Recently I accidentally knocked one of the connections lose, and thought I'd broken the speaker system. I plunged into researching speaker systems, and after reading a number of reviews I settled upon the Z640. When I got the speakers, I excitedly connected everything together and started perusing my playlist. Much to my dismay, none of the music seemed as clear or powerful as with my old system. I tried fiddling with my equalizer settings or using different Winamp plugins or using the Matrix mode for the speakers, but nothing made them sound better. I may not be a hardcore audiophile, but I can differentiate between broad levels of audio fidelity. These speakers simply aren't up to par. Thankfully, my FPS2000 system was still working, but I regret buying this set of speakers.

There is a lot of emphasis on converting carburated engines to fuel injection, but only specific examples are given when it comes right down to it, leaving many people and possibilities out in the cold.For those wishing to derive their own fuel-injection systems, this may be a good starter book, but leaves the reader with more questions than answers.

Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate dramatic series with heavy moments emphasized by crying characters. But, even this was a bit much. Then the icing on the cake, the fittingly climactic moment followed by one of those ridiculous, many years later sub titles, where all we see is only two characters from a larger cast sharing a completely useless moment.

Lumley incorprates what we know about vampires and adds on and changes that image completely.The characters arenot so easy to relate with, that is what makes a novel or movie scary (In my own opinion.) But this novel seemed more like it was intended to be a mix between science-fiction and horror. Since I am entertained be both I enjoyed this work.One thing that is important to remeber is that you must keep an open mind while reading it. This is not supposed to be thought provoking.

They are truly original and the cornerstone of an epic is set. The characters in the book have much depth and writing quality is high. The plot is also quite interesting. My two complaints: 1. Because it is meant to be the first book in a series, most of it has to do with how the Necroscope became what he is (including his elementary school years). It's more realistic this way, but I could do without. 2. Not all the books in the series are this good (see my other reviews)PS. Most of the secondary characters have been covered in depth in one or another of the books. Except for the Necroscope's uncle and aunt. They do not appear in any of the books and he never visits them. There isn't even a reference to how he feels about them. Curious, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series, but by no means origional","review":"In the last few years, I have read more or less the entire Necrosope series and I have found the books to be an excellent read. The depictions of the vampires and their characterization definately made the books stand out. If I have a complaint, it is that these books are very similar to his much earlier written Titus Crow series (A total of six novels) which deal with Lovecraftian monsters as opposed to vampires. In fact, I have noticed similarities between both series of books in regards to the main charachters, the organizations they belong too, and the people who belong to those organizations. Beyond those observations, I find the series to be quite good and if one is interested in Lovecraftian horror, his Titus Crow series may worth investing in."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must read this series!!","review":"Having picked up this book three years ago I steadily read the entire Necroscope series.

Elaborate descriptions all add up to a mess of dead fake scenery and non-sensical garbage.It really doesn't help that I'm a Russian. If the author needed to rape a roster of dead people, why take the one with so many recognizable ones and stick them to supporting characters that die 5 minutes into the story? Why try to stick 'tz' endings to different words, _especially_ to an anti-Semite character's last name?

I grew to like Brian Lumley from his short stories I found in anthologies. They usually focus on small, crawling horrors. Therefore, I decided to give his popular Necroscope series a go.From the creepy cover-art (a decayed but still-living vampire skull), I thought this would be a book about vampires. And it is...and psychics, and espionage, and science fiction, and warfare, and mathematics. Lumley throws everything but the kitchen sink in here. It is held together because Lumley is really good at his craft - he knows how to create characters and scenes and he has one of the best prose styles in horror literature. My main criticism is that he jumps a little too far off the diving board, but that is a matter of taste.

In fact, I bought a Canon replacement and will install it when the ink cartridges on the Lexmark go empty. Why? The printer does occasionally jam (paper feeding is sloppy, jerky), the driver/software does crash once in awhile and does not gracefully exit Windows XP when I shut down my computer, the ink cartridges are extraordinarily expensive, and the print quality is--at best--mediocre.I didn't pay much for this thing, so I'm willing to eat my losses instead of buying more cartridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"driver software doesn't work well, support is pathetic","review":"I have used this product for a week or two now. Once a day or so, the driver software crashes, turning the Lexmark \\"red diamond\\" into a \\"red X\\" and the only solution at this point is to reboot - the device no longer will print jobs from the printer at this point. I reported the problem to support and they claim it is not a \\"known issue\\" - even though I find web pages on the internet which mentions other people having the same problem. \\"Hide your head in the sand\\" support policy, I guess. I will be returning this item, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Printer soaked up ink like a sponge!! Ink cartridge became blocked even when stored with the original tape over the printhead. Lexmark technical support suggested using a damp lint free cloth to clear the printhead. This did not work most of the time. I was not too happy having to sponge bath the ink cartridge everytime I needed to print. After much complaining Lexmark sent out a replacement cartridge which eventually clogged after printing about 20 sheets of paper. Recommend buying some other brand of printer. Lexmark ink cartridges are expensive. The cost of these and the frequent problems makes this printer not worth buying. I went back to using HP printers. I have an 8 year old HP Laserjet 4ML that works like brand new after print over 4000 pages. I have an HP Photosmart 7550 for photo and color printing.

Joan Jett is missing from the interviews and, if I recall correctly, no explanation of her absence is provided. The documentary is missing Runaway songs (this could be due to copyright laws?)! The documentary also has trite, cheap video effects that became grating after a few minutes of their use (if the storytelling is good all they need to do is point the camera at the interviewee).

All the Runaways participate and Fowley even rears his arrogance for all to see but Jett is nowhere to be found outside of the historical footage.

It could have been spiced up with more Runaways material from the era; the footage of the Velvet's \\"Rock and Roll\\" live is a highlight. I grew right along with them and though I was a male in the audience, felt their ups and downs. I also took offense at Mr. Fowleys assessment of The Runaways' male audience at the time... he missed me by a mile.

Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Idea","review":"I can't believe that anyone would actually buy this. The average price for these DVD's is still around $12.00 each. It's not a deal at all. If they bring it down to $5.00 each ($150.00 total) maybe I'd consider buying it. Even if I wanted to buy it and the price was right, I already have some of these.

Thats a great deal!\\"I might would consider buying this set if the price was say around $70.00 just so I would break the set up to resell.$600.00 HA!...if anybody has bought this set then they have way too much money and not enough common sense.The words rip off, waste of money, and only the dumb should be in the tags"},{"rating":"1","title":"why are the people reviewing this sayin its a wu cd?","review":"theres 2 wu tang related songs on this cd.i dont like most of the songs on it anyway.1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This is the third book on biological warfare I have read and by far the weakest.

There are so many rules, and then there are so many exceptions to those rules.Jane Straus' \\"Blue Book Of Grammar And Punctuation\\" is the best book I have ever found.Ms. Straus presents concepts in simple language and follows them up with excellent examples. She gets right to the point.I would highly recommend \\"The Blue Book Of Grammar and Punctuation\\" to anyone who teaches English, grammar, and writing.I would also recommend this treasure for anyone who wants to polish their writing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I have struggled my whole life with grammar and punctuation UNTIL I read Jane's easy-to-understand, incredibly helpful book. I would recommend this book to anyone, even people who think they already understand the rules. I have given copies to my friends and co-workers. They are now telling everyone they know to buy the book. The examples are clear, the exercises helpful, and the layout perfect for those of us who were not English majors. This book has also helped my children to understand the rules painlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to dissent...","review":"Most of the reviewers seemed to like this book a lot and recommended it highly. With their recommendations in mind, I went ahead to purchase the book (2 copies) to use for tutoring a high school student. Unfortunately, I was disappointed at the quality of the text (paper, font, number of pages) and the content. There's several pages on the use of commas, which is wonderful, but that's several pages out of not so many. So what's the substance of the rest of the book? Not a whole lot. I immediately returned this item back to Amazon. I suggest, if you need a good reference, to find a good grammar textbook (used in primary and secondary schools) or perhaps even the MLA Handbook - depending on what your needs are. This book, Grammar Blue Book, is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had listened to \\"Bare bones -- waste of money.\\"","review":"The content is decent and concise, but the production quality of this book simply can't be forgiven. Ms. Straus likely had these printed up at Kinko's -- this \\"book\\" is really more a pamphlet with a card-stock cover over 68 pages of plain paper. This could be something to buy and hand out at a seminar, with the expectation that it would be worked through and then discarded, but I doubt very much that it will last long in even moderate use.This should be selling for $3, not $13. I wish I had listened to the earlier \\"bare bones\\" review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise Review of Grammar","review":"The Blue Book of Grammar is an excellent resource for students and professionals alike.

Coherent stories, decent prose, actual plot and character development, but all in support of repressed bestiality.

He is a high school dropout. He preaches murder without remorse. Much of this work came from other authors and is not his.

When I first gave it to him, he read the first 3 chapters straight, only stopping to run in to tell me excerpts and exclaim: \\"This is exactly the same things I'm worried about. It's like they're writing about me!\\" Then he'd excitedly run off to read more. That alone made it worth it: so he knows that he's not alone and someone somewhere understands and that I am making an effort to help him. Also, I am a single parent, and he is an only child, whose father shows no interest. It breaks your heart to see your child full of anxiety -this is a worthwhile investment, as is anything that helps navigate rough waters. My gratitutde to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"good overall...","review":"I am a bit hesitant to give this book 5 stars because I feel like some of the detail in the book can be overwhelming for the younger ages...especially 9 and 10 year olds. I bought the book b/c it was recommended and I have a son that has experienced anxiety issues. I'm also a licensed mental health professional. This book would be an excellent guide for parents.. but I would carefully review before you allow a younger child to read. The author has presented some excellent coping techniques for anxious kids. Overall, I do recommend this book.. but I would sit with the child and read through it.

With other hits like \\"In this Diary,\\" \\"My Reply,\\" \\"The Saddest Song,\\" and \\"The Boys of Summer,\\" this CD is bound to be a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ataris are still amazing","review":"This album shows great technique! However I was suprised when I first listened. This cd has a different sound then the Atari's previous work. The songwriting continues to be the best I've ever heard, however they sound more produced. Some excellent tracts are #4 and #2! I give them a enthusiastic thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have the cash spend it","review":"If you have the cash to buy this cd spend it.The cd has there hit IN THIS DIARY and a redo of I WONT SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT ALONE.All the other songs are good too but theres one song thats really good called THE SADDEST SONG and thers a original one an a acustic one.To sum it up this is a awesome cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emo music that can make hardcore kids cry...","review":"Well goodness why are you reading this? Well, because you are not sure whether you should buy this CD or not right? Well let me tell you The Ataris just keep getting better with their \\"heart on my sleeve\\" lyrics and emotional-rollercoaster memories. This is one of their best albums yet. No one should think twice about buying \\"So long Astoria\\" it is anything but a gamble. This album expands the world of emo/heart-wrenching music. It lets you know you aren't alone in such a chaotic world. It would definitely be a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"Ive loved the ataris for about 2 years. This cd shows their many talents. Kris's voice is so good and the lyrics are briliant. Looking back on today is such a good song. I've heard it before (the acoustic Version) but the version on the cd is better.THis cd is worth the money. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Progression at its finest","review":"This Cd is the result of a punk child all grown up. The Ataris finally have moved passed complaining about the girls who they love and have loved and into musical maturity. Subject are much more real and beneficial to the listener while still using themes from previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't feel it.","review":"Man, did I have high hopes for this album. I had even pre-purchased it on Amazon.com. But when it came to my house, 2 days after it was released on shelves (grr), I popped it in the cd tray and almost cried. Sure, the songs \\"So Long, Astoria,\\" and \\"In This Diary\\" were great because it had that \\"Blue Skies...\\" feel to it, but they just tore the rest up. The music was bad because they made it way too melodic, and it was just another pop-punk disaster. He even tried to sing like a back street boy in some of the songs, leaving out his classic grungy, almost screaming, vocals. And all you Ataris fans out there; I know you wanted to cry when you heard the remix of \\"I Won't Spend Another Night Alone.\\" It was god-awful. This album [is bad except] two songs I mentioned where good and throw the rest away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, haven't we heard this before?","review":"Well, it's not BAD...but it's essentially the same album as End is Forever, which was essentially the same album as Blue Skies, which makes me wonder why some people are so ready to praise the same songs with the words switched around. Seriously, was there ANY chance we were going to get through So Long... without hearing a song about Kris's daughter? Don't lie, you saw it from a mile away. Song about the deception of love? Check. Song about childhood memories? Check (half the album in fact). When you consider the Ataris were never musical pioneers to begin with, there is really no need to hear this album. Come on Kris, let's hear something new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Ataris that I grew to love","review":"Seeing all these flawless reviews sparked my need to write a review. While the Ataris are a band that I respect a lot, this cd is what I hoped it wouldn't be. Now in my opinion, they didn't \\"sell out\\" when they went to the major label. They have been slowly going to a slower more emo-ish sound, and that's fine. But for any die-hard fans of \\"Blue Skies\\" this is nothing like that cd. This is by far their slowest album and the tunes aren't as catchy as in past efforts. The Ataris have stayed true and haven't tried to appeal to the MTV audience even though they do have a video, but why not if you have the means to do so? Focusing strictly on the music, this is not my favorite kind of music, but it is decent. I wished they went back to their old style of punk though. This is one band that I wish hadn't grown up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"You call dis punk? THey sing like whiny little babies! God they suck! This some of the most horrible music I've ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely my fave album","review":"Where to start...well first off this album isn't one that will knock your socks off right away, but give it a bit of time and it will. Every song is good except Summer '79. I think of that one as filler, but some people seem to like it. So buy it, give it some time, and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Punk At Its Finest.","review":"Only being an Ataris fan for only a short time my opinion is that So Long Astoria as compared to the Ataris' previous albums falls short of my expectations. Long gone are the blistering riffs such as the Last Song I Will Ever Write About a Girl. No more is the angst which lured me to this once brilliant band. They traded in their indie-esque roots for corporate glory. And they succeed. Highlight (the only one) track a cover of Don Henley's \\"Boys of Summer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Music","review":"This album deserves five stars for about five seconds of one song alone. On the speeded up and very cool sounding cover of \\"The boys of summer,\\" Ataris changes the line \\"out on the road today I saw a dead head sticker on a Caddilac\\" to \\"Jack Black sticker.\\" This is a text book example of updating an old song to make it more relevant to new audiences, and a nice twist for those that remember the original. I liked the Don Henley original, and am so familiar with it that the first time I heard this version it seemed to be much faster than it actually is, because I had the original running with it in my mind. I liked the way it is paced and how it takes the familiar musical elements and incorporates them in this context. I love to hear reinterpretations of songs, and this one is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"generic pop punk","review":"Working at a record store has many advantages and disadvantages.I get to hear alot of cool music first, but I also have to listen to all the [stuff]we have to try to sell.This is where the Ataris come in.After seeing them live many times (they always seem to play with bands I like), and being annoyed, I thought I'd seen/heard the last of them.Then comes a So Long Astoria promo, and we're playing it constantly at work.This album is just very boring and unoriginal.The lyrics are trite, and this has ALL been done before.Of course all the twelve year old \\"skater punks\\" are eating it up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sellout Album","review":"Its so sad to see the greatness that is the Ataris put out such a dissapointing pop-punk album. The previous reviewer mentioned that this album was the 'real deal' unlike all the other pop-punk songs on the radio. She's right about the radio but unfortunately this Ataris is not the real deal at all, I mean come on, they re-made a Don Henely song. Poorly for that matter. Buy Blue Skys Broken Hearts or any of their other earlier work and forget that they ever put this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk rock? Dont think so!","review":"This is pure pop. Simple plan, Blink-182 and Good Charolotte need to realize that Punk Rock actually died out about 16 years ago. First off, being punk is not about dressing at hot topic. It's a culture. It's a lifestyle. It's about being against the establishment, anti-government and anti-capitalism (for some people). It's about making a statement and being a sub-culture against the norm. Real punks dont prance around and perform on TRL. Trust me, I've known some before. I could sometimes call myself a \\"punk\\" even though i dont dress the stereotype. Trust me, Ataris is not punk. They are just pop-rock. Im sure they have a lot of talent but to come off as punk when they're not is just plain wrong. The only thing CLOSEST to past punk recently is Green Day, but they still did more pop. Buy something from Green Day instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty [Bad]...","review":"Okay I've heard these guys were good before this cd, but I don't think I'll ever appreciate them after hearing this album. First the music really [stinks] and the lyrics go against all punk music is about. EX: \\"Here in this diary I right you visions of my summer. It was the BEST I ever had!\\" I mean what ... is that all about? Just the way he sings it is obnoxious, especially when he says best. Well I can say about this is this another band that's sold out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much different at all. Just as good as I expected.","review":"I'm a pretty big Ataris fan and have been since their release of Looking Forward to Failure, and I have to say that \\"So Long Astoria\\" is not much different than their previous stuff. They succeeded, just like Saves the Day, in releasing a record that does not stray too far from their roots, that will get them the exposure that they deserve. This album is chock full of catchy, loud, and emotional tunes. Just like their previous CDs. If you are an Ataris fan there is truly nothing you can complain about here. Keep supporting this band and go buy this well put together album. Could end up being the best Punk-Pop-Emo CD of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"13 songs, 2 hidden tracks... what more could I ask for?","review":"So long astoria is a long awaited full album in nearly two years, every avid ataris fan has been looking forward to buying it and listening to it over and over.Yes, it does have a slightly different sound from their other albums but its still a fantastic sound. Awaited by so many people all over the world, its no disappointment. I've loved the ataris for so long now and so long astoria has made me love them more (if it is possible), kris pouring his heart out once again, what more could any ataris fan ask for from such a fantastic band?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Ataris CD","review":"And it only gets one star.

If you have one, you have them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely their best one","review":"I have this and 2 other Ataris CDs (Blue Skies, and End is Forever). I have to say this is undoubtedly their best one. In the other 2 CDs I have the lyrics are relatable to but pathetic. This CD has great lines such as \\"Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up\\" (In this Diary) basically saying enjoy your teenage years while you can, and \\"I wish their was something I could say to erase each and every page you've been through\\"(My Reply). The lyrics in this CD are much more mature and compassionate. Whenever I think of the lyrics for my reply I get chills. Get this CD as soon as possible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I gave it 4 stars because there's 2 songs I dont really like but other than that the CD rocks!! My favorite song is \\"In This Diary\\", im listening to the CD right now!=)"},{"rating":"2","title":"one word, amazing","review":"All of you should own this cd! I have been a fan of the ataris for a while, and never imagined that they could get any better. But this cd has such a mature sound, and it shows a new side of the ataris. There are some redone songs, and old or new, they are all great. They've come along way, and are only destined for more fame. They're change in record labels doesn't show up at all in their music, they still have the same punk-rock feel to them, for all of those sceptics out there, they are not selling out. I didn't think that the lyrics could get any better, but these lyrics seem to really reach out, they go past what the ataris have done in the past. All I have to say, is that this cd is the best thing I have heard, and all of you should buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Long, Astoria","review":"This CD is very good. I was very impressed. I have heard older Ataris music, and it didnt appeal to me as much. After hearing \\"In This Diary\\", I knew their stronger sound will make them that much better. I bought the CD and I am NOT disapointed! Every track has the same feel to it. So if you like one song you've heard, theres a good chance you will like all of them. If you are a older teenager going off to college soon, this CD will remind you of good memories. You'll love if you like the Drive-Thru records bands (New Found Glory, Something Corporate, Mistown, etc...). Buy it, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stepping stone to greatness","review":"I got this album at 12:05 AM March 4th. And it is the only cd in my cd player. On first listen, this cd doesnt give you much feeling, but after listening to it a few times you warm up to it and begin to have a love and understanding for the lyrics. Its so good and it truly gives you an insite into the life of Kris Roe and the things he feels. This cd is about Kris and his experiences in the band and out. Its personal and wonderful.This cd marks a new day for the ataris, becasue the cd is on columbia, and with their new catchy single \\"in this diary\\", they should be heating up TRL, and all of the charts. Although End is Forver and Blue skies.....remain my favs, i dont think the ataris could priduce a cd i didnt love. Buy it. You will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an icepick to the ear!!!!","review":"Folks this really is bad. I don't understand any of the fasination with this band. The singer is such a tool. Really, the music is so typical, and uncreative. These guys are definetly on my top ten bands not to buy list. I highly recommend people not to buy this sad, sad, sad album. They cover an Eagles song for Petes sake! The Ataris are not good. Why would anyone name their band after the worst video game system in history? Also why would a band choose such an annoying singer?This album lacks.....1. Originallity2. Any form of interesting structure3. Good song writing4. A good singer5. EverythingIf you want to buy this album go ahead, but its a big waste. I recommend Neil Diamond before this......stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Long Ataris","review":"I was honestly excited when my girlfriend got me this CD for my birthday. Their record before this was good, but some of the songs had mediocre lyrics. All in all, it's still a good listen. But this CD.......First of all, most of the songs sound like they were trying to write a different version of the song that came before it. Very uncreative. Lyrics? Same thing over and over again. I thought one album about how you wanna go back to high school was enough. Did we really need another? So in conclusion, the Ataris seem to be retrogressing musically - stick with one of their earlier CDs if your gonna get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?","review":"The Ataris used to kick ass before this album. I loved all their previous albums. In this album, they weren't as emo (and they are definitely not indie anymore). I don't really love emo that much, but the ataris made it great. This album has some decent tracks. Seriously, I hate 'The Boys of Summer'. It used to be so over-played. If you like that song, LISTEN TO THE ORIGINAL (by The Eagles), it is so much better. Sorry, but this was really not their best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"I really want to like these guys...honestly. I own their first two cds and neither of them was \\"bad\\" but neither one of them stood out either. Each one contained about a 4-5 song ep worth of decent material and a bunch of throwaways. Their cover of Jawbreaker's \\"Boxcar\\" was simply disgraceful. I could never really figure out why a major label would sign them when there are so many better bands within this pop-punk genre that are far more deserving. Well I figured that maybe the jump to the major label would make them better (ala Blink 182), so I bought the CD. All I have to say is that this is about as mediocre as it gets. It is not terrible, but it is not good either. It is a ho-hum album from a ho-hum band. I guess polished production and big studio budgets are no substitute for talent.If you like music in the pop punk genre use your money and get something better like \\"Avoid One Thing\\" or even \\"The All American Rejects\\" they are way better than these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album lacks any purpose","review":"I heard from a friend that this was a pretty cool band, so without listenng to their music I just went out and grabbed this CD. This is one of the weakest offerings I have ever heard. There is one good song on here, and it is a cover of THE BOYS OF SUMMER. Aside from that it is just a really bland album. The lyrics are just the same old nostalgic ..., and the instrumentals are totally uninspiring.The mark of any good album, is that it has something that stays with you after you turn off the stereo, but unfortuntely, this album is entirely forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Downfall of the Old Ataris....","review":"Another band that used to be punk that turns to pop and sold out. I can't believe after listening to this cd that they are even the same band. This cd made me lose alot of respect for them. Much slower music than the old cd's, and definately not punk. If you like songs on the radio, this song is for you. If you like punk music, keep looking...."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"I loved old ataris albums, but this isn't even punk, its almost unlistenable. there raw garage band sound is gone and they have just been turned into major label BS pop.The other ataris albums are awesome. go buy one of those. this cd has its moments, but overall is a monotone waste of time.so... buy the old ataris albums and GO TO A SHOW. they are excellent live, and definately buy and old album. unless you like polished, major label, pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin","review":"I really like Ataris.

So Long Astoria is full of really heartfelt lyrics and has an awesome sound. I've checked out one of their past albums (Blue Skies...), and although So Long Astoria isn't as fast, it's just as good. If you are skeptical of the Ataris, I suggest downloading a few of their songs to be sure buying their album isn't a waste of your money. But if you like them, by all means buy it! They have to make a living too."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, but it could be better","review":"this is the ataris' third cd, or at least as far as I know. It's very good, although the songs start to sound the same after a little while if you aren't paying attention. Radio-friendly rock, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money...","review":"Do not waste your money on this cd like i have done. There a few things wrong with this cd and i think they should be emphasized. First of all, this band sounds alot like Jimmy Eat World, especially the song \\"in this diary,\\" just listen to the beginning it sounds just like the beginning of \\"in the middle,\\" by Jimmy Eat World and im sad to say that \\"in this diary,\\" is the only song somewhat worth listening to on the album. The other problem is that these guys have some of the worst lyrics, they are soo cheesy and trite. It sounds like these guys are trying too hard to fit into mainstream but they still cannot pull it off. Get Jimmy Eat World or All American Reject's cds instead, much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than their old stuff!","review":"Ok, I have to admit that I like a few songs by The Ataris. \\"San Dimas Highschool Football Rules\\" is a cool song and \\"Song For a Mixtape\\" steals my heart. However, they have some of the most pointless, most abnoxious songs I have ever heard in my life (\\"Teenage Riot\\"). This new album by The Ataris not only shows the absolute worst of The Ataris, but also shows what they will do for a dollar..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not good at all!","review":"This reminds me of how bad music is today. What ever happened to the good old days of Maiden and Zeppelin? Anyway, this is bad and the guitars in the terrible remake song \\"Boys of Summer\\" sounds like a part of \\"Flash of the Blade\\" by Iron Maiden. So if anybody trys to tell you that this stuff is good just tell them it is more Poison to your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"ungh...","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst poppy emo bands I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. I'm quite thankful for every second I DONT own this cd. I have listened to it and it is awful. Unoriginal musicianship, extremely immature lyrics (\\"Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up\\") cmon give me a break. I do like their cover of \\"Boys of Summer\\", but it's the only good song on this cd. THIS IS NOT PUNK! I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT PUNK! STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ataris - Worst CD","review":"The Ataris are a great band and they were great live, but their new cd \\"So Long, Astoria\\" is their worst CD i have ever heard from them.

Ha ! Laughing so hard that the cd is out of print.Those guys should just do eagles covers and just call it a day.The Ataris will not be missed. Pipebomb !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable rock","review":"I have mainstream rock taste, and I understand why I'd never heard of this band. They have a decent 'sound', but they lack melody - or something. Maybe they just need another band member to be the 'glue' or to fill what's missing from their songs. They remind of a harder rock version of \\"Dashboard Confessionals\\" - and, like D.C., they think their words are so great that they don't feel the need to put forth the effort to make the words rhyme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major label does not mean sell-out","review":"I know some will not agree with me, but I think this CD is soooo much better than Blue Skies, Broken Hearts, Next 12 Exits. Yes, it's more emo than their earlier work, but in 2003, emo was the current thing.I'm sure Kris and company realized that they could not continue making pop-punk music if they wanted to make any real money. Astoria got them noticed (and a spot on the WB's Pepsi Smash)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"If you are (like me) frustrated with all the 'so called punk bands' they play on the radio all day long, then you will really enjoy the new Ataris album. This is the real deal ! And even their new album is more rock than punk, it is probably their best release so far. These songs are full of emotions and the craftsmanship of the songs and the production is outstanding. The cover version of 'Boys of Summer' became instantly one of my all time favorites - but all their original material is fantastic, too. The sound of this CD is somewhere between the 'Goo Goo Dolls' (producer Lou Giordano used to work with them) and the excellent first 'Third Eye Blind' album. It's a straight forward rock album with strong punk influences. As long as there are bands like 'The Ataris' and CDs like 'So Long, Astoria' there is hope for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good CD","review":"I like \\"So Long Astoria,\\" it's a good CD. However, one thing i noticed is that a lot of people say it's a \\"new sound\\" or something for the Ataris, but honestly, I don't see much of a difference from their old stuff. It sounds a lot like \\"End is Forever,\\" not and not quite as much as \\"Blue Skies...\\" but it's still good. The cover of Don Henley's \\"The Boys of Summer\\" is, dare I say, better than the original version, and \\"Summer '79\\" is a good track as well. Overall, it's not too terribly different from their older stuff, but it's still a pretty good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago music fan","review":"The Ataris So Long Astoria cd is one of the best I have ever herd. I think everyone can relate to some of the songs they are singing about. It has some great guitar riffs and drum beats. This was the first Ataris cd I ever bought, and it had conviced me to buy more of there work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"A little while ago my friend was telling me about this band he liked called the ataris. I thought how good can a band be that is named after a video game system from the eighties. I got their new cd the first week it came out to give them a try. I have to say i was more than pleasantly suprised. This cd rocks. There isn't one song on here which i don't like. It is hard to pick my favorites but if i had to they would be summer '79, boys of summer, and the hero dies in this one. I can highly recommend this band to anyone who is a fan of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"there's not one song on this album i would skip. There are really no \\"fill ins\\" like those other albums. but is it just me or so some things get a little repeatitive.

So Long Astoria is one of those albums you can just put in and listen to over and over without skipping any tracks.

But if you want to buy this one... you should buy their other albums too, because they are awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst CD EVER","review":"I cant stand this cd.

I have nothing against what a lot of people would call \\"sell out\\", but \\"So Long Astoria\\" has taken \\"sell out\\" to a whole new level.I have a feeling some A&R; guy got involved in making of this album, and wanted to nail the Radio Disney market. Well, he got it, but what he's left the world with a boring peace of music, with every song sounding painfully the same. Each song on their own is just sort of forgettable, but put together in a whole album, this project really starts to [stink]. It hurts it's so bad.Next time guys just do what you do well. We love you when you do. So skip this album, or buy their other ones, but don't waste your money here. \\"So Long Astoria\\" is really, really, painfully, bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"found myself saying \\"i've heard this before\\"","review":"i bought this album because \\"boys of summer\\" got stuck in my head. i thought itd be something new and fresh. i struck out there. after the first song everything sounds repetitive. i got bored by song 4, since i somewhat enjoyed \\"in this diary\\". i wanted to enjoy it, i really did, but it just seemed so recycled. every song seemed to try and make teenage girls cry. im not a girl but the only time i contemplated crying was when i realized i couldnt get my 15$ back. sure it sounds a bit different from the run-of-the-mill stuff we're getting today, but not by enough. every verse and chorus could be played over one riff, its that identical. im all for a band keeping with its style, but that doesnt mean the style has to be narrowed down and boring. i wouldn't recommend this to many people. sorry, its just weak"},{"rating":"1","title":"so long to the ataris i used to know and love","review":"This CD is definitely by far the worst of all the Ataris'. On the day it was released I went down to the record shop, excited to buy it after seeing them live a month before they were awesome and I couldn't wait to listen to So Long Astoria. It is different from their old stuff...way too whiney and boring. I listened to it once and have not touched it once. It definitely is one of the worst CD's in my collection and since this release I haven't been bothered to see them live again- not if I have to hear them play songs from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they'd play this on the radio!!!","review":"This kick ass CD is worth a double album, just for the first three songs!!! My new favorite band, and I'm 47!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too emo","review":"I hadn't realized the ataris moved to Columbia from kung fu, but they did, and the result is slower songs, and a stupid video on MTV. All of the songs sound more polished, and Kris Roe's voice sounds very produced. Some of the songs are kind of sad in a good way like My Reply and the title track, so long, astoria, but most of the album sounds a little too much like New Found Glory. I don't know if it was the ataris' choice to make this kind of album or a major label trying to come up with another emo rock band. All in all, So Long, Astoria will probably bring more people to the ataris with its slowish emo songs, but I hope the band goes back to their older sound soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"well what can i say, the ataris ... amazing...! its about time they hit it big on a good label! these guys rock and im really happy for the them! each of their cds has its own sound(all that are great); their other cds like \\"end is forever\\", \\"blue skies\\" and \\"anywhere but here\\" i think have all lead up to this great cd. basically all i have to say is you must buy this cd and all their others. and the re-release of anywhere but here(its soo much better)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Error","review":"The game installs, but will not run.

However, if the Pirates of the Carribean is as big in your house as in mine - you might want to get a couple of sets.The rings are all HUGE so be prepared to put duct tape inside of them to make them fit. They don't give you anything to put the dagger in, so your child will be sticking it down his pants (not a good habit to get into in my opinion)These were marked down to less than $[...] at Xmas time, so we bought a couple more and donated to the Starlight foundation - thinking they'd be good fun for kids in hospital.

I purchased it to store loose tobacco in. However, it is almost useless as the rubber gasket came off within 24 hours and no matter how I put it back on, it pops right back off within a short period of time, usually the next time I open the canister, which is every day. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars as it is indeed very attractive and sturdy, but does not keep tobacco or anything else fresh as far as sealing out air if the gasket won't stay on tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tenure Turns Tragic\\"","review":"The imagery of focused academia and the discontinuity of John and Carol's conversation can be defined as a constant stop n' go. You find yourself wondering if the structure of \\"Oleanna\\" will transform a change of pattern from interupted dialog to a free flowing comprehensible conversation. You want to talk irritating-its all here. John the ostentatious Professor is developed into this pompous character and Mamet creates a twisted tone of pathetic sympathy hitched with misappropriated authority. Will John's foolish indoctrination jeopardize his tenure? If you can get through the continuation of interrupted dialog - lots of credit to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never a complete sentence!","review":"I disliked this play very much. It is little more than a vehicle for William H. Macy (a fine actor, who is typecast) to stutter and seem confused for 90 minutes. Imagine watching the Macy character in Fargo for 90 minutes! I was expecting tremendous dialog as in Glengary Glen Ross-- I was very disappointed. The dialog in Oleanna was obtuse and difficult. The theme of politically-correctness became tiresome very quickly. This play has very narrow appeal and was obviously a pet project by a fading playwright. Bottom-line: it gave me a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oleana: The Loss of cordiality","review":"I am not sure if David Mamet wrote \\"Oleana\\" in response to Anita Hill's accusations against Clarence Thomas, but, his insightful portrayal of how some feminist activists sometimes misuses men as a means to accomplish their agenda would be humorous were it not truly sad. Mamet critiques several relationships in this play including that of humans to humans. In the final analysis of the sexual harassment situation demonstrated in the play, Mamet illustrates how cruel humans can be to one another. Can there really be interest in and cordiality between men and women, student and professor? Does there alwyas have to be or assumed to be some sexual tension or inuendo going on? Or has the declining morals in society dictated that in age of uncertainity and suspicion, people must distance themselves from one another for fear that words, gestures, and intensions can be totally miscontrued and taken out context?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Mamet!","review":"Mamet is by far one of the best play wrights of our time. His powerful use of language and his ability to twist a knife in the hearts of those who watch and read his plays is truly powerful.In this particular play, Mamet takes a look at sexual harassment in the work place in a very different way. In Oleanna, there are two charaters. There is John, the bumbling professor who's extensive vocabulary and good intentions bring him to an inevetable demise.Then there is Carol, a twenty year old student who is struggling in John's class. At first we see Carol as an innocent student, who is trying to understand why she is failing the class. After the two's first meeting, things become horribly wrong. A deeply disturbing play; Mamet's ability to twist the meaning of words is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mamet's done much better work","review":"I love Mamet -- usually. His plays leave me wanting to speak in well-constructed sentences. This one was annoying from start to finish, with stereotyped stick-figure characters, none of whom were sympathetic or made a valid point. So stick with House of Games, Glengarry Glen Ross -- even Speed the Plow (Madonna was unexpectedly good all those years ago) if you're in a Mamet mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"I stumbled across this book in the library and couldn't put it down.

So consequently the outside film shots were somewhat interesting, but the tedious boredom of \\"Holzman's\\" life (doesn't matter it is faux) is draining as a viewer. I enjoy documentaries (faux or not) and this is very shabby compared to so many other films. I could not endure it to view it more than once and the 74 original minutes was about my limit.

Indiana distorts everything so he can cackle at it--including readily identifiable people, and the city of Los Angeles. His characters are objects for his weird scorn of everything--the brothers, the mother, the reporters. Satire is one thing, but malice for the sake of malice is another, and this is a very weird piece of malice."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross and disgusting","review":"Still haunted by scenes I wish I'd never encountered. A comedy? Not even an amusing satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad excuse for a novel","review":"Has this guy Indiana ever even been to Los Angeles? Did he even read any of the many accounts of the Menendez brothers? I agree with the guy who said this is a cruel book. Indiana feels he can laugh at everyone, the killers, the victims--and the columnist he lays into like he's got something really personal (envy) going. What's with this guy, and who is he to pretend to know so much? Real serious stuff was involved in this tragedy, nothing to trivialize and make silly like Indian does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resentment? More like revulsion","review":"The title may see it all--Gary Indiana seems to resent everyone, especially if they're attractive or intelligent (like Dominick Dunne). He has no insight into the people he so recklessly attempts to portray (even minor characters that are easily identifiable), and he seems to think that he can aim poison at them without regard. The whole thing backfires--including his weird views about Southern California--and the reader ends up laughing at this silly concoction, not at the characters involved in a real tragic event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel and outrageous novel","review":"The characters in this book are all easily identifiable, centering on the participants in the famous Menendez Brothers trial. Not one of the participants escapes Indiana's venomous attitude and ridicule. Even the minor characters involved in the fringes of the trial are objects of contempt. This trial involved real and serious issues, and Indiana has reduced them all to props to be aimed at, by him. Perhaps someone will write a novel with him as a character; there would be a lot to satirize. On top of it all, the book is sloppily written, as if he could hardly wait to set down his attack on living people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly attempt at satire","review":"Gary Indiana continues to write about subjects he clearly doesn't know anything about but would like to--like hustling, like leading an exciting life, like being really famous. All right if he would write from the point of someone looking in, trying to look in, but he doesn't; he pretends he is iside it all, and the result is ludicrous at its best. If you want to know what really went on during the Menendez trial that Indiana so pompoulsy claims to illuminate, read Dominick Dunne's excellent account--and skip this very silly and pretentious endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"Best product we have found for cleaning our granite countertops.

These remain valid today: although the programs are stronger now, the advances have nearly all been in increasing search depth, not in making the programs better at evaluating poaitions.There is also considerable historical and technical information about computer chess programs up to 1983, which today would primarily be of interest to the chess programming specialist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all","review":"Bought these pair of glasses with the hope of finding my lost ball in shorter time, but I was very disappo��nted, because they didn't serve the purpose.

Because there are only one or two facts on each page, there's not really a lot of content, so they should have had the time to check all their information. For example, they say that only Texas is allowed to fly its state flag at the same height as the U.S. flag. This is a Texas tall tale, as discussed at www.snopes.com. They also say that only Costa Rica is forbidden by their constitution to have an army.

The smooth electronic sounds can transport you through space. Each song is a new journey. I've updated to a digital version now, but this is one of the few cassettes I've kept throughout the years. Fourth Universe will remain a favorite of mine for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional & Floating space music...","review":"Ranging from dynamic, rhythmic pieces to ethereal, beautifully floating music, Fourth Universe portrays magnificent visions of the universe.The song titles are often clues to the tempo. The opener, \\"Sailing To Neptune\\" is a cruiser which rides the waves of the galaxies, while \\"Deep Blue\\" floats slowly as it spirals deeper, and \\"Rhapsody on a Red Planet\\" uses classical motifs to envision the desolate planet-scapes of Mars. Flights of fantasy move through deep space, romantic and ethereal at times, upbeat and rhythmic at others. The Geodesium sound is full of clarity, expressing its own view of space and all the sounds generated from these deep expanses. Eighteen tracks altogether make up this nearly hour-long release, marked by an ability to portray magnificent, memorable visions of the universe through its varied approaches to the space music genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound!

This movie inspired me to re-read the original. Beautiful filming and entertaining. The only part that threw me was the teenage actress in place of the 7 1/2 yr-old character, though the actress does a very good job. My 7 1/2 yr-old son also enjoyed the film; he was glued to the set for the entire 86 minutes (perhaps because we read Through the Looking-Glass to him last year). However, my 4 yr-old daughter was not interested in the least.

Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so. She just didn't look well in this movie, and everything looked so cheap and fake. The story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out. I would not recommend this.

If the plug was just a little longer--say, the same size as on the extension cord--it would fit.2. The extension cord is way, way too long and bulky. The drive itself is small and easily carried in your pocket. But if you have to carry the extension cord with it, it's no longer easily portable.Just extend the male plug (about 2/10 of a cent's worth of materials) and this would be an absolute winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lounge ibiza music","review":"This album is smooth and great sounding. most tracks are great.

The brass section has trouble staying together allot, as though they had too much to drink when they performed this, otherwise, what music was presented is fairly convincingly together, not tight though.

Doesn't work properly on Snow Leopard","review":"I have become accustomed to using Amazon reviews to help my decision making.

Macally did not provide a timeline for updated drivers. I was initially deciding between this keyboard and Apple's keyboard and will be returning this keyboard and exchanging it for Apple's. The keyboard is decently comfortable to type on. However, I am a heavy user of the function keys on my keyboard (volume, play/pause, brightness, etc.) and these are only supported on Apple's keyboard. If the volume keys worked on this keyboard I would be more likely to keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent replacement for white Apple keyboard","review":"Bought this to replace my aging white Apple keyboard. The keys were starting to stick when hit off-center, which made the data-entry portion of my job a pain (literally). I wanted something other than the slim, silver Apple keyboards of today, so gave this one a try. So far, I'm loving it. Great key response with minimal effort, and quiet. The little notches that help your fingers find the \\"home\\" position are also large enough that they probably won't wear away, like the dots on my Apple keyboard did.Also it's a very nice-looking keyboard. Not quite as artsy as the Apple ones, but still looks like it belongs with my 24\\" iMac. A small ding on the score due to the need to install software for the volume and other specialty keys to work. Other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and unreliable","review":"This keyboard has always been too noisy and the action of the keys is very springy.

(Yes, it's that good). The action is suberb, the key size and texture is perfect, and your fingers dance and glide over the keys like hippos doing ballet. My typing speed practically doubled overnight. Its look is futuristic yet subdued, and unlike a lot of third party keyboards, there aren't a bunch of junk buttons and extraneous labeling smattered all over the keys. You have to try it to really see how wonderful it is. It may not be wireless (yet), but it's worth another cable to have this, the keyboard of the gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Keyboard","review":"This is a really excellent keyboard. The feel of the keys is like the old Mac keyboards; the keys are slightly concave, which I think feels much better than the new chiclet keys. It reminds me a lot of my iBook keyboard. I went to their website and downloaded the new drivers for leopard, so now the volume buttons work. The only thing is that there is no fn key, so you'll have to use an actual 'delete' key instead of fn + backspace. Really not a problem at all, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scissors switches!","review":"My last two keyboards were fairly expensive cordless models. The keys slid up and down in holders. I preferred the Apple ADB keyboards I had before them.From the start, the Icekey made touch typing easier than with any other keyboard I remember. The Icekey supports each key with a scissors mechanism that allows consistent tactile feedback no matter how it's pressed, and it's probably less vulnerable than a sliding key to dirt. The keys need be pushed only 3mm. This reduces the risk of catching the edge of an adjacent key.The Icekey does not have bigger key faces than other keyboards, but when I type they feel bigger because hitting a key near the edge works as well as hitting it in the center. That makes touch typing easier.The Icekey takes less desk space than my last two keyboards because they had two dozen \\"bells and whistles\\" buttons and wheels. Who needed those buttons?"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT STICKS!!","review":"What can I say, it's a keyboard! The only major problem is the keys stick! Until I finally set my default to show on my screen which keys were pressed, I didn't even know what was going on exactly - is the shift key stuck? Maybe the command key? The shift, command, and option keys all stick, whether or not I use them; what's with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Mac keyboard","review":"Great keyboard for the price. Tactile feedback is very similar to the first Mac book pro. Easy on the fingers and has all the extra Mac buttons you'll want (volume, eject, etc.).

I now have three of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this keyboard","review":"Just got this keyboard a week or so ago. This is great. Nice, easy touch.

It's the best looking keyboard I've ever owned and the key response was very good at first (just a light tap was all it took) but over the course of one year the spring mechanism underneath the keys started to wear out and the keys became unreponsive (flat.) The more a key is used (space bar is the first to go) the faster it will lose response.Usage was moderate: two users using it mostly on weekends and nights for 12 months.There is no print screen button which can be an annoying surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"the keyboard ive been waiting for","review":"i use this on my pc. very comfortable and i am able to type much more quickly because of the short keypath. i am very picky about keyboards. do yourself a favor and get this keyboard. i am not well-versed in apple keyboards but i wouldn't look any further and would buy it again in a heartbeat. one reason i would have given it 4 stars (as a pc user) is the aforementioned lack of volume key functionality, however it is a mac keyboard so i cant really hold macally accountable. cant find any pc drivers.. still the best keyboard ive ever used. very satisfied after 4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macally, call me back when you use USB 2.0 ports","review":"I bought this to replace the Apple keyboard that came with my iMac. I don't like Apple's super slim keyboard design so I thought the Macally keyboard would be a good replacement. The only problem that I found in the Amazon reviews is that the volume buttons don't work, which isn't a problem since I run speakers using the digital out, which disables the onboard volume control anyway.Well, when I plugged my iPhone into the keyboard to sync, my Mac said that the port didn't have enough power. This means it's not a USB 2.0 port and won't work for most USB devices. And back the keyboard went into the return box.Buyer beware, if the specs simply say 'USB' and not 'USB 2.0', then it's probably the antiquated 1.1 protocol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had just bought a Mac Mini and this keyboard because a friend recommended it. I was looking forward to getting my new system up and running and this keyboard really ruined the day. Here's a quick summary:. Keyboard is not solidly made, feels cheap. Keyboard was not automatically recognized by the Mac OS.. Driver disk is worthless, driver simply does not install.. Phone numbers listed on the files in the CD AND the phone numbers on the website are out of service. A LOT of the keys on the keyboard simply did not work.Plugged in a real Mac keyboard and problem solved.

I found that I was constantly making mistakes and found it difficult to type on the keyboard. The keys did not feel right and my hands were frequently not aligning on the keys correctly. I also have a PC sharing a common monitor. So I ended up with two keyboards,switching back and forth when I changed computers.I bought the Macally key board and have found it to be a much better feeling keyboard that has significantly reduced the errors when I type. It has a very solid feel making typing easy.It has the second bonus that it also works with my PC, allowing me to automatically convert to the correct function keys depending on the computer, using the MAC command and control keys on my Macbook, as well as the Option keys with my PC. This is a quality product and the price is very reasonable at about $30 I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super product for Mac computers","review":"I replaced my previous keyboard (same brand) after 6 years of hard use. I use the USB plug for my wireless mouse, and the keys are excellent for long term typing.

They key issue is that it doesn't work properly under Lion.The keys are softer and the media keys are unlabeled (ie, they don't show pictures for pause/play or mission control). I didn't think the latter would bother me, but it does increase my trial and error when accessing them.The biggest issue is that those keys don't work under Lion. MacAlly's driver is 32 bit, and Lion has moved to 64 bit. As of now MacAlly has not said that it would upgrade the driver. It's kind of a bummer since I bought the keyboard only around 6 months ago. I certainly wouldn't buy it now, given that the media keys don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"junky keyboardS by macally","review":"I bought an icekey keyboard in Canada.

I can really type faster with the low profile keys that require less force. The USB connectors on each side will prove to be useful.Being a Windows user, my only complaints are that left Windows key and the left alt key are reversed on this keyboard. There is also a 'blank' key where the right CTRL button should be but the right CTLR is shifted over a bit. These are minor complaints but they cause me several mistypes per day like hitting Windows-tab instead of alt-tab because of the key reversals.Another keyboard with the similiar low-profile keys is the pricey Logitech diNovo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, buy an Apple keyboard.","review":"Apparently I didn't read the specs carefully enough before I ordered this keyboard for my new Mac Mini running Snow Leopard. It doesn't have all the keys or functions of an Apple keyboard. For instance there is no F16 key on the Macally. Also the USB ports on the keyboard don't seem to function with many devices.In short, this product may work well with older systems, but I wouldn't recommend it for a new Mac system. I would write a more detailed review, but I'm so unhappy with this product that it isn't worth my time. If I had it to do over gain I would spend a few more bucks and buy the Apple product in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a keyboard, but usb is not useful for today.","review":"This is a good keyboard. I bought it for my old powerbook G4 with OS 10.3 because I knew it would be compatible. It works great except for the USB ports- the ports just aren't powerful enough to run most of my newer USB peripherals, which leads me to think that the ports on this keyboard are either USB 1.0 or are just not drawing enough power from my main computer- So those looking for a usb keyboard specifically for more accessible or extra usb ports should go for a newer keyboard that specifically uses USB 2.0. That way you'll be able to run any of today's usb devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and Disappointed","review":"I've used Macally products for a long time and have never had a problem with them, until I got this keyboard. I'm not sure what happened but suddenly it just stopped working. The number pad went first, then the caps key and finally certain keys were unusable. Okay, fine, once in a while you get a lemon. The problem is, I got another one exactly like it and the same exact thing happened. It worked for a few days and then the keys started acting up. I tried both keyboards on two other computers - they still didn't work.It's possible that I just happened to get the only two keyboards from Macally that were lemons. Or it's possible that this particular model has a flaw that will sometimes make it stop working. At any rate, I was very disappointed. Just be very cautious with this keyboard.

It works mostly fine with Windows 7 which recognized the keyboard immediately without requiring installing any drivers. But the four media keys don't work.

Works perfect with my Macbook and all of the secondary and Apple specific keys work perfectly after installing the driver.Obviously this is not a luxury keyboard. There is no backlighting, the key labels are laminated or glued on and are not etched into the keys. That being said, it looks very high quality.

Elizabeth Searle's style is such a pleasure!--the rhythm, the images, the sensual intelligent prose. These stories center around women and girls wanting and needing to be watched. The title piece works perfectly as a film noir novella. Tight, fast but complex; shapely; and it has a satisfyingly dark ending. I also like the story The Young and the Rest of Us. It has a lot of style and power, and a lot of feeling. Compassion for all characters. I read in order to learn how to live life, how to see the world and other people more clearly and deeply. Elizabeth Searle's writing gives me that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"\\"Celebrities in Disgrace\\" is Elizabeth Searle's thoughtful exploration of the disturbingly egotistical souls emerging from a celebrity-obsessed culture. The downfall of characters whose driving desire to be placed on a pedestal is tragic in \\"Memoir of a Soon-To-Be-Star\\", humiliating in \\"What It's Worth\\" and disturbingly and comically familiar to scandal-saturated pop culture watchers in the title story. \\"The Young and the Rest of Us\\" touches poignantly on the role of television in the life of a family struck by tragedy. And \\"Celebration\\" seems to be the antidote to these often-disturbing characters, portraying one couple's struggle to make the life and death decisions surrounding modern pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Motorhead - 'Nuff Said","review":"This DVD is an excellent collection of classic performances of the legendary Kilmister/Clarke/Taylor era, as well as a few spots with one-time guitarist(& sadly not well-recieved by fans), Brian Robertson, formerly of Thin Lizzy. Also included as a bonus feature is the classic \\"Killed By Death\\" video, done in totally \`80's Heavy Metal style, with the dual-guitar assault of former member Mick \\"Wurzel\\" Burston & current mainstay axeman Phillip \\"the Beast\\" Campbell, as well as another one-time member, former Saxon drummer Pete Gill.

Last night I dreamed of a wild cat, which in the dream I identified as an ocelot. Sure enough there's an entry for ocelot! The interpretations, however, are often TOO specific, right down to telling you how many days before those very specific results will occur. For example, dream of an octopus and 'within 3 days someone will become very demanding of your time and financial resources.' This strikes me as gimmicky and makes the book more suitable for a fun session with friends than a serious guide for personal dream work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Dictionary of Dream Language","review":"It helps me understand my dreams more, although what they say may happen in the future does not really come true.

I have extremely baggy jeans as I've been losing weight and this thing still makes it hard to get the pants up and over the holster to draw it, it may work with khaki's. This thing is not comfortable at all. Will be sending it back, I can't use it for plain clothes carry unless I'm wearing shorts which makes it useless.

The velcro is just starting to get a little weak and the stitching is coming out in a few places, so it's time to replace it with a new one.I haven't got a single other piece of duty gear that has lasted this long, or worked this well, and I don't use the top strap either. I've never had an issue with movement, and have worn this holster during a few foot chases with no worries.The only discomfort that I've ever experienced is the few times that I've worn it for an entire day off duty with a pair of jeans and running shoes with no socks under it....as I said, I wouldn't wear any other ankle holster...thanks Uncle Mike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holster","review":"I like this holster. It is very comfortable and fits my S&W Model 637 perfectly. My only issue is that I wear boots most of the time and having the holster with gun around my ankle makes for a pretty snug fit inside of my boot.

He was a mover and shaker, particularly in Great Britain, in the back-to-the-land movement. He was not a existential seeker of altered states like his American hippie counterparts, but an articulate, well traveled, well taught, well organized, proponent of traditional old world skills and a rational mind. The Self-Sufficient Gardener is a treasure trove of traditional gardening skills coupled with clarity and ingenious organization. Seymour, as a life long observer of how traditionally grown food is a foundation of a strong and healthy body, was a philosopher in the most beneficial sense--not at all like Nietzsche, Sartre, or Marx.

Age and the fact that I re-read it for pleasure this time around can make a difference.... Though I do miss the book discussion at UCLA.What I love about \\"America is in the Heart\\" is that the book gives voice to Filipino Americans, particularly to the forgotten ones from the early part of last century. Just like the Filipino American War, only a few knows about this chapter of American History. The struggles and successes of this group of Filipino men should be heard and this book gives good account of their experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Triumph of Courage","review":"Carlos Bulosan captures the struggles of migrant farm workers with exact details.

When I read Carlos's writings, it brought tears to my eyes. He was writing about my father and mother's hardships and triumps in the 1950's Livermore and Pleasanton area of California. We were one of the first Filipino families of that area and my parents worked hard through all the hardships to graduate five children from major California universities. As Filipino Americans we owe much to the Manong generation. Many of the Manong generation are buried with full military honors.

The fun of trying to second-guess the ripples in society caused by some single world-changing event keeps me reading long into the night.With Lion's Blood, Mr. Barnes has done an incredible job of creating a world with an authentic feel. In his alternate history, the American continent is colonized by African peoples who import Europeans as slave labor. It is easy to imagine a writer overdoing this situation as a racio-political diatribe, but Mr. Barnes avoids this trap. What he has written is a STORY, containing memorable characters in an exciting, well-reasoned milieu. As an alternate history fan, I had a lot of fun with the way he worked out the basic concept of this world. As a reader, I was entranced by the emotional reality of his various characters.I'd love to see more of this world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an epic novel of Human Courage","review":"In his latest novel, Lion's Blood, Mr. Barnes explores humanity and the human condition in the exceptionally thoughtful way he has become known for. This book has something for everyone, with exciting battles, romantic interludes and extreme personal challenges.Through the depth of his characters, Mr. Barnes really gets at a working definition of HUMAN COURAGE, and what it means to take personal responsibility, while existing in a world that does not seem to ALLOW personal responsibility. Men and women will both enjoy the strength of the characters.He creates a rich and plausible society, where black masters barter with the lives of white slaves. This fictional history allows us to grapple with questions like, \\"How could we let this happen?\\", \\"What can one person do to change the way things are?\\" and \\"How do we go forward from here?\\"A must-read for anyone, with a strong message about race relations & diversity that is a pleasure to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't a Terminator Timeline Tale","review":"Wonderful introduction to a non-Terminator-type of alternate timeline!!!!!!!!!!!!!A historical role reversal on an unprecedented scale.This is well written and worth every dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"If CHarles Murrary wrote these books","review":"If Charles Murray wrote 'Lion's Blood' and its sequel he might have made Bilalistan more like Poul Anderson's Ythri or the fliers in 'A Stone from Heaven'; a bunch of smart touchy individualists. Mechanical advances resulting from a lot of quarrelsome lone tinkers, not one centralized effort. I'd have liked to see more about the dirigibles in the first book, too.That's what Steve Sailer's idea of Charles Murray might have written. If Steven Barnes loathesome, politically-motivated reductionist had slimed his trail across some innocent word keyboard-Different story.What would Charles Murray's idea of Charles Murray have written?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done before.","review":"This is a story of the injustice of slavery, in reverse. Slavery is unjust regardless of the racial identity of the slave or owner. The plot was obvious and predictable. All the men were strong but flawed. The females were strong victims. What happened to the main charters had to happen for honor to be maintained, no news there. Three times a put down this book, not intending to pick it up again but I thought it might improve. It didn't. This was the first time I read this author and it will be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"I've been a fan of Steven Barnes for years. However in \\"Lion's Blood\\", Barnes has created his masterpiece. The story centers around two young men, Aidin and Kai, each about the same age and each from different cultures. In this Alternate history Whites are slaves, and Blacks are the masters. One of the themes that you will see when reading Barnes solo novels (and also in some of his joint efforts) is the development of trust between people of different races. They learn to find the commonalities between them instead of focusing on the differences.Barnes manages to decry slavery and point out the inherent evil of it without condemning those on either side as completely evil, or completely good.Bravo Mr. Barnes.It's been a long time since Steven has published a solo novel. This extremely well written and well researched novel is well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!!!","review":"I also first heard about the book from Heather Alexander about six months before it was released. Normally, I would not read this type of book, but I became intrigued when I heard the basis of the story, and could not wait for it to be released. I, too was pulled into Steven's world and read it every chance I got.Steven Barnes created a very believable world, and created character's that seemed to jump out of the pages, and the story seemed to unfold before me. I also enjoyed how he took some prominent people in history and incorporated them in the book with his own little twists.I highly recommend this book and I also recommend getting the CD that goes along with it (Heather Alexander's INSH'ALLAH). Having the music in the background will help visualize the farm of Dar Kush, you will hear the songs of the Irish slaves as they work in the fields, you'll know why the slaves fear the Gruagach, and see the visions that Aidan has of the New Northwest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like a Lion had drawn Blood from my eyes","review":"Perfect example of a good author telling a bad story.

I have no regrets about the knife, just looking at the silver line of the sharpen blade makes you feel that you have gotten cut (as I had previously read on one of the review) the blade is well balanced, and has a good weight to it.The sheath needs a little work, but overall design is great if you are making a survival kit, you can easily attach the pouch to the sheath.As I mentioned that I just got this knife, so have not yet placed it in use.

Came sharp as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my prized knife.","review":"I cant get enough of Cold Steel knives.First i got the folding Recon Tanto and just completely loved that product.I got this one for i need a longer blade knife and its just as good.Extremely sharp and love the sheath that came with it.The grip is very comfortable and the balance and weight are just perfect.Now if they make one with serrated edge ill definitely get another.Back to my research and find a Cold steel 11\\" blade knife to compliment the other two LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Testing...","review":"This knife is a good design, but made of very poor materials. For the price, i'd say perhaps a little over priced. I've been using it for one day, doing some basic shopping and throwing and the handle is lose. i wouldn't buy it again if i had the choice. i give it a one out of five stars. i will never buy something with a kraton handle again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just fix one problem and make the loyal customer base very happy","review":"The hilt is a rubber-like material. It easily bends, does not add any functional value and is only for looks. As time goes by, I regret purchasing this knife for that reason alone. It's the first thing others have noticed when I showed it to them, confirming the matter.Understand, I'm a big Cold Steel fan and continue to purchase Cold Steel products. I feel like a spokesperson for the company. Therefore, coming from me the company should consider fixing the problem to produce a truly great product.The blade itself is perfect for a non-carbon edge. The handle less the hilt is also very good. The Japanese design, the tanto, is classic and will never go out of style."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Carbon V as described","review":"The description of the item is not accurate.

The knife was spooky sharp, and the blade is thick as my little fingernail is wide.Fast forward 15 years and I still have the knife. I never used it for anything but kept it in its sheath in the cabinet all this time. I ouled the edge of the blade one time with a trace of vaseline, and that was seven years ago or so.The knife is still shaving sharp. The handle is super comfortable. I do miss a finger guard and a steel butt-plate on the handle for hammering, so I am buying a Ka-Bar, but this Recon Tanto is a remarkable knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"They WorK but Don't Fit","review":"I had something similar on my last vehicle, and they fit and worked great.

It's crisp, hopeful Christian theology. It's an upbeat page-turner, but it is not dumb-downed for the masses. I keep going back to my dog-eared 1974 original version of this book by my bedside.

I've read this book at least 10 times, not always straight through, but in its entirety. Buechner is thoughtful, poignant, and funny. If this book doesn't make you reflect on life and religion, you need help. I carry with me quotes like, \\"reading the bible as literature is like reading Moby Dick as a whaling manual\\" or \\"an agnostic is someone who's not quite sure about the existence of God; that is, some of us all of the time and all of us some of the time. Doubt is the ants in the pants of religion.\\" Buy this book now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure of a book","review":"This was the first book by Frederick Buechner I have read, and I have already ordered more.It's a quick read, yet full of little treasures.

The velcro connection from the hood to the back of the seat is already coming off. The seat insert/cover bunches up at the bottom if I don't hold it up while my daughter climbs in. I can't imagine trying to put a six monthold in it, you would need and extra set of hands.

So much for saving money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing the True Jesus","review":"This is a fine documentary production which presents many great historical and cultural insights although I was annoyed by some of the modernist (liberal) theological perspectives presented by a few of the commentators.Purchasers of this DVD may also like the Jesus Revealed DVD study series. It uses many of the the same beautifully produced visual dramatization scenes from the Gospels with the addition of the provocative Bible teaching of Andy Frost. This is an excellent tool for anyone wanting to know more about the authentic Jesus.Jesus Revealed: Encountering The Authentic Jesus (Disc 1)Jesus Revealed (Disc 2)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and narrow documentary","review":"Saw clips from the dramatized sections of this video (a set of music videos called \\"The Story\\" was created with the clips from this documentary). Wanted to hear the dialogue and searched for the full version as the acting and production was very impressive (if you like silent movies). The documentary was dry and contained too much speculation (to be 'fair'?) There were a few decent speakers (small percentage). The dramatized parts are inaudible (spoken over). They may have been in Arabic or another language. They are truly the stars of this video even if there is no sound. If this video is all there is for these dramatized scenes, it was very disappointing. I tossed it. To see the music videos go to Godtube.com and the best ones are \\"Alive,\\" \\"Empty,\\" and \\"When Love Sees You,\\" all done by major Christian artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Not only has Stormie written a book to encourage and lead husbands to be praying for their wives, but she has also provided numerous insights into women.

Both you and your wife will be blessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY DISAPPOINTING BOOK","review":"The Power of a Praying Husband is a book with potential that fell short. Far Short. It is written by a woman when it should have been adddressed by a man. The book is overly simple. I get the impression she writes it simple with the idea in mind that \\"even us guys can understand the complexities of a women.\\" As usual a women has sold us short. As a Christian I am very sensitive to my wife's needs. Many christian men communicate with their wife in a far more perceptive environment than this author gives us credit. I belong to a christian mens group that is totally bored with this and I will be surprised if we finish it. I do not recommend this to mature christian men in a mature christian marriage. It would be a waste of time. I do give the author credit for attempting this issue. She failed, but I give her credit for trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"Though I love her other two books, this one is a disappointment. A very bad example of communication between husband and wife at the beginning and more 'insults' to loving and caring husband to follow. I bought this book for my husband but I don't think I will have him read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulk Cheez?","review":"I thought this book would be a super simplistic and insulting happy-go-lucky Christian pulp offering. While the cover art, picture and title all lean towards that interpretation, and the meat sometimes does too, I've found that the prayers at the end of each chapter are great. They are insightful and give words to my feelings. They help me really pray for my wife in a way I've never done before. Mrs. Omartian has revived my commitment that I made 10 years ago in a spiritual way that I've always wanted.This isn't a feel-good quick read. It is a tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Men! This book has Enriched Mt Life!","review":"Wow, I don't know where to begin. I'm in the middle of a marriage crisis as I'm writing this. My wife has left our home and I was needing some answers. This book has taught me how to connect with God and learn about my marriage and my wife as well as the giving me insight into how my wife thinks and functions. The 20 chapters are incredibly informational and easy to read and understand. Guys...you've got to read this book in order to learn how to help your wife and increase your relationship. In the end, if my marriage fails, I will walk away with a wealth of knowledge about how to assure that I'll never get into this predicament in life again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I pray for a better read","review":"Personal this book wasted my time. The only thing that she said that applied was that your wife may at times be IRRATIONAL.....

I thought it was a weak attempt to get men praying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"The books \\"praying wife\\" and \\"praying husband\\" are written by a woman, from a woman's point a view and FOR women. They are both full of all the subtle and not so subtle negative male-bashing stereotypes that many women have of men.

For that she gets 2 star. I tried with my possible best intention to listen to the book, I just could not reach half of it. I applaud all those men who say it's a great book and rate it 5 stars.

Imagine what he can do with a song, let alone a concert full of them!You can't imagine it. He's that good. He's a thousand steps ahead of you and you're glad, because you know he's going to write a song about it.If you haven't heard of him before he's like a mix between the Smashing Pumpkins during \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\", Nirvana and The Counting Crows.This CD/DVD combo is amazing, just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Godly","review":"I enjoyed this book because it answered a lot of questions I had about where God stood.

It the face of amazing examples of how to press the playstaton's limits with games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, CB2001's trick set is so short that it will make you want to take naps in between jumps. As long as we are speaking of tricks, there is one called the sad air. I think that sums up most of the game prety well. It's just plain sad. The tracks ... as well. The only plus to this game is the Create-a-Boarder. All the details are alterable so that you can customize yourself to your most intricat wishes. I feel sorry for this game because I am a major fan of the series. I own the second and third instalations of the series and it hurts me to see them at such a low.

It was shipped in a timely manner (less than a week after ordering) and had replacement parts for it in the box. I tried it out and I couldn't hear anything what I needed to hear. I couldn't even hear my heart beat with it and my heart beat is very strong. I did end up returning it for a refund which I received in a timely manner.

She has this book and that is how I know how great it is. Since she has only been in this country almost one year, it has been invaluable to her, and me as well.We have used this book numerous times to translate the entire gamut of topics, words, items and meanings. And we've had a hilarious time as well. Such as when she needed to understand the difference between; 'snicker,' and 'sneaker,' 'boxes' and 'bucks,' (which she initially thought sounded the same!) Of course the killer of them all was when she ordered a 'coc,' not and not a 'Coke,' in our local Applebee's!Now I'll be able to have my own copy for when we are on the telephone, and to help be better understand what she and her relations are talking about when they are speaking Spanish!I truly hope that I'll continue to pick up the Spanish language as quickly as she has done, with the help of this book.

The radio remix of \\"Jealousy\\" is great because unlike the album version it incorporates organs along with guitars, to have more stuff going on. Recently miss Merchant released another great album called \\"Motherland\\" which unfortunatly flopped.

One day after vending for about four hours I checked the temp in the meat cooler and it read -20! The packs were still frozen solid.

Ice is ice. it will never be colder than 32 degrees F and as soon as it is above that; which is as soon as you take it out of the freezer, it's water. Duh.Wrap your stuff with it or long the sides. Also consider the cooler, too. If you have a cheapo cooler, then you has faster melting. Another; Duh.Oh yeah, can you also keep your food warmer longer with ice as you can with Techni-Ice?

I don't totally regret buying this film, because the first 30 minutes are pretty solid, and the sound mixing is at least acceptable. But it all goes downhill from there. Not only do Bob and the band become more and more wasted as the four hour concert goes on, but whoever's running the mixing board seems to go the same way. And it's horribly filmed. You're one of the most prolifically creative bands that ever lived, and you couldn't find a decent film crew in Chicago for your farewell show? It's like these guys hadn't held cameras before.

My boyfriend and I were rated \\"Worst:marriage\\"! The birthday book was by far the best and most accurate.

Everyone I know always wants me to \\"read\\" their relationship for them, and I use it for every single person I meet in life, regardless of the relationship type.

My boyfriend (who is so grounded that if his science hasn't proven it, then it mustn't be real) is a non-believer in this book. He also can't handle anything that attempts to \\"know\\" someone because he refuses to accept that anything has a sense of control over his life other than himself. So, if you're sort of like that, then you won't care for this book. Granted, if you're like that, then you wouldn't be searching for this book.

I am very open to many forms of spirituality, spiritualism, and mysticism, and I thought that this book would at least give me food for thought about relationships in general and about the specific relationships in my life.Unfortunately, I did not resonate with the descriptions in the book. I think the main reason is that the prognosis was almost always negative. I know that all relationships are a complex mixture of positive and difficult elements. However, most relationships are not mostly bad. Furthermore, I do not want to dwell, almost exclusively, on the reasons that relationships won't work.

You won't put it down until you've read and analyzed every personal relationship you share with members of your family, friends, and co-workers. And what's more, you'll find the in-depth descriptions of personality traits chillingly accurate. I found that the descriptions of relationships between various weeks of birth to focus too much on the negative but even so, the personality descriptions reveal traits and inclinations that will give you goosebumps with their 'bullseye' accuracy.

Saying this, however, is a bit like saying that Ulysses is about man walking around Dublin..\\" What I mean is that this piece of writing has so many levels and layers, that one could hardly say that it's about just relations between Jean and Paul. Most of the book is dedicated to stating different theories about weather, history, psychology, human relations and so on and on.And at some point it might get a bit tiresome, becaouse even though it's interesting I'd say that there is a bit too much of extra information not directly related to the main plot.In general I liked the book, but I could not say that I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a controller, not a game!!","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas.

My son is now two years old and they are his favorite blocks - first he liked to just take them out of the box and when he was a little bit older he started to stack them and point to the pictures. Now he is trying to build a \\"castle\\". My only complaint is that these blocks come in a paper box and don't have any fabric bag for an easier storage, so after every play I have to put them back into the box.

He is a strong supporter of the Paypal Brand and an arch enemy of all things Ebay whose attempts to throw \\"roadblocks\\" at the company would almost cause disaster on numerous occasions. This book is very well done with top analysis on the business functions of Paypal. It considers Paypal's inability to get profitable and the problems inherent in its business model to ways that it prepared its consumer base to enjoy the benefits of having a flexible pay service. The internet and computer industry is filled with wonderful business stories and Paypal's is truly near the top. For those who want real business analysis and an understanding of how Silicon Valley works this book cannot be topped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read as told by an insider","review":"The PayPal Wars provides a good narrative of life inside a silicon valley startup. The story starts from the humble beginnings of yet another dot-com that garnered traction via viral marketing. However, the difference was in this company's nimbleness in maneuvering around its obstacles. The author discusses the company's various competitive responses without boring the reader with too much detail. The reader gets a good appreciation of the importance of timing in the rapidly changing Internet space.Overall a brisk and informative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was much poorer quality than expected.

Then I started to have problems figuring out how to only print one page (still haven't).

I put in 5 sheets of label paper, selected the \\"coated paper\\" function and it pulled all 5 sheets through. I've discarded the box otherwise I would take it back to the store, so I guess I am stuck with it's quirks.

Directions say things like: \\"Open the cartridge access doors\\" & \\"Install the cartridges.\\" They do not, gentle buyer, tell you HOW to do these things.

I was an avid fan of the MacGyver series, so I thought the idea of this book was genious, but the execution was abismal. I found one story, one!, to reflect a true moment of MacGyverism. The remaining stories were either stories about applying extremely obvious solutions, or just tales of life travels. And the author knows this, since the stories are fraught with sensationalism, or foul language, as a poor attempt to keep the reader in shock and awe. What's worse, the publisher chose an author for this book project who often claims he is incapable of producing a MacGuyver moment, which I feel explains why this bizarre collection of tales are completely void of MacGyver traits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as witty as you would think","review":"Personally, this is more readers digest material.

Unfortunately, I only got through the first three before having to give up.Does the author really think the real MacGyver would be proud of these three? Knitting needle as a clutch cable pin? Yawn. Snack mix for traction? Is he serious? And here's a beauty: Waiting for someone else to come by because you're so worthless at fixing your own muffler? They don't exactly grab you... Certainly not anything close to what the real MacGyver would do.Perhaps there are better, more worthy stories later in the book. I'll never find out. The three I listened to attempted to be so \\"eloquent\\" that they became nauseatingly \\"cutesy\\". Way too verbose for the actual amount of informational value. Self-celebratory to the point of being repulsive.I loved the show, and with equal emotion, loathe this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly MacGyver","review":"I was excited by the title, but it didn't deliver. It's a bunch of short stories of people who 'improvised' to make something work. Mostly stories of people who think highly of themselves and make a big deal out of very little.

A couple of the stories are good, but over all the book is a major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't judge a book by its cover...","review":"...which is why I wasted my money on this awful, awful book. The BEST thing is the cover... a great catchy title, and a picture of Richard Dean Anderson's mullet. Cool!Other than that, everything about this book is horrible. As other reviewers have pointed out, it has nothing to do with what MacGyver would have done, and everything to do with pretentious artsy-fartsy writer/advertising/media types trying to deal with everyday reality. I suspect the author sold the concept for the book, pocketed the advance, then suddenly realized he had to deliver SOMETHING... so he called a few dozen friends and transcribed whatever nonsense they dictated over the phone.No Swiss-army knives. No paperclips. Nothing of interest here.I own thousands of books, and love books. I've kept books I've disliked, and I've kept books I've disagreed violently with. But this one hits the recycling bin. It will look better as McDonald's paper napkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disappointing","review":"This book is plain awful! Near all of the solutions in the book are far from true MacGyverism.

Shot on a shoestring budget with nonprofessional actors, it's a simple story of four young people who chance to spend a leisurely Sunday together in 1929 Berlin. But it's also a collaboration between world-class talents---screenwriter/director Billy Wilder, future cinematographer Fred Zinnemann, film-noir creator Edgar G. Ulmer, and brothers Kurt and Robert Siodmak. All of them would be forced to flee Germany after Hitler's rise to power---and all would find sanctuary and (to varying degrees)success in Hollywood. Their work shines brilliantly on this digital restoration, created with the help of The Netherlands' EYE film Institute. Along with the film itself are included a great special-features package and a well-written booklet. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was okay...","review":"I found more information on papillions, specifically-online!

See my reviews on other Papillon books for the best one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to a Wonderful Breed","review":"Most people have only seen Papillons on television dog shows and never in person, a true shame as these little dogs are among the cutest and most wonderful of breeds. Although this book doesn't come with one of the furry-eared little pups, it is a great introduction to the breed.The book covers the Papillon breed itself, giving a short history and breed standards, then goes on to discuss what to expect in a pet, delves into care and touches on grooming and showing, peppered throughout with color photos. Yes, the dearth of printed Papillon literature in the US does mean that this book is the choice by default for many wishing to learn more about Papillons, and some of its information is both dated or at times erroneous, but overall, it's a good introduction to those hoping to learn more about one of the cutest and most endearing breeds of toy dogs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"I bought this book for a birthday present for my adult daughter.It is such a thin little book, I had to go buy another gift to go with it.

However, by halfway through I was turning pages as fast as I could, not because it's a page-turner but because I wanted to be done with it. As another reviewer mentioned, the book is full of cliches and one-note good guys/bad guys. Poor dialogue, excessive irrelevant details, awkward use of Britishisms, and thoroughly unbelievable behavior on the part of the husband during the last part of the book (humorous comments on the weather, for example) made this hard to read. Definitely a 'first novel' - maybe he'll get better as he goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed in the reviews for this book","review":"I picked up this book on a whim. I didn't know the author, but since I am a gardener and I enjoy mysteries and the reviews on the cover were favorable, I thought I would enjoy it.The first few chapters were ok, interesting premise, likable characters, but after that it degenerated into a mawkish mess, with cliches that usually only tacky romance writers use.Example: \\"It's only a flesh wound\\" says Alex about his friend being shot in the leg. And other gems such as \\"The man collapsed under the jarring impetus of Alex's perfectly executed rugby tackle.\\" (As far as we know Alex doesn't play rugby, so why is it a rugby tackle?)and \\"What a stroke of luck it had been, her eavesdropping just at that very moment.\\":read ...needed a way to move the plot along.This seemed very amatuerish to me and I am quited disappointed in Publisher Weekly and the Washington Post for recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Slow going, a lot of toing and froing, the actors doing nonsensical stuff to keep the improbable story line going.

If everyone knew that they were here before and would return again then maybe everyone would be kinder, more compassionate, and much less violent towards each other. Dr. Semkiw then uses physical appearance (along with other comparisons) to match American revolutionaries to present day people. Some of these people are famous today. Others are not. I found the reincarnations fascinating and believable, and feel this book is an eye-opener to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"The most interesting book I've read this year! The photos speak for themselves, but add the author's narratives about the continuity of interests, symbols, and even writing styles among some of the cases and it's a book you can't put down.

Just flipping through, it looks like the majority of shipwrecks include pictures of the ships and nicely detailed descriptions with sources.

A land of rugged climatic extremes and even more rugged geography, it has largely bent men to its will rather than the other way around.Beginning with his own childhood reading and first trips to this area, Turner paints a portrait of the Southwest's natural and social history while also describing how he, too, has been shaped by this land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reprint is well-done!","review":"A wonderful new edition of this lovely book has recently been done by Fulcrum Publishing.

In the past 5 years I've owned/purchased 3 printers and 2 computers.While the organization and scope of this book are OK, there's just not enough room or flexibility built into it to make it useful for the many types of homeowners there are out there.I found something called Life.doc at Target and that seems to fit my needs much better.

Another friend who was present at the \\"gifting\\" called it a \\"baby book for a house,\\" which I thought was a marvelous description.My husband and I have just bought another house in another state (meaning that in both senses of the word) so we're ready to begin a new diary.

I truly found this book to be fascinating. It recounts the story of scores of shipwrecks from the earlies know to just prior to the books publication (1969--reprinted in 1973 as a pocketbook by Pan). The stories are tragic, harrowing, and at times downright bizarre. Each chapter deals with a section of the coast, and as each section has seen numerous wrecks, only a few can be discussed in any depth. The book is well written and keeps the reader's attention by not becoming mired in trivial fact and exhaustive description. I personally found it very informative, and it has given me a better understanding of the perils of sailing, something easily forgotten in our day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broly 1, 2 and Bio","review":"I must say that I do not regret purchasing this set, it's very convenient to own all 3 movies on one disc however the only Broly movie that any sort of impression on me was the first one.

No book can comprehensively offer advice about where you live, in your home place.

Within the first half hour of \\"Cotton Mary\\", I couldn't believe the venerable house of Merchant Ivory let this one out the door! The usual subtlety, nuance and visual emotiveness of the actors is missing. Madhur Jaffrey offers an unimaginative performance as an Anglo-Indian stuck in the limbo of two cultures with a history of antagonism and admiration betweem them. Greta Scacchi barely drifts throught the entire movie as a naive and weak-willed wife. There is so much potential in the basic storyline but it is rendered into a soap-opera version of what should have been a poignant and bittersweet story.For those looking for a more sensitive treatment of the Anglo-Indian dilemma, look for \\"Jewel in the Crown\\", a multi-episode Grenada production which appeared in PBS in the late 1980s.

Do not only use this to replace regular toothpaste...it is extremely unhealthy for your teeth and WILL cause cavities because fluoride is required for healthy teeth, and this paste does not contain any.The flavor is not very good and the aftertaste is terrible.I do not believe they make this anymore, which is wonderful-because all it did was cost me a lot of money and time to fill SEVEN cavities because of using this toothpaste for over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPLIFTING, FUN, IRONIC AND DELIGHTFUL","review":"This movie, as they used to say, is quite \\"a trip\\" -- innocent but ironic, simple but poignant in message, lulling and teasing -- and all told with a big wink. How much have we all changed since a century ago when Vincent van Gogh was rejected, scorned and dismissed? Not much. When he comes back today, the media (journalists and newsmen), lawyers and judges, art critics, even art educators try to dismiss him all over again, considering him a \\"con-man.\\" But this is no \\"Harold Hill\\" of the MUSIC MAN who tried to con River City into buying instruments for a Boys Band. This is the real Vincent -- and like any working man, he wants to get paid... it's been a century and he comes back from death to just TRY to get his check from the greedy chiselers who hoarde his artwork. A low-budget, independent film that makes up in charm what it lacks in production sophistication, with some very funny performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"This movie is absolutely the most awful movie I have ever seen, but the hysterical thing is that we rented it knowing that it would be a complete flop, based on its premise, and the description on the video.

How Van Gogh was supposed to have an open air residence on a roof, furnished (from where I don't know), and storing paintings regardless of the elements is a complete mystery.

Only saving grace was that this wasn't filmed in black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accept the Corny-ness! This movie has heart!","review":"This movie is really fun as long as you go into it with the right attitude. The sets are cheap, there are some continuity problems, and the acting is really, really strange. It's sort of like something you'd expect from a PBS-produced soap-opera documentary. Some would call it bad--and I would agree if it was confined to one cast member--but it seems like the whole cast is in on the joke, and once you accept it, the movie is really quite interesting.

There is not really any room for the neck strap in the bag but it sort-of extends through holes in the sides so you could have the case on the camera while wearing it around your neck - but then where would you put the bag when you remove it to shoot? The case has openings that would allow rain or dust in. There is no room for accessories except in the little separate case that clips to the main case. It uses magnetic closures which I don't like to have around storage devices like SD cards. I prefer theMountainsmith Focus II Camera Bag (Small, Warm Grey)that fits this camera perfectly with room for accessories and the strap and good closures to protect the camera from weather.

It's just that in comparison to the stiflingly boring first 2/3s of the book, you get really excited for any kind of action. Maybe that was the idea of the first 140 pages. The author had this really great idea for a really great story but when she wrote it out she just couldn't make it all that interesting. So she added 140 pages of backstory to really bore the crap out of the reader to make the last part of the book seem mildly interesting in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"My book group chose this book by the interesting description here and review.

After one of the coeds is brutally mauled while waterskiing, the others make an effort to get him medical attention, which, of course, merely results in more death as they attempt to traverse the dangerous waters of the lake. Hampered by its PG-13 rating, the film fails to deliver the goods in either of the two major draws of the genre: gratuitous violence and/or gore, and gratuitous sex and/or nudity. Shark Night brings nothing new or exciting to the formula, so it's pretty difficult to make a recommendation out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"saw it","review":"im pretty sure i just watched it on chiller tv here in fla. different title, girl returns to home island after bad experence with boyfriend;; friends start dieing in salt Lake, old boy friend films deaths for Shark Week on tv also becomes dinner, am i close;; lame need to get there shark species correct,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark Weak","review":"Excuse the poor heading, Shark Night was a weak film overall. A group of college students go to a lake house to party and end up being the prey of deadly sharks. The story is generally generic even when the twist occurs; I personally thought the second half of the movie brought down the film the most since the first half was decent. It has some exhilarating scenes that were actually fun, but only SOME scenes really worked. I ended up hating most of the characters and the survivors are predictable from the beginning. The acting was okay, I personally thought Sara Paxton did a better job in The Innkeepers. The effects were also weak. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a horror movie because it wasn't scary at all.This movie has some gore, blood, and partial nudity (male and female). It kind of pushes the PG-13 rating, I've seen tamer R-rated films. Overall, I don't recommend paying for this film. If you must watch it, it's available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/22/12."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Kind Of Bites","review":"Shark Night has plenty of cute shirtless guys, and a scary looking shark. Unfortunately, that's about the only positive things I can say about it. And the shark doesn't get nearly as much screen time as those three psycho's do, played by Chris Carmack, Joshua Leonard, and Donal Logue. The movie is mostly boring, especially when compared to 2010's Piranha remake, another recent big-budget killer fish movie. Piranha had awesome gore, a sense of humor, and lots of skin, which are things that Shark Night is lacking. See it on TV, if you see it all all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lower intestine product","review":"I love shark movies, and although there has been little produced about sharks that has been worth watching since the original Jaws was released, I will still go the extra mile to watch anything newly released that's shark related. I almost knew what to expect going into this from watching the trailer. Sadly, I didn't know it was going to be this bad. Sure I've seen some really low budget movies that turned out pretty darn good, so if you consider the budget they had to work with on this, it actually makes this one exceptionally bad flick. The acting, the story, the CGI, it was so depressingly poorly executed. How someone gives this anything above 3 stars is beyond me. It's so bad that I don't even feel like typing anymore about it.

About why the sharks are there, they say its not salt water and that the sharks being there is impossible, and aside from one small scene, you never really know how they were put there and didn't die.Bottom line is this.

Moira's quest of knowledge could have been an interesting side story, but instead the author only applys non-specific references to Moira's concern for others finding out about her experiments. Perhaps Donna Fletcher should have engaged in her own search for knowledge and researched what advances in science were unfolding circa 1513.

It was very hard for me to grasp the idea that 29 was considered Old!?!?! But during this time period it was, I just couldn't wrap my mind around that idea! I thought the Characters were great, although, I did get the feeling that the heroine had a big better than attitude b/c SHE was educated and SHE had to keep up her studies and SHE had to keep up with her 'experiments'.

By virtue of sheer overall beauty, sublimely spiritual atmosphere and hair raising choral climaxes, Karajan wins, but barely! Solti may have better overall singing, and the sound is a bit warmer (Karajan's early digital can be slightly bright at times).

It is also small enough that it does not greatly enlarge the overall size of the palm (still fits in large pockets). My only complaint about this and every other case is that none of them are built with left-handed users in mind. While the included leather flap was flimsy, I could drop it into the right hand slot and the pen into the left so it opened \\"backwards\\" from the normal book-like approach. The close fit of this case (which is good, mind you), prevents me from doing the same trick.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the overall construction, look, feel and perfect fit that this item provides. This is by far the best way to protect your investment. I also found how easy it was to use with my hotsynch cradle without taking the plam V completely out of the case; simply raise the cradle a few inches up off your desk with a book, open the case at a 160 degree angle and the palm fits very easily on the cradle. This case satisfies all of my criteria for a product worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good protection on the road - operation and finish too bad","review":"The hard case for Palm V offers good protection while on the move. But during operation it is a nuisance. The contrast switch on top of the Palm is depressed by the hard case making it impossible to operate my Palm when it is resting in the hard case, overall handling is harder, Hot-Sync is a joke and finally the looks does not at all reach the finish of the Palm V itself.

This case does not look worth [price]at all. I ended up buying IBIZ Aluminum travel hardcase. This IBIZ hardcase is made of rugged aircraft aluminum and your palm is totally enclosed except for the part where you beam and about an inch on the side where the stylus is. This case looks very sleek and comes in black or silver. The best part of this product is it only costs [price]in Compusa. I suggest you check this out before buying the palm hard case.

It has done a good job of protecting the device. It has been a pain when the contract button is pushed because several times the contrast has gone to all black (good luck trying to tap on the contrast bar to bring it back again). The other problem is that since it is a hard case, it wears holes in the pockets of my pants. My jeans have holes where the corners of the case rub. I'm going to try leather as a compromise.

One feature I particularly like is the pocket for carrying business cards. Also, the inside of the case is a great place to stick the graffiti guide.

The cover that comes with the Palm V looks better.The biggest problem I have with it has been mentioned but not emphasized:YOU CAN'T HOTSYNC with the case on.If your Palm use is very Palm-oriented this might be ok, but mine is very desktop-oriented, and that means I have to repeatedly take the case on and off.Another minor annoyance: the case itself is just slightly larger than the Palm V.

In addition, the pin slowly slides out the top of the hinge as you open and close the case (at least mine does)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"If you are looking to keep your plam pilot in your jeans pocket then this is a great product. If you want looks, go for a nice leather case. A good leather cases is far more elegant and better designed (also more $$$) than the hard case. I would give this case 2 stars if you want to show off. A couple of notes.1. The case closes (it won't suddenly pop open by itself) but doesn't close tightly. This is just fine if you plan to keep it in your pocket or a brief case.2. Hot sync is slightly more complicated but doable. If you keep the cradle on top of something (coffee cup, books, in my case ISDN modem), hot sync is fine.3. The case is not made of the same material as the Plam Pilot. It is made of plastic and with two pieces of cheap metal. It looks just OK.

That's what I call a ripp off.I will return it and ask my 6 year old son to make something nice for fathersday.

Lets face it, even though it's got style, the Palm is first and foremost a tool. As such, a leather case seems to defeat the purpose. Maybe it looks good, but I've found the leather cases to be less practical than the sturdy hard case. Most leather cases do seem occassional make contact with the \\"on\\" button when the Palm is being carried in hand or pocket. The Palm did occassional get turned on accidently in the leather case a tried. That has never happened with the hard case.As others have noted, a little thought should overcome any criticism leveled at the hard case. The cradle can be adjusted to allow hot syncing without removing the case.The hard case seems like the most practical cover for a very practical tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Palm pilot case.","review":"I'm guessing from the pricing info above that these are no longer manufactured, but QUICK, order one used while you still can, because these cases are GREAT!They protect your Palm Pilot in your bag, without accidentally turning it on (when I used the original flip-cover that my Palm Pilot came with, my battery would always run down because it would switch on when it was in my purse).They're SUPER-easy to put your Palm Pilot in and out of (yes, you will have to remove it from the case to charge it, but that's a piece of cake).Also: They are reversible, so if you are left-handed, you can put your Palm in \\"backwards\\" to the way it's \\"supposed\\" to go.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers good protection","review":"I did a previous review on this case, which I liked, and just wanted to clear up a misconception I read by another reviewer.He said the case doesn't offer that much protection because it's just plastic with an aluminum finish. No. The case has real aluminum bonded to plastic, because one of the occasional problems I've heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic.Aside from the occasional problem like that, I found this to be quality case. Although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it, it's worth it as it costs $100 to get the glass screen replaced by Palm if it breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all of you that take the pilot out before hotsync...","review":"I have bought the hard case, and saw that before HotSync, I need to take it out of the hardcase. I found a simple way to avoid this- put the cradle on a few-inch-high box and open the hard case both from top and bottom (180 degrees). Now you can put it on the cradle that is aligned to the left side of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe to protect from a serious drop","review":"Without repeating what has been said many times before, the hard case may offer protection in the event the palm V is dropped. However, to protect the screen from scratches, etc., I will stick with the method I used on my palm III - trim a piece of thin clear plastic (like used on an overhead projector) to fit the screen and fit it neatly under the slight overlap around the screen edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"The palm V is both fabulously practical and stylish. However, this case feels and looks cheap. With this case, the pilot ceases to be stylish, and becomes as bulky as the Palm III."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Are Left Handed, Don't Buy It!","review":"The leather case that comes with the Palm V allows you to put the case on either side. This makes use of the Palm V a lot easier for us left-handers. This hard case looks great and I was really excited to get it, but it only opens to the left like a book. This makes it difficult to juggle hands with the stylus in order to get into a position to use it. I wish that Palm made a left-handed version! Oh well.... I'm sending this one back ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive and NOT Worth Buying","review":"I was going to buy one of these cases for my new Palm Vx. It looked great and I figured if it was made by Palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy...I mean tool...safe. Fortunately, I saw one in a store before I ordered one. As some of the other reviews have said, it's made out of cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration. The hingers are fragile and the spring-loading is weak. I don't think it's worth the cost and I've seen them as low as $25.If you're buying a hardcase, I'm assuming you want some protection for your Palm. This won't give it to you. If you just want something that looks good to cover-up, there are lots of nice leather ones out there.As for me, I decided to spend the extra money on a Rhinoskin molded aluminum case. I'll let you know how that goes. So far, so good...check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Good informative book, very educational.

Well, the leather is thinner than I even expected. More noteworthy in my opinion is that, even when the case was filled with travel cards, business cards, and the like, it was still designed to be thicker -- perhaps about 1/2\\". The effect is that that the tri-fold and closures are loose and sloppy. It really wants to be thicker than it is when fully loaded.

It's weak after just an hour, thought it just be me, but seems like this is the biggest complaint on other sites.I've even tried 4 sprays on different parts of my body and it simply does not last.

The one that you'll find in any beginner's book (or even the one that came with the flute) is far more usable.This chart would be good for an instructor to post on the wall in class, only because it shows a life-size picture of a flute. And it points to where the fingers go when holding the flute - a good 30 seconds of use per student. At nearly a quarter the cost of a full-on book, it's hardly worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for your flute!","review":"My daughter just started playing the flute and this thing is awesome!

Well anyways, I saw the commercial and the voices aren't the same and the animation is DEFINATELY not the same. I'd personally just settle for the 1st Jungle Book re-release.

Save for the voices of the actors and the extended color palette (that's what the two stars are for), for the most part the movie is a poor extension of the original without anything to add to it. As a matter of fact, the storyline is very much a refried version of the original: no new villains, no new challenges, still Mowgli confronting his nemesis Shere Khan the tiger, even the monkey scene is refried, but mimicking it with children this time. Not worth renting, much less buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disappointment","review":"I like to consider myself one of the ultimate Disney fans, and I thought this movie was just awful. Mowgli was so much more whiney and obnoxious, and Haley Joel Osment did not have the same attitude as the voice in the first one. The tunes are not at all catchy, most of them are just annoying. And, with all due respect to John Goodman, you are not Phil Harris. You can't compare the Baloo in this one to the Baloo in the first.

Depending on your taste, you may enjoy either CD1 over CD2 or visa-versa. I love CD2 because it is very smooth and the way Sander K transitions in between Party to the Music and Waves is mind numbing! He uses what I call a stutter-step beat as a pivot over to the next song (difficult to explain), which is the icing on the cake.

Otherwise, this is good old fashioned science experiments and apparatus straight out of the 60's. It is getting to be a tired old saw, but I have to say it: this book helps in some small way to fill what has gone missing in modern education and a child's youth.

She was a little too young for it at the time, but we have been trying to use in now. Yes, it tells how to build apparatus and yes, it has brief descriptions of how to setup and run simple experiments. What is lacking is a coherent explanation of why to do the experiments, why the experiments work, and what scientific principle is being illustrated. This book may be useful as an aid to teachers who already have introduced the scientific concepts to a class, but for a kid trying to learn by doing, it is sorely lacking.

The interactivity between Barney and a certain scientist is nothing short of amazing. At one point, the character leads you!It was rather short, but the HD pack and a standalone version of Opposing Force, coupled with the new point of view, makes it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and way too short","review":"As a Half-Life fan, I must say how disappointed I am with Blue Shift. It's far too short (took me about 6 hours), too easy (no hard puzzles to solve), and limited in scope (you don't even see all the monsters or get all the weapons you do with original Half-Life). Is it worth the money? Barely. Even if you look at it as just a 'filler' until HL2, it's still very unsatisfying. If you're an HL fan, go ahead and order, but don't waste your time standing by the mailbox for it to arrive. It's just not worth getting excited about. INSTEAD try Gunman Chronicles (uses the HL engine) and actually drive a tank this time !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it unless you don't have OpFor","review":"I bought this game for Blue-Shift, the abbreviation of which is, unfortunately, BS. This is surprisingly useful though, since this game essentially is BS. It seems like it might be cool, being a security guard, right? Being a mall security guard is probably more exciting than this game. it has some interesting sequences, but is is horribly short. Seriously. I took about 3 1/2 hours to beat it on \\"easy\\" THE FIRST TIME. No cheats/hints/strategy guide, either. I am not exagerating when I say it's too short. But it comes with OpFor, which PC Gamer put as 2nd runner up for Game of the year at some point. OpFor is much better than Blue Shift, so if you don't have Opfor, take a look. If you do have OpFor, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Shift, a dissapointment","review":"I can't believe this is actually a game. I've downloaded mods better than this!!

Took like 5mins to download, full ver I mind u. It was about a 120 megabite download. I can tell u ok so u'r Calhoon, a guard. U start off in a tram like usual. Then u like witness sum cool graphix n whatnot. U basically go threw shoot sum swat guys, go thru a portal at the end for sum odd reason, nd get back out. Then go back in and u'r on the outscurs of the whole lab with other scientists. And it ends with u'r jaw droped and wanting more for u'r ... money. I am sorry but this is the worse attempt to draw u'r money from u'r wallet and basically it's like burning $... with a match. U won't see the same $... again nd u'll get frustrated. That's all I have to say to this weak attempt of what they call a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Add-on! Too bad it's so SHORT!","review":"This is a great add-on for one of my all time favorite games. The level design is just as you'd expect from Gearbox. Everthing is top notch. I had a lot of fun playing through this, all of about 1.5 hours! Blue Shift would have deserved a 5 star rating, with so little new material, it is just not worth it. If you don't already have the Opposing Force add-on (which is also included) this may be worth buying, and the high-res pack makes the characters and weapons look cool. For me though, having already purchased Opposing Force, this product is just not satisfying enough. Should've been 3 or 4 times longer. Definately a dissapoinment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ITS OVER ALREADY","review":"that was my expression as I beat teh game...no end boss, no new weapons, this game just doesn't feel like opposing force or teh original half life, at 10 bucks I'd suggest buying it if only for the high res pack and a quick run through the levels, but the game itself isn't that good, its not much combat mostly puzzles until the last 2 levels.My advice stands as: Buy it if only for the high res pack packaged in but dont expect much from teh game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!

Nothing new, all recycled stuff. High definition pack will update 3 years old graphics into 2 year old graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hard-core HLers","review":"Blue Shift can be summed up in one word: Short. But there are some things that make the game more than just that. One of them is the HD Pack, which virtually gave away to the ugly-faced NPCs and replaced them with better looking models. But there is one thing Gearbox needs to correct. On the back of the box that shows the improved model of the alien slave, thats not the model in HL HD pack, thats from the PS2 version of HL. Other than that, everything else looks good. The next great thing about Blue Shift is that you get to play as the security guard. Ive always wondered from the HL days what the guard had to go thru to get out. And third, it tells the story of how the whole ailen incident got started, before Lambda Core was built, and the \\"incident\\". All in all, Blue Shift is good. But its only for people who are toltal fans of HL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!

Having only 20-odd levels, anyone with even a passing interest for first-person shooters will finish it in 3-4 hours. ( I have done it in 2)The game's brevity could be forgiven if it's content was of high quality, but once again, BS's levels and game content are nothing to rave about. Following the same principle that HL popularized of having small level clusters, BS's levels are not given a chance to show their full potential.Most of the levels seemed like a work of amateur designers.You are better off purchasing Counter-Strike and playing that instead of throwing your money away on Blue Shift."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up???","review":"I saw 12 reviews all dated prior to June 14 when my local best Buy said the game would be available.How are you people \\"reviewing\\" a game which is not yet released?Or do most of you work for Valve?PS I had to fill in the star rating field...I have not played this yet either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short and awful","review":"This game was not only short but stunk, I think that MODS and other downloads on the internet are far better than this, I think is stinks!

It's about an 1/8 of the size of origional HL. The new high definition weapon and model pack that comes with it is great though. It makes the scientists, security guards, and aliens look much more realistic. And it replaces some of the old weapons for instance, the glock for a beretta, and mp-5 grenade + launcher to an m16 + grenade launcher. That little upgrade enhances the game so much that I would buy it just for that. But back to the game, it was fun, with good scrpted scenes and puzzles (i got stumped a few times on em But eventually worked them out.) As I said before, fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of Half-Life","review":"This game is very disappointingly short...there is no excuse to charge $30 for a game I can finish in a night.

The game was really good except for the fact that it's 1/4 the length of half life and you hardly get any contact with other people besides the army. I would recomend that you buy this game but if you don't own the original Half life buy that first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and not too Sweet...","review":"I am a Half-Life addict. I will admit that I did support the game tooth and claw whenever I heard a dissaproving grunt from my friends.So why did I rate this game a measly two?!It was short. Everyone was complaining about Op. 4's unsatisfying length, well then, now you've got something to complain about even more. This is more like an overnight game than a month game like the first (and in my opinion, best) Half-Life.Sierra and Valve have been relying on the popularity of Half-Life to get them more cash out of expansion packs. The companies don't put as much time in their HL games anymore. Bl-Shift is just a few small levels put together in hopes of a fatter wallet.The graphics were not spectacular either. If Valve wants a better game they need to spend a little more time on it. I was downright dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Bust!!!","review":"Wait until this comes to the discount shelves or try it our first. Very short no real benifits to buy this game.

The game starts out in a tram(sound familiar) and then all hell breaks loose down at black mesa for an unkown cause. Im sorry, but I do not think that the original half life is even that good, so when this expansion pack came out i was not that excited for it. Though I wasn't that enthusiastic I picked it up, and once i started playing I officially lost my taste for all half life games. Even a novice gamer could finish this game in a matter of 4-6 hours of casual playing. No complex puzzles, terrible sound, terrible graphics even with the new high definition pack, and way to much of the slide effect when walking. Overall this game is short and leaves gamers unfulfilled, though it does contain opposing force, i still feel the 30 dollar price tag is way to much for a game with uncountable faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selena Gomez","review":"It's the second movie Selena has done that it's from Disney and I think she is doing very good. The only problem I have with it, is that it simes that every Disney prinsess has to make a movie where she is playing two people. And I think that's a shame.But like I said Selena Gomez, is doing great is this movie, she really shows the world that she is so much more then just a Disney prinsess.Cory is also good in this one, I've seen him in Glee and seeing him in something else is amazing. You get to she him as someone else for a change and he is doing is amazingly.All in all everybody is doing a really good job.I would tell you to see this movie, if you're a fan of Selena or some of the other stars in this, or if you like a good laugh, love, romance and sisterhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinketh","review":"Boring!There is no action and certainly absolutely no plot.

I was always weary of Hillary, reading this book sealed it. He constantly bad-mouths the porters who took him to the various summits of Nepal (other than Everest); he is always quick to point out he was 'first to wake'; 'first to lead'; etc. The book was published in 1955, two after the ascent. During that time, Tenzing was receiving more fame than Hillary. Jealously took root to write this terribly constructed book.Recommended, however, to see just how self-righteous Hillary is.P.S. Hillary didn't summit Everest first - Tenzing did (or perhaps George Mallory). Also, the cover of the book is not of Hillary and Tenzing on the summit, as some believe. It's at Camp XI."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm On Top Of The World!","review":"HIGH ADVENTURE is Sir Edmund Hillary's engaging and somewhat self-effacing account of the first recorded successful Everest ascent in 1953.An earlier reviewer describes Hillary as \\"a bigot,\\" I suppose because he describes the Sherpas he worked with as \\"coolies.\\" Of course, HIGH ADVENTURE was written in 1955, when attitudes were much different. And Hillary, far from being self-aggrandizing, seems to shun the spotlight.Certainly, Hillary makes fairly little of his pre-Everest climbs, although they undoubtedly made him a splendid mountaineer. His lyrical voice for settings and experiences is fine, though never as poetical as Peter Matthiessen in THE SNOW LEOPARD, who traversed much of the same ground.One of the shortcomings of this book is the lack of an Afterword in the new edition. One has to wonder what Hillary thinks of Everest's now chintzy, clockworked guided climbs.

We lost my son's favorite sticker - the yellow street sweeper - because it didn't stick to the page, and it was upsetting to him.

You will need to be careful when peeling the stickers since depending on the shape of the vehicle, you can tear them, especially the long tankers and big hulls. This is not a good thing.First time using the sticker in the book is fine. But after a few tries, the ends will start to curl. It's even worse when my child decided to stick the stickers on other surfaces, which then desensitized the sticky side.But overall, it's money well spent. He's had it for several months now and he still enjoys playing and looking at it.

I don't know how the people who worked there dealt with the strong, perfumy smell because just driving past the factory on certain days gave me a headache. OSIS Thrill smells almost exactly like that factory, and it's just as overwhelming. The only time I used it, I wondered if it would weigh my hair down, so I tried a VERY SMALL amount. I smelled like a cheap candle until I washed my hair over 24 hours later. I didn't see any styling benefits, but I assume it's because I didn't use enough. Or maybe the smell blinded me to the styling power of the product. Or maybe it killed off so many brain cells I wasn't capable of noticing any improvement.I'm a HUGE fan of other OSIS products (Schwarzkopf Osis Dust It 10 gmcomes to mind), so I'll stick with them.

You do *not* want your tap breaking or damaging threads, it's not like you get to do this sort of work over again if you blow it. The Craftsman set was pretty expensive for what it offered, so I started looking else. Since I have always had great experiences with Gear Wrench tools, and based on reviews on Amazon and a couple automotive forums I checked out decided to pull the trigger.

The performance is objective in every sense, being uninflected by an evident interpretation. Much better are the Leonhardt, Cates, Brookshire, and Rousset recordings, by a very wide margin. Each of these recordings features a distinctive interpretive approach that one can like or dislike. Moroney's approach will offend no one, but will likely bore many. This recording is representative of the pseudo-authenticity that reached a peak in popularity around 1980, but which has not worn well, have been superceded by a new wave of early music performers, each with his or her own voice. Moroney plays much as an editor edits, seeking absolute \\"transparency\\" through his unwillingness to inflict his own hand on the \\"text.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Giant tornado, great heroism, enormous tragedy.","review":"Although I fear the wrath of nature, I have found myself wanting to read another book on weather since I devoured Isaac's Storm two or three years ago. Although not as comprehensive as I would have liked it to be, this book still drew enough of my attention that I finished it in only two days.The Forgotten Storm details the path of an F5 tornado that devasted a 219 mile stretch of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana in 1925. It contains general information on tornados in general, and on what kind of weather forces created such a monstrously huge storm. Although the author's family lived in one the towns demolished in the tornado, he admirably manages to avoid an egocentric viewpoint by telling not only his own story, but that of a myriad of people in the towns and rural areas whose lives were also affected.This book is not only an exploration in weather, but effectively and gently unfurls stories of heroism, bravery, and tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"I quite enjoyed this narrative of the great Tri-state tornado of 1925. I found the straightforward linear presentation easy to follow and the background explanations of the storm's formation added to one's understanding of the weather systems that produced such a massive tornado.The fact that the author is a survivor of the storm adds to the sense of immediacy and gives a human dimension to these events.The one minor quibble I have with this book doesn't occur until the final page of the main text, in which the author states that the last single tornado with a death toll of over 100 took place in 1944. As anyone from my area knows, however, the Beecher tornado which struck the north part of Flint, MI on June 8, 1953 killed 116.That aside, however, I found this book an interesting insight into a disaster which - as the book's title indicates - is largely forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"great this is NOT","review":"How anyone could be so dense as to consider this recording \\"great\\" is beyond me. Nilsson is available in a number of live performances with a FAR better conductor and Tristan than here. Solti is too slap-dash. He knew nothing of TRISTAN but, based on his Ring sales, he was given this and other recordings. Yet he had no concept of the opera at all. Nilsson is great but she's the only one. Uhl was a decent enough artist but was never a Tristan even with the help of over-miking. Go for any of the Nilsson - Windgassen or the Nilsson - Vickers sets (by the way, Windgassen was much better than the crooning Vickers as Tristan). If you can find the LIVE Bayreuth performance with Nilsson & Windgassen under Bohm, THAT will raise you blood pressure. The DG set is good but was a patchwork of live & rehearsal perfoamnces. The live one has the occasional blemish but you don't remember them. Bottom line - forget this Solti."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cover","review":"I regret that somehow my name/review has appeared twice on this page.

I guess the lure of adventure was stronger and more accessible, especially with aviation still being in its infancy and no doubt very dangerous by current standards. Sabotage is the Sky not only has tough guys fighting it out on land and in the sky, but a great, cocky female pilot who more than pulls her weight to save the day.The basic plotline revolves around Bill Trevillian, who tests new fighter planes for the Allied Forces. He's competing with another company to get a multi-million dollar aircraft contract. Covert Nazi enemy agents, however, have tampered with the warbird to deliberately mark it for failure, and fatalities.

Ramthun writes a story that takes us on a non-stop adventure from the first page to the last. Her minor characters are so fun that I forget that it is a story. This book has a rock and roll star who is a hunter and a gun-toting independant, but yet we see how he feels so passionate about a sport that needs a voice. Yet the main characters, some of whom we know from Ramthun's prior books, continue to delight, entertain and have us hanging on the edge of our seats. I really like Ted, Lucy's husband and his role in the book. It is not a long book, but contains so much adventure I wonder how she does it.I recommend this to all adventure readers, conspiracy readers,besides readers who like a little mystery, romance, science fiction, angel believers, and anyone just wanting a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb read!","review":"WHat a great book!

Just dead. Won't turn on. E-mailed iRiver support---no reply after two weeks. As I write this review, I've been on hold with iRiver customer service for 22 minutes and have yet to speak to a human. First and last iRiver product I'll ever buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME little player","review":"I have done extensive research and have read many reviews about different mp3 players out there, and finally had settle on this one. I purchased it here on amazon and just got it a couple of days ago. Overall, the built quality is very impressive. Although it's small in size, but feel very sturdy, and of course, the sound, flawless, and powerful. The included headphone is not bad at all, actually it's quite good. I purchased a creative MuVo 256MB for my sister a couple of months ago, and the sound on this one is definitely better than the MuVo one. I guess if there's one complaint about it, that would be the included armband, too small. I read that in a review somewhere, but told myself that it'd probably fit me right since I'm not Arnold or even close, but nope, I was wrong. So I'm back on Amazon now to buy me another armband for this player. But overall. I highly recommend this player to anyone who's looking for a flash-based mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support?!#@? We don't need no stinkin' support","review":"I just bot an iriver 795T from Amazon. My first ever mp3 player which I got after a fair amount of research. One of the main reasons I got it was for the fm player in it. That was the first feature I tried out. I'm in the Chicago area and should get plenty of radio stations. It picks up 11 and three are just dead space.Support from iriver? I'm still on hold with them, have been for about 40 minutes. Has anyone EVER gotten through on that line? Their automated support on their website was not a help.This is really a bad customer service issue. I'm thinking of returning this product just because of the lack of customer service which is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not measure up to hype","review":"I skipped the ipod because I wanted a fm radio. The 795 offered a radio and the in-line recording capability. To this point, I am disappointed. The stick control is very sensitive making it difficult to use. Moreover, the radio gets poor reception. On the positive side, the sound quality is good, and it does get good battery life. I would also say that if you have medium sized arms the arm band is useless (and hideous). Because the radio is useless, I would have been better off with the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this piece of junk","review":"I purchased the iriver IFP-795T several months ago. When I installed the software, it causes my keyboard to be disabled... there's some type of a driver incompatibility problem. The only resolution was to reinstall the original driver set. This is a repeatable compatibility problem.I've tried contacting iRriver multiple times for resolution to get it to work with my PC. They are totally unresponsive.In the meantime, I have a choice... use my MP3 player or use my keyboard. Some choice!I can accept that there's an incompatibilty problem. What I can't accept is that iRiver won't help me fix it. They won't even respond to my messages.This product is junk. Don't buy it if you have any doubts about compatibility with your equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing Fundamentalism","review":"Geisler is a fundamentalist theologian who has written numerous apologetical and theological works. I will admit I'm strongly prejudiced against fundamentalism, but this theologian even actively takes creation science (the belief the Earth and universe are 10,000 years old) seriously and tries to dismiss any science which disagrees with this theological view.He is familiar with Christian theological tradition, but on the whole, his works which try to prove fundamentalist dogmas are entirely unconvincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not for everybody","review":"For those of you hoping this is some sort of new and undiscovered toots&co reggae album, you'll be dissapointed.... unless you dont mind hearing the maytals belt out fast ska stompers. This material was recorded for byron lee a short time before toots left for jail where he recieved inspiration for the famous \\"5456 was my number\\". This is a good collection, but if you own \\"time tough\\" the anthology, you already have the two best song on here, which are \\"It's You\\" and \\"Never You Change\\". I'd say this album is probably only for collectors, largely due to the fact that it is so obscure and there are 7 bonus out takes(of only four different songs). A interesting history piece, but definately not their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and underpowered","review":"I already had a collection of wireless adapters, but seeing this product and its reviews made me think I could do better so I gave it a shot (Click above to see my reviews on some of my adapters).My first complaint is that it would not run on my laptop at all. I have XP SP2 and the setting the manual tells you to uncheck to enable the adapter is not present for some reason. The customer support section of the web site is just a copy of the manual I already had problems with.So I tried my desktop running XP that had never been on the internet and had no updates. Instalation was no problem and it was up in minutes.I tried connecting to various routers and even though percentage wise I seemed to have a good connection it took minutes to load google and longer for any other site.It felt like I was using a 14.4 modem to surf the web no matter which router I used.Appearance wise, if it matters, it's huge and clunky for a wireless adapter and hardly portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"This was a enjoyable light read.

I have always found the online reviews very useful in selecting romance novels---in this case I question whether or not we read the same book! I thought that the story moved at a snail's pace! Too much dull conversation! The storyline seemed to wander in many directions.

(This fact was not mentioned anywhere on the product's Amazon.com webpage when I ordered it or at the time I'm writing this.) While Kasey Chambers is totally a five star act, I can't give this album more than one star because any copy protection that penalizes legitimate buyers is absolutely ridiculous.Even if you don't own a Mac, you may want to pass on COPY CONTROLLED CDs as they supposedly won't work on other types of players as well, such as Microsoft's Xbox videogame console."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped workin within 20 days","review":"don't buy this watch. it stopped working with first 20 days :( ..along with that...its too bulky..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Product, bad delivery","review":"I purchased this the Elemis 6.8 oz gel because I believe its the best shaving product I have ever tried.

It was totally unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elemis Ice-Cool Foaming Shave Gel","review":"The gel works well and the cooling effect numbs your skin so shaving is less irritating. However, the compressed can has gone bad on me and the Elemis company will not replace an almost full can, nor will they of course refund my money.So beware! Maybe the non compressed tube would be your best option. I won't do business with the Elemis company so I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.....","review":"If you like humanoid sci-fi you'll like this book. On a planet not unlike our own, the reader is drawn into that age old struggle of how to preserve ones own culture when faced with an overwhelming tide of \\"others\\". And although set on a distant world, the dilemmas faced by its inhabitants hath a familiar ring.Truly a throwback to vintage science fiction. John W. Campbell, Jr. would have approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Scumbag!","review":"John Bramhall is a hatemonger of the lowest sort and \\"Deep Blue - A Novel of Racial Conflict\\" is the worst kind of racist propaganda.

Don't do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The great cost of enlightenment","review":"This book I found to be a difficult read. It says that this form of meditation needs to be taught to you, and it can eventually bring about world peace. Well, it neglects to say that it costs about $2,500 to do so. It also says that you cannot become enlightened unless you do nothing like business or run a household, so it is not for most people. How does the maharishi fit in here, being a man of business, if I am not mistaken?This is confusing. You already need a lot of excess cash to learn TM; where does this money go? If they think TM is the cure to the world's ills, then why not make it more accessible, ie. make it affordable to the masses? I would think David Lynch has the right idea; his foundation is making it available to school children. Perhaps these children will one day decide that no one owns TM and it should be taught to anyone wo wants it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science of being and art of living. Transendental. Meditation","review":"I became a TMer 5 months ago. After attending a few events with speakers and video tapes of the Maharishi, I wanted to know more about him and TM. Well, this book accurately mirrors the movement. Repleat with vague platitudes, confusing jargon and tautolological thinking this reader hungered for a few facts. To bolster the value of meditation -which basically is getting a mantra and meditating on it twice a day for 20 minutes- quantum physics are employed. The meissner effect is a springboard for the Maharishi effect which proports to insulate environments from negative forces by creating a positive protective force by a number of meditators practicing TM in unison. Natural Vedic law, yogic flying and a lot of hippie talk make this book a good advertisement for TM being cultish. I really wanted to swallow the koolaide but choked instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read it...","review":"...the less interested I am in it. This might not be a well-rounded review considering that I've only read the first 39 pages and skimmed through the rest. I was really turned off when the author specifically claims that TM cannot be achieved without an instructor (and for a costly price!). Although I did enjoy the discussion of reality of the relative world of the cosmos and the absolute world of being, I can tell that this book is not for most readers, as it can be a bit difficult to follow.I'd recommend reading other philosophical writings that have a higher degree against the test of times, such as the Tao te Ching, rather than this book which seems to be more of a path to a fluky scam rather than to a path of enlightenment. But some people need the approval of an \\"expert\\" when it comes to their progress in life, so they may be easily fooled by the Transcendental Meditation scheme.In a sentence, this book may be some well-written advice wrapped up in expensive packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be a fool","review":"I have two ferrets and have owned many over the last 20 years as beloved pets. You want to give them a treat, have them lick some peanut butter off your finger or give them a real piece of chicken or make them an omelet. Jerky treats are all over the news with recalls because some of them are coming out of China and packaged by companies you thought you can trust. Purina has two jerky treats recalled 1/9/13 after they knowingly were hurting and killing dogs for years. People were mailing and calling.Furthermore, don't feed ferrets Purina Kitten Chow.

I was looking forward to hearing an innovative electronic rock band like many others spawning from the Netherlands and the rest of Europe. I was most disapointed when I heard this countryish 'Train' style band which is all over the place in the U.S. today.

And, this mouthwash does make my teeth feel a little stronger - so I'm pleased so far. And, it's easy - yes!I guess you're supposed to try these products for a few weeks before you notice anything. I noticed a change immediately but it could be wishful thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR HOUSE LOVERS","review":"While this CD is good overall, I was mostly amazed with the second disk for tracks 4-11. I have not heard back to back hot tracks like they have in NYC Underground on the second disk. It's clean, consistent, BPM's are 133, and some of the best vocal house you will ever hear. In my collection of 200+ house CD's this is definitely in my top 10 and a must have. I bought the CD just for tracks 4-11 on the second disk, but I also bought it as many friends recommened it and I was not disappointed in any way. I probably would have paid double the price if I had to just to add this to my collection. This CD definitely represents great house tracks, and a lot of music you would hear in NYC back in 2006.

It fits snugly to the receiver and allows plenty of room to view the iron sites. The only thing is that the top rail to mount the scope is thicker then the rings that came with my Bushnell scope. I'm now looking for rings that will mount to this base. I figured the .22 caliber scope w/rings and this rail would have a matching pitch, but they don't. This is no fault of the rail, but if you buy this make sure you find rings that will mount to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like it's suppose too","review":"Mount this on my Ruger, you do need to turn it around so it will mount with one screw on the front and 2 screws to the rear.

Mounted easily to my 10/22 using the provided screws. I did use my own hex wrench due to the one that came with the rail was too small.

The plot is cryptic, and keeps you guessing until the very end. There are some vintage performances such as the young Gabriele Lavia, in the role of the dissolute, alcoholic artist who is yet capable of giving philosophical advice. Elements designed to curdle the blood include the child's song, which the killer repeats prior to each slaying, and a sadistic little girl who likes to dismember reptiles. This is a must-see movie for all Italian horror aficionados, and together with Suspiria has the greatest cult following of all of Argento's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim, compact, cool design, and great sound!","review":"This is a great portable CD player!

The cover does not do justice to the book. Many people may feel embarrased to read it in public because of the provacative cover, My husband included, but use a book jacket if you must.

I think the excess humidity tends to make the dough soggy and sticky when rolling out (even if starting with frozen dough), casuing me to compensate with too much flour and ultimately a tough crust. The pastry cloth is the best solution I've found for a non-stick surface that doesn't lead to excess flour incorporation.

The honesty, the clarity of thought,the freshness of language are the hallmarks of his writing. On this volume he goes over the top. The following example from a prayer entitled \\"Is This What It Means to Be Free?\\" will serve to intrigue: \\"Why is the marvel of a molecule of DNA its capacity to blunder into something new when we would have made it perfect, according to our Eden complex, except the molecules blundered their way into us first---or was that your \\"sort of\\" plan all the time, the blundering being a nudge toward an intentional choosing through the whole twisting way?\\"Imagine talking to God in such an honest and compelling way. Loder's God is one I want to know and share with others, for this God cares about EVERYTHING about us, receives our frustrations and meets us in the most extraordinary ways.A wonderful book.

I worked on stage production of this in Southern Oregon a number of years ago and I had also heard Judy Collins sing a couple of his songs.Not knowing french, I can't say much about the translations. But what they showed along with the songs was at times strange if not down right disturbing. The visuals presented in \\"Sons Of\\" were not at all what I would have expected. When I had heard Judy Collins sing this with her warmth and sincerity I had pictured something entirely different. I was actually quite glad that the visuals accompanying \\"If We Only Have Love\\" were relatively simple. That's a song I have always liked and I was delighted not to see it visually interpreted in some bizarre fashion as were some of the other songs.I think had they just shot this as a stage production or as an \\"in concert\\" format it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris","review":"This video is an insult to the work of Jacques Brel. The production is a dated and poorly produced representation of his poetry. I would much rather have seen the actual stage performance filmed than the collage of stage and second rate images presented in this DVD. I realize that the production reflects the thinking of the late 1960's and early 1970's of Hair and Godspell and this DVD is simply a reproduction of that period productioin, but as much as I like Brel's work, I doubt I will watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and amateurish","review":"Simply awful. An atrocious film.Jacques Brel is a relatively recent discovery of mine. After listening to the new off-Broadway CD, I sought out the old CD and DVD.

Heaven Sword & Dragon Sabre mentioned of the two famous warriors who were the owner of two famous weapons, and if you are a fans of Chinese martial arts comic, Legendary Couple is the best place to start the beginning of the story before you move on Heaven Sword & Dragon Sabre.

I'm a slow reader, and the story is a slow mover, and the two together make for a tedious read.For me the book was overly intellectual, there was not enough action or emotion. The story is so dry at times it's almost textbook like. Attention to detail is taken to the extreme, and often does nothing to further the plot lines or character development.I only read the first 120 pages, and I couldn't take it anymore and gave up. Several metaphysical concepts where introduced, such as lucid dreaming, and visions, and channeling, but I did not find the insights from these activities particularly enlightening in the book.The book is almost 500 pages, so maybe it gets better as it goes along.

It's based around some extensive past life regression sessions of those who were once Essenes and one of these was a well-known Biblical figure. So the book is historical in nature and gives us a lot of information, with many fascinating details of Essene life. In essence, they were nothing less than the support group for Jesus. However, it is the beautifully poetic spiritual words which come through from Daniel that, for me, make this one of the most wonderful New Age books that I have ever come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Essenes","review":"I'm still waiting for this book to arrive.

And sometimes despite less than perfect singing. But Mackerras' knowledge and insight always win through, unifying some very disparate elements in the cast.It's much the same story with this Idomeneo. The conductor is more dramatically pertient and better informed historically than even Harnoncourt and Gardiner. Alas, the central Idomeneo is sung by a young-sounding and colorless tenor. In no way does Ian Bostridge begin to suggest the complexity and stature of his role. The rest of the cast is well chosen, making his monotony of color and lack of ease with Italian seem more apparent.Is Idomeneo without the protagonist worth hearing? In this case, yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great recording, but..","review":"Listening to this recording i had the impression that Idomeneo is really a masterpiece. But i had some deceptions: Anthony Rolfh Johnson is borring and the charismatic Ian Bostridge sings beautifully but does'nt have the streght for the role. The orchestra plays very well and the recording is captured in excellent sound. Lorraine Hunt is excellent and Barbara Fritolli, moving, despite an excessive vibrato. This is a good recordng, but this opera demands much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possessing Your Inheritance","review":"I can't remember exactly how this book was listed, but it was not mentioned that there were notes in the first chapter...and underlining with pen.

It rolls whatever it needs to keep each player advancing bit by bit. I win over all about twice as often as the best opponent they have but am always very frustrated when it just starts rolling doubles at the end to get the desired outcome in score that it wants. I am equally if not more frustrated when it gives me a run of doubles to outplay my opponent. It can often take 20 rolls of the dice to get back into the game when the entry area has 4 open spaces to land on. I wish someone would come up with a decent Backgammon software package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dice rolls not random.","review":"This game has three difficulty levels, and after playing this game a lot, I have the opinion that the only thing making it more difficult at the higher two levels is that the dice rolls are not truly random and of course, it does not make a mistake. In a human to human backgammon game on the kitchen table, the rolls are going to be random and each human is going to make a few errors. This is a good way to get some practice if you are by yourself, but at the higher levels quickly becomes frustrating to win 1:10 and I do not think is worth more than $10. with shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good implemenation but poor AI","review":"This is a smart looking backgammon program, but the artificial intelligence is not very good, especially in doubling.

The violin play was mediocre, and did not showcase this musician's capabilities. The strength of her earlier two pop albums were in the strong foundation of classical music, brought up to date with modern instrumentation and rythm. She has left that foundation here and ventured into a wilderness. Vanessa Mae shows she is an excellent musical technician, not a composer. The sound of this album relies heavily on pop echoes of the seventies disco era, without the underlying edginess and tension that gave that music it's attraction.Vanessa Mae should return to her roots. If this had been my first exposure to her, I wouldn't have looked further, and not been exposed to her better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Although I'm a fan of her other works, I found this album extraordinarily flat and unexciting. The music is mostly trite, with little energy or passion, and much of it sounds like it was turned out on a cheap keyboard synthesizer. Most disappointing of all, the focus here is not on her violin work, which is sometimes hard to pick out-- if it's there at all -- but on vocals and other pieces which are pleasant in their own way...but not what you buy a Vanessa Mae album for. Pleasant background music, inoffensive, but with none of the spark that makes her other albums so great, and many pieces that are little more than violin-assisted disco"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Most Americans would respond \\"Vanessa who?\\" to the mention of Vanessa Mae. I very much enjoy both her classical music and her self invented \\"Techno Acoustic Fusion\\" or Technofusion. I like Subject to Change as much as her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE STORM LEFT OFF..","review":"Quite simply, Mae's latest album takes off where her last one left off. She makes you wonder why rock and roll is associated with guitars, not violins.Once again, she weds a dizzying array of synthesized and generated sounds with violin playing of great warmth and dazzling virtousity. Expect beat-driven songs that combine her spiffy ability at the strings with various subgenres, as well as softer, more introspective pieces. The arrangements are classy as usual, and together with the well produced combinational elements, make for an entertaining album.Caveat: it may get a little monotonous, but if you enjoyed Storm you will likely find something on Subject To Change to keep you interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this book again.","review":"My review will be short and to the point.

The research that goes into each one is truly amazing and this one is no different. In this book Benjamin and his bride Rose go down to Mexico to rescue their friend Hannibal who has been accused of murdering the son of his paramour's father. Once there they are thrown into dangerous intrigue and sadistic cruelty. Ben and Rose have never seen a family quite like Don Prospero's. And it appears that Hannibal did indeed kill the Don's son since no one else could have poisoned him, but Ben knows that Hannibal is incapable of murder and he and Rose set out to prove his innocence at no small risk to themselves. This was a good book and a good mystery, but I missed the New Orleans backdrop since all the book's action occurs in Mexico. Ms. Hambly is a master-storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I loved the Benjamin January series. This one just didn't deliver the story or the characters that I expected. I couldn't relate to any of the characters and kept waiting for the story to pick up. Sad, because I was so looking forward to another story from Barbara Hambly. I think that perhaps it was that it was missing so many of the regular characters that have made up her previous stories and that it was set in old Mexico and didn't seem to have the mystery or romance of the earlier books.Next time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get through it","review":"The reason I can't give stars is because I didn't read the book. I love this series. I love the characters and the history and New Orleans and the writing. And I thought I could get on board in Mexico- especially because it was set during the whole day of the dead festivities but I lost interest within 30 pages. I'm sure it's not the book or the story but I started to lose big interest when all these relatives of the Soprano started to get introduced. I just did not care about them and didn't want to meet them.

Shirley Maclaine not only teaches us about the Camino but takes us on an inner journey in search of universal truth, self-discovery and self-realization. Her poetic writing is the icing on the cake: \\"Life on earth is somewhere between feeling liberated and deprived. Like a harp string-if it is too tight, it won't play, if it is too loose, it hangs. The tension that produces the beautiful sound lies in the middle ... The earth mother is our link to who we are as her spiritual children. And as her inhabitants, our balance and harmony will insure hers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"camino review","review":"I, too, have walked the camino, but Shirley MacLaine's descriptions made it very difficult to recognise. I can hardly believe we walked the same paths.I was very disappointed in this book - but have to admit she has a wonderful imagination. I didnt really expect to read more about her dreams than the camino itself. Sadly she made little mention of her arrival in Santiago de Compostela and I did get bored with obsession with the photographers hounding her.I wouldnt give this book any stars, given the option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I have read other Shirley MacLaine books but this one was by far the most bizarre. I found myself skipping the parts where she is communing with people from a past life and going to the sections where she is talking about the camino and her current experiences on it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I finished it only to see if she actually finished the camino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley's Journey","review":"I loved reading this book and getting an a look at what it is like to walk the Santiago de Camino. Although one needs to dismiss the parts where Shirley is trying to avoid the photographers and reporters. I wonder if she may have missed something that she could have gathered from the walk by focusing, worrying, plotting and planning to avoid the paparazzi.One may find it a bit difficult to wrap your mind around when she talks about her dreams where John the Scot tells her about Adam and Eve, the Temple of Learning, the Lemurian civilization as well as the Altantean civilization, how the Great Spirit created soul mates and how the separation occurs.Overall it was an enjoyable read and good insight into the experience of the walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"She lost the point of the Camino","review":"The author completely lost the point of El Camino. This pilgrimage, about 1000 years old, is a Christian Catholic route. I have made the pilgrimage myself last year. All the teachings and stops during the way confirm the validity of the teachings in the Bible, and they are very different from the things MacLaine describes as her findings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I TOO HAVE DONE CAMINO & MORE","review":"MS.

Shirley, Thanks for the great book and sharing the Camino with us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's a good storyteller...","review":"Especially when she's interjecting incidents having to do with her celebrity. I wonder if these books would be as much fun if she weren't, after all, her.However, I do love this woman and find her stories a lot of fun and I have learned a lot about the world from her.In the long run, Shirley MacLaine is one of the world's best travel writers - a journeywoman of mind, body and spirit. Wherever you are, Shirley (and it is likely you're right around the corner from me, even as I write) here's a big hug and thanks for your gift of another enjoyable adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...do not buy","review":"Shirley MacLaine combines Christianity, with modern chakra, astrology, and other doubtful ingredients, producing a sickening mixture of new-age garbage. Besides being semi-religious pulp, this book gives us a completely unjust and incorrect impression of Spain, the beauty of the Camino, and the people that undertake this journey.There are many good books about the Camino of Santiago like El Peregrino from Paolo Coelho, and The pilgrimage Road to Santiago, by David. M. Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mac Laine devotees only.","review":"Hmmm? Let's see. Past Life Regression, Lucid Dreaming, Chakra Balancing, Guardian Angels, Lemuria, Atlantis, Soul Mates, Extra Terrestrials and what have I forgotten?Oh Shirley, I love you dearly but please stay out of those metaphysical bookstores!This book is strictly for Mac Laine devotees only. Everybody else can just sit on a park bench and wait for a crazy person to walk up and start talking to them. It's the same experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Shirley MacLaine is ever the entertainer in recalling her trek across Spain on the Camino. The physical descriptions about her voyage are inspiring, and her determination to succeed in completing the journey is admirable.The most interesting part of the book for me was the journey itself. It succeeds in making you want to try it yourself if you have a month to spare.The spiritual aspect of the book is thought provoking, if nothing else. Shirley doesn't withhold and for some, I'm sure it's a little bit hard to digest, but you have to admire her honesty.I thought the ending would have been more glorious. I would like to have seen a moment when she paused and reflected at the end of her journey, but instead she rushed through it like it was something to get over. All in all, it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't encourage her...","review":"I have biked the camino three times. I know the camino. Believe me, Ms. MacLaine does not know the camino. Ms. MacLaine knows a lot about Ms. MacLaine and that is what she writes about. Her tale is extremely self-absorbed and has little about hiking in Northern Spain. If you want to read about hocus-pocus as experienced by Shirley, you may enjoy the book. If you want insight and planning information about El Camino de Santiago de Compostela, you will hate this book, as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is fiction, right?","review":"Because if it's not, it should me. Total waste of time for anyone looking to read a good travel memoir. You'd be better off reading Twilight. Frankly, I'm pretty surprised this book is rated 4 stars.Amazon, can I please get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read unless you love Shirley MacLaine","review":"Having done the camino myself I was eager to read this book. I am not a Shirley MacLaine fan, and I admire her for setting out to do this ardous juouney at her age. I found she shared too little about the actual journey and plenty about her inner journey. This is fine if you can imagine and believe all she believes. I can't. I personally hated the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd","review":"This is another wierd book by Shirley MacLaine: it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shirley MacLaine walking the hardship","review":"I like Shirley and have all her books. This one? No sir! It is a nice attempt on her part trying to pilgrimage among those not quite normal people she encounters on the ancient path of the Camino in Spain. Yes, I agree with her, dogs are dreadful creatures, but she doesn't realize how decadent man's best friend is. Would wolves have attacked or frightened her? No. The wolf is peaceful, quiet, respects man, has psychic dignity. The movie \\"The Mexican\\" shows Oscar winning superstars sitting on toilets. On the Camino you can find that too. Of course girls pull down their pants to \\"make water\\", even while on the Holy Pilgrimage, as all the girls who pilgrimaged before in history. Oh, Shirley! It was obviously a bit too hard for you, but you did it, anyway! Gerborg..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Poorly written (maybe she just needs a better, more attentive editor?), this book is at least half about MacLaine's own hallucinations or visions or whatever. I read the book because am interested in possibly walking the Camino de Santiago, and only a portion of the book really described what that was like for her. Also, I found it hard to believe some of what she wrote; e.g., \\"I ate very little, only dried fruits, nuts and yogurt\\") Come on!! When you spend ten hours a day walking, it's not possible to subsist on that little food. Then in one chapter, she says she'll never see her friends, Ali & Carlos, again, only they reappear a couple of chapters later, then again she says she'll never see them again.At the end, MacLaine reports that she immediately flies back to the U.S. -- I didn't understand that, either. After walking all that time, why not spend a few days relaxing in Santiago de Compostela? She said she got on the plane, basically smelling like a goat. Nonsensical stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Camino: A Journey of the Spirit","review":"Shirley MacLaine is a gifted and outstanding writer as well as a fine actress. The insites she shares with us in The Camino are very insiteful and intriguing. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiritual Journey","review":"I really enjoyed the story of Shirley's trek. I have to admit I was more interested in the details of the Camino itself, then her discussion of her past lives and metaphysical experiences. Her storytelling kept me interested throughout the whole book except for chapter 15 where she really gets into the whole past lives thing. Don't get me wrong, I am open to reading and hearing about it but a whole chapter was more than I could handle. Overall, I really enjoyed this book! Shirley's account of her daily experiences on the Camino and her spiritual journey were inspiring. Reading this book has really sparked my interest about learning more about the Camino."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Camino: A Journey of the Spirit","review":"This book, like all of Shirley's, is fast paced, exciting and hard to put down. She shares her spiritual insights on herself, delving into pastlife connections brought up while walking the notorious El Camino along with fellow travellers also making the pilgrimage. My one problem with the book is that it relies heavily on Shirley's dreams she had while on her trek. They are vivid and detailed, dreams that I am sure most of the readers cannot relate to, as I doubt if most people remember their dreams in such a glorious, exacting manner. Therein the validity of the book lies, are they spectacular \\"real\\" dreams induced by a spiritual state while walking the Camino, or are they, simply, dreams?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"After reading this book as the monthly selection for our book group, I must say that I have never before read a book where I felt like I had been so \\"had\\". This drivel would not have made it past the first reading at the publisher's if the author had not been a celebrity. If you are seeking any information about the Camino, this is not the book you are looking for.Looking for stories about former lives spent in Atlantis, or visits by extraterrestials? That's about all you'll find here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley's Experience of the Camino","review":"I have enjoyed all of Shirley Maclaine's books. I appreciate that she is so candid with her beliefs and experiences. I listened to the audio version of \\"the Camino\\" and really loved hearing her tell her own story.Her experiences are very far out and may be found to be a little too much for some readers. However, if you are a seeker of spiritual truth from a metaphysical point you will be captivated.If you are looking for a down to earth story on a pilgrimage then this is not for you. However if you like Shirley Maclaines witt, intelligence, and openess, AND you are open to consider all possibilites, then you may very well enjoy this book.I also recommend \\"Circle of Tears\\" by Jeanne Marie Antoinette"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read also Paulo Coelho's pilgrimage and hit the road","review":"An interesting book, that will be criticized by pilgrims who believe that El Camino belong to the choosen ones. I suggest to complement the reading with \\"The Pilgrimage\\", by Paulo Coelho, and then go and do it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley still amazes!","review":"Once again Shirley MacLaine has taken the reader upon a perilous and mystical journey. Filled with fabulous insights and humor, this senior citizen proves that there are still adventures and worlds to explore. It is wonderful to see the fire burning just as bright in her as it had in Out on a limb. Shirley continues to be a remarkable soul and a light on any trail she ventures upon. As for those who don't agree with her mystical adventures, remember that this is her journey, not yours. You don't have to agree because what is true in her experience is just that: It's her experience! Just read the book with an open mind and allow yourself to be swept upon your own Camino Walk.

Luckily no one else bothered to read it.As collections of refuse go, it is quite the production.We only have three more dreadful years left. I am sure that Aman Verjee has already begun his latest venture into political fiction.

As others have said her voice, as every other singer out there, had pros and cons. She was NOT a contralto (go listen to Marian Anderson or Kathleen Ferrier, for goodness'sake). What did happen is that a) she lost a lot of weight at one point because of personal life (Onassis), which is not neutral on the voice. And b) she sang probably too frequently, and often roles requiring very different qualities, which is why her career did not indeed last as long as some other singers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"attacks, attacks by jealous Callas fans","review":"If you're a Sutherland we can't have this constant bashing. Bel Canto is beautiful singing. To qualify, you have to have a beautiful voice. Sutherland has the voice of the Century. Some call the most beautiful technique. And she is matched by Horne. What does the Callas set have? Mono sound of rediclous sonics. A voice that chokes even on Gs. No coloratura ability. And she hs a terrible Adagisa.Hands down, this is the best Norma. I know, I'm a voice student and I know the human voice. As for the drama. Bellini wrote the drama into the music. If you sing it stupendously, you are Norma. Horrid ventures of shouting like Callas is never bel canto. She is nothing next to Sutherland. Read the reviews and listn to this Norma. It is the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sutherland, Bellini would be ashamed of you!!!","review":"Sutherland's diction is horrible. Her voice is droopy. Her phrasing is poor. Her drama is nearly non-existent. Her interpolated high notes unfairly hijack this opera from the other singers. Where is Sills' studio \\"Norma\\" with Shirley Verrett when you need it? I hope EMI releases it on CD very soon.Also, everyone keeps ranting about how Sutherland and Horne sing everything in the original keys. Keep in mind that the tones have gone up one full tone since Bellini's time. So today's key of F has the same tessitura as the key of G in Bellini's time. That means that both Callas and Caball��, singing \\"Casta diva\\" in today's key of F, are actually singing the aria in its ORIGINAL TESSITURA. This means that Sutherland and Horne are actually singing ABOVE the original keys (tessituras). It is wrong of them to show off like that. Upward transpositions done to show off one's singing technique are just signs of lacking taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for MOney","review":"I advise you to buy the Decca Collectors' set which features 4 Bellini operas made by Sutherland in 1960s.

The Math review was particularly helpful in brushing up mathematical concepts and relationships. The numerous questions slowly develop a feel for the exam and with it, more confidence. I suggest getting the book and the software (which comes separately). I used the book to review concepts and go through the questions slowly, this built answering strategies. I then used the software to simulate exam conditions which built speed and accuracy. It was the perfect combination.

I will be purchasing it to add to my collection. It's Very well written and a true life story. If you enjoy history (how people lived before this day & age) or outdoors you'll enjoy this book! Would recommend for anyone around age 10 & up. Tells how they lived in a very rural area of Southeast Alaska where boat was your main way of transportation. They hunted, trapped & fished to provide food for themselves & to sell to make living. Their experiences through all this give you a very real idea of what it would have been like. I think this took place in the 1940's-1950's, but I don't remember for sure. Some of the expiences have some humor in them too. This book talks about a mailboat coming with mail & goods...there is also a book out about that specific mailboat called \\"In the Wake of an Alaskan Mailboat\\" by Dennis Sperl, also a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"If you enjoy reading Alaskana books, then this is a great one to add to your collection.

Then I discovered \\"Made in Malaysia\\" conveniently hidden under the Amazon inventory tracking label.As for quality and precision, the laser dot has a distracting series of three concentric arches emanating above and below it as well as several dashed lines to each side that are clearly out of level.

It is great to have an official warmup before performing and this one only taeks 15 minutes to go through if you do each exercise once.The flaw is the range that is covered on the CD. It has a male and female part. I wanted something that had a bit more on the lower range (for men) and a bit more in the upper, so I just figured out the exercises, extended the range, and now play them myself on my guitar to warm up.

I can't believe the authors really wrote this book. I wanted to give up a few pages into the reading but since I had spent my money (unwisely) on buying one instead of (wisely) renting it, I plowed through to the end. The dialogues are laughably artificial, the plot is moronic, and the cliches make the reading pure torture. Please avoid this book like the plague. Spend your time and money elsewhere.

But the book jacket was as deep as this book got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading the same book?","review":"I really wanted to like this book, as I love biblical tales, especially from the Old Testament. But I found this book to be dull, dragging. And the error of Isaac dying before Jacob returned to his homeland was a little too blatant, and I couldn't get passed it. Another thing, is even though I think the author did do a good job of giving us a perspective of what it was like to live back then, there were parts that I felt were a little to PC for me. For example when Jacob slaps Leah, and then thinks to himself how much he HATES the custom of hitting women. It just strikes as unnecessary to establish the idea that even though Jacob slaps his wife, he really doesn't like the custom.Another thing about the novel was that I just didn't find it all that gripping. It flowed along fine, but unfortunately it didn't make me want to stay up passed by bed time and continue reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"more great stuff from angola","review":"If you liked the LuakaBop compilation _Telling Stories tothe Sea_, you will love this compilation.

There are some other films on global warming that cost no more or even less than this one and which are are much better. From the title \\"60 Minutes--The Age of Warming\\" I thought it would be an hour long. I did not read the additional data that said the running time is 12 minutes.

One is challenged to tell a deeper level of truth about one's own motivations and to see one's present level of maturity. The path is laid out clearly, and the steps from naive ignorance to conscious participation and service are reflective of the way offered by the great spiritual traditions. This book is not for those who want to play with Tarot, but for those who want to genuinely use this brilliant tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just keep telling yourself it's the inside that counts","review":"It's the Bible, and the only English version of the Bible that's TRUE to some of the oldest, trust translations in our tongue. The facsimile is absolutely gorgeous, and it feels like you're taking a step back in time every time you open the covers. However, the actual outside of the Bible is what gets to me. The front cover is stamped with HUGE 48-point font HOLY BIBLE 1611 EDITION etcetera... This doesn't really match with the historical feel of what's inside. But overall this is my new favorite Bible and something I'm sure people at my church will love to see (since finding Bibles with the Apocrypha is quite difficult but they are the standard in the Episcopal Church)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just another Crucible","review":"While being a well researched book about Salem, this novel goes much further than a simple re-hash of the witchtrials. It examines women's issues, interpersonal power struggles, and takes a closer look at elements of religious fundamentalism.The main character starts out quite naive and wide eyed and is swept up in the Puritan movement, later finding herself disillusioned and eventually persecuted when she decides to break away. There are a few typos, as is the case with some pod imprints, but nothing worth passing on the content for.I recommend it for anyone who enjoys women's literature, or the sort of historical fiction that really makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"WITCH -- a bit disappointing","review":"After waiting a long time for this book to become available on a book-trading website, scouring the used bookstores for it, and combing the library catalog, I finally broke down and bought a new copy. I read about 20 pages and realized I was forcing myself to go on. It wasn't particularly entertaining or enlightening, in fact those 20 pages were pretty boring.

I've lived in Salem, MA and seen ridiculous displays of foolery, and this fits right in with the rest of the kitsch. A useless waste of time for any reader older than 10.Also, the author spent a bit of time living in Seattle, where the first five-star review hails from; anyone want to bet they know one another?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Helpful Book","review":"I purchased this book before I started law school as a primer to help give me an idea of what to expect. I found the book to be honest and helpful as an incoming student. I think the book would have been more helpful if I hadn't chosen a school already, but the advice in the book is good for any school. I can tell you law school is stressful and time consuming. I found a lot of my female friends shocked by the competitive environment which is something this book can help you prepare for. Overall, it was very helpful and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't treat me like a child!","review":"I only got through the first few chapters of the book before I was so OFFENDED I had to stop. The author clearly believes she is speaking to an immature and unintelligent audience. This is what cinched it for me:\\"At lower status law schools, the students of both genders are often the first generation of their families to get a higher education, and even a modest middle-class life seems good to them\\" (14). Why beat up your readers, Hirshman? I happen to be a first generation law student who is very displeased with the attitude of the book. I do not reccomend this for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic thesis","review":"This book explains how to choose a law school if you are a feminist who wants to go where no one will challenge your views. Hirshman seems to believe that feminist principles will crumble if exposed to any criticism, so she encourages people to choose schools that have lots of feminists, do not have any conservatives (and preferably not many men), and that will never question feminist beliefs. The problem is, lots of people say that the purpose of law school is to have your ideas challenged, and to face and overcome those challenges. Will Hirshman's approach train feminsists who like law school, but aren't very good lawyers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"drifts into fantasy?","review":"I would have agreed with the earlier review about this book merely being incredibly badly written, until I got near the end. Having read everything written about Carlos Hathcock, I found Gibbore's claim to have killed a VC sniper by putting a round right through his scope as, to put it kindly, not believable. Gibbore wants to go Hathcock one better, by having done it at night using a starlight scope. I simply don't buy it. This book is NOT a \\"keeper\\". I truly don't know if the whole book is fiction, or he just lost it near the end, or even if I'm wrong and his story is absolutely true.

I shouldn't have been. It's pedantic, repetitive, and very, very poorly written. (I suspect it was never critically edited.) As you read, your mind is constantly offended by truely awful writing and grammer. Mr. Gibbore admits he is poorly educated, so why hasn't someone worked with him in the publication of his story? How could a publisher actually go to press with such literary junk? Gibbore is probably a nice guy who did a great deal for our soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam; however, in my estimation, a writer -- he ain't. The only book that competes with him for top ranking in the Most Poorly Written class is Grandfather's Tale -- the story of a German sniper in W.W.II. Don't buy either one!

It isn't difficult to understand but you could feel like you are in a lecture.Two - This turned out to be a big plus for me. About 1/3 into the book I realized that I needed to have a better understanding of the teachings of St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila. I had previously stayed away from their writing. What a mistake! I would recommend an introductory book on their teachings. For me this was Fr. DuBay's Fire Within. Fr.

Not only that, she was six feet tall and unusually athletic for nineteenth-century women. Ironically, she tended to be sickly as a child, so her doctor prescribed being in the outdoors as a cure. Cornelia discovered she loved to hunt and fish in the Maine woods.

Includes the #1 hits (I'm A Believer, Last Train to Clarkesville & Daydream Believer), top 10 smashes (A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You, Valerie & Pleasant Valley Sunday), a couple of latter day songs (That Was Then, This Is Now & Heart & Soul) & a good sampling of fan favorites (Goin' Down, Mary, Mary, Listen to the Band, Steppin' Stone & Words).In addition to the Monkees completeist this collection is definitely for those looking for what is, more or less, their top 20 songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The Monkees singles, were for the most part not very good. Their LP cuts (particuliarly the Nesmith tunes) were often EXCELLENT however. The Monkees anthology is a much better collection, and a fan would be wise to get that and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD for starters","review":"This CD contains all of the hits, and some of the singles that weren't added onto the reissued albums as extras. Unfortunately, The Monkees had too many good songs to fit onto one CD. This CD is especially good for new Monkees fans that want to hear the hits. It's also good for the casual listener that just wants the hit songs. However, one CD can't show you how diverse and wonderful The Monkees songs really were. This is a great CD for any fans on 60's pop music, and if you enjoy this, you should look into getting other Monkees CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkeyshines--sort of","review":"Anyone who has a modicum of interest in The Monkees should consider buying this album. There are a number of really good tracks on this disc including \\"Goin' Down\\", \\"Randy Scouse Git\\", \\"Words\\" and \\"Listen to the Band\\" to name just a few.Unfortunately, there are also a few duds on here that keep this disc from being a first-rate compilation. Rhino would've done well to omit \\"D.W. Washburn\\" and \\"Porpoise Song\\" as these songs signal the beginning of the end for The Monkees and are otherwise forgettable pieces. Ditto for \\"That Was Then, This Is Now.\\" Instead, Rhino should've included lesser known but far better material like \\"Teardrop City\\" or \\"Man Without A Dream\\".Despite these minor weaknesses, this is album is definitely worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"We ordered this CD with the hope of enjoying the titles listed and being able to download them to our MP3 player.

Firstly, there was no CD or DVD with the solutions worked out on it like the book says it has. Secondly, all these pages were low quality xerox copy, black and white reproductions of the real textbook. All the graphics were washed out, like when you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy on an old xerox machine. Many random pages were loose, which I didn't find until I got to that page in the middle of the book. All in all, this is what I would expect to see if they had counterfeit textbooks. Oh, and the textbook itself was VERY poorly written; even if I had bought a regular quality printing, all the English was so awkwardly written that I spent most of my time trying to figure out what the guy was trying to write instead of working problems. Only use this book if your class has homework out of it; otherwise go with another, more literate writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess Vancouver rocks, the rest is Limp","review":"Princess Vancouver is the one exceptional song on this CD. It builds up nicely to some rhythm and power. Another reviewer used the word \\"jangly\\" in regard to this CD, I'll use it but not as a compliment. The rest of the songs jangle like keys on a chain, making an occasional sound as they move up and down but do not really go anywhere. Ask Us to Dance and Sugar Witch are decent, the rest of this CD is limp, even when the music picks up the vocals (both male and female) are stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent indie rock masterpiece.","review":"Morning Spy's The Silver Age is even better than 2004's Subsequent Light, and that is saying something. The band's creative indie pop covers everything from 70's glam to chamber pop to jangly-fuzz-folk (I made that one up). This a \\"magnus opus\\" for the band, and songwriting, musicianship and range is far above your average indie band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it as a Layman","review":"Very interesting and detailed look at the routes taken, the acts, and influences left behind by this historically powerful figure who left such and indelible mark. He also died at only age 33.Although brutal, he was an adventurous traveler and enjoyed the many delights of wine, women & song. Michael Wood provides and ample supply of photos and maps to detail the routes he and Alexander took. I am not a historian, so I can't corroborate all the details for accuracy. As a history laymen I can say I enjoyed what I read and I admit my lack of knowledge in this area. For those interested in the area, I think you may find it worth reading, and then you can take what you want from that point on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading, and very entertaining","review":"I have to say that this is great work. I feel more younger people should read this (and watch the video series) and get a better understanding of the size of Alexander's expedition and accomplishments..... The ancient Greeks did consider the Macedonians as a Greek tribe. Some people like to point to Demosthenes' Phillipic speeches as proof of the \\"barbarian\\" attitude of the Greeks toward the Macedonians. That's misleading. Demosthenes was deathly afraid of the loss of Athenian supremacy and power if Phillip became the leader of the unified Greek states. Other Athenian politicians did not see him that way. Political rivalries were not anything new to the politically independent ancient Greeks. A closer look at Arrian and Plutarch indicates very well how these ancient historians viewed the Macedonians as Greek.Anyway, this is good work. Bravo to Mr. Wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Woods Rules!","review":"I teach Global History and Studies. As a teacher, I used over and over Woods excellent series Legacy.

The video is incredible and this book is a very useful companion. The book is good, i use parts of it in class...however If you have not seen all the parts of the Video, you must. He is crazy. Woods is a great historian who is also fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate, historically incorrect.","review":"It is disappointing indeed to read history from people who are not historians. This book is an inaccurate work, one-sided and definitely not recommended for a person who is interested in Greek history. Alexander was a great general and a \\"cosmopolitan\\" who first implemented the vision of globalization. It is sad to read wrong interpretations and poor descriptions for the life of a great man who carried a great civilization to the world. I would advise Mr. Wood to study Greek history from some great historians before attempting such a work. But I understand that this is a trend of our times, to stuff the reader with thrill and violence, neglecting or masking historical truth. It is easier and sells better, I agree. But I personally dislike this style and would thus recommend the conscious reader to definitely avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor.","review":"If you pick this up, don't expect any in-depth or informative analysis of Alexander's life, conquests, tactics, motives or personality; expect a Junior High School reading-level synopsis of the route traveled by Alexander's army with brief, sporadic, uncohesive glimpses of major events along the way. The pictures add a bit of life to dehydratated and uninspired prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lapses in Historical Accuracy","review":"I also agree that this book is one-sided for Wood had created serious lapses in historical accuracy. It is simply incorrect to call Alexander or his Macedonian army \\"Greek\\", when the ancient Greek and Roman historians made a clear distinction between the Greek and Macedonian nations. Alexander was known as Macedonian and had never been called \\"Greek\\" in any ancient text, and Wood should have represented him for what he was. Instead he left an inaccurate portrait of the famous conqueror ascribing him a false ethnicity and identity for which he was also sharply criticized by Archaeology in 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Title and Serious Lapses in Historical Accuracy","review":"Wood had created serious lapses in historical accuracy. Alexander's journey wasn't from \\"Greece to Asia\\" as Wood puts it in his title, but from Macedonia to Asia. Non of the ancient historians wrote that the Macedonians left from Greece to counquer the world, but from Pella, Macedonia. It is simply incorrect to call Alexander or his Macedonian army \\"Greek\\", when the ancient Greek and Roman historians made a clear distinction between the Greek and Macedonian nations. Alexander was known as Macedonian and had never been called \\"Greek\\", not in one single ancient text, and Wood should have represented him for what he was.

The camera is terrible and always finds a bad place to settle to. The dungeons are very repetitive and dull. In fact, it is impossible to tell one part of a dungeon from another or how far you have left to go in any of them. And very often, after one of the countless dungeon battles, you will be unable to tell which way you were going beforehand. So you'll end up spending an hour walking back to the entrance, only to have to turn around and go back the right way.

This is most definatly not meant to imply that there's nothing on here for the Maroon or Stunt lover- \\"Testing 1,2,3\\" and \\"War on Drugs\\" are each in the same vein as earlier songs. It's also worth noting that this album stays true to the Steven Page tradition of lyrical brilliance- \\"War on Drugs\\" in particular has a solid lyrical arrangement that I personally found very moving. All and all, this is a great album, and is only losing the 5th star because I disliked \\"Have You Seen My Love\\" and \\"For You\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling on name alone","review":"Since BNL can now sell records on name alone, they obviously decided to put little effort into their newest cd. The songwriting is god-awful and there are simply no cathcy tunes that usually come from this band.

Let's hope the next one makes up for this lame-o."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the true fan","review":"almost a five but i felt the album was missing something. i was looking for the one or two songs that were along the lines of \\"call and answer\\", something slow and dramatic. overall its a great cd, my personal favorites are aluminum, war on drugs, and celebrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"BNL have never sounded better","review":"I keep trying to put this CD aside, so I can let my car's CD player play something else, but it's no use. Each time I listen and re-listen I get further hooked on these songs, these lyrics, the outstanding production quality, and the melodies that I just can't stop singing to myself. I've been into BNL since \\"Gordon\\" came out, and I think this is as fine a group of songs as they have assembled on any album. Among the highlights: \\"Celebrity\\" is smart, \\"Maybe Katie\\" is infectious, \\"Another Postcard\\" is classic BNL goofiness with another \\"how does Ed rap like that\\" hook. Steven Page's delivery will break your heart on \\"War on Drugs\\", and \\"Unfinished\\" is heavenly in its Beach Boys type harmonies and countermelodies.

Their \\"intelligent but lite\\" style has given way to just plain silliness, with endless repetitions of mildly catchy choruses that compel you to slap the \\"next\\" button on the CD player.

This fine Canadian band consistently puts out fine recordings without making their fans wait terribly long for new material.The melodies from this fine band are very ear friendly with sophisticated pop stylings. Next Time to my ears is the best tune on this collection with its fine instrumental arrangements, super harmony vocals, and strong song structure. Shopping is another cute tune making fun of materialistic people. Second Best is a good driving rocker and Testing 1,2,3 has some noteworthy harmonies and lyrics.Some of the musical arrangements are less varied than on Stunt and even Maroon. Also some of the songs are a little similar to recordings on these aforementioned CD's. Nonetheless that is not such a bad thing as these two CD's were very good recordings. A little more growth would be nice. However, this is very good music with a nice touch of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"Classic BNL!

While some of the songs show some of their best work there are some songs that just dont cut it. In a way, I feel you have to be a long time fan to really enjoy this album. For example the song shopping. To the casual listener this is a horrible song. For me though, this is classic BNL. Random and funny. Same thing happens with Take it Outside. This song is better \\"music\\" than shopping but still a stupid song, but to me I think its great, \\"Who'd want to get their lights knocked out\\" The rest of this album is fairly solid, celebrity is great, maybe katie complements celebrity well. Testing 1,2,3 is my favorite. My advice, if you are a bnl fan get this, it is good..if u aren't a long time fan get a different album to get your first impression.

I have been a BNL fan since I first heard Gordon in the fall of 1992, and can remember going to see them in small theaters (which they could not sell out)in and around surburban D-town far before MYSD was even released. That being said, there is only one word to discribe this album, and that word is awful. We have all at one point or another heard one somewhat catchy single on the radio that causes us to get an album, only to soon discover you spent $15 for that single and 14 other terrible songs. Don't let it happen again. Let a friend buy it first, or use 'other ways' of evaluating the album before you spend a dime on it. I hate to say it, but charging money for albums like this is what lead to the boom in file sharing. Honestly, if the RIAA were to listen to this album it might actually realize that sales are down not only because of downloading, but are also due to bands releasing this type of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Barenaked nation will be very happy!","review":"I have to be honest, I don't have the CD yet BUT I did see BNL a couple of weeks ago and they played two of the songs and last night they did most of the songs on a live show on the radio station I listen to. Of course, they have their satirical songs like Another Postcard (which is so much fun). I really enjoyed the songs \\"Shopping\\", \\"Maybe Katie\\", and \\"Celebrity\\".

When I asked him how he liked his gift, he told me I would have to listen to it for myself. While, some of the songs on this CD are catchy,I can't describe any of them as enjoyable. The music sounded cheap, the words mudane and boring. I feel like the whole album was a project in being cute and clever, which is no crime. However, I felt that the true quality of past BNL albums was compromised in an effort to be too cute and their trademark cleverness just ended up being silly. So, unless you are a diehard fan, I wouldn't recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down","review":"Despite initial disapointment I forced myself to give this album repeated listens in the hope that it would gradually grow in my estimations to something approaching the high regard that I hold the rest of the BNL catalogue in. Sadly the more I heard it the less I liked it. Only \\"Aluminium\\" comes close to anything that they've released in the past and if \\"War on Drugs\\" didn't grab you the first time then repeated listens only make it more embarassing. Taken as a whole it sounds like a band trying to recapture a formula that worked so well in the past but lacking the creative energy to pull it off. Hopefully E2E serves as a signal that a rethink is underway in the band's camp and future releases will be up to the standard they set with their debut and rarely dropped away from.Still, at least it's better than the unspeakable Christmas effort that followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSICAL BRAINS !","review":"This CD is the perfect example of mature POP music !Yes there is more to POP music than fluffy lyrics, a strong hook, a massive beat and a video with lots of spandex and a bleached blonde with a studded navel!BARENAKED LADIES, \\"the Average-Jo boy band\\" from Canada demonstrate that a successful POP CD can consist of intelligent pop songs.Their musical style becomes more solid on this effort as they create songs that make you think!Fans of the current pop trash (Britney, Christina, Clay; still trying to figure if he is a male or female artist) will not appreciate the subtext and musical undertones to this release.However, this release is one for a serious collector.

The DVD includes videos of all the acoustic songs, other videos, 5.1 stereo versions of all the songs, and the song \\"Yes! Yes!! Yes!!! It is worth the extra money.

This record is just weak. Don't get me wrong, there's some great songs here [\\"Celebrity\\", \\"War On Drugs\\", \\"Aluminum\\"], but most of it [particularly \\"Another Postcard\\" and 'Shopping\\"] is just embarrasing. I've always enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek side of BNL, but the jokes on this album are far too blatant. Rather than finding the perfect balance, BNL put too much emphasis on humor and too little on songwriting, and the songwriting is where they really shine.

This cd's best tunes are typical of the average BNL cd songs while the harder edge pop/rock hits are absent.

It is fully adjustable, even to a 29-inch waist like mine or a 43-inch like my friend's. Whoever says 12-gauge shells don't fit is crazy; it's tight on purpose since the only thing holding shells in an elastic belt is friction. Idiots!

The belt is long, but can be ajusted to fit most any waste, however there is an excess of webbing strap that hangs when worn aroung the waste. This may be so you can use it as a bandolier as well.

To fix this, I tied a knot in the nylon instead of using the buckle, and now it's pretty much only good to use as an over-the-shoulder bandolier. Not too impressed, but you get what you pay for.

I thought the story might make up for the other shortcomings but that was not the case.As a vampire novel it's bland and flat. As a Butler novel it's hard to believe it's even her writing this. Her previous novels have depth and were truly thought provoking. This has none of those things.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Edited, Pedophilic Undertones","review":"I love Octavia Butler. She was a brilliant, creative writer and I hold many of her works close to my heart. Her books seem to have a running theme of challenging social structure and societal norms, even around sexuality. That's part of what I appreciate about her writing. What I just can't tolerate is the pedophilic undertones of this book. I know the main character is technically in her fifties, but her body is that of a ten or eleven year old. I trudged through the otherwise entertaining story (skipping the love scenes, yuck!), but I'm still left disgusted by that theme, and wondering what Octavia Butler was thinking. Why was it important to her to carry her readers through scenes of grown men making love to a ten year old's body? Ugh! Gross gross gross... My only other complaint is that this book seemed to be very poorly edited. There were errors on at least every other page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Butler at her finest!","review":"I've alway been a fan of Octavia Butler, but haven't read anything recently.(in fact, I just learned of her death)The Fledgling is her most intriguing tale. I'm sure you've picked up the whole amnesia aspect of this young phoenix. Ms Butler has shown us the love and caring between races (of human and Ina)by using the tiniest details. Shori's \\"first\\" symbiont is jealous of her need for other food sources. He is allowed to feel jealous, instead of being put down as an insecure man. The newer parts of her \\"family\\" have their own issues, each of which are admirably revealed and valued.

But, the book isn't built around the gore/fear like so many \\"horror fiction\\" novels seem to be. In fact, I would almost classify this book as a study of culture and social psychology with a splash of erotica and mystery. These vampires have laws and cultural norms where they can co-exist in symbiotic relationships with willing humans. I read the author's \\"Lilith's Brood\\" and \\"Kindred\\" before this one. Then, this one really showed me how versatile the author really was...and keenly aware of human nature and how to create very believable characters. It is a tragedy that this author died. She had more to write!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This was the first (and only) book I've ever read my Octavia Butler. I bought it after hearing a brief review of it on a radio progam. I love the way Ms. Butler wrote the book, unfolding just a little knowledge as the story unfolds. If you haven't read the plot synopses on Amazon or elsewhere, do yourself a favor and skip them. They reveal too much. Half the fun of the book is the fact the you are completely in the dark about the character when the story begins. You learn her story little by little, and that made it very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"A different take on the vampire scene. Butler is a brilliant writer. This is actually the first vampire book I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing...","review":"After reading Kindred, I was looking forward to another novel by Ms. Butler . I was intrigued by the idea of a new race of vampire, but was unable to finish this story. Shori, the main character, is a 53 year old vampire in a 10 year olds body . She was badly injured and as a result has amnesia (and we are constantly reminded of this every other page ), over and over. It would have been helpful if Shori had been a likable character, but as many reviewers mentioned, she seems a little cold. I could not relate to her or any of the other characters . The sexual relations Shori had with adults was very disturbing , Perhaps it would've been better if she had appeared older and not like a 10 year old, having sex with men (and women) . The premise of Fledging ( a race of vampires able to bear sunlight ) is good, original, but unfortunately, this fell flat in so many ways ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"I ordered this book because I really enjoyed Kindred and I like Octavia Butler's writing. This book was riddled with errors and I was hoping that it was an issue with the Kindle format. At the end of the book I found myself wondering what was the point? For anyone who reads my reviews you know that I need to find a point .... Was the book a little about sexual mores and how even vampires have some standard in that regard that is different than the human standard. Was it about racism being an issue even for a species that are supposed to be more evolved. There was a thousand different themes running through this book but none of them compelling. In sum, I didn't like it and would not recommend to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bite","review":"I love Octavia Butler, but this book did not live up to her talent.

Outside of class, I read a lot, and I happen to be a fan of vampire fiction. Out of the many vampire novels I have read, I think this is actually one of the worst. Butler's writing is almost as poor as Stephanie Meyer's, but her plot is not nearly half as entertaining. Her prose has been called \\"lean;\\" I would call it simple to the point of childish. Another problem is that the characters are unconvincing. The main character's relationships seemed forced and unbelievable; her romances felt lifeless. Look elsewhere for good vampire fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!!!","review":"I never knew there were any female African-American science-fiction writers.

The unique take on the vampire myth was original and enjoyable (though there were some uncomfortable parts...) It was exciting, and I am very disappointed to learn that this was Butler's last book, as I would have enjoyed a sequel! I really enjoyed this much more than I expected to, really.

No overdubs or re-mastering. It's \\"get it right the first time\\" and everyone playing has to be in the groove.This makes for a very edgy feel to the solid playing these folks do. They reprise one particularly good number, Tamborine.

The radio would not receive AM stations even after using their provided AM antenna. FM reception was not very good either. We called Soundworks and they said to get an AM amplified antenna and it would work great. Doing that we could get one station 15 miles away almost acceptable. We do live in the country but have never had any problem getting radio stations with our cheap radios and did not dream that an expensive radio would have this type of problem. Soundworks admits that the AM signal is weak. Very poor radio and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality control","review":"I love this radio, which I use in the kitchen and dining room so that I can listen to fm stations and music cds while I work. I also use it to listen to language cds. I have lived a lifetime with cheap radios so having a more expensive one with good sound is wonderful. My complaint is that I had to send back the first radio because of static in the speakers. The replacement radio sounded great but the remote didn't work. I called technical services several times and they were promptly helpful but problems with two radios in a row seemed excessive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds is awesome, CD player is broken by design","review":"The sound quality of this unit is excellent for its form factor. I also own a Bose unit, and I can't stand to listen to it. The Cambridge unit is by far a superior sounding unit. The radio is great, the controls are pretty nice. BUT... the CD player is broken. It appears to be a design defect. I went through 2 units. On both units the CD player failed after a single CD was played and ejected. After that, it refused to accept another CD into the slot. I really wish they had stuck with a lift-top CD design instead of the motorized slot. I sent them both back, but I may still buy the radio-only version and plug in a separate CD player - the sound is that much better than anything else I've found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is a Zero","review":"I've had this radio for 3 years. After 6 months, the well documented CD problem emerged (see other reviews). Factory exchanged for another, only with the help of local dealer (2 months wait!), then failed again after the warranty expired. We had used as FM only clock radio, with mediocre sensitivity and selectivity (city dwellers beware), then on January 1,2007 (almost as if programmed) the radio failed.

I purchased and have listened to the Cambridge Soundworks 740 and it seems to me to be in no way inferior to the Bose and is almost 30% less expensive. It also does not have the disadvantage of being totally without manual controls and operable only with the remote. I do not know how long either will last without problems but based on sound quality, design and price, I recomnend the Cambridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"5 Weeks after it arrived it would not relinquish the cd within.

Sure...Classics, probably not","review":"I almost sent this back, because it wasn't as good as my Bose AM-5. Hah! It doesn't claim to be. Normal setting has a good bass boost, possibly too much for the classicist. Real boost is for people who don't mind going deaf before they're 30 yrs. old.I've learned to enjoy it as a bedside unit, secondary to my better-balanced Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Item for the money - CD player just does not work","review":"We purchased this unit January of 2005. We experienced no problems for about 9 months after which the CD player started being very picky about how the cd was loaded and we often had to try loading or ejecting multiple times. Finally in August 2006 the cd player just stopped working. It took the cd, refused to play it and now will not eject it.The reception has always been poor, but since that was not my primary usage I was able to live with it, but this last event was the last straw.I have purchased Cambridge SoundWorks speakers in the past and I have been very happy with them. I thought this unit would be made with similar quality but it is not. I cannot recommend this unit any longer. It is unreliable and poorly made.

I prefer some things to be hinted at rather than have to wade through a detailed description. After a while, the casual lewdness and perversity of some of the characters disgusted me and I could not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"What an unbelievably boring book! It's a bunch of facts and numbers and dates strung together - as if the author was bound and determined to use every bit of historical research that she had found. The main character is a stick - the story is supposed to show how he became a stronger and better man through adversity and hardship, but instead he is so perfect and aloof and godlike, he isn't interesting or sympathetic at all. I was very disappointed in this book, because I had really enjoyed her previous books. The Thorn Birds, An Indecent Obsession, A Creed for the Third Millenium all had far more interesting and believable characters, and storylines that were far more engrossing and weren't sacrificed to historical detail. I plowed my way through Morgan's Run, hoping the story would finally take off, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story/Boring read","review":"The jacket cover of Morgan's Run implies that this novel is as sweeping in scope and emotion as \\"The Thorn Birds\\". Although the story is wonderful, it's the telling that is stagnant. Instead of a compelling novel of intrigue, emotion and three dimentional characters, this book reads like a dry history chronicle. It tells a story, but lacks the insight to satisfy the reader. Maybe the problem is that the publishers promised a \\"Thorn Birds\\" but delivered a 19th century history primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Having read most of Ms.McCullough's books, I was looking forward to Morgan's Run. Although the book got off to a slow start and the detailed descriptions made for very slow reading, I was not disappointed. One of the reasons I like reading Colleen McCullough's books is that her reasearch is very thorough. She describes in detail how people performed everyday tasks. Her descriptions of life in the jails and aboard the convict ships show the hardships of the times and what these people really had to endure. Alot of other books, and especially the movies, paint too romantic a picture. You could almost smell the stench of the prison hold. I liked the character of Richard Morgan. And, even though he may be bigger than life and almost too perfect, isn't that what a hero is? Looking forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring Disapointment","review":"Morgans Run was a very strange and oddball novel. There were many literal gaps and parts that left you hanging. Although the characters were fun and enjoyable to read about, it was the only thing that made me put any stars on the book. The book seemed to long to read and not worth thee time. But I figured that I'd stick with it and read until the end. After the last page, I wasn't suprised that I was half asleep. If you like fun and exciting books, this, well, is not up your alley. Colleen McCullough has had much better novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untold Early Australian Story","review":"Colleen McCullough is a very thorough researcher who has acquired the art of putting all the facts in with out the yawns.I never realised how important Norfolk Island was to the survival of the new colony in New South Wales, and as a Third Fleet descendant I found her detailed account of the voyage out both fascinating and melancholic. This is based on a true story that is a party of every Australian's roots and should be read to understand just how we all gained our strengh of character during advertsity.A hard to put down book, and the Audio stayed true to the original version with Tim Curry's voice giving an English flavour that immediately sets the scene.Excellent and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Australia","review":"Being a big fan of The Thorn Birds, I was hoping for a novel set mainly in Australia. But after 300-plus pages with the protagonist still in England, I just couldn't muster the interest to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow going","review":"I have to admit that I abandoned the book halfway through. Although I was expecting a story about the hardships of settling in the penal colony of Australia, I reached the novel's midpoint and Morgan was still on the convict ship, sailing past the coast of Europe. I grew tired of reading about fouled bilge pumps, shipboard diseases, and the quarrels among the ship's officers.Richard Morgan was a cardboard cutout of a protagonist. His personality radically changed, according the situation at hand, from a quiet tavernkeeper's son to a rum-sotted grieving father to a wise leader of men. Morgan seemed to be no more than a vehicle for the author's detailed treatises on 18th century England and Australia and their history, public health issues, criminal justice system, and shipboard life.If you are a historical novel buff with a preference for the factual over the fictional, then perhaps this novel is for you. It did not appeal to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyed it...","review":"The first Colleen McCullough book I read was \\"The First Man in Rome\\" and I absolutely fell in love with it. I read each subsequent \\"Masters of Rome\\" book trying to recapture that love but none of them quite hit the spot. Finally, my perseverance has been rewarded. The only reason I gave \\"Morgan's Run\\" four stars is that I'm reluctant to give any book five. I love a book that's packed with detail and Ms. McCullough obviously does an exhaustive amount of research. Richard Morgan was just a good person that you couldn't help but cheer on. Perhaps he is a little too enlightened and kind-hearted to be true but it's a novel, why not. I once more eagerly await Ms. McCullough's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Accurate","review":"Morgan's Run is historically accurate when it comes to dates, facts, and the experiences of a person who is sent to a penal colony. Although this novel did not hold my interest in the way that the Thorn Birds did, I persevered and finished it because I wanted to learn something new. One thing that stands out about the novel is how McCullough does an excellent job of describing what life was like on a penal colony and I almost feel as if I am Richard Morgan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morgan Run not THE THORNBIRDS...But","review":"I always think there is but ONE truly great novel inside every every writer, and in Ms. McCullough's case of course I thought it was THE THORNBIRDS.Morgan's Run proved to be a close third after her novel TIM.As has been stated the first few chapters of Morgan's Run is a bit tedious, but once Richard Morgan gets on the ships and then lands onto Botney Bay, interest soars.It's the kind of story that details and chronicles the life of a man who has lost everything, and gained back his integrity, his loast sense of self and finally learned to love once again.Characterization is rich and engaging, and I became immersed in finding out just how Richard Morgan was going to survive in a land that was vastly different from his home in England, making him face harsh realities that he could either face what was ahead or die. He chose life and what a life it was.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After hearing great reviews and personal experience with 10\\" CMT table saw blades, I thought I'd give these a go for the jointer.

They end up together, yes, and the story she was investigating was the murder of her roommate, but in fact he didn't have any information about it (which the reader knows up front). I don't consider myself a prude, but she wasn't doing this to fulfill a fantasy; she was using him to get information. To me there's a distinction.

Something happened when Sage's mother died and the two women have been estranged since. However at the end of the novel Lucy is described as having 'introduced her CIA boss, Sage's father, to Lucy's sister, Sage's mother. How can an 11 year old child be working for the CIA?

There are alot of well written progressive tracks on this CD. Very tastefully put together and soulful harmony vocals. It's funky,rockin' sometimes way out there.

Alex, with the help of his friends, securityexpert Lisa, street wise Fortune and computer savvy Foody, attempt to clearAlex's name and bring down Simon.The plot was an interesting concept, but did not seem to deliver on paper.The jacket cover Alex was touted as an Easy Rawlings for the 21st Century,but neither he nor the book were anywhere close to Walter Mosley's fastpaced and smart Easy Rawlings Mystery novels. The book was slow, thewriting was flat, and the characters did not captivate.

This detailed book includes casting numbers for blocks, cranks, rods, cylinder heads, intake manifolds and water pump housings for those who want an accurate restoration or those needing help with identification of parts. This book is more detailed about B/RB disassembly/reassembly and problem areas and tips to make the job easier than other general engine rebuilding books.

Some material on the exam doesn't even appear in this book, and other material goes in to much more detail than the book does. Example: visual basic scripting; I got a couple of questions that required some knowledge of VBS, but this book didn't touch it. Another example: using the automated system recovery tool is covered, but not in enough detail to help you pass.

This band stuck more to the Cuban conjunto style than most bands of the golden era of salsa. Great songs like the big hit Amor pa' Que, Maria Merce both written by the great Ruben Blades and Todo el Mundo Quiere Bailar. 3 songs sung by Nestor Sanchez a great and underrated sonero. Also songs like Felipon, me Imagino and En Vano Existir sung by there other fine sonero Carlos Santos who went on to sing with Roberto Roena. Fine musicians throughout especially Charlie Rodriguez on Tres and Gene Rodriguez on trumpet. My only critique is they didn't bother to remaster when transferring it to cd and the sound is very bassy with the highs way down in the mix. Otherwise a very good album enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth ten dollars","review":"There are some good drills for the 4-3-3 but the video is dubbed and very dry to watch.

It covers a lot of material, whether it be foiling foot, vehicular, or technical surveillance attempts. Unlike some books that will include a few pages on eluding surveillance, listing techniques like \\"leave the TV on if you think you're bugged\\" or \\"make two right turns if you think you're followed\\" and leaving it at that, this one will provide you with more discreet and effective ways at accomplishing these goals.It also offers insight on the mindset of your adversary, the survelliance operative.

It holds a lot of music files at 128 mb, especially if you rip 'em using mp3pro or wma. All this in a device the size of a cigarette lighter.Downside: its design is too simple.

This review is based on the MIT Press version of the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually lazy","review":"Lev Manovich claims to have been trained in computer science. If he had any respect for the field, he would not have filled his book with deliberate misstatements about the nature of digital media. He uses these misstatements to fill out his narrative about the development of new media, and in doing so misinforms the \\"new media artists\\" he purports to educate.The writing is reflective of Manovich's speaking/lecturing style: factually lazy, fluffed up with pointlessly obtuse language, and above all else BORING.If you are an artist looking to understand the development of new media, look elsewhere, as you will only be bored and misinformed by Manovich. If you are a computer scientist looking for media theory, you will also be bored, but also possibly offended by the lazy treatment of your area of expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"My name is Lev and I'm clueless.","review":"In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them. He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.

Don't get me wrong, I think Cream was an extraordinary group that had an amazing magnitude of truly great work in the few short years they were together. I also think Eric Clapton is one of the greatest musicians of our time. But this thing is just mind-numbing in it's detail of minutiae. I don't typically like \\"rockumentaries\\" in the first place, but if you are going to do one, do it right and spend more time talking about the music. The Classic Albums line of documentaries does a better job of this, see the one about Deep Purple's Machine Head for a good example. But two hours of who said what to who is just not worth watching unless you deeply care in the minutiae of other people's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential purchase for any Cream Fan!","review":"A two-disc set comprising of interviews,video clips and live music, this is a highly entertaining collection with Jack Bruce,Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker telling us in their own words how the world's first supergroup formed, hit the top of the charts with such hits as Sunshine of Your Love and White Room, then self destructed in just a few short years, only to reform for the celebrated 2005 Cream at Albert Hall concerts. Poet Pete Brown, who had a hand in most of Creams songs, also is interviewed.The only complaint I have about the main program is Ginger Baker who comes across as as quite bitter and unrelenting in his interview when commenting about Jack Bruce. One would think that Ginger would have mellowed out a bit over the years, but sadly it isn't so! But the fantastic music more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth seeing","review":"I have only seen the streaming-video documentary portion of this package, so I can't assess the entire set. But I hugely enjoyed what I saw. It's a good, solid documentary that tells the story of one of the most influential bands in rock history. Note well: this is not a music video or a performance piece. This documentary didn't give me a deeper appreciation of Cream's music, but it did help me understand the personalities of these three brilliant musicians, the reasons for the band's success, and why they broke up at the peak of their glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"This is a book about a woman that got treated poorly by everybody she met.

The vocalist Ed Jackson has great range with his vocals. There are alot of great guitar riffs also.

It goes much deeper than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in outlining the fundamental limits of observation and thus empirical/scientific knowledge. Szilard's results would even apply in a \\"classical\\" universe.I have yet to see this fully explicated in philosophy departments or other \\"popular\\" texts, etc.Recommended as a very good, basic introduction to information and communication theory.

I don't know what kind of audience it's for--mathematicians? scientists of some sort? But not the lay reader, that's for sure. I would have wanted this to be made clear before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"As another reviewer notes, Jay Leonhart is brilliant on this CD. He has a few other CDs available, but this is still my favorite of all of them. The songs feature his clever insights (both funny and serious) and spare arrangements. In addition, this is one CD I take along to audition stereo gear. This recording is so clean and has so much presence and three-dimensionality that if it doesn't sound that way on a given system, I know where that system's shortcomings are. A treasure and one of my \\"desert island\\" discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid and waited two weeks for the wrong book","review":"I odered a school book for the first time with Amazon.com a few weeks ago.

It leads to most of the psychological disorders that young men and women develop, generates a \\"hedonistic\\" backlash comparable to the War on Drugs and thwarts the intelligent use of contraceptives (which in turn leads to unwanted pregnancies and abortions).This book is so hopelessly puritanical and backwards that it just might resurrect The Taliban.Atrocious, close-minded and anti-Christian. An abomination of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do as I say or burn, sinner, burn!","review":"This book is one of the most atrocious books ever written. Dannah's preachy, holier-than-thou attitude is a tremendous turnoff except to those who are like-minded or being bent under the thumb of fundamentalist Christianty and Puritanism, which seems evident from the kidns of people who have been giving this monstrocity of a book 5 stars. The delights of sexual experience were given to us to enjoy, not to keep under lock and key for one guy who may or may not be good in bed or even worth staying in a marriage with. In addition, science has given us contraception, which allows women to choose how many children they have. This book undoes every last shred of the women's rights movement. I am not a promoter of promiscuity, but this book's only message is that we should feel guilty and dirty for even thinking of sex outside of marriage. It's books like this that remind me why I gave up Christianty many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's next-chastity belts?","review":"This book is a reactionary effort to make women \\"wait\\" for sexual union or they'll be \\"sinners\\" and end up with Satan. Pleeeeease! More unsettling it is \\"based on scriptures\\" yet ignores recent findings (Dead Sea, Egypt)that indicate JESUS was married and not so \\"pure\\" (Our Bible was translated from Greek writings. FYI Jesus never ever spoke or wrote Greek.Our Biblical books were chosen based on politics, not truth. MAry wasn't a virgin either, read Thierring, et. al. and get real) Love is love is love. Orgasms are of the spirit, but let's get away from this \\"purity\\" garbage. There are too many horrible pure people, while some of the nicest people I knoww, AND the most like JESUS, have enjoyed sex without marriage. What's next, follow the husband barefoot and pregnant?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dangerous book.","review":"This book disgusts me and carries on the harmful tradition of teaching children that abstinence is the only option.Dannah, and people like her, are contributing to the rise of STDs and teenage pregnancies in this nation by urging abstinence at all costs.Here's a hint, ma'am; kids are going to have sex. It is the strongest biological drive that exists. You can either teach them how to have safe sex that minimizes the chance of pregnancy or STDs, or you can keep them ignorant. It'll be your own fault when she ends up with a kid at 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing!","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book.

It's on the topic of purity, but most importantly it helped me understand how to connect to God in real life! This is an amazing book, and i would recommend it to every woman/girl in a heartbeat.I love the way Dannah Gresh writes; she is so friendly, funny, down to earth, and easy to relate to. In this book, she writes about how to live a pure life- purity is not something you start out with, but something you strive toward.Don't go another day without reading this book (and when you're done, recommend it to your girlfriends)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Bride wore white","review":"I have never been so inspired by a book such as this. I strongly advise all teenage girls to read this book,it could change their lives completely. Dannah is an inspiration to all who read this book and the honesty and sincerety of this story involving Dannah's teen years is heartwarming and a real tribute to her faith in God. Please do not miss the blessings you get from reading the trials and tribulations Dannah shares with her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disapointed","review":"After reading the reviews about this book I was convinced it must be good for teaching purity, I was sorely disappointed. The title does not match the book entirely. It should have been titled \\"How to attain purity after you've messed up\\". This book may be good for a girl who has already messed up and wants to start over. I would not recommend this book for someone who wishes to start out and remain pure. This book is also for a more mature reader. If you are looking for something for a young girl learning about purity, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a God-send!!","review":"I recommend this book for any woman, married or single. Dannah speaks directly to the reader as if she was sitting right next to you. She gets your attention and keeps it through the entire book. The information is relative to today's teen, yesterday's teen, and tomorrow's teen. I strongly encourage any woman, seeking to grow closer to God and her future/present husband to read this book. And if you have already compromised your purity, this book can help show you the forgiveness and steadfast love of Christ and how to get back on the path of purity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now available for your Kindle!","review":"Hi!

I have not been able to trace one memorable melody on the entire cd. Neither is there anything original to redeem this fact, if you accept ambient/electronic music as an established genre.

The ideas are easy to understand, the concepts are well explained, and although some of the material is repeated for effect, there are some really good ideas and exercises. I thoroughtly like the journal idea where you honour all the good things you do and write down 1 good thing you did/that happened in that day. It's an excellent book. Highly recommended to teens as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"This book tries hard but it's way too short to really cover these topics. It's too dumbed down and simple. It doesn't have enough substance to really change you. I recommend Nathanial Brandon's Six Pillars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Camel's Lament","review":"Great kids book. I love Charles Edwards Carral. His poems flow so nicely that it is fun to read. I still remember one of his poems that I memorized in the fifth grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick, fast, brainy trash you won't put down.","review":"Trash. Absolute trash. I literally read it on a bet. So Itotally enjoyed a book I would not otherwise have picked up, and Imade five bucks on the deal. Goldsmith's megaseller is fast, witty, frequently touching, and much smarter than I would have guessed.Reading The First Wives Club is like devouring a bowl of fabulously exspensive gourmet jelly beans: you know it's not going to enrich your life or better the world, but once you start, you're not going to stop until you're done. Despite the hype, not just a glitzy chick book. This is a really good vacation read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"Amazing, arrived earlier in very good state but for some couple scratches and a little stains, but it was amazing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Sadistic","review":"Almost all the time books tend to be better than the movies that they were made into. Perhaps this is because the movie has so much product placement, and this plot is always reworked. But here, the book turned out to be worse than the movie. The movie was funny and great, but the book, which I read before seeing to movie, Is overly sadistic, drags on in many places, to mention just a few flaws. I would definetly see the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of life's relationships to make you laugh at yourself","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read! As a woman I can relate to some of the experiences of these characters and what I found charming about it all was the way Ms Goldsmith was able to make me look at the humour in the situations. The book is very funny and \\"un-putdownable\\" and it helps you to change your outlook on life, it helps you to face up to the truth about yourself and your relationships (remember admission is the first step to a cure). It is not a men bashing book as I've heard people express, but it is one that aims to heighten women's awareness of what relationships may turn out to be but put in a light-hearted manner to make you laugh at yourself. This book scores high with me and I'd recommend the book (not the movie which was a total letdown) to anyone in a twinkle of an eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie; Bad Book","review":"There is no comparison between the movie and the book it's based upon. The film is light, fast-paced, witty without being vindictive, and fun. The book is downright hostile. If there's ever going to be a bible for man-haters, then it's this novel. Every single man is painted as cruel and heartless, while the women are portrayed as \\"why me? I never hurt a fly.\\" Ms. Goldsmith's fascination with lesbians is at times lurid and revolting. The changes the filmmakers made to the story were absolutely correct. I barely got through the whole book before I donated it to a neighborhood library. Watch the movie; it's a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is better.","review":"I listened to the audio copy of this book and it is too raunchy for my taste. Christine Baranski, who reads the book makes most of the characters sound like stuck up snobs, unlike what Bette, Goldie or Diane do in the movie.The movie, at least, gives the story humor and keeps the sex at a minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn Airplane","review":"There I was, sitting on an airplane next to a guy with the worst body odor who insisted on trying to talk to me. I had already done the in-flight magazine crossword and the only thing that saved me from having to talk to the smelly man beside me was a copy of this horrible book a previous passenger must have rightfully left behind. Reading it was easier than pretending to read it so . . . I hate to admit it, but I finished it. If I hadn't been on an airplane I would have burned it, but as it was, some sadistic impulse forced me to leave this incredibly bad novel behind for the next poor sap to occupy my seat. The only reason I give it two stars is because the guy beside me got one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy novel, poorly written","review":"When I read this book several years ago, I had no idea what I was getting into. I had seen the movie, and although I didn't love it, the movie was ok, and a book is always supposed to be better than the movie. At first the book seemed merely very unlikely. Then as I continued reading I began to feel a little uncomfortable with certain characters. The one friend who was supposedly a compulsive eater sounded no different than me, and I am not even considered chubby. The one new girlfriend was disgusting, not only in what she did, but in how she lived her life. The only saving grace to the entire book was the general plot. Although very unbelievable, it was also very satisfying to see these men get what they deserved in life, but honestly the women did not deserve the satisfaction they experienced from the men's downfalls. Thank goodness I had just borrowed the book from the library and not bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than barefoot","review":"I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells. When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to). Most of their shoes need no \\"break in\\" time. I own the Yeti slides, they are so warm and comfortable. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years. The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret. You know, you're walking in heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my TNIV!","review":"I just purchased the TNIV (got the red one) and I LOVE it! This Bible is the perfect size - not too small, not too big, the font is easy on the eyes, it's light and easy to bring around, and I love the soft feel of the cover.The translation is wonderful! Much of the more dubious phraseology in the NIV has been updated so that it's more readily understandable (e.g. \\"with child\\" changed to \\"pregnant\\")... and unlike many opponents of the TNIV suggest, this translation is not \\"gender-neutral\\" as much as it is \\"gender-inclusive.\\" I love that it is CLEAR that I (as a woman & daughter of God) am included in the commands, exhortations and promises of God. :) I thought I would never make the switch from my beloved NIV (from which I had memorized over a hundred Scripture verses), but the Strauss vs. Grudem debate tipped me over to \\"the other side\\" -- i.e. the TNIV. It has been a good change -- refreshing and enlivening for my Spiritual journey. Thank you, TNIV translators!!!! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Updating the \\"New\\"","review":"The large number of respected evangelical scholars who have weighed in in favor of this translation certainly carries more weight that anything I could add. As a teacher/preacher (no longer in Togo, but I can't figure our how to change my profile), I had tried using the NLT, but found that it was just too different from the NIV that most use for people to follow easily. The TNIV is very similar to the NIV with most changes made to allow for gender inclusiveness. Sometimes this calls for changes from singular to plural tenses, but I can't tell that the meaning is altered. For those used to the NIV, it's a pretty natural move.I can't help but be amused by the marketing challenges involved. How do you update the \\"New\\" International Version when it is no longer new? And what will they call \\"Today's New International Version\\" tomorrow?I enjoy the look and feel of this thinline edition, though cross-references would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"Thanks for selling this product so cheap!

This does work on pre-lingual children. I used it with my child before she was 1. I found myself struggling with behavior again in the 4s and 5s and read this book and went back to applying the principles. They do work. You'll be amazed and your child will be happier. This brought peace to our home. It's easy to read and give lots of examples. Both parents need to be informed and commited to sticking to the plan. ...There is no heartlessness in this plan. There is no spanking, time out, or counting.

It changed my life and how I interfaced with my children. I tell everyone to read this book. I think that all parents know \\"what\\" they should be doing so their children behave, however,this book does is tell you \\"how to do it\\". The examples are wonderful. I now have a \\"tweener\\" and a \\"teenager\\" and they are really nice, respectful kids. The chapter on \\"contribution\\" is critical. After reading that, I had the kids start helping me set the table, put the dishes away from the dishwasher, and sort, fold and put away laundry. It has made my life so much easier; and our family's life so much more enjoyable. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, if you read it and implement the recommendations, it works - and works really quickly (we had a huge behavior improvement after the first weekend)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of minimal help. . .","review":"Most of the examples and ideas in the book pertain to older children -- but it's the younger ones who whine! The idea of ignoring a whining child really doesn't stop a preschooler from whining - they'll just follow you out of the room! I didn't find a lot of specific answers that I was hoping for.

All I can say is that for me this book is actually changing my life. The book has taken all sorts of disparate elements and finally organized them into a plan I can really use. It's changing my life, and I can't give it a higher recommendation than that. It's a slow process, but I can feel it working everyday.

I think the last picture of her I saw was of dinner at the White House. I downloaded the title number and the 'I've Known a Few' from iTunes and play them all the time. The collection is intimate, and quiet. A pleasant voice, but as far from Edith Piaf as one could get. Quiet, personal, wry, perhaps, definitely talented. Nothing better to make someone want to learn French and even pick up a guitar. I still don't know what the song is about. I am sure whoever put it on the sound track of the movie did.(500) Days of Summer (WideScreen Rental Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still listen to this after over a year!","review":"I discovered Carla Bruni's all French album for over a year now and I still enjoy listening to it.

I three of the other reviews (as they were kind of low in my opinion), and although I must say some of their arguments seemed correct, I don't see how bad it is.They are right in the sence that it's very uniform, meaning, the rythms change very little from one song to the next, and it's probably not the most original work I have heard. But on the other hand, it's really different from what I hear most of the time, it's refreshing, and I really liked her voice.I tend to rate, in my opinion, a bit hard. I would give it four and a half stars if I could.

The consumer IR port was a surprise, as most of the manufacturers do not include this on their devices.The battery life is ok, but I feel it should have been of a higher capacity. The new Media Player is not up to the mark, few of its features being useful only if the user ties himself/herself to Windows Media format and applications. These are the reasons that I gave the product four stars.Being Blue tooth and Wi-Fi enabled this is a great product. Its slim and light form along with the excellent features have won me over. I feel that the X50v is an attractive high-end Windows Mobile handheld to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy from JerseyCLOSEOUT","review":"I love this pda; it has almost all the features I need and the price is affordable! I bought this item from Jerseycloseout and their customer service is excellent and deserves 10 stars! After a year from my purchase, my pda stopped working. I recently contacted jerseycloseout expressing my grief that it stopped working in a year, and he asked me to send it to him after all the other efforts to fix it through the phone failed. In about five days, he sent me a new one plus a high quality battery! All I had to spend was 6 dollars for shipping. If you buy from Jerseycloseout, you can trust that they will be helping you anytime you need! I am extremely satisfied with their customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A relaxed, unstuffed-shirt approach to classical guitar.","review":"This is a wonderfully reassuring book.

It is great for that, and I think it sounds great. But keep in mind, it is not made well. There is a typo on it for \\"filter\\" a friend of mine caught, and the input output labels are reversed. From day one, I couldn't get the battery cover to close without the chance of breaking the unit(I now just leave it off), and it has since developed a really high pitched squeal.

A friend had lent it to me and I had nothing else to read at the time. By page 40 I was completely convinced on just how terrible this book is.The characters in this book have nothing to distinguish themselves from the terrible stereotypes they are. They have a terminal flatness that makes them completely unengaging. The setting and exploration of the world were also particularly unengaging.So, why did I finish the book? It was like watching a bad Godzilla movie. You go into it expecting these terrible writing and characterization faux paus just as you go into a godzilla movie looking for the zipper on his suit. There was zero chance for emmersion into the world as it was written but there was plenty of laughs and cringes at the trainwreck of a plot that was there.If there is any reason to read this book, it's to learn what not to do as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember me-Snoozer","review":"Horrible. didn't even finish it. got to the point where she was pushed from the balcony and already knew who did it and why, read the last chapter to confirm i was right. there was nothing really to draw you in. shari thinks like a 15 year old boy.

By the time I finish the book I feel that I know the characters. I read 3:The Last Story, before I read 2:The Return, but I really liked both of them.

They think she jumped off the balcony but Shari can't remember.She knows she has to go into the light but how can she when everyone thinks that she killed herself.

I give this book 4 stars and 2 thumbs up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I named it engaging because it is, but I have to admit the beginning was a bit slow for me. However, after the first few chapters the story really took me in. It provides an interesting perspective of a ghost and what may exist beyond life. The story also contained characters with depth and personality. A good plot line, an interesting perspective, and characters that move the story along make this a great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book! My favorite by Pike!","review":"This book is great. You just never want to put it down. Shari's journey into death and her search for her murderer just enthralls you. The end either makes you want to cry or you just do. It's not really sad (well, maybe a little bit)....I guess it could be called bittersweet.This book is just a wonderful book and I would recommend it wholeheartedly.

He started throwing away the letters from the frdige, so now its in my attic hoping it may be useful after a year or so :-( I know couple of my friends said that their kids also did not use it effectively. SO, think twice whether your kid will use this properly or not !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to play this toy WITH your child","review":"I was secretly hoping that this would entertain and educate my 4yo child without taking up my time. You definitely need to play this machine with your child if you want your child to learn. Unfortunately, the voice is very unclear. \\"f\\" sounds like \\"s\\". \\"hen\\" sounds like \\"fen\\". Heck, even I have to guess what word/letter the machine is trying to spell or say.Also, my daughter gets disappointed when she wants to spell words longer than 3 letters and can't. Can't even spell \\"zoo\\" because there's only one \\"O\\".The only good news is that my daughter is paying more attention to spelling and to word/letter sounds than usual. Otherwise, this toy would only get one star from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared my child","review":"We gave our 3 year old daughter the Fridge Words(tm): Magnetic Word Builder for her birthday 2 weeks ago. We have numerous Leapster products and I had full confidence in purchasing this item. As an elementary school teacher for 11 years, I know the importance in toys like this one. Much to my shock, my daughter is terrified of this toy. Why? Because for whatever reason for the letter A the sound and announcement is \\"aaaah....monster!\\" Who ever thought this was appropriate for young children need to actually spend time with a toddler. We spend many times a day pretending monsters are fun and NOTHING to be scared of. Now I have a toy, that I was so happy for her to play with, reinforcing the idea that a monster is scary. At this point I will never again purchase Leap Frog products or recommend them to friends or students of mine. What a disappointment created in this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I GOT RIPPED OFF!!

Why? because my child is running around the house yelling \\"B#TCH\\" because thats what the Leapfrog fridge words taught her to say, rather than \\"Bit\\" This is not a joke review, you can see my video of it on youtube. I immediately contacted Leapfrog customer service and they were very unconcerned even though I played the toy saying the word for them twice. When my kid gets kicked out of preschool for saying a word like that, are they going to take responsibility? Could have at least got a half hearted \\"sorry\\" I would recommend staying away from this particular Leapfrog product. Seems like it may have been a good toy if it didn't swear at me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!","review":"I just got this a couple of days ago and my kids (4 and 5 yrs. old) have not stopped playing with it! What I love about it is that all the pieces are magnetic and can attach to the fridge so you don't have the problem of how to store the letters so they don't get lost. Plus, since it's on the fridge, they play with it more. I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this is a new and improved version.","review":"I bought this product three years ago. The first one misidentified the letters, I complained, and they sent me a new one. The replacement was no better. I asked for my money back; they sent me instructions on how to fix it. I was enraged.

Be forewarned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than \\"Fridge Phonics\\"","review":"My daugter received both the Word Whammer and Fridge Phonics for her second birthday. The Word Whammer has three modes. The first mode is almost identical to the Fridge Phonics set. The song is a little bit shorter, but it sings the letter name and the sounds it makes. If you press a letter twice, it has a phrase with that letter, something that the Fridge Phonics doesn't do. For example, the \\"c\\" is \\"It's c-c-c-c-old in here!\\". The \\"a\\" is \\"aaaaaaah! I'm scared of monsters!\\". It's very cute. The second mode is for making words. If you just put in one letter, it will prompt you to put a vowel (a \\"blue letter\\") in the second spot. When you spell a word, it sings a short song. In the third mode, it prompts you to try to spell words that rhyme. It is a great toy with much more \\"grow with me\\" potential than the Fridge Phonics."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEAP FROG HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!","review":"My daughter got this for her third birthday and LOVES it! It is the perfect addition to the original fridge phonics, and all of the letters work with both products! This toy helps teach how to spell three letter words like mom and dad, which is perfect for a three year old! I am dissapointed that the songs for the letters are not the same as fridge phonics, they were so catchy for little kids. Overall I would reccomend this product to anyone with a preschooler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"other leapfrog letters don't fit","review":"This is a good toy stand alone. However, we were really hoping to build on his other fridge toy - from the same company - and we have upper and lower case letters from that toy/same company. The letters are not the same size. They are just slightly different. This is ridiculous?! Why? Why? Why? Not only that but they are slightly smaller making them just small enough to fit in the choking tube for our littler one who is following her big brother to the fridge. Now we really can't play with this toy. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not working out","review":"The first Word Whammer I got for my daughter for Christmas, really excited by the reviews and never having a previous problem with any Leap Frog products. The middle section would only say the letter \\"A\\". After a customer service battle with Leap Frog, Amazon.com finally replaced the first one. Now, after minimal use, the only thing that it will do is begin to sing the ABC song, and then get stuck and start to repeat. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this leap frog item","review":"A few months ago, I bought my son the fridge phonics set and it didn't work; even after switching batteries and cleaning the battery contacts as recommended by the manufacturer. Back to the store it went. Wal-mart informed me that a lot of them have been returned. Sad. At any rate, my son got the Word Whammer for Christmas. Again, the same thing. What a pain to have to turn the thing off and on between EVERY word, AND then have the thing only recognize the letter \\"A\\" in the center space. It got returned the day after Christmas as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I bought this for my 2 yr old. He loves it.

I think this is a wonderful Leap Frog item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Five Stars","review":"My three year old daughter loves her Leap Frog Fridge Toys; this is the latest addition. She really likes it, but has one big problem which is really testing her patience. When it asks for a letter and she has to search for it, sometimes it gives up on her before she finds it, and then she has to start over with a new word. I understand this is probably a battery saving device (perhaps the child has wandered off) but she's getting very frustrated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to fix the toy, then it was great","review":"I too had the experience of having the toy not work right.

Now it works great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters are incorrect","review":"I wish I paid more attention to these reviews about the letters functioning incorrectly. I thought I'd take my chances and I got what I paid for. It worked correctly for about a month. It would have been a great educational toy if it worked well. I don't want my children thinking an F is a G and Q is an E. There are less letter choices with this toy, but my kids have gotten more accurate play out of it: Melissa & Doug See & Spell puzzle. I'm really disappointed in leap frog.Luckily, our fridge phonics still works correctly, but I'm wondering how long I have until that toy starts giving incorrect letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leapfrog is a terrible company","review":"Leapfrog has the worst customer service ever! I received a Leapfrog toy as a gift for my 3-year old and wanted to exchange it for something more advanced, but the customer service center told me I could only exchange a damaged or broken item and only for the exact same item. I asked for a refund or credit, but they told me they could only apply the credit to my brother's credit card, and I did not want him to find out and feel bad about me exchanging his gift. The package came with a letter entitled \\"Returns and Exchanges\\", but the language does not mention anything about how to exchange a gift or how to do any type of exchange at all. Completely useless! I would not buy from this company ever again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as always","review":"Leap Frog always does a great job of helping children learn and this toy is no exception. My daughters love singing their ABC's, spelling words, sounding out letters, and much more. I would recommend this to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"My son picked this out for his 4th birthday. We opened it up and found that it does not identify the letters correctly. When identifying a letter, the first bay seems to consistently pick the letter before the correct one ... eg, says \\"E\\" for \\"F\\". I called the phone number listed on the box and they said it would be up to 2 days for a return call. After reading these reviews, I think I'll just take it back to Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed...","review":"I wanted to love this product. My family has had wonderful experiences with other LeapFrog products, but this one simply was not of the same quality I have come to expect.Like many of the other reviewers, our first Word Whammer did not correctly identify the letter placed in the first slot. The only letters it recognized were C and Q. I returned it to the store and bought another one, hoping for better luck. The second one had the same problem with two of the three slots. Some of the little tabs in the slots (which read the letters) are partially depressed, thereby preventing letter recognition. I found that if I used my fingernails to pick at the tabs prior to inserting a letter, it would sometimes work, but that eliminates any possibility of my son being independent and spontaneous... I hate to say it, but I am returning the second Word Whammer and looking for an alternative product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 18 months-5 years","review":"I have two kids, 19 months & 4 years. They both love playing with the magnets & hearing the letter sounds while attempting to build words.

Thanks for making a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This!","review":"The concept is great, but unfortunately, the Word Builder is getting the letters WRONG!!! My two-year-old, who already knows all of his letters, is getting incredibly frustrated using this product. I had to take it off the fridge because I don't want to see him frustrated and I don't want him to start getting confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would be a great toy if it worked!","review":"My 2 year old niece loves this toy. The only problem is that the unit misreads certain letters. Not so great when you are trying to teach letters and spelling. We tried cleaning the contacts and changing the batteries as was recommended on the leapfrog website with no luck. We contacted Amazon to exchange it and had the same problem with the replacement. Contacted leapfrog and was told there's nothing else to be done and we should just return it. Why keep selling this if leapfrog is aware the majority of these are defective? The best I can say is that Amazon customer service was very helpful with the initial exchange. Listen to the reviews and buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the single magnet alphabet toy","review":"also cheaper. i got this because when i went to replace the single one, the price of that one had skyrocketed from what I initially paid ($15) to $50+!!! this little gem is a really great toy. i recommend it to all ages and it will keep toddlers learning their alphabets occupied, as well as provide gaming to older kids. has a lot of functions and is very high on the educational scale for toys. super cute airplane also good for babies and toddlers sensory input."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randomly detects the wrong letters","review":"As my luck would have it, it looks like I got hit with a lemon.

We had the fridge magnet with the single letters and luckily, this one fits both the new and old magnets. This one comes with all lowercase and we already have all uppercase from the previous magnet. Unfortulatey, it just sort of freezes or shutsdown midplay. My son has learned just to flip the power switch off and then on again...but lame! I wouldn't go through the trouble of returning it, but it is a very disappointing aspect of it. Also, you have to catch the window of when your child is only spelling three letter words. We lay the magnets out on the table or fridge to spell bigger words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads letters wrong/poor sound quality","review":"This would be a great toy if only it worked properly. It is useless because it reads the letters wrong and the sound quality is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"I love the leap frog fridge toys. My daughter knew her ABC's several months before she turned 2 and now we are working on recognizing simple words. Thanks for the great learning tools, Leap Frog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but one small flaw","review":"Product is great, but has one flaw. It recognizes the L as a K. This confuses my 3 year old. I explain to him that our unit or the letter is not right and that he, in fact, is right. I have to place the letter in a certain way to make sure it reads the L correctly. Other than that, we enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both my son and I love this toy!","review":"Everything about this toy is cool. My almost 3-year-old son loved it and really truly played with it unlike alot of his other toys. The phonics education in the toy is awesome, and even though he is a bit too young for certain aspects of the toy, it is something that he will grow into and learn from so he will be able to enjoy it for some time. It truly is an educational toy. The durability is great, but I would just warn people that the combination of a refrigerator toy, and a pre-schooler who likes to try to pour his own juice (and prefers to try when mom and dad are not in the room), is not a good combination. Our first one of these was drowned in OJ and nothing could be done to save it. we still loved the toy enough to spend another $20+ on a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away: unreliable product; horrible customer support","review":"We bought this toy for our 3-year-old as an EDUCATIONAL toy! It is extremely unreliable. When he placed a t in, it pronounced it as f. He put in FOX with confidence...the toy told him it is not a word! I contacted customer service. They told me they don't have a technical support that can help me. If I want, I can write a letter to their home office. Are you kidding me? The only thing they can offer me is a discount to purchase another Leap Frog. No, thank you. Not going to happen. At first, they dare to tell me it's the first time they've ever heard about the problem. When I told her she should google and see the reviews, she said it's a known issue.They don't care, bad product, bad service, stay away parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"basically useless","review":"Our 3 year old son loved the Word Whammer... except that it didn't recognize the letters properly, therefore encouraging him to spell words incorrectly, confusing him about letter identification and not complementing him on correctly spelled words. We returned the WW and got another one only to find it had the same problem. This was a huge disappointment as we loved fridge phonics. Do NOT buy the Word Whammer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No replacement letters","review":"Although this is very idea and well made toy, it only comes with one of each letter with the exception of a few. When one letter falls under the fridge or misplaced, the toy is virtually useless as you cannot buy replacement letters. You can only repurchase it in it's entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misreads Letters, Had to Jerry-rig","review":"Bummer, this would be such a cool toy if only it read all the letters correctly. None of the small reader buttons are stuck or anything, which is the only troubleshooting tip from the website. The misreading seems to be due to the letters not fitting in snug enough to depress all the buttons for a correct read, so I've put scotch tape on the \\"roof\\" of the problem space to make the slot a tiny bit smaller. Now misreadings are less frequent/almost gone, but be careful to keep the tape near the outer edge so that the letters still push in. No, you should not have to do this to make the toy work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't recognize letters correctly, Leapfrog worst customer service","review":"My 4 year old daughter received this as a Christmas present. It didn't recognize the letters correctly (said the K was an E and the L was a K, etc...) and didn't recognize correctly spelled words. I contacted Leap Frog directly and spent 45 minutes describing the problem. Then they sent me an email and asked me to go through it all AGAIN, told me to deface the product and send them a picture of it defaced before they would send a replacement. Today I got an email saying they no longer manufacture this product and could offer me 15% off something else. Are you kidding me? Worst customer service ever. Don't waste your money.*****I DO, however, give Amazon.com 5 STARS! They are sending me a replacement with no problems. Now that's customer service. Take a lesson, LeapFrog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had such high hopes for this toy. I thought it would be a great way for my daughter to learn and practice spelling three letter words. Unfortunately, the unit did not properly recognize the correct letter in several instances. Fresh batteries resulted in no improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broke after two months but they sent a new one","review":"I sent the product back to them, since it was under warranty. They sent me a brand new one right away, and this one has worked fine for the last year or so.(Original review) My daughter received this gift and loved playing with it. She particularly liked listening to the ABC song. But after only two months, the sound does not work any more. The lights still flash, but no sound comes out. At first I thought it was the batteries, but I tried two different sets of new batteries and it still does not work. Unfortunately the Amazon return policy is only for 30 days. I am going to attempt to get a replacement through Leapfrog, and we will see how that goes. This is my second Leapfrog product that has broken after very little use, and I am starting to become wary of this company. My daughter is very sad that her toy does not work any more, but I am reluctant to buy another one because all their toys seem to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited about the concept of this toy, so I suggested my parents buy it for my son for Christmas. We love the other LeapFrog products that we own, but this one was disappointing. I too, had the problem of letter recognition with this toy. Almost every letter that we put in was identified wrong. So, my husband took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. That one did the same thing!! So, back to the store he went for a third try. This one we kept. It only identified a letter wrong once. When we tried to call LeapFrog customer service we were on hold for an hour and eventually hung up. I would not recommend this toy to anyone, because you have a very good chance of getting a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"Well, my 3.5 year old received this as a gift, it's broken, and Leap Frog will do nothing to fix it or replace it. They will do nothing to fix it because while just purchased, it sat on the store's shelf for too long. (That sure tells me something, Leap Frog.) My daughter follows the prompt and the machine incorrectly prompts her, and she says, \\"but I did it right, Mama\\" and yes, she did, but the product is incorrectly prompting her. So, not educational in the least -- just confusing to my 3 1/2 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning tool","review":"My son is 3 years old and loves using this set. It helps him recognize letters and teaches him how to spell words. I love it myself and also brought one for my best friends son."},{"rating":"1","title":"toy malfunction right out of the box","review":"the second and third slots didn't correctly recognize the letters. I bought this trying to replace a word whammer which also malfunctioned immediately out of the box. Too bad this one didn't work. Also I thought I'd at least be able to use the word whammer letters but they are too large for the Word Builder. Have to figure out how to return this now. bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for my 6 year old","review":"My son is in first grade and is really starting to develop his reading skills at school. This toy gives him a little extra practice every time he walks by the fridge. Since it only holds three letters he can only spell so many words but he plays with it every single day and I enjoy playing along with him so I'm a happy dad. There are several different modes that can be selected with the slide switch on the front so he can vary the routine so it doesn't get boring for him. You can also use the magnetic letters outside of the toy to spell words on the fridge. My only wish is for LeapFrog to come out with a longer version of this toy that would hold 5 or 6 letters so he could spell more complicated words as he gets more proficient. I highly recommend the Magnetic Word Builder for your beginning reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"This is a great little toy to have around. The kids always enjoyed playing with it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of how insanely easy it is to lose the letter pieces under the refrigerator. I wish I could just buy a replacement pack of the letters without buying the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Says wrong sounds","review":"I thought this would be a great toy for my special needs child who is beginning to read and spell words. I was disappointed when we played with it. 90% of the time it did not recognize the correct letter and would give an incorrect sound. Not helpful for a child who is learning to read. I'm stuck with it, it was a gift. I cannot take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issues - doesn't work (doesn't recognize letters)","review":"We received one for Christmas. Didn't work. Returned it. Received another one. Didn't work either. Returned it again. Got a refund. At least the returns processing at Amazon.com works well, but what a huge deception when your child is opening a toy only to have it disappear a few hours later because it's defective.Leapfrog should be ashamed of letting these products reach its customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on here??????","review":"The item says it is \\"Word Whammer\\" but the picture shows the same \\"FridgeWords\\" as the other - a stupid newly incompatible gimmick to greedily keep people from using their old letters in combinations or if (oh, how impossible!) a toddler lost a single letter from the old set. This is an vicious marketing trick by a company that doesn't care about customers at all. Can't Amazon at least get it straight and let us know if this is the old or the new version. My review is for Amazon's irresponsible labeling, not for the product, which I don't know if I should buy. I would buy it if I knew it was the compatible WordWhammer. But like everyone else, I wouldn't buy it with the new incompatibility unless I was unethically tricked into it, as so many people have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy for 4 to 5 year olds out there!","review":"I think it's really difficult to find quality learning toys that really engage my 4 year old. Like most parents these days, we have a playroom full of mostly unused toys. This toy is the exception! After receiving the Word Wammer, my four year old had figured out how to sound out phonics in a matter of days. Now, he constantly asks me to \\"give him a new word to spell\\" and in no time, he's sounded it out and spelled it.I recommended this toy to a friend and she reported the same results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory","review":"This toy is great if it works all of the time. I returned the first toy that we received as a gift because I thought it was broken. Letters can be inserted into slots and then the toy says the letter and word that corresponds. Unfortunately, a common problem with the toy is the little grooves that decipher which letter is which, get stuck quite often and when the child places a new letter in the groove, the toy incorrectly 'says' what it thinks is the new letter/word. When I returned my first 'broken' toy, the store informed me that this was a common problem and you need to run your fingers over the grooves to loosen them. This does not work all of the time. The second replacement toy has the same problem. When young children are trying to learn new letters and words, this problem can be very confusing (and annoying to the parent.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Word Whammer","review":"This is a great toy!

My only complaint is that when it's in the sounding out mode- the child can put in 3 letters and it sounds it out. This is great for learning letter sounds and putting them together. However, if it is a real word, first it says the word and then sounds the letters and the says the word one more time. I'd like my child to get a chance to try and put the sounds together, before it tells him the word.Other than that it is very fun, and my 6 year old loves playing with it even more than my 4 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This toy does not work. Does not correctly identify the letters and the little word game functions do not work either. This product was given to my child by a well meaning relative three years ago. Never have gotten it to work correctly and is a waste of hard earned money. Be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy extra as gifts / some possible improvements still","review":"These are just great. I have bought extras as gifts.In future versions it would be nice for it to hold even more than 3 letters.Also, it would be nice to be able to buy more sets of letters. With little kids you will loose some, at least temporarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fridge Words NOT Word Whammer - letters incompatible","review":"The item by Leapfrog in the shape of an airplane with space for three letters is the FRIDGE WORDS toy. These letters ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE as the letters used with Fridge Phonics from Leapfrog (the toy that fits one size letter). Very disappointing. I believe that the WORD WHAMMER letters (old version of the FRIDGE WORDS) might be interchangeable with the Fridge Phonics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy - electronically malfunctioned toy","review":"This toy would be great, but only if it worked correctly. Right out of the box and the third letter slot would say the incorrect sound and letter. Obviously from reading the other posts there have been similar problems. It is not worth the time and money to buy this toy and then end up returning it. Wait until Leapfrog comes up with a better product or recalls this toy for all its problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this gets 4 stars","review":"I love leap frog and have never had a problem with there products before. I am so disappointed with this one. The word whammer would not recognize letters properly. I changed the batteries and cleaned it as it says to do in the handbook but nothing worked. With many of the same reviews I'm not sure if I should exchange it for another one or return it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Christmas morning bummer","review":"I'm on my second Word Whammer now because I didn't want my grandson to have to wait for a replacement through the mail. (I ordered the first one online, but not from Amazon--a mistake I won't make again.) The first space of WW consistently gave an incorrect letter and sound. When I contacted LeapFrog via e-mail, I had to wait a week for a reply. Then they gave lengthy instructions on how I could fix the problem. Spend time fixing a brand new toy? I don't think so! So I'm returning it to LeapFrog for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but unreliable letter recognition","review":"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift last year and it has never worked properly. It started off with one space not working and the company recomended cleaning the sensors with rubbing alcohol and still it has only gotten worse. It is very frustrating for my three year old who knows her letters and the toy gets it wrong and tells her she is wrong. It is very disappointing that the company could not offer any better resolution than to clean the contacts of a new toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Second Ones Did Not Work","review":"Our first Fridge Words toy we purchased incorrectly identified about 1/3 of the letters. We changed the batteries, but it still did not work. We easily (Amazon is awesome!) exchanged it for a second Fridge Words toy. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem. I am so excited about using this toy with my four year old, that I think I will exchange it one more time. Third time is a charm! If the third one works, then I will edit this review to give a more current opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound and not fun for baby <2Y","review":"I recently bought it for the training usage for my little girl who is 2 years old and one month now.but the toy can't attract her attention, and besides the sound is very very poor that I barely understandwhat the toy says( English is not my native language). I decide to return the toy during 7 days trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T READ LETTERS CORRECTLY","review":"Where to start... we have just about every Leap Frog toy ever put out after 2007. Naturally this one would follow the alphabet set one (which was great). I thought it would help my son begin blending the letters into words, but we purchased this DEFECTIVE item before reading the reviews on it. The device won't read the letters correctly. My son puts letters in there thinking he spelled a word correctly. P.O.S. THEN, I called up the company and wasted 15 minutes getting no where and became extremely frustrated (as you can see I still am). The representative couldn't even spell my name correctly and my first and last name are each 5 letters long and ENGLISH. Bottom line: we're stuck with a crappy toy that doesn't even work and the company can't do anything about it. DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S.!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product that needs just a little tweaking.","review":"This is almost a really perfect product. I think these improvements need to be made:1.) Sound clarity. Some of the letters are hard to distinguish.2.) \\"Word Hunt\\" and \\"Word Builder\\" would be greatly improved if a sample sentence were included. ESPECIALLY since the sound is a bit slurred.3.) If a child isn't reading yet (which I assume is the point of the toy), the labeled mode switch at the bottom is meaningless. I would prefer icons that allow kids to use the product independently.4.) I'm a little concerned that a toddler could get choked on the pieces. They are small enough to fit in a mouth.Overall, though, I love this product line. It makes learning tactile and fun. My son loves taking the plane off the fridge and soaring it through the air. Great concept, and I'm excited about using it to teach him the foundations of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"valuable educational toy","review":"I bought this to add onto another alphabet fridge magnet toy from leapfrog.

Why does Amazon continue to sell it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept; Poor quality","review":"Unfortunately we are really disappointed with this toy. My 2 year old picked it out herself to purchase with a gift certificate she received for Christmas. Out of the box it did not recognize letters in the 3rd position correctly. After playing with the little buttons that it uses to recognize the letters it worked... for about 3 days. Now it thinks there are letters in the 2nd and 3rd position when there is only one in the 1st position. And when it is feeling less tempermental, the 2nd and 3rd position don't state the correct letters. My 4 year old knows her letters and keeps trying to explain to our 2 year old that is not the right letter - to no avail. When their interest wains a bit, this toy will certainly disappear. Very disappointing for a LeapFrog item!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"we had gotten this toy for my son's birthday. Well after he played with it a while it got dropped, then it didn't work right it just keep saying the same thing over and over, if you tried to spell a word it would finish the word but not the song, so I took it back and got another one the same thing happened to this one like a week or two later. I liked the toy but I guess if your kids are ruff it is not the one. He liked it before it broke. My daughter also liked it but she only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudice in word choice","review":"At first I thought this toy was a great way to allow my son to learn phonics and for the most part it was. Until we started playing around the word builder function that I realized Leapfrog selectively de-sensitize the word \\"GOD\\". It does not recognize it and all it said was it's a good word. What?! Huh?! Regardless of my religious belief, I don't want to give a false impression to the little one that G-O-D isn't a word! Hello, Leapfrog, of all people and for someone who attempts to be an educator, you ought to know the difference between merely teaching a word over proselytizing others.how far do we go with this kind of prejudice. give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's broken!","review":"I really love the idea of this toy, because it's good for kids a many stages. We got it for my 1 year old for Christmas (2012). It's a magnet so we just kept it on the fridge. It helped my 1 year old with letter recognition and speech development and the songs and funny sounds cracked him up. My 2 year old liked it too and it helped him develop a few 3 letter sight words. But, it sometimes said the wrong letter name for the letter you put it. As the weeks went on it started doing that more and more often. A few says ago it stopped working altogether. It still get's power but the lights are stuck on and it doesn't name the letters you put in or anything else. It was great while it lasted, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"We have most of the Leap Frog magnetic toys, sorry to see them being discontinued.

This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for. Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes. It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side. Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball. It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting. I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room. Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl. Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for smart cats!","review":"I have a half-Siamese and he got the food out of the balls in record time.

Most of the rest, however, while not exactly lackluster, are simply more of the same. Which isn't exactly a bad thing, seeing as how that means the album on the whole is much better than most of the stuff out there.

It's just an hour long toy commercial with the product forced down your throats every two minutes...and eventually every four seconds.The film follows EXACTLY the same plot as the series: The characters talk ENDLESSLY about the rules of the game, using card strategies that seem to come out of...nowhere, before pulling out a \\"shocking card that turns the tide\\" all whilst explaining this to the audience who have no clue what is going on.The series is rubbish, the film only has moments of quality humour (from Pegasus, who steals the film) but apart from that, it's a toy commercialIf you want to see a movie that is worth watching AND will keep children buying toys, watch the all time classic Transformers: The Movie, or Pokemon 2000, those films have1.

The animation was not as well done as the series, but it was ok. I would have liked it better if they had talked more about Anubis and Yami's relation to the past. This movie is basically one big duel. I really don't like the show because of the card game, i like it because of Yami! If it didn't have Yami, i wouldn't watch it. Ahem, back to the movie. If you like Yu-gi-oh, i would rent it first. If you really like it then buy it. I saw it in theatures. The card i got with my ticket was BESD.

Yugioh: The Boredom!","review":"I rented this at Blockbuster. This movie is boring. The main villan is Anubis and he only appears in the movie for 5 minutes. The movie does not flow well. More than half of the movie is about one duel and if it is all about one duel, they should make it good. Right? The duel only contained a few cards. They kept playing the same cards, reviving them, attacking, and you get the point. You will regret getting this. The duel is so boring. Anubis is what this movie is supposed to be about and he appears and it takes 5 minutes to destroy him. This will just make duelists believe that the cards used in the movie are good and they are not. And since when will someone come up to you and say \\"Duel me and the loser dies\\"? My suggestion is to stay away from this. The first 30 minutes are good and then it degenerates.

This book teaches children to accept things \\"as the best\\" without reacting emotionally to what goes on and to maintain balance and stay focused on what they are doing -- primary values to happiness. The whimsical illustrations awaken the senses and highten the enjoyment. It's an excellent book to promote conversation with children on how to accept what comes, maintain balance and remain focused with the end result of happiness.

They have also refused to reimburse me the $50 shipping cost for sending the unit to their nearest service center. The quality of the unit doesnt matter to me anymore.

He quilts, knits, needlepoints, surfaces huge areas with mosiacs, has his own fabric line, and holds workshops internationally. He was born in San Francisco but now lives in England. I taught myself to needlepoint from this book. As a beginner, I started out small by making two spectacles (Eye Glasses) cases. Then I went on and made a pansy cushion (throw pillow). I find Kaffe Fassett's designs to be beautiful and colorful, which is refreshing especially when it's nothing but gray clouds outside. I recommend this book and any or all of Kaffe Fassett's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A filled out workbook","review":"Ok, so I know I bought a lab workbook used to save money. I'm aware of that.

I bought this book thinking I would find some scholarship opportunities and just found myself fustrated and out of 25 bucks. The book is not organized well and all the scholarships have very strict criteria making it almost impossible to find a scholarship you match for. This book may be good for a school guidance office, but because of the disorganization it is probably useless for a student to sit in the office looking at thousands of scholarships they are not qualified for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice balls, feel good in your hands.

Most of the video focuses and problems with evolution and then concluding thatif any aspect of evolution is incorrect then the only possible alternative is creationism. Crosses the line into anti-intellectualism with a touch of conspiracy theory.The logic behind the presented arguments is simplistic, leading to errant conclusions.Finally the conclusion of the video is that it is wrong to exclude creationism from the classroom.The video boils down to a \\"it's us against them\\" argument. Less than 2 minutes over the course of the entire video is dedicated to evaluating creationism."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was immediately dissapointed in this soundtrack.","review":"I first bought this soundrack as an LP record back in the 80's. I more recently purchased it on CD and I listen to it very seldem. I don't know what gets into the minds of soundrack producers that often encourages them to offer new arrangements to the music originally featured in a film or in this case a TV show. I was so looking forward to hearing the great music from the Addams Family TV series unaltered. While some of the music is very much like or actually is the same as in the TV show more of it has rather bizarre altered arrangements for unknown reasons. I know that Mr. Mizzy has the masters and I believe owns the rights to all the original music cues for the Addams Family and how I wish he would make them available to all of us who loved the music in this series. Let's all write to him and encourage such a release."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Vic Mizzy must have gone to the Enlish 1960s School of Chamber Pop. The Adam's Family soundtrack is based on the harpsichord.This is not rock, but graceful program music with a baroque vibe and some jazz touches, like tenor sax, and some nice 60s guitar twang.And it does work as music. This is definately a product of the era, but the composing is intrinsically good, and this holds up quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original music from the TV show","review":"This is NOT the original music from the TV show. It's over-orchestrated and over-produced and very dated. It may have been \\"scored FOR the TV show,\\" but it is most definitely NOT the music used IN the TV show. It's one of those things produced most likely to cash in on an original's popularity but without understanding just what it was that was so appealing about the original. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS AN OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK???","review":"This cd is a real stinker. That's right, a real stinker. most of the tracks sound like they were done by that Brazil 66 band. And the rest sound like the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. I could have put together a much better soundtrack than this pathetic attempt. Amazon doesn't want to let you hear samples because they are not the actual music cues heard in the show and they know it sucks. Don't be fooled. Trust me, if you really know The Addams Family tv show, this cd will only serve to anger you.

They are tremendously silly and fun, and meant for light-hearted listening. A friend of mine gave me a copy on cassette tape back in the 80's (now that's scary!) and I was so sorry when the tape was eaten by someone's car tape player. I never forgot the music, though, so when I had a chance to buy this I pounced on it. My absolute favorites are \\"Gomez\\"- so bouncy, eccentric and happy, and \\"Morticia\\"- ethereal as the character herself, but others on this collection are quite catchy as well. If you can take creepy and kooky, buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 thumbs down - too jazzy","review":"I just sampled all these tracks on amazon, and none of them, minus the very last track, sound anything like the original score music from the show.

The rich dialog and description. This one has none of that. In fact the dialog between Melrose and Jury in the first chapter sounded like a beginning writer's attempt at pithy dialog. I'm about half way through and keep wondering if this book was ghost written. It is truly terrible. These great characters deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely dull!","review":"I bought this because reviews on the back cover stated it was as good as Sayers, Christie, etc.Indescribable boredom best describes my feeling prior to putting the book in the bin - I could not even give it to a charity bookshop - it was so dull!!The English speech patterns are obviously derived from Coronotaion Street or such like soaps - while the effect sought is apparently PG Wodehouse with a touch of The Nine Tailors.Characters have tedious conversations, the hero - a Scotland Yard policeman - apparently has no work to do, but he is in love with a Lady Kennington - therefore very posh! The only entertaining character is the owner of an antiques shop - but that's just because he is very rude about everybody else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical Pieces Dropped like Confetti","review":"Oy vey! This is my first--and last--Martha Grimes. No respect for forensics. Tedious characters (the Scotland Yard guy hires an illiterate numbskull with illegible handwriting for his sectretary!). A whole chapter on arcane antiques that does nothing for what bits and flotsam of plot there may be.And that's the main trouble with this book. Instead of a straight forward telling of a story, we have tiny bread crumbs of story scattered all over the place. Key information for solving the crime (was the victim killed where she was found or elsewhere?) is withheld and amiable chitchat substituted. What's worse, if you soldier thru to the end (I didn't; my husband told me the ending), the method of the first murder is truly impossible.UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not reconize the characters in this latest Jury novel.","review":"The names are the same in the Richard Jury series,but the personalities are so different in the previous books.

The best I've read since I've forgotten when. It made me realize why I love the English language so, beautifully written. I understand perfectly why Miss Cornwell says Grimes' work is poetry for the way she writes and the words Miss Grimes uses are those of a poet. Beautiful scenery, lifelike characters and a thoroughly satisfying end. Undoubtetly it has been said before but for once I don't mind repeating another man's words: an absolute must!! Since this was the first Richard Jury (and Martha Grimes) book I've read I'll be drawn inside every bookshop by an irresistable force: the other books by Martha Grimes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading!","review":"I have read all of the Inspector Jury novels and enjoyed each of them. Not so with this last. The writing was weak from beginning to middle (where I finally had had enough and put it aside).

This is the first book in a long time which has tempted me to break this rule, and after painstakingly having finished reading it, I wished I had spared myself the agony and shelved it after the first few boring chapters. The characters are unidimensional and dated, the plot is predictable and dull and the pace is incredibly slow. I would only recommend this book to those who are looking for a healthier alternative to Nytol. This was my first and definitely also my last exposure to Grimes' work. I will be donating my copy to the library without any regrets, but I will not do this without first entering a caveat on the flyleaf...beware of terminal boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only got about one third into the book and shelved it!","review":"Wish I read the reviews here before I bought the Case is Altered..my first experience with Martha Grimes, and probably my last. Didn't grab me quick enough, or am I being too impatient? Any of you reviewers, who panned the book, got a recommendation for me in the mystery genre?

I heard him solo with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, and he literally brought the house down. He also was the only player in the band whose suit didn't fit him. On this album, he plays with a mixture of soulfulness and dazzle that really is quite inimitable. He even contributes a lovely flute solo. Garry Dial plays well, as do the other members of their quartet--there is even a delicious string section. But this really is Dick Oatts's show. As with other CDs from DMP, the sound engineering is a total delight. I rarely have heard a piano recorded so realistically. This album should make you want to hear other CDs by these artists, including the excellent Dial and Oatts Play Cole Porter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic program","review":"My 4 year old daughter loves this program, as well as another title in the series called Shapes.

The coverage area was the primary reason for this purchase. The built in timer I've found more useful than I anticipated. One thing I discovered is it's very important to keep the screen at the water inlet clean. The timer doesn't work properly if the water flow is restricted by a clogged screen. This is easy to do with an old toothbrush and some rust cleaner. You'd be surprised how much junk flows through the hoses.Adjustment is easy and performance is great as long as you keep it clean.

That needs to be made PUBLIC knowledge...upfrontNow, once I spent time with the sprinkler and fooled around with all the knobs and learned all of its many capabilities I am pleased with the product.

I had been expantant when I purchased it, thinking that Sicx's style would be more like \\"Dead for Life\\" (a most deserving album, with a 5 star showing as well), but what I found was so much more. Were i albe to, I'd rate this higher than available \\"5\\" rating. In a style combining the sounds of an obvious horror genre root with most depictive lyrics, Sicx manages to forge ahead, showcasing his already apparent talents on song after song. Fish hooks, clips from Hellraiser 3, bodies missing parts, plus more personal moments involving feelings and talking to devils meshes into one of the finest showcases for talent that I've ever seen. With the melodies now keyed to a darker sound and Sicx aparently focused, the album seems more complete and more impactive. It needs you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but Boring","review":"This young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice, albeit a little underpowered, but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. There is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties.

The acting was HORRENDOUS! I felt like i was watching fledgling student actors improv about 95% of the movie. The death scenes were completely uninventive and unexciting. The plot could have been really cool, but the directing, production, cinematography and acting were all sooooooooooooooooooo bad that there was no saving this disaster of a movie. I also want to state how shocked I was at the camera work and overall movie \\"QUALITY\\"...because this movie looked like it was filmed on a 500 dollar camcorder.

As a newcomer to IT generally, reading this book enabled me to understand better the Operating Systems course at Imperial College. I think the reading of this book should precede any approach to a course on operating systems. As a final note, Jeff Kramer is one of the most popular lecturers at the department of computing of Imperial College. Many other studens I spoke too were convinced that his teaching was by far the most efficient. I strongly recommend the book! I still use it at work as an ever useful reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book was a required text in a graduate course in Software Engineering that I had taken. As many other reviewers said, it is solid on theory but lacks from a practical standpoint. None of the new threading features in J2SE 5 are covered which is a significant drawback. For beginners to threading, this book does a decent job of illustrating some of the issues/problems that will be encountered and potential ways to solve them. The book's website has applets that allows the reader to see some of the problems in action which is nice. However, if you are already working in the industry and you need to use threads, a better choice would be Java Concurrency In Practice by Brian Goetz."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but good nonetheless","review":"I really wish that it had been noted that this album dates from 1936-1937 and that this is a mono recording. The music is vintage Rubenstein at his prime (age 50). He was nearly 96 when he died in 1982. The notes included with the CD could have been written by a 3rd grader; no first names, only initials (J.

Its really just an expansion pack -- a good one (unlike loopy landscapes and the other one which didn't really add much).

Well apparently this wasn't it.As others have indicated, it really is a weak offering and lacks anything so spectacular that you are able to ignore the major glitches in the game. I won't list them because I notice other reviews have found most of the same ones I encountered.What's really sad is RollerCoaster Tycoon seems to have been embraced by educators as a teaching tool for students so I expected much more out of this offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Original RTC fans~","review":"This sequel is such a major disappointment for those of us who have played and fell in love with the original RTC and those expansion packs. Too many choices have been taken away and the real strategy and skill needed in the original game has been dimished. Very very limited graphic improvements, some even negative graphic changes. A few more rides but many of your fun choices for scenery and themes is gone. This pack is a HUGE disappointment for RTC fans and the only good thing is...it will definitely cure you of those late night, 5 hour RTC playing sessions.

Before you pre-order this title, take a look at the screenshots for the new game. You can find some on the company's website or any PC game review website. The sequel looks EXACTLY like the original game. They've altered the roller coaster design features a little and inserted a few different rides but overall, this game is almost a carbon copy of the first one. If you enjoyed Corkscrew Follies and the other expansion game, this game is for you as all it really is is more maps and a few more rides but if you're expecting something different (which I always do with sequels) you're going to be horribly disappointed.

The ability to stack scenery allows you to built nice scenery for your coasters and increase the exitement rating. If you liked the first, buy the second. One thing is the Six Flags junk. Who really cares? I mean really, all it is is a bunch of pre built coasters that noone goes on cause there \\"Too intense for me!\\" and a bunch of pre built parks that have WAY too many trees and WAY to much scenery.

The 1st is better because the scenarios are nicer than the 2nd or 3rd.

Whatever improvements or additions I was anticipating turned out not to be exciting and I actually found RCT2 less absorbing than RCT1. One of the most tedious items I found was having all the scenary remain if you demolish a ride that you built including scenary. In addition, most of the challenges in the various scenarious in RCT2 are long and boring. I found I spent a large amount of time detangling walkways and rearranging the scenary included in the scenarious so my visitors would not die of thirst and hunger and I would not have to spend the bulk of my $ on maintenance.

This game is realistic might I add. It costs mmoney to tear down trees! But realistic can sometimes be better. You can select playing on an already made park, or a real six flags park. There are six flag's rides you can buy throughout the game too. Basically what you do is buy a piece of land, have an objective, an then start building a park with rollercoasters, food places, merry-go-rounds, and a whole lot of other stuff. As you go on through the game you can buy more varied types of rollercoasters and more scenery. This game, in my view, is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks!","review":"This new Rollercoaster Tycoon game rocks becase there are new types of coasters such as a giga coaster or a multidimetion roller coaster!

These are wood, I really like the synthetic ones better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price....you get what you pay for.","review":"Most of the dominoes are misshapen and of different sizes.

I will not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are dominoes.","review":"I can't fault the advertising, they are double-nine dominoes, and they are wood.

So you buy it. You take it home, you play with it. You say to yourself, \\"I can't wait to read this.\\" Then you read it. Yeah, the first section is relatively good, then you get to your favorite character. What's new? Crap. The characters are not how they are in the game. Scorpion is a wus. Kung Lao is a dork.

Like I said Mr bean without the funny)then they find fluid that starts to morf mr bean in to an alien (I had hoped the movie would start at about 45 min in: it did NOT) then there is allot of shooting aliens and people that are blown up with b rated special effects/ graphics. If you can take it, with the mind numbing video, the end has the only 2 minutes of viewable move (you can get these without the wait by watching the trailer if you watch the trailer you have watched the only part of the movie that is worth seeing.If you have not opened the package you might want to get your money back from TRISTAR PICTURES. it is really that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released to the Theater.

One would expect that with such skills, they would have been capable of creating something worth watching.

I live science fiction, but this was a complete and utter dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"District 9","review":"This movie was overrated. I think the biggest hype pusher was the fact that Peter Jackson had anything to do with it. \\"Peter Jackson Presents\\" is what you saw at the movie theater trailers and and the beginning on the dvd. He neither wrote nor directed it. I'll just lay out what sucked in this movie:CGIThe aliens (I mean come on, if they are so intelligent, why are they so obsessed with rummaging through garbage and getting cat food? They resembled ghetto slum people, not an intelligent alien race...)The shaky camera work. It strained my eyes really bad. I wish they stopped with that.It didn't feel like it was making any sense most of the time.

This movie was nothing like I was expecting. First off it was disturbing and out right disgusting, second it made no sense. It never actually explained why the aliens were there , how they even got there, and left you hanging in the end. The movie was really more focused on the main character and his whole situation but didn't really give much insight about the aliens. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 star review instead of a 1 star is because there were pretty funny scenes that were the only entertainment I got out of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb !","review":"Not a very good sci-fi.its kinda gory, but the does not make the interesting.Just wait till its free on cable tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit more action violence than needed, but compelling","review":"The action scenes in this film go on for quite some time and are rather frequent. However, one can't help but feel sympathy for both the unfortunate aliens and for the hapless human who gets caught up in matters he never thought he would be involved in. One can detect many implications and ideas here, from racism and xenophobia to the problems of refugees, to the status that would be given to aliens who are stuck here, to the morality of using them for medical experiments, and much more. You don't need to be a sci fi fan to understand the deeper meanings of what the filmmakers are getting across. They also have done a fantastic job with the aliens--their look, their movements, and even their expressions.It's also telling that they set the movie in Johannesburg, South Africa--I don't need to explain why. Definitely worth a look and may be worth further discussion even in a classroom setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Not much to compair it to. It is so different and it blew my mind.

From the way the aliens look to the shanty town they live in; which was presented in such a realistic way that one's attention was continuously transfixed on the images on the screen. The heroes of the story are both tragic and heroic at the same time and the real question I left the theater wondering is if this was a prophetic tale of how we might treat our first alien visitors? There's little doubt in my mind that the way the corporations where presented in this film was dead on accurate. The acquisition of new and more advanced alien technology would boost any greedy companies' bank account. This movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered at the end; but that is part of the excitement. Were left wondering about the fates of the main characters and will the protost return in three years as promised?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick","review":"Exciting and well worth watching.

Not to spoil anything, but District 9 had great special effects given it was made outside of Hollywood, and a storyline that wasn't so linear and predictable like Avatar's.I loved this movie, and hope they will one day make a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Fiction..","review":"I hadn't seen this anywhere to rent, so just decided to buy it so my husband could see it (I saw this movie with a friend at the theater).

A completely different approach. There are reviews on here that put the movie down but they can't offer any reasonable example why. I'm just guessing that they aren't even sci-fi fans to begin with. \\"The worst movie I ever watched\\", lmao. I wonder how many reviews one person uses that phrase in. The movie is one of those that make you think about right and wrong and hate the idea of oppression. Compassion. Why do people hate and fear something they don't understand? That is what this movie is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER !","review":"This has to be the worst movie ever. Don't waste your money on this garbage.

I fought the urge to get up and leave thru the entire movie and when the end came I really wished that I had left. That is two hours of my life I will never get back.

If you have two hours to waste I would use it doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"WALKED OUT","review":"I am not a professional theater critic but I know what I like and this aint it! If I could rate it no stars I would. This was the first time EVER that I walked out of a theater and went to another movie to \\"wash the images out of my mind\\"! The documentary form was lousy to say the least. It had good potential in the story line, but turned it to a total waste of time! I am not proud to say that I stayed 3/4 of the way thru to give it a chance, but I couldnt stand it anylonger and left!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"They had the potential to make a pretty good movie here and completely blew it. If they had spent even a tenth of the time trying to make it good as they spent trying to make it gross it might have been an OK movie.

It was a terrible movie & not worth seeing. It's not original, in the sense that bad movies have been made before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Moive","review":"This movie should be at least in the top 5 worst movies of all time if not the worst. Awful, horrendous, boring, stupid or ridiculous could all be used to describe this movie. The point where you think, it has to get better, trust me it never does. I didn't know garbage gets rated 5 stars and I didnt want to give this 1 star. It was a painful struggle to finish this movie, 0 enjoyment. I will NEVER watch this pathetic movie again. The people that rated this movie 5 stars must have seen a different movie. As bad of a movie as Torque or Alone in the Dark were, they are drastically ahead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossed","review":"You can't turn away. From the first moment, the film's style won't turn you loose. At its core, this seems like a re-make of some other movie, but the setting (South Africa), the accents, the actors, the special effects, combined with the pacing and inability to guess the outcome, make the film a unique experience. I recommend it for family viewing, if your kids can handle the gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Unexpected","review":"This was a totally unexpected movie... the greatest Sci Fi I've seen in a long time. It was so unexpected that I made the mistake of sitting very close to the screen. One advice, if you go see it, sit in the back row, or you will get dizzy... But nevertheless it was GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"this was a great movie in the theaters and it is even better on my couch with a great surround system. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper Hit","review":"You owe it to yourself to give this movie a shot. I admit I was about to turn it off after 20 minutes, but I'm sure glad that I didn't. There is an excellent lesson in humanity you will learn by watching this movie to completion. The entire direction this movie was taken is truly revolutionary. It is not like other movies you have seen, and just like in life, sometimes change is a good a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth Renting","review":"I only spent a couple bucks renting this flick...that was a couple too many. Absolutely not something I would have expected to see from the LOTR/King Kong super team behind Peter Jackson. I strongly believe that was 112 minutes better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"District 9","review":"Not my cup of tea,would recommend to die-hard scifi fans. I should have known since Peter Jackson(Lord of the rings EW!) presents it, and this is a rookie director's first movie(hopefully the last? or no sequel)The movie is not bad, it's just the message that somehow Human beings are bad and greedy. That we would use alien technology,etcera. Another one of those deep social messages like avatar. First off, If it were aliens they would do the same thing.Second, Yes it's science fiction. but poor science fiction. sorry but I don't want preachy over-lying \\"Anti-Imperialist\\" themes that are so passe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and not so great as advertised","review":"I was so excited to get this DVD and watch it but it disappointed me. The first 30-40 minutes of the movie is just confusing and does not make sense much. The rest of the movie is violent, inhumane and full of gory scenes. It did not have an iota of message about humanity or did I miss something? Any how, I did not get the story line and do not recommend this movie. It's overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"From the first scene I was waiting for the documentary format to change to the real story. It never happened.

If you enjoy a good sci-fi yarn w/ cool E.T.s and big laughs, then D9 should definitely hover your UFO..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving the District 9 Blu-ray","review":"I see a lot of reviews that comment on the movie District 9 itself. However I believe that the reviews should be talking about the Blu-ray disc itself and not the content of the movie. I have a 32\\" TV and the blu-ray quality looks great on it. There is no grain and the movie looks like what it's suppose to look like: High-Definition.The humans look sharp and the color is well defined on the edges. The prawns (the aliens in the movies) stand out because of the higher detail that the Bluray Disc ensues.I can't comment on the audio because I had to listen through my crappy TV speakers but it's suppose to default to lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dolby Digital","review":"The big problem I have with this disk is that it does not have an unfettered Dolby Digital track (it does have a \\"descriptive\\" track which means in addition to the surround your have to listen to a narrator describe each scene). I do not have a DTS receiver so my only choice is PCM with only gives me stereo, not surround, which significantly diminishes the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"The movie is very unusual which you may like. I didn't like it. It started in a slow documentary style and continued in that style off and on. It was a gritty kind of sci fi futuristic movie. I thought that it was boring and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Hand-held Camera Work May Induce Nausea","review":"Warning! When movie critics review a movie, they should include a warning about the unfortunate trend that directors seem to be over-indulging in -- hand-held cameras. The premise of this movie intrigued me immensely. Right off, I wanted to stick around and watch how it developed. I'm guessing the director thought the hand-held camera work would convey a more documentary-like feeling of verite and a sense of urgency. However, after about 15 minutes of watching jittery hand-held, fast-panned, jumpy movements on the screen, the only sense of urgency I had was to leave the theatre, right away. I had to settle for a retelling of the movie's plot and conclusion from my husband. Perhaps it will not be as nausea-inducing on the small screen as it was on the big one. If not, take your dramamine before viewing and then, enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very big let down","review":"I have not been so let down by a movie since There Will Be Blood. I just didn't see the great movie that everybody was raving about. Aliens and special effects were pretty good and the ending was a good surprise. But the movie dragged and dragged. Cannot recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good at all, rent first!","review":"Careful with what people say here. Anyone who says \\"This is the best film of the year\\" or \\"The best film ever\\" cast a skeptic eye on those comments. No way this is better than \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Public Enemies\\" or \\"Avatar\\" This is clearly a grade 'B' sci fi along the lines of \\"Cloverfiled\\" To save money on production costs, you are not even shown a clear, hi-def image of the space ship until near the end. Not the best screenwiting either in my opinion. You are mostly jostled around as a third party video cam reporter. This does not lend to very much replay value since you never really feel engaged. Save a few dollars on a potential dog in your collection by renting this first like I did and see if you like it enough to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Action packed, good storyline, great special effects, what more can I say? I enjoyed it. I've added it to my home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Ripped off on \\"Digital Copy.\\"","review":"District 9 is a great movie, and Sharlto Copley does an incredible acting job in this film, in my opinion. The only reason I couldn't give this 5 stars is that I ordered this Blu-ray this past April, and when I entered the code to redeem the digital copy included, I kept getting an \\"invalid code\\" error. I was perplexed until I noticed in the fine print that the digital copy has to be redeemed by 12/29/2010.

This is strange sice the disk is a sony product and so is my Player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly mediocre...","review":"I love sci-fi but I recommend that you Netflix this if one if you want to see it. The movie lacks momentum and it is true challenge to like or even relate to the protagonist. The whole movie seems to be the background or setup for another movie. The solid special effects and cinematography does not make up for the lack of interest I felt. I am glad I did watch it on blu-ray because I could at least fast-forward through parts of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trailers were the best parts of the movie","review":"I had not seen the movie but thought it would be a good sci-fi flick for me. Well should have rented it first. Most of the movie was in the format of a documentary. Similar to the opening sequence for the old TV show \\"Alien Nation\\". I am not a fan of that perspective in a movie. Special effects/CGI were pretty good but that was about it. The movie did leave itself open for a sequel which I would not see unless it was produced as a normal movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Box","review":"Peter Jackson's done it again!

I'd give my 4 stars to Star Trek ANYDAY. I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this space fluff :( I think its just a lot of Peter Jackson worshippers out there trying to pump this film up. No Thanks guys.It was just so campy and ridiculous. I could also compare it to Evil Dead, which I could never completely sit through.I think a lot of people are going to be scratching their heads about this getting so many good reviews....Next!I'll be watching the $5 bluray rental of wolverine tonight, I hope it will not be as disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"PS3 owners beware!","review":"Even though you can go through multiple setting changes to try, this blue ray does not work on play station 3.It simply doesn't work.

The player I have is the slowest loader ever (Sony BDP-S300) so I just spent a half hour while it loaded previews then finally a screen with graphics and no play button multiple times. Then, it just sits on a black screen forever then says can't play. Man I wish HD-DVD had won. I never had a slow load with HD-DVD or any problems. The thing that sucks with sony as well is if your on a Mac they have to send you an update. Which means for me, buy another player just to see HD of district 9, or wait for an update to see if that works. Or, send the disc back. anyone else have problems? I will never buy another Sony blu-ray playr that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"District minus 4","review":"I rented this movie because I'm a big sci-fi fan. The special effects are okay, but in no way carry this movie.The main character is almost Monty Phythonish and the whole \\"documentary style\\" is unbelievable to the point of being laughable at times.What's worse is that the whole premise of the movie is ridiculos and it never explains anything about why the aliens came or arrived here, or anything else about them even though they apparently understand English better than the employees at your local McDonalds and we understand them perfectly. I guess Dan Rather wasn't avaiable to do a sit down interview with them.This movie had as much forethought about plot development as a Don Knotts movie.My advice; rent or buy something else; this is 112 minutes of my life I'll never get back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, no resolution","review":"Even the most basic student of storytelling (in whatever format) knows that a great story must have an introduction, a conflict, and ultimately a climax and a resolution. This movie is strong on intro and plot, but weak on climax and a failure on resolution. What is the ultimate outcome???? The movie criticizes apartheid (Congratulations, I think everyone in the modern world agrees apartheid was evil), but what is the end of the story????

Alien Nation was infinitely better as a comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage","review":"Is it just me ... I don't know - I don't care. I hated this movie. I don't like movies that do newsreels and reality TV show type. I am throwing it out - I watched 45 minutes of it and that was enough. Had I been in the theater I would have walked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left the theater","review":"I attempted to see this movie while it was playing in the theater. I had not walked out on a movie since 1972. Maybe it was my frame of mind. Although the story seemed compelling. There were just too many \\"bodily fluids\\" in the movie. I found it more of a gross-out than virtually every \\"slasher\\" film I have ever seen. After sitting through about half the movie, I decided that this wasn't doing me any good and left. If you can stomach the gore, it appeared to have a good underlying story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"A completely horrible movie. The idea behind it was alright, but the execution was atrocious. It was a boring blend of faux-documentary and tried to perceive a semblance of emotion with the whole family angle.

The film needed a better film direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"i\\"ve seen worse but not much worse. i hate how the camera guy jerks the camera around. it was hard to follow. i would compare it to cloverfield. which was totally worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci Fi movie","review":"I went to see Transformers 2 knowing pretty much what to expect, and ended up being let down.I went to see this movie in theaters shortly after, not knowing what to expect at all, and i was blown away.

Actually, forget the dollar amount. If you didn't know it was low budget, one would still enjoy the special effects and true to the best sci-fi, great message about society's incredible ability for intolerance. It's a fast, powerful punch to our society's history and current viewpoints of intolerance and hate towards different races or species or sexual orientations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Glad I rented it.

I was only able to watch the first 30 minutes before I was overcome by motion sickness.I've googled around, and this is a pretty common complaint of this movie. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A teenage boy's wet-dream..","review":"Great if you like big handheld weapons and people spectacularly being blown up by them, special effects were good.

This was basically a bunch of dribble built around some good CGI aliens that were caught on earth because they lost a piece of their spaceship that was (for some unknown reason) parked over the slums of Johannesburg. They actually showed the piece coming off the ship but could not find it???????????? and were magically stuck on earth for the next 20 years; give me a break!!! The fooooking actors were bad, bad, bad in there Africani style, and in a lot of scenes, hard to understand (Duhhh). I had the distinction of watching this right after Inglourious basterds; Oh my God, my brain is full of dribble and I need to flush it out with a good movie.

S.Fuller, J.Frankenhimer, and E.Kazan made movies that remind me of this one, not in the plot but the way it makes you feel. Its a little twisted but great. The idea is to make something new and different, and this is. If you like things that stray from the norm this is for you.

This movie is more of a morality allegory than hard sci-fi. There isn't much of an explanation about the alien's home or their culture, it's more about their experience living side by side with humanity. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"District 9 is AWESOME!!!","review":"I just finished watching the dvd today, the date of it's release and it is on of the new films that lived up to the hype. It is definitely one of the best films this year and also one of the best in the sci fi category. To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it at first. The first part is shot in documentary style and pretty violent. But once it settles down and focuses on the main characters it when it really kicks into gear. T The special effects are good. But unlike so many films with good special effects, it is a human/alien interest story as well with well written characters too. The alien boy's relationship with his father was my favorite and something that we all can relate too in one way or the other. I can not remember the last time I felt so good at the end of a movie, knowing I had seen something so entertaining. Highly recommended and definitely a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I did not enjoy this movie at all. It took a very long time for it to develop and I lost interest in it before I finished watch it. I couldn't sit down and endure it till it finished, so I really don't know how it ended. The documentary type format was a bad idea. It didn't feel like I was watching a movie, it felt like I was watching a crappy documentary. The aliens were just big, ugly savages. I love alien movies! But this one really disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a negative star rating","review":"This was the worst of the year. Kept waiting for a \\"1-800\\" number to appear to help the aliens: 'just a dollar a day'.

Get the DVD instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out awful!","review":"Man I have seen some bad movies but this one is really terrible. I watched the whole thing and I can't believe people are giving this 4 and 5 stars. I'd give it a negative if that were possible. Even Plan 9 From Outerspace was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made","review":"This is a horrible, disgusting, disgrace of a movie. Made of pointless death, torture, and merits no information of value and isn't even close to being entertaining. Mixed in with two hours of mindless killing, it insults the audience with a non plausible joke of compassion between whoever, without any believable reasoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I have read numerous reviews which in part dictates my choice of movies. I have never had the time to write my own review, but since I am writing this one, tells you how disappointed I was when I watched District 9.To be honest, I never got through the whole movie. To me, what's the point? I read other reviews and waited for this to come out on DVD, and then got the movie for Christmas. I was in high anticipation for this, but extremely let down.I absolutely hated the biography, interview type format. In simple words, it is just a stupid movie. Special effects were okay, but this movie was slow moving, dragged on and on, and just plain didn't make sense. I have no idea how others can rate this film on pure entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the videos on FHV look great!! (Funniest Home Videos)","review":"For sixty years I have been an avid SiFi fan, never seen a film I didn't like.This could have been good, but the filming must have been done by a 3 year old with a cell phone. My wife and I watched it in a theater and the picture jumped around (shook) so much we couldn't watch most of it.The movie industries and camera companies have spent millions to control camera shake. The effect in this movie is as if someone hand held the camera with maximum zoom. Even shots of people standing still and talking were jumping all over the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappoinment","review":"This movie gets worse the closer to the end it gets. If you hated Transformers, you'll hate this movie as well.

The story line was absurd. The format (pseudo-docu) was off-putting. The prawns are revolting to look at and not worth taking the time to understand, and the humans are one-dimensional cardboard. After an hour I had no sympathy or interest in any of the characters or what passed for a plot.Save your money and use it to take someone you love to see Avatar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough to be bad sci-fi","review":"I love sci-fi, I love bad sci-fi...D9 isn't good enough to be bad sci-fi. My 7 yr old could have made this movie. The documentary style was interesting at first but soon became annoying. The acting was horrible. The characters had no depth, they were sterile and fake. The Wikus character's \\"happy\\" disposition didn't fit in with the story line. D9 is like taking a bad idea for a movie, and using it to make a bad movie. If you think smashing your hand with a hammer would be fun then you are going to love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!!","review":"Couldn't get it out of my DVD player fast enough!

The t.v. mini series \\"V\\" did it so much better and much more believable than this hunk of junk. This movie suffered in more ways than one. The plot had some promise, however the acting was a joke, none of the HUMAN characters had any real depth so the acting fell flat just going through the motions of reading the script the same as you would a newspaper. Making the Aliens look like giant shrimp wearing body armour whos idea was that???? Giving it the documentary feel only helped contribute to the cheapola B movie factor. I am in total disbelief that so many viewers liked this movie giving it 5 stars..! To me it looked cheesy and just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defaulty","review":"Twice I had ordered the blue ray District 9 from Amazon and both times the video did not open to play.

District 9 is one of the most imaginative and refreshing science-fiction movies released, and certainly a treat to behold on Blu-ray. There IS a very noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-ray experience, to which I highly recommend the Blu-ray experience. The acting, pacing, and direction of District 9 is award-winning material, but the real star is the story. The story behind the film is just as relevant today as it was when it was released in 2009. That the film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and not the overly used locations of New York or Los Angeles boosts the originality of the film.Before buying, check out the review on Blu-ray.com to see if you'll want it,http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/District-9-Blu-ray/7594/#ReviewConsidering the quality of this release, you'll wish that all Blu-ray releases were managed by people as conscientious as those that worked on District 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money","review":"Spoiler: this movie is full of such contradiction and idiotic lines its almost laughable...hey lets treat these aliens like equals by asking them to sign something before they can move and now we are going to burn their babies alive. the main actor fails to have lines of any common sense \\"if i wave a gun in a government building and steal a very important vile so i can get my normal hand back then they'll take me back as i was before\\".and many more things are wrong with the movie,though i realize scifi movies are rarely believable this one takes the cake"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really wanted to Love this movie but...","review":"This movie was supposed to be a great movie and so I decided to purchase it. After watching it, I was extremely disappointed. I knew this movie was made cheaply and was suppose to be great, and so I wanted it to be great, I really did. However, I never really got into the movie and thought it was a waste of a couple hours. The effects are great and everything, I just never truly got into the story. Maybe two stars is a little harsh, but it is not worth buying, maybe worth a one night rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst SciFi movie I've seen in a while","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie because of the very interesting premise, but I was sorely disappointed. The special effects and acting were good but in the end it was just a waste of time. This movie was visually unappealing (just gross) and at the end there was no reason for watching (no redeeming quality). At the end of the movie, I just felt \\"EWWWW\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence and Gore Detract and Make it Nearly Unwatchable","review":"I was hoping for an enjoyable science fiction movie that perhaps posed some questions about society and religion. Instead, the story is overrun with over the top violence and gore leaving a nearly unwatchable film. Placing the violence aside, there is an interesting story underneath, but it's buried under the filmmakers' pretentious efforts to shock the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy this movie very much","review":"Except for the last 30 min. of the movie I didn't like it very much. I won't be viewing this video again. It's headed for 1/2 price books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targeted at a very select audience...","review":"I've read a number of glowing reviews on this movie, and have to wonder where the scifi genre is headed. It appears to me the movie was created and presented solely as a shock movie, rather than the more conventional \\"story based\\" movie. It is evident from the very beginning you are in South Africa, and are destined to stay there. The \\"news commentary format\\" left this viewer cold, and the Apartheid innuendo throughout felt forced. Perhaps I, as the viewer, just doesn't want to be reminded of(make that force fed) an infamous part of history yet again! Yes, this movie seems targeted towards a narrowly defined type of viewer...I just don't happen to fit into that category.To be fair, there were a number of scenes near the end where you could genuinely feel sympathy for the two principal characters and had a feeling of a story emerging, but it came a bit too late for overall effective story telling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"District 9 is a good Movie. The story is completely based on human powers. Nice screenplay and direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but not mindblowing","review":"This movie is a pretty solid piece of work, overall.Problems with the script:1. The movie never explains how a clearly superior race of beings \\"stalled out\\" hovering over the Earth and almost starved themselves to death, luckily this is not important to the plot.2. More importantly, the fact that the alien visitors clearly understand their resulting mistreatment on this planet and do nothing to change it even though they are in possession of weapon technology far superior than ours.Other than the 2 items mentioned above, it's actually pretty good.The special effects are mind-blowing, the viewer literally can't tell the difference between a real actor and a CG alien standing right next to each other. A+ on this one!I found myself hating the main character which proves to me that he really sold the part.Worth owning, get a copy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story telling","review":"I enjoyed the story of humans dealing with alien refugees. Some of the events were quite humorous and others quite graphic. Adult audience is recommended for good understanding of plot elements and discrimination themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't understand critics","review":"I don't understand critics who fault the movie for allegedly getting \\"mired\\" in action and violence toward the end. This is a sci-fi action movie, with the added bonus of an original storyline that explores serious themes. That is what makes it a brilliant movie. Yes, there are lots of action sequences at the end, but they serve the plot - namely advancing the cause of the main characters. The violence and action represent obstacles for the main characters to overcome, essential to any decent plot. Nor was I surprised by the violence in the movie - as District 9 is clearly represented as a powder keg waiting to explode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and provocative sci-fi","review":"I've seen this movie several times, and absolutely love it.It's a clich��-less sci-fi experience, the choice of unknown actors is spot on, and the production is flawless.More than that, the movie has some surprising authenticity to it. I had the opportunity of seeing it with a friend from South Africa, and she said she could spot the different accents from the different parts of Joburg. She also explained how there had been a District 6 in the time of Apartheid.All in all, it's a good story, excellent effects and production, and downright thrilling to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary movie","review":"gave this as a gift to someone who enjoys this kind of movie. was good quality - satisfied with purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"by far the worst movie in sci fi history !!!!!!!! cat food addiction? waste of time money and dvd DO NOT WASTE MORE TIME THAN YOU TOOK TO READ THIS REVIEW MINUS THREE DAYS!!!!!!!

I don't know what the the author is trying to convey other than refugee camps are bad and if we do it to aliens that can eat us, we are really bad. Another movie denegrating the human race and developed countries as power hungry, war mongering, and arrogant. If you are an Obama fan, you will love this movie.

This movie is so bad i could not finish it. Thats saying alot because i sat all the way threw Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. There are no big name actors in this movie. I'm not saying you need a Will Smith or Tom Cruise but maybe it would have helped. These actors seem like complete amateurs. The main character is this realy boring little man. I read a 5 star review that admitted that the main character was very hard to like. If you believe that then why would you give it 5 stars? Even the aliens don't seem very intriguing. I gave it 2 stars because it does try to tell a decent story. It just fails everytime that it tries.

Most shows in the set just start with the action, NO THEME, NO OPENING OR CLOSING. Instead you have some would-be announcer/tv historian narrating an intro to each episode. WITHOUT DOUBT THE WORST JOB OF A TV SET I'VE SEEN. O & H is a great old show, that's the one redeeming value here, but hardly worth the annoyance.

Carrot and celery seem adequately healthy to warrant their inclusion in Bolognese sauce - perhaps Ms. Rosso might have called her sauce something other than Bolognese, since it is so far from the real recipe and miles away from \\"classic.\\" Yes, okay, you can adjust the recipes to suit your taste.

Ms. Seton is incapable of boring anyone. There's a lot of history here but it's important to know that there were two errors discovered. The author states that Dr. John Radcliffe attempted to help Charles Radclyffe who had been condemned to death. Dr. Radcliffe died one year before the arrest of Charles. She also states that Jenny, illegitimate daughter of Charles emigrated to Virginia to be with Rob Wilson and they had a plantation named Snowden/Snowdon. The property referred to was purchased from the Indians by Thomas Jefferson's father. No white person had ever lived there or owned it. So it must be assumed that both Jenny and Rob were \\"made-up\\" characters to assist the writer in making the book more exciting.

He was in the great tradition, and it came naturally. He was also a great pianist. In Boult he had a kindred spirit. As a young man Boult played two-piano duets with Fanny Davies, Clara Schumann's pupil. He was 9 when Brahms died, but by then had attended London concerts of the composer's works. Later, as conductor of the BBCSO and the LPO, he won a major reputation as a Brahms conductor. For Sir Simon Rattle, Boult was one of the two great Brahms conductors (the other was Giulini). This CD, then, gives us something we won't hear nowadays. It's a powerful performance, a real performance, in pretty good sound for the time. Noone would listen to this for audiophile pleasure, but as a study disc that takes us close to a 19th. century tradition - 'echt Brahms' - it's priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure for my collection.","review":"I've been a fan of the Leonidas Witherall books by Alice Tilton for decades and being able to replace a copy of one lost years ago in a fire has beena great boon.

The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.

She even copied Shirley Temple's portrayal with her heroine's moppet looks and locks. Emily Claire has a wicked school mistress, true-blue servant friends, and she eventually finds out she really wasn't impoverished after all, nor had her father's friend abandoned her. Sound familiar?

Sonny Clark is a good soloist and even better comping pianist, and Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones are superb as bass and drums respectively. In the horns we have the brilliant Jackie McLean on alto, and Art Farmer on trumpet. This was actually my first recording with Farmer, and he is a capable, steady soloist with some nice lines. McLean, not as razor-sharp as usual, contributes some nice solos, although he's a bit dissapointing on this to me as I've heard him do some much better hard bop. This album is good, but not quite great. Everything swings, but there are no bursts of inspiration that define the great albums of the period. The compositions are standard medium-tempo fare with some very nice moments. Nothing spectacular, but a good Blue Note addition, and and an excellent way to check out Sonny Clark, an underrated and to jazz novices unknown (he died early) pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"...an album you must hear !!","review":"Sonny Clark - Cool Struttin', Blue Note Records, 1958 (XRCD)Let me just start off by saying that this is a fantastic album that lovers of jazz will adore.

The group is well balanced and plays as a synthesized unit, as a true trio should - in other words no extended solos featuring bass or drums. The mix of standards and a couple of originals is beautifully played; the recorded sound is exemplary.This is one of three fine albums Hank Jones made in 1989-90, the other two beingLazy AfternoonandOracle, both of which are more inspired than \\"The Essence.\\" This is still a fine trio album which I would recommend if you can pick up an inexpensive copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience ever to own this poor-quality TV","review":"I got this 32\\" Philips Plasma TV back in May 2004 as a gift.

It's a cover album of AC/DC's most overrated album, \\"Back In Black\\", so you basically know that all of the songs basically run together. The only credit I give on this CD is that Chris Barnes is less annoying than Brian Johnson. Otherwise, this sucks.

However, it offers nothing that its sequel doesn't offer, and the game is, shall we say, very poor. Not having the advantage of color that its contemporaries (Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy) had, the graphics are so poor that they were actually bad in 1989, which says a lot. The story is about as simplistic as they come, and you should be able to beat this game in a few hours no problem.

My advice: Skip this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Final Fantasy has quite a few games, and a couple of little series spun off the main franchise, such as Final Fantasy Tactics, and Legend is another one. It's unique in that you can customize your party, and power-ups work differently. Personally, I say that if you're starting out, you want 2 Humans (one male, one female) and a Mutant (I chose male) along with one Monster. Mutants level up on their own, but you can buy stats for your Humans, and you can change your Monster by feeding it the meat of other monsters so it's a different way of playing the game but fun.This game is a little short - you can finish it within one day, or a total of 24 hours spread out however long (even with working on leveling up) but for a Game Boy game and the debut of one of the Final Fantasy miniseries, this was actually a pretty decent game as a debut and laid out the groundwork for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more guess work.","review":"I originally was searching for those pop-up things you put in turkeys to tell when they are done, when I ran into this meat thermometer.

There are two spools of plastic ribbon wire running against each other...you MUST pull out both wire ends smoothly AND simultaneously. Retracting the cables must also be done in tandem. I mistakenly thought I could pull out just one side for a short run, but this engages the opposite spool by friction causing it to wad up inside the case and jam. It's not clear why this wasn't designed like retractable measuring tape with just one spool. I sprayed some WD-40 inside mine to make it slip better.

The characters are entirely one-dimensional with extraordinarily little sense of purpose, and the situations -- while remotely interesting -- remind readers immediately of the stellar works of Allistar McClain as well as Robert Ludlum.Perhaps the writer was stretching for such comparisons, but, in the sense that they appear to be loosely veiled (very loose, at that) comparisons.One plus is that EPSILON is, thankfully, a very quick read.

I love the great interface upgrades to the Finder in this version, especially the Quicklook preview function of your files, improved sidebar, and the fancy 3D dock. I also liked the enhancements to iChat, esp iChat theater and file sharing through iChat. Safari has some minor improvements here and there, and everything seems to run a bit speedier after upgrading. Stacks isn't very useful, though. The Mail application is great, with a variety of stationery templates to choose from where you can insert photos.

So, we drove 50 miles to the nearest Apple Store, which told us to go to Best Buy or Amazon (to buy a product that says, \\"made at Apple in California\\" on its box cover). Then, the installation instructions were generic, so we had to hire a consultant to install it on the different models...

My G5, now with Leopard, randomly and continually crashes with Safari, Mail, iPhoto,and as well as many other programs. Even the disk utility First Aid hangs the computer. In two days now it has crashed probably twenty times. The force quit will not terminate hung programs and the computer has to be restarted with the power button. I have Disk Warrior on order to try to fix things but right now I'm seriously considering deinstalling this crap and going back to the stable Tiger.

I've been learning Chinese and Leopard comes with a fully capable Chinese version out of the box. No need to buy a special version. You can easily type in Chinese in any application by changing the keyboard type in the International control panel. If you want to see menus and such in Chinese you can do that too.2) It's very friendly for sight-impaired. My vision is good, but I've been very impressed with the built in VoiceOver utility.

Until now, I always praised apple for being out of the box, attentive to detail, and not guilty of rushing products to the market.Sadly, this product is very simply a Microsoft type release - immature at best and totally out of kilter for apple. I have a brand new iMac, not one single problem - the only additional software loaded is the MS office. Also have a Canon printer and a backup HD. After loading Leopard, my machine shuts down for no known reason, won't wake up from sleep and periodically won't start. I have talked to apple over two hours on the phone and spent 1.5 hrs at the apple store.

Nails that are embedded in the ground generally don't come out.

That part was good for my spiritual development, but the most important part for me was the concept that positive thoughts make us stronger and negative thoughts and shame make us weaker. Dyer spoke about this, but it was the demonstration in the DVD extras section that hit the point home.

Ann Blyth, who we generally like very much, was hopelessly miscast, and the rest of the cast, including the great Howard Keel, found very little to get excited about in their roles. Musically, apart from a couple of famous numbers, it had very little to offer.

If you have the appropriate means, I advise securing your speakers and subwoofer(s) directly to your head -- this is to insure you don't allow even one drop of the liquid tones to escape your thirsting ear canals. I find, in particular, tracks 1, 5, and 6 to be completely transfixing.Originally I stumbled upon this band through their \\"From Heaven and Hell (A tribute to Black Sabbath)\\" album.

The graphics are remarkably more in detail then the previous Legend games. Role-playing games have something in common which is you need a pen and paper to write down stuff people say to you. I don't remember writing a lot but you see a cave you cannot get to yet, then you would want to write down the grid; the number of squares across and down. Therefore, if you do that then you will not have to worry about it so much. I remember walking around sometimes going \\"where do I go\\" but here again if you look back at what people have said to you then you will be pointed in the right direction.

If you shop around like I did, you can get them for $70 each. Having a $70 mic for overheads on drum recording may sound like a real ham 'n egg operation, but these mics are really doing the job. You need to work on placement, just like with much more expensive mics, but once you've got right spot, the F-15's pick up everything - clearly. The gain on the board need not be cranked in order to pick up the crash cymbals correctly. With almost no efects added, the F-15 pick up the attack and decay of all cymbals, with again, amazing clarity. They also pick up, and add nicely to, the sound of the \\"drums\\" in your mix. You can go buy more expensive mics, but how much better they will sound, given the home recording setup, will not justify their purchase. Save your money - buy these.

He also breaks each part into individual chapters and suggests exercises to--hopefully--alleviate each problem area.The only complaint I had is that most of the writing examples are so horrendous, they border on unbelievable. This is a minor drawback.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELP FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE","review":"Most books about writing tell us what to do. This book, however, takes the opposite approach and tells us what not to do. As an editor, Noah Lukeman shows writers why their manuscripts are rejected by both agents and publishers time and time again. After defining the problem spots, the author gives us examples and then follows with exercises to help correct the problem. The only criticism I have of the book lies with the examples. They are truly dreadful. I'm sure the author made them up to illustrate his point, but I, myself, would have found examples more helpful had they been drawn from actual books. This book, however, is very useful, both for the beginner and the more advanced writer and will go a long way toward keeping you out of the rejection pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide to Keep You On Track","review":"I was very pleased with this book. It takes a no-nonsense approach to the writing concepts and skills most likely to prevent an editor from reading a manuscript. Topics are presented in order of importance (as determined by the author) and I think he's pretty much on target. The only complaint I have is that his examples of bad writing are so obviously bad that they're really not realistic examples at all.

Or it may be the publisher's fault. Unfortunately, this sentence also has a sample of the real problem. Anybody who uses a word like \\"determinant\\" when they're not writing about mathematics is more than a little bit pompous.This is not an easy or enjoyable book to read, and the advice seems to be pretty basic - more tips from Chapter 1 include \\"don't send an agent the only existing copy of your story\\" and \\"realize that Stephen King will have less trouble selling his next book than you will selling your first one\\".

While The First Five Pages does a great job of outlining common mistakes in writing (generally speaking, not just in the opening pages), it falls short in the How Do I Fix It department. Yes, it discusses the Dos vs. the Don'ts but it left me unsure how I go about recognizing the problems in my own work or the process of how to fix them. Just showing examples doesn't work for me. I need a process: here's what you look for, here's what you do when you find it. That's what I found in Cleaver's book, but I did not find it here.

I have purchased many used books from Amazon and this was the best one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blaine Lee Pardoe brings us another great BattleTech novel.","review":"While the trend for BattleTech books seems to be \\"get as much fighting crammed into as small a space as possible\\" Mr. Pardoe is able to tell a great story that has both battles and personal stories. I was a little apprehensive when I began reading that this novel would turn out like Gressman's \\"Dagger Point\\" in that it would be too long in the beginning and middle, too short at the end, and leave you scratching your head as to what the whole point of the story was about.Not here. Mr. Pardoe is an inspiring author and his continuation of Archer Christifori's battle against Archon Princess Katherine is much appreciated. If you have'nt read \\"Measure of a Hero\\" yet, please read it first and then give this novel a go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrating Life","review":"Talk about serendipity--I did not know a thing about Will or Madeline Tuttle until researching a different Amazon product I was thinking about buying. I discovered that there was a YouTube video of this other product which was made by Madeline and Will, and had Will's music playing in the background. The music was so beautiful, that I started a new search to find out more about it!I had been transitioning to a vegan lifestyle for a period of time, and finding Will Tuttle'sAnimalSongsseemed the perfect way to celebrate finalizing my transition away from using animals for food.A \\"celebration\\" is the perfect word to describe this CD. A celebration of all Life, including that of the animals. This joyous work incorporates the sounds of the animals themselves as Will attempts to portray their essence via his music. It is uplifting, joyful and celebratory. I feel blessed each time I listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget boring remake","review":"this movie is a low(er) budget remake of a surprisingly good movie called \\"Dance of the Damned\\" The original, which does sport a couple of vintage 1980s styles such as a vampire with a mullet, had real chemistry and some very good dramatic acting. This movie appears to have a lower budget, and worse acting with no chemistry between the main characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The convincer","review":"This is getting older with dignity. Every song is so fullfilled with soul, passion, sound and beauty. Play it twice a week and you have a cd to grow old together with. Do I like it? 6 stars out of 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, hollow","review":"God bless Nick Lowe, but the first review really hits it on the head. If you are a fan of Impossible Bird and Dig My Mood, then this will appeal to you. Otherwise, you'll confirm for yourself that the great white light that was Nick Lowe has dimmed to a flicker. Nick, keep on kicking. One of them will get over the bar. Eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Life, Nick!","review":"I'm not convinced. I tried to like this, I really did. Nick needs to get out of his reverie and make some music that indicates he is still alive. I enjoyed \\"Dig my Mood\\", but enough is enough! Think about many of the wonderful songs he has written. There's only 2 or 3 songs on here that are in the least bit memorable, and I've heard most everything Nick has ever done. People are much too generous with their stars in these customer reviews. 4 stars?? Listen to all his music and you can't give this 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Convinced!!","review":"Nick Lowe has spent the better part of his career writing witty songs that make us all laugh at ourselves (or him). Over his last couple of albums he has slowly transformed into a crooner. He always has had a fine vocal sensibility but now he is down right soulful. At first listen these songs tend to be somber and downtrodden but after a few times it really has grown on me. I really enjoy the story telling and the sparse arrangements. Highlights for me are: \\"Only a fool breaks his own heart\\", \\"Indian Queens\\", and \\"She's got soul\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Convincing","review":"Nick Lowe was one of the pioneers of new wave music. He wrote scathingly witty songs that were delivered in a power pop, punkish tones. In recent years he has moved away from that sound and developed into something of a balladeer. The Convincer is full mellow songs crooned by Mr. Lowe. His voice has become more and more of an instrument over the years. Despite the change in styles, Mr. Lowe has retained his wry sense of humor and sharp wit. \\"Bygones (Won't Go)\\", \\"I'm A Mess\\", \\"Lately I've Let Things Slip\\", \\"Let's Stay In & Make Love\\" and \\"Only A Fool Breaks His Own Heart\\" all retain that classic Lowe writing style. He does an elegant version of Johnny Rivers' \\"Poor Side Of Town\\" which may be the best song on the disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any cat lover","review":"I found this cd by mistake and it was the best mistake I ever made. Not only is it beautifully done, the songs are great and addictive. Once was not enough in listening to it. Marc Gunn is a very talented musicain and makes you see what he is singing. My cat's also love listening to this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"This book shows children and adults the importance of appreciating what we have and to find a smile in everything we do. What an inspiring story. Not to mention, an author who should be a role model to us all. My love to his family and may he rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite poor as children's literature","review":"I know that this book has tapped into the child-illness market, and if it has served a useful function there, that's great.But as a piece of children's literature, it's pretty dreadful. There's no real cadence to the verse, the flow of the story makes no sense, from ancient castle to modern life (our message to homeless people should not be for them to just laugh?) and it's really unclear why anything happens. Why has the king lost the ability to laugh? How is it that he gets it back?As a Mom who has read countless books to her three children and to nieces and nephews galore, I can only report that neither I nor the couple of kids I read this story to was engaged. I should say \\"tried to read it to,\\" because they lost interest before we reached the end. My view of this book is that it's something everyone THINKS is supposed to be good, especially because of the sad story of the young man who wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting Book!","review":"David Saltzman's book, \\"The Jester Has Lost His Jingle,\\" is an excellent book that teaches children and adults the importance of a positive attitude and laughter.The main character is a Jester that discovers that everyone has lost their sense of humor and he goes on a journey to find out why there is no laughter.My favorite part of the book is when Saltzman writes, \\"Then it isn't me at all! It's the world that must be sick. We must find that sense of humor, and bring it back here quick!\\"On his journey he discovers that people are dealing with \\"Real\\" issues (ie...depression, poverty, sickness, etc...) and he takes it upon himself to help people find their \\"Jingle.\\"The message of this book is very positive and it helps the reader to value laughter and a positive attitude.The illustrations are beautifully done and your child is sure to love this colorful and valuable book.I highly recommend \\"The Jester Has Lost His Jingle.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this book knowing it was used, however it was more than used. The book binding was taped together and was not what I had thought I would be getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story","review":"The story is great! My plan was to read it to a classroom of students that has a classmate diagnosed with cancer. However, I find the condition of the book to be very poor. It was stated that it was \\"like new\\". However, the pages are torn and ripped and a few of the pages cannot even be read as the words have been removed. It appears that pages must have been stuck together and were attempted to be separated. I guess you get what you pay for -- a \\"used\\" book is definitely used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely atrocious","review":"This is absolute worst juvenile book that I've ever seen. Besides the obvious politically correct messages, the plot is just plain silly. I mean, where in the heck did this guy come up with a jester and a talking piece of wood?! At any rate, unless you want to laugh AT it (you certianly won't laugh with it), I wouldn't even suggest taking the short time necessary to read it, much less buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful","review":"I'm just going to quote another review on the site, because I don't want to be redundant and this says it all:This is absolute worst juvenile book that I've ever seen.

Nothing revolutionary here, just good playing, and not much \\"Quiet Storm\\" - the bane of recent radio-friendly jazz. Here with Peter Erskine, Russell Ferrante (of the Yellowjackets), and Will Lee, \\"Simple Things\\" (along with \\"Balance\\") showcases Chuck Loeb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original!","review":"Important... Please note that this book has been rewritten for a very young audience by Christine Rose. This is not the book as it originally appeared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Tale...but not about Joan of Arc","review":"I originally bought this book in my search for greater knowledge on Joan of Arc. It was recommended to me by a friend. What I found was a fantastic tale of Gabrielle, a girl who follows Joan of Arc in France. The story is magnificent, and I highly recommend it, especially to teens and adults interested in stories of that period. This book would appeal mostly to women. I cannot recommend it as a historical book that gives much information about Joan of Arc, however. If you are looking for Joan of Arc historical facts...search elsewhere. If you are looking for a romantic piece during that time period, then this book is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!","review":"This was the best book ever! I loved the details and the characters. The story was well written, and I loved the way it was in first person. The way it was written, it was like you were right there beside Gabrielle! During battles and healing the sick, I could almost smell the stench of burning and decaying flesh! (That wasn't too pleasant) I highly recommend this book! It contains everything you might possibly be wanting to read. It has romance, action, drama, everything! I could read this book a million times and still be as amazed by it the first time! You have to read this book! If you don't, you're missing out big time baby!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventurous tale","review":"A wonderfully written book! It takes you back to the time of Joan of Arc, and makes everything seem so realistic. Joan's friend is the narrator, telling adventure after adventure. A tear-jerker! I actually cried! Even though I had to read this for a book report, I enjoyed every minute of this book and was glad because I couldn't put the book down - this was the first book report I actually finished on time! READ IT AND YOU'LL THANK ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Indie Film with Mike Starr","review":"I watched this movie on cable this morning (around 4:00am). I have always been a fan of Mike Starr and this moving just reinforces it. This moving is a great independent film done on a budget of 1.1 million. You have to watch it to appreciate the humor and if you like this film check out Mike Starr in \\"The Deli\\" another low budget indie film. The cast of The Deli is amazing (Chris Noth, Ice-T just to mention a couple)."},{"rating":"2","title":"User friendly and informative","review":"This book tells it like it is.

We used it to find a couple unique restaurants near our hotel we otherwise wouldn't have tried. The only thing I don't like about it is the lack of neighborhood information - it's hard to find stuff by location, rather than category, and there's no information that gives a general sense of what different areas of Amsterdam are all about.Other than that it's good for a several-day visit to Amsterdam - and won't weigh down your luggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"More for Hippies...","review":"Not a bad book at all!

While this is certainly not the only guide you should read before your trip, it is a damn good one.

It's the author's story of his year in China, after graduation from boarding school in 1948 - the year of the Communist revolution. It is an exuberant tale of youthful experience told with the wisdom that only comes with age. Mr. Knowlton's word pictures of this complicated country during one of the most important political episodes of the 20th century makes this book essential reading for anyone interested in the region.For those who do read My First Revolution, there is a special dividend, namely Mr. Knowlton's quiet insights into his own life with many poignant observations that punctuate his story, but never distract the reader from the main event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cord","review":"absolutely nothing negative to say.
