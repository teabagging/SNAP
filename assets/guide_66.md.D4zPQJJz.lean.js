I was forced to read this book and I'm only in 8th grade. One thing I would have change is the ending, after enduring all that time thinking that they were finally going to become men. They kill there leader and make them all become babies again. I think this book was a waste of money and a waste of paper. This book infuriates me; it makes me want to throw up. With the presents of some comedy this book might have been funnier but no they had to make the worst book ever wrote. The story line is that these kids see these buffalo getting slatered, and these kids go up and try and break them out.

The characters in the book were good described, and they were well fit for the spot in the book. The setting in the book was well played out by the author. The flashbacks in the book were kind of awkward. Some of them really had no point to them. The point of view in the book was told well because it wasn't in any of the characters point of view. Well John Cotton was there leader and they followed him like he was a god. They did that because he was the oldest and he took the part in being the leader. So that is what I have to say about the book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"This book is about 6 kids that are rejects at box canyon camp in arizona.

The setting of the story was OK. The story was set in Arizona. The flash backs are a major point in the story.

I strongly advice whoever wants to have a deep understanding for reality read this book.The best part is how to meditate: Observe these 'I-thought' and hold them, eventually they will collapse, then the real Self would be seen.Jiddu Krishnamurti's advice on meditation: Observe your thoughts without any judgment, that's all you need to do to find reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"OM Ramana","review":"Ramana is the nectar of advaita/non-duality teachers.

Ramana's message is that of the use of self-enquiry will lead one to have direct experience with the Self, one's true identity. He urges his followers to consistantly ask oneself the question \\"Who am I\\" and/or \\"Who is asking this question\\". He also places major emphasis on silence, especially the silence of the mind.

This book shows how Ramana Maharshi keeps his teachings very simple and direct from all angles. How he addresses questions tosubjects like: Surrender, Meditation, Yoga, Mantras, Reincarnation, Karma and many, many other topics posed to him. He always found a way to keep all these topics aligned with knowing the Self, your unconditioned state.

To me the array of questions stated were either dodged with the standard \\"Look Within Yourself\\" solution, or they were given the \\"No, it does not exist\\" - \\"Yes, of course that is the true existence\\" contradiction. I really cannot imagine how some of your reviewers can discover such wondrous revelations here.Simply put, I found absolutely no great knowledge or guidance in this volume, and I truly feel sorry for the poor guy who was trying to broaden his understanding of Eastern philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight","review":"Questioning earthly values? How about some serious, very serious teachings on Reality. Reality is not anything you observe or experience but deeply hidden within you. These teachings are one of a lifetime that can get you out of the cycle of rebirth. David Godman is also one of the best editors alive and has much practical experience in working and studing with true guru's. Many people claim that they are guru's, only to destroy you. No one can give you the answers. Your inquiry into ownership of this book shows that you are on your way to the Source.

But there are more appropriate places for trying to spread your message.If you don't mind Christian themes in your cookbooks, this one is fine. If you happen to be of another religion, you might want to stay away.(I should also mention that the quotes themselves are fairly generic and not overly preachy, but they are unmistakably Christian and prevalent enough to bother many.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Cookbook","review":"This book has many recipes that are tasty and easy to make.

We loved it. However, we were disappointed by the introduction of a mechanically based enemy. The overall feel of these books is so genuinely medieval that this sort of robot creature took away from that trend of her past books; it felt too modern. As a school/community worker recommending books to children on a regular basis, I am also concerned with the robots having their origin in slaughtered young children's bodies that resemble dolls with bruised faces.

Now, she must learn from the biggest knight in Tortall: Lord Raoul, knight commander of the King's Own. Although practice jousting matches leave her bruised and out of breath, they prepare her for the many tournaments that she competes in. Someone always wants to beat Kel, but few people do. Eventually, she is challenged by her former teacher, Lord Wyldon. Many times, she wins, but she does lose these jousts occasionally. (I'm not telling what happens with Lord Wyldon) Also, Princess Shinkokami is in town for presentation, and Kel, old friends with \\"Shinko,\\" is the envy of all of her squire friends for being in high standings with such beautiful girls. As always, Kel has to prove herself in real-life battles, but comes out on top. Then, she faces the most difficult challenge of all... The Chamber of the Ordeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I, personally, have tended to find Ms. Pierce's quartets are particurally weak once the get to the third book, then they pick themselves up for the end. I enjoyed this book alot though, finally a book whose lead charactor has no magical abilities!Reading through others reviews of this book I was irked by several peoples complaintes about her not liking Neal anymore. I belive Ms. Pierce's decison is just fine, and it was well handeled. I wouldn't belive it if someone honestly said that they didn't fall in and out of crushes very abruptly as teenagers. Just because her affections are concentrated on a person besides Neal doesn't make the book bad. As for not seeing Neal as often, thats ok. The story is told from what Kels sees and thinks, and she just isn't seeing, or thinking, about NealI am greatly looking forward to seeing what Ms. Pierce comes up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last one!","review":"This is the most reacent book in Tamora Pierce's Protector of the small series.

The Yamani princess arrives, Kel finds a baby Griffin and she meets up with all of her old friends again, including Neal of Queenscove.

Kel's dream of serving under Knight Alanna dies as she serves for the good-natured Knight Raoul who deals with raiding centaurs, invading Scanrans, and other law-breakers of Tortall. Exciting and irresistible like all the other books by Tamora Pierce, Squire is a must-read for fantasy-lovers or those who likes the never-ending combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Out of Tamora Pierce's many books, i think this one was one of the best she has written yet. The Alanna series touched me, and Protector Of The Small series showed even more compassion and adventure. I can't wait till Mrs. Pierce writes the KNIGHT version of this series. Keep pouring 'em out, they keep getting better! It shows that in a world of prejeduce and hate, females are actually getting stronger. It's a shame of the problems females face as we all grow up, and this book shows that we can overcome almost every one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good but not as good as I would expect.","review":"Keladry is a new squire and is looking forward to the next four years as a squire.

She learns the skills of a knight first hand and helps people along the way. She also trys herself against the Chamber of the Ordeal through out her years as a squire, finally truely facing it to become a knight. The Chamber has more in mind than a meer test though. I love Tamora Pierce. She is my favorite author. This book just isn't her best though. The charactors didn't seem as real emotionally as they did in her other books. I think it was still really good though and can't wait for Lady Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I really liked this third book in the Protector of the Small quartet. Why?

I was so glad for this four day weekend. So get it. It's so good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Well, I bet I'm going to get a ton of complaints about this, but I didn't like the book that much at all. Kel doesn't have a consistent enemy to fight against...Joren crops up occasionally during the book and Kel has him taken off her hands by outside means. Many of the issues in the book (i.e sexism, class divide, sex) are cliched and tell me nothing new. Kel doesn't have half as many things to struggle against (unlike Alanna) and her character isn't interesting enough to sustain my interest. Oh, and the gift giver thing was boring. Everyone I knew thought it was ALanna, and it was. Wow. Sorry, but this book is far too issues-driven. I hope Lady Knight will be better! Oh, but I did like the way Kel had several different crushes to contend with, the trial was good, and I liked the way she confronted the Chamber as it built up to her final confrontation with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah well....","review":"I love this book because Kel becomes Raoul's squire. In the Alanna books, he isn't a very well developed character, and I was really happy to see him reappear, especially as Kel's knight master. I was dissapointed that Kel and Neal didn't fall in love, but that would have been too much like the Alanna books with Jon and Alanna. Besides, Neal is too cynical for Kel. She is completely a fighting knight and Neal is mostly a desk night, like myles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protector of the Small #3- Squire","review":"I actually thought this book was better then the one before it (Page) which surprised me as usually I find in Tamora Pierce's quartets the first book is the best, then they get slowly a little worse each time. But even though Kel wasn't working aound the palace any more, this book was still really intresting and it was great that it was a lot longer then the first two books. I have one complaint: Cleon. ....Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.) A great addition to this quartet and I'm really looking forward to reading book 4, Lady Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok people, here we go","review":"Honestly this book deserves more than 5 stars. I could hardly expect anything less than great from Tamora Pierce....but Squire was incredibly great. If you're reading this review, chances are that you've already read some of her books and know that they are absolutely wonderful....so it'll come as no surprise to you that this one is just as good as the rest (if not better). I don't really know what to say about the book itself (except that I loved it of course)....I can't pick out any one thing that I liked more than anything else....its the perfect blend of all the necessary things that make a book so good that you can't put it down. Lady Knight comes out next year, and that seems like a long time to wait, but I have a feeling that it'll be worth it. So anyway, read this book, or buy it or whatever, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pierce fans will not be disappointed","review":"If you have read the first two books in this series (Protector of the Small), you already know what you are in for, and you will be happy to get this book! Fans of Tamora Pierce's other work will like this series as well. It has it all: feminist adventurer overcoming adversity and sexism, delightful magic, interesting characters, and a story that's hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"I, personally, loved Squire. So far, it is my favourite in the series. Of my friends, the majority of them thought that it was one of Tamora Pierces better books, but I still love Alanna. Tamora Pierce is a great author and this book is no acception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanna: The First Adventure","review":"Tamora Pierce wrote a book that puts Harry Potter to shame that keeps you on the edge of your seat. You don't want to put it down, and when you do, it's to pick up the next book in the series. Quick-witted and funny, Alanna and her friends charm you and makes you laugh until tears stream down your face. This book shows a strong female going against the ways of her time to get what she wants. This book is good for school use too. if ever a girl needs to have a heroine to look to, it's alanna. Tamora Pierce's books need to find their way into every teenage girl's room (no matter how messy) and give them an enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first two","review":"Kelandry of Mindelan made it through all four years of knight training school and now all she has to do is wait for someone to choose her as their squire. She hopes that she will be chosen by Lady Alanna but expects to become a desk squire. She is presently surprised when Lord Raoul chooses her.I didn't like this book as much as the first two but it's still a great book. The beginning was a bit on the boring side but the plot picked up before I was thoroughly bored. I kind of missed the school setting and I really missed a lot of the characters. The book was also more action packed than the others which was a good and a bad thing. I really liked the romance even though Kel's boyfriend was not who I'd have picked for her (I'm not telling who it is) This was a good book but I'm not really as anxious to start the fourth one as I was the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loyal since Alanna","review":"When I was 12, I got a hold of the Alanna series and have read everything Tamora Pierce has written since...however, I mourn the lack of charm in the Protector of the Small series as her previous others have possessed. Now, being 20, I find the plot humorous, delightful and a light reading, but it can never add up. I believe Pierce's work is going downhill when it comes to seriousness and ability to transport the reader into the plot. One does not see the same maturation in character from First Test to Lady Knight compared to Alanna, the first adventure to Lioness Rampant. Still a fan, but not as impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the series!","review":"I wish I could give this book more than five stars. I am a huge fan of Tamora Pierce and the Tortall books,...P>In my opinion the Protector of the Small series is the best of the Tortall books. I also found that SQUIRE is the best book in the series - it's full of humor, battle, and yes, the book even contains romance!As Kel begins her journey as a squire, she spends time battling foes, learning about being a knight, and even makes some new friends. A little romance is also included.This is the best book in the series - it is a must read! However, if you are new to the Tortall books, I advise you read the Alanna and Daine books first, for history and background."},{"rating":"2","title":"What will be in store for Keldary?","review":"I must say, this is the best book out of the quartet.First of all, I must say that Kel is a perfect heroine: smart, fiesty, loyal. She's a great role model for young girls.Pierce's books somehow contain this degree of imagination that appeals to adults and younger children. They're charming, serious, witty, and at some points laugh out loud funny. Her charachters come alive so easily that it seems like you've known them your whole lives.Another thing I really enjoyed about these books was bringing back old charachters like Raoul, Alanna, George, Daine, Jonothan, Thayet. It's always somehow exciting when you get to hear about charachters that seem so distant.Oh, and the whole Kel and Cleon romance is absolutely adorable.To sum it up: Kel is a fabulous heroine in a lively book full of danger, romance, and the power of the human mind.Read these books to your children and enjoy them yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this book","review":"I found this book so engaging that my seven year old and I stayed up late reading for so many evenings that the grade one teacher asked why my daughter was so tired. The characters are believable and its great to have wonderful heroines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squire, an excelant book!","review":"This is the third book in the Protector of the Small series. In it, Kel has passed the big examinations, and has become a squire, join her as she captures bandits and fights immortals with the Kings Own. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sleazy","review":"Peggy Caserta apparently knew Janis very well, and I have no doubt that she's telling the truth. But Peggy comes across as self centered and unlikeable and I sense that she enjoys throwing mud at Janis. ( I also sense that she was badly in need of money.) I much preferred \\"Buried Alive\\", which manages to be both unsentimental and compassionate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth the $, here's why","review":"This book has very little info {unfortunately} regarding Janis' history in terms of her career as a singer. There's 'some' interesting details in there. However overall, it's just repetitive sexual experiences her lover describe/writes about her and Janis Joplin. If it had been a book about her male lovers that would've been far more interesting. I was hoping to get more about her background as a professional singer + her roots/upbringing in the south.If your a lesbie, you may want this crazy book.But I wasted my $$$. Oh dawg gonnit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Joplin biographies I have ever read.","review":"As a Joplin fan from way back, I thought this book was a great insight into, as Janis herself puts it, \\"the two hippest people in the world.\\" This is one of those books that every fan of the 1960's culture should keep by their side, right next to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\". My only regret is that I lost my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"A great value! 18 fantastic songs including all of the Neopolitan favourites you grew up with: O Sole Mio, Luna Rossa, Come Back to Sorrento, Oh Marie. Almost all of the songs are in English, which is just as well, because when Jerry Vale sings in Italian, his American accent will make you cringe. He's got a great voice and a great style---all of his English songs are wonderful. If you are looking for Italian music in English you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific songs","review":"I love Italian songs. Jerry Vale does an excellent job of presenting these songs in a romantic way. I especially like Mala Femmina, Al Di La and Amore Scusami. If you like his previous albums, then you will like this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian songs","review":"I enjoy listening to Italian songs sang by Jerry Vale.

I believe i have an IQ somewhere above a 20 (sarcasm) and this is the most convoluted, useless piece of crap ever. The course should be relatively simple and the material is pretty straight foward... however, the book makes the material a chore to learn. There are few examples, poor definitions, and vague explanations. If you are a professor, do not get this book unless they pay you! And if you did get the book, you would do a disservice to all your students (the reason why you have a job,... unless you're one of those \\"research\\" professors)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only NSYNC album you should really own","review":"If you don't own any of the other albums you might as well dive for this obligatory Greatest Hits. I would recommend getting the Mexican or any other import release though as it includes the Spanish versions of some of the songs and a bonus dvd which includes all of the cheesy but creative music videos. Make sure it's the NTSC version though or else you'll have some compatibility problems if you don't have a PAL player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This is a pretty good CD.

And yeah yeah, we know, Nsync was one of the most popular boy bands of their day, but that doesn't mean that you need to waste money on this crap, regardless if you are a fan or not. For one, this is not even an offical \\"greatest hits\\" album. None of the guys have even acknowledged this release, and from the way it looks on the cheap album cover, it looks as if this was a rushed released so that Jive can get a quick buck out of this. What happened to the days when GH's albums were released when the artists recorded more than 3 albums? GH's albums used to be something that was kind of like a testament to all their hard work, and reflecting on where they're headed. Now it seems as if GH's albums are released from artists who have barely been around 5 years so they can get a quick pay check."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"*NSYNC have been the most popular group for the past couple years before the pop genre faded into the past and the hip-hop or R&B; world stepped up and most people's fave music genre changed to either one of those or rock, but not pop as much anymore. Although people's musical taste has changed, but the old *NSYNC fans cannot not admit that they have never liked their songs or have a crush on Lance or Justin, or whoever. Back in the days when they are on top of things, I have always listened to their songs on the radio but never really was a big fan but thought that their songs rocks. I always wanted their CD, but then I don't want to get it all because not all of their songs in the past albums are as rockin' as their singles. But now, the time has come, all the singles that they released are on this Greatest Hits, and it is truly, the Greatest Hits.I think this does worth the buy if you once liked the *NSYNC singles and don't own it, then you should get this CD, because it contains all."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINISHED FOOLS","review":"Barely anyone knew this came out.

Even BSB's 2001 GH's album had a new song.Still to this day, even though the teen pop craze was over four years ago, I still consider *N Sync pale Backstreet Boys knock-offs. Even when their management did their best to hype them over BSB in the states, BSB's record sales still top *N Sync's.The only really good song they ever had was the awesome Richard Marx's ballad \\"This I Promise You.\\" \\"Gone\\" had glimpes of greatness, but Timberlake's vocals ruined it which is a shame.*N Sync...Justin Timberlake's stepping stone to superstardom. He just used the other four guys....what were their names again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"If you're a fan, you probably have bought these songs years ago and this realease will be a real disappointment for you. If you are one of the very few people who like Nsync but don't have all three of their albums, this may be a good thing to pick up.The songs are catchy pop music, with the boys singing in tight harmonies. Most of these songs were big hits and show why there's little question that Nsync was the best boy band of the 90's. The trouble is that this CD has a very small well to draw from doesn't offer a compelling reason for fans to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually very catchy ;-)","review":"Yes they are a boy band and yes there seems to be a stigma associated with being in a boy band, but these guys weren't a success for nothing. These songs are actually very catchy tunes and really boppy and fun. What's wrong with that. They can sing and dance and do actually have talent. This cd encompases all the best of their work without leaving anything out (that I can think of) unlike other 'best of' albums where some songs could be missing. This is great and I know that there will be some people who'll buy this anyway because you know these guys have it going on. I love it. This I Promise You is the best song. They are all reconisable and good to dance around the house to. Go get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice walk down memory lane","review":"Seems like Jive released this album without any input from the members of Nsync at all. There are a couple of reworked versions of hits that I've seen on YouTube that I would have loved to have on cd, like a bluesy version of I Want You Back and that hyped out version of It's Gonna Be Me. Seems they did not give them a chance to rework anything or include new material to boost sales.With Justin and JC solo and completely \\"un pop\\" it's doubtful the group will go back to this kind of music. It's obvious Jive doesn't really care, and was just trying to get closer to the contracted amount of albums that Nsync agreed to record for them. Sad, because I was looking forward to a more adult sound from them, more along the lines of what Justin is doing solo.That said, I agree that if you don't have any of your old Nsync music this is a nice one to have. I loved them when they were hot and they remain high on my faves list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"Chip set arrived quickly.

Very sturdy design and very solid once installed. To make a long story short it was worth every penny and I have just added the second mirror to my cart before writing this review.***REVIEW UPDATE***I have been using these mirrors for a month or so now... Once again GREAT PRODUCT!!! Here is what I found out though... If you mount the mirror to the bottom of your existing mirrors, make sure the WIDE ANGLE mirror does not hit the paint on your car if you close the side view mirror. It hits my paint.. I had to move the wide angle mirror to the top of my side view mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap made, but it works.","review":"Pros: Real glass mirror, clear, eliminate blind spot, a must have for large vehicle.Pretty simple to install and pretty secure.

I am thinking to add something to secure the mirror to prevent the rattle.I bought one for the driver side, now just bought a second one for the passenger side.

These after market item are just ugly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind spot mirror - helps","review":"I purchased this for myself on a trail along with the Autobahn mirror from another vendor.Both work well, but I repurchased this for my parents and installed on their vehicle to give them better vision as the Autobahn mirror installs inside the car on your windshield such that with it you look at 2 places inside & out - whereas this mirror fits atop your existing outside mirror such that your eye need only go to one place. EASIER.I do have some hesitation as other reviewers talk about weather resistance, but time will tell and for less than $20 this does help cover blind spots, especially when merging onto the freeway.So for my experience this is a good option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mirabal","review":"This album is Mirabal at his best.

Never did I imagine that once I started the book, I would not be able to put it down until I had finished!! The format was so unique- letters to and from the character Elizabeth to/from real and imagined people. The story was like putting Judy Blume, Marian Keyes and Helen Fielding in a blender and coming out with a tale of present day adolescence.

I could relate to all of the characters in one way or another, especially Elizabeth. She goes through what many teenagers today go through. I loved all of the letters from associations, clubs, etc., especially \\"The Association of Teenagers,\\" which criticizes everything the main character, Elizabeth, does that is is \\"not typical of a teenager.\\" Every page of Feeling Sorry for Celia kept my attention. Jaclyn has told a story in an original, unique way with wonderful characters and situations. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical and lighthearted read","review":"I picked up this book at the book store and knew I had to have it when I saw that one of my favorite authors, Marian Keyes, had given it her stamp of approval (perhaps a silly reason, but nonetheless, it hooked me!). I can't tell you how funny this book is - it engages you at page one and I laughed OUT LOUD throughout the book. The main character is extremely likeable and as you read through her correspondences between her mother, her pen pal and her imaginary demons - you see a very likeable person who I think everyone can identify with on some level. If you are looking for a lighthearted read that will keep you smiling for hours afterwards, this is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a pleasant surprise!","review":"I had read an excerpt of 'Feeling Sorry for Celia' in a magazine and thought it was worth a deeper look. I'm so glad I took the chance to buy my own copy. Jaclyn Moriarty creates some of the most relatable, entertaining, and realistic characters I've seen in young adult literature. While the characters are somewhat eccentric (particularly Celia), I felt like they were more real than so many stereotypical characters I've seen in other novels. Elizabeth sounds like a normal high school student and deals with normal issues, such as her stepfamily, the ending of an old friendship, and the beginning of a new one. I thought that telling the novel through letters was engaging, particularly the use of 'helpful' letters from different 'societies'. What a unique idea! I absolutely loved reading about Elizabeth and her friends; I can't wait to see what Jaclyn Moriarty will do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Sorry For Celia by Taylor K","review":"This book captures all of your attention from the first page to the last page.

When Christina and Elizebth are both in the same hospital visiting reletives, they meet for the first time after writing each other for so long. They become friends and everything works out great.

This is a must read for every teenage girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry for Celia; Happy for us","review":"Author, Jaclyn Moriarty, has created with her lead character Elizabeth, the perfect every girl. During the course of the novel she deals with the same problems and insecurities all young girls face... family problems, best friend issues, boy trouble.The main reason this book stands out from others similar, is its unique format. The entire story is told through notes, letters, and memos from fictitious organizations. Which, again, is something I am sure all girls do.I found this novel in the regular fiction section, possibly because of its length, but I would recommend it to the teenager crowd as well. Perhaps a good novel for both mother and daughter to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Funny and Entertaining quick read. Will appeal to teenagers and older folks who still remember what it was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who IS Celia?","review":"This is a well written novel, but I think it should have a different title. Celia is not mentioned much at all. The book is not even from her point-of-view. The cool part about this book though, is that it is written completely in letters and notes. The story is based in Austraila, which means the dialect and the word selection is much different than the ones in America. It's quite easy to understand, besides that. I especially liked this novel because it is so easy to relate to. I would reccomend this book for anyone from sixth grade on up to about eleventh grade. It is a quick and easy read, and it is quite funny, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a Good Time Reading This Little Gem!","review":"\\"Feeling Sorry For Celia\\" is one of the oddest books. Elizabeth only communicates with her mother via notes on the fridge, gets strange letters from the \\"Soceity of Teenagers\\" (or something like that) and spends most of the book feeling awkward and out of place.The whole thing starts when Elizabeth starts writing Christina for a school pen pal program. We find out about both of them in a present discovery sort of way. From Christina's prgnancy scare to Elizabeth's attempt to save her childhood friendship with Celia, it's an interesting book. I don't know how well Americans will appreciate the humor, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This is the awesomest book!

It honestly is the awesomest book, you'd be sorry if you miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so funny after all","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. The letters from all the made-up committees and organizations were so clever and funny, but the overall feel of the book was depressing. Teenagers with mixed-up, messed-up and dysfunctional lives.

I think the lady that wrote this had a great idea with all of her notes and letters, but I gave up on the book about half-way through and returned it very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I like the book a lot because it was a great way to get the attention of the adventure book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ book","review":"It was a very good book!

It's about girls not being allowed to go anywhere in ancient Greece, not being allowed to go to school, or the olympics, or anywhere outside, and not being allowed to learn to read or write... my 3 yr old girl and 5 yr old boy were really distressed by the injustice of it (the girl burst into tears!). I just don't see any need to put the idea into young people's minds that boys and girls aren't equal. It left all of us with a real bitter taste... there are plenty of other/better books for your youngsters, so choose something else.

The interviews, which must have taken place shortly before his death, focus on his imprisonment by the Japanese during WW2 and his quest for the last people living the traditional life of the Bushman (San) in the Kalahari Desert in the 1950s. There are several excerpts from the film he made for the BBC on that quest, a film that is otherwise unobtainable; anyone who has read Lost World of the Kalahari will find these fascinating. Disappointingly, there is very little about other periods in his life, but what we do get is a very worthwhile experience of this truly exceptional human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot jazz","review":"This is a great cd not only charles lloyd but also keith jarrett in their early years the live section is so well recorded this is a cd worth having in any jazz collection it is five star value"},{"rating":"2","title":"transcendent, magical journey of sunrise, sunset","review":"This is one of my all time favorite jazz cds. I have the original vinyl, scratched as it has played so often. Now I am grateful for the remaster on cd.I was introduced to this by a jazz drummer (who became my fiance), and he said it was the best music to accompany love-making.I was entranced. The great musicianship of jazz dynamos Lloyd, Jarrett, DeJohnette is a thrilling combination. The lyrical style, the Trane-like free form, the interplay of Lloyd and Jarett, are uplifting with some of the steps leading to a spirit evoking transcendence. It produces a gritty giddy sweetness in those reached for notes. (What build up to those high reaching notes! ah,sigh) Sunrise, sunset flow into each other with a subtlety.It is a great cd for captivating a jazz start up collection, and intricate enough to satisfy the seasoned jazz buff.

Steve then climbs aboard, runs through the cockpit arrangement, fires her up and taxis to the end of the Planes of Fame airstrip. After taking off, Steve shows us the planes excellent flight capabilities and noting some of its limitations.Overall an excellent video, although a little short and for me not enough high speed flybys.

Peter Ustinov here builds on the sly but endearing crook persona he won Oscars for in Spartacus and Topkapi. While the characters in those films are expressions of Ustinov's great abilities in making sleazy characters sympathetic, this film goes beyond the slightly over-the-top characterisations of those films to present a fully-rounded character in the context of a credible and somewhat touching love story. This is particularly remarkable because Hot Millions is a light and airy 60s caper film. The scenes between Ustinov and Maggie Smith are brilliant, exhibiting a humourous warmth all too little seen in films, and there is great comedy generated by the presence of Karl Malden and Bob Newhart. Nice score and tight direction too. In my opinion, one of the very best mainstream movies of the late 60s, and one which gives renewed pleasure on each viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"I watch this film every year at least once.

McGinniss manages to involve the reader in the story and the characters, a struggling team of soccer players in a small Italian town who manage to temporarily advance in the national ranking. The depiction of the Italian lifestyle and personalities is very amusing. McGinniss inserts himself in the life of the town and becomes a consultant to the team, even if his advice is not always sollicited.

Just as the readers do, some characters in the book associate with his funny side, some with his compassion, others with his clumsy side. Like the characters in the book most of us are turned off by McGinniss because of his \\"greater than thou\\" stance. As someone who knows no Italian, rather than confuse me, the movement from English to Italian has motvated me to learn more of the language and to visit the country, which is exquisitely described by the author. Overall a good story on how the game takes over peoples lives, and a behind the scenes look at a professional soccer environment; a good read for both soccer and non-soccer loving readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story poorly told","review":"As a fan of Italy, soccer, and Italian soccer, I expected to love this book but it just plain stunk. McGinnis took a Cinderella story about a small soccer team in a charming town and turned it into a snorer. How? By injecting himself as the book's main character. Instead of showing us the miracle, he tells us in details bogged down by first person impressions of interviews, characters and what they said to \\"Joe,\\" and other personal opinions. Suspense is nil. We spend as much time hanging around with \\"Joe\\" in the small town as we do at soccer games, and the whole rambling affair ends up more like a bad travelogue than a Cinderella story.

FURTHERMORE THE MOVIE'S SUCCESS WILL RESULT IN THE BOOK BECOMING THE BEST SELLER THAT IT DESERVES TO BE NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"The nerve of this mindless, ignorant blowhard is so rivolting that I've pitched this rag of a book for good. Who, on earth, does he think is? I'll tell you. He was the genesis of today's arrogant, jock-sniffing sports journalist who takes pot-shots at the men of sport, which is simply the manifestation of extreme jealousy. They will always be a bridesmaid, never the bride. He reads a few books on calcio, believes himself an expert, then has the gall to suggest recommendations to the coach. Once you get past his typical American cluelessness and his oh-so typical leftist rant (i.e. the left's love affair with persons of color), you are left with about 50 pages of a realistic travelogue. As someone who has dedicated 20 years to the \\"Beautiful Game\\", I resent the fact that I paid one cent for this disgraceful body of prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Arrogance","review":"Although the book purports to speak to a year in the life of an Italian football team, it rather highlights typical American arrogance. This book is more telling about the author than anything else. As an author covering the team he thrusts himself as a knoweldgable member of the football community 9although clearly a novice). His arrogance in the manner of interacting with the team, as described in the book, is insulting. I would not recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their interest in football, or Joe McGinnis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice story","review":"This book was especillay enjoyable to read this summer after Italy's win in the World Cup. Regardless, I found the book a delight to read. If you enjoy Soccer or Italy, you would likely enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Soccer Parent","review":"Yes, it's a well-written book and certainly gives an insight to working-class Italian life so you're taken off the tourist path. But beware: the author knows virtually nothing about the game and then, in the grand tradition of the know-it-all, overbearing American soccer parent, wades into the coach nd players with advise on how to do their job. These are professional coaches and players and how they found the patience to put up with his boorish stupidity, I'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A year in the life of Joe McGinniss","review":"Agree entirely with the previous review. A good tale spoilt by a self-indulgent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story ruined by annoying author","review":"The actual story that is supposed to be told would have been a great story. However, the arrogance and poor writing style of the author made me cringe every time I turned the page. The fact that the story about the unlikely successes of a team turned into a story about the author's 9 month vacation in Italy was a shame. This must be the first book I've ever read where I literally couldn't stand the author and the only thing that got me through the book was the underlying tale of this incredible soccer team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good story","review":"This book was a fun read with interesting characters and an engaging story line. Was McGuinness totally out of line? Sure. Did he upset me with his actions? Certainly. Does that mean this isn't a good book? Certainly not! In fact, McGuinness' actions help make the book even more enjoyable. Just when you thought he couldn't get any worse he did and that simply adds even more to the already wonderful and ubelieveable story. One thing that drove me nuts was his extreme overuse of Italian words and phrases throughout the entire book. Do we really need to have Italian words pop up in every other sentence? Does it really help the story to have entire sentences in Italian? I just learned to skip every Italian sentence I came across and this was by far my biggest complaint with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks the Life Out of a Great Story","review":"I agree with the other reviews - McGinniss takes one of the greatest sports stories of our generation, misses the point completely and turns it into a travelogue of an egotistical American's time in Italy. Okay, one star for recognizing there is a story here. However a monkey would have seen that.It IS possible for an American to write a decent football book - see Geoffrey Douglas' \\"The Game of Their Lives.\\" If only the subject matter here would have received similar treatment. There are at least 11 stories that should have been told that will forever be lost thanks to McGinniss' hack job.The only thing that is clear by the end is that Joe continues to marvel in the fact that he is an American that knows a little about soccer. Avoid unless you want the game explained to you from this perspective and anectdotes about Joe's time hangin' with Alexi Lalas. Blech."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it's worth...","review":"Most of the criticism of this book is aimed at the author's inappropriate application of american sensibilities to Italian calcio.This may be a fair criticism, but to me, this was an interesting part of the book. Sure, McGinniss seems a bit overbearing at times (though hardly an 'Ugly American' as some here have implied). But the story told from this point of view makes it even more interesting.In the end this book is more than just the rags-to-riches story of a minor league Italian soccer team. It's about immersion in another culture, and finding out that even the most knee-jerk liberal american sensibilities won't shield one from being occasionally judgemental about what one finds. In the end, the author is clearly in love with Italy, Italian calcio, and Castel di Sangro---for better and for worse.For what it's worth, I'm an american soccer fan who enjoys learning about other cultures and languages. I think that most people with these sets of interests will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbounding","review":"Similar to JK's other books I have read this kept me thrilled right up to the last page.

Still - it's in-line with other Ralph's World CD's...genuinely fun and silly, and catchy enough to engage parents in the fun of dancing and singing along.

I like the fact that the director distinguishes between the different kinds of nursing homes and walks you through the check-list of a home. Also, the film points out \\"just because a nursing home is pretty from the outside, doesn't mean its pretty from the inside.\\" So, you can not judge a book by its cover. You have to gather as much facts as you can about the nursing home of your choice. These are some of the high-lights of this film. I found it to be informative and easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to choose the best nursing","review":"Mr Ghazaei has presented a sensitive and well documented review of the steps one should take in trying to evaluate a nursing home for a loved one.

I thought it might be just a sloppy sequal. Fortunately, I was proved wrong. In fact, it fits right in with the first book, K-PAX.The story takes place 5 years after the original book, when Prot returns home. All the main characters are back, along with some interesting new ones at the hospital.Like the last book, this novel leaves you wondering whether or not Prot really was who he said he was, or just a dillusionary effect of multiple personality disorder. In my opinion, the first book is more convincing that Prot is human, but in this one he seems more alien.Either way, this is a great book that continues the exciting story of Prot from K-PAX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prot (Mr. Hyde) is not hidden!","review":"This book helps complete the story begun in K-PAX, but the narrator is becoming too wooden and predictable - much like the skeptical characters one finds in THE X-FILES. Having a foil to the phenomena on hand can seem plausible only so long.Nevertheless, the story is great fun, and one must hand it to Dr. Gene Brewer for his skill at interweaving psychology and science-fiction in an odd and entertaining fashion that never delves into the bathic, but keeps the reader thirsting for more contact with the protagonist - whoever he may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent USB Speaker","review":"I bought this USB speaker from Amazon a few weeks ago. As I found again, I found the best price here - no other website or dealer could give me this price!It is indeed an excellent USB speaker - the sound is very loud and the quality is also very good. This is not a speaker that you'd want for a party (its not that loud), but is absolutely charming for watching a movie on your laptop. The best feature is its no hassle transportability. Just remove the USB cord and slip the speaker in its bag to take it anywhere. So, it makes for an ideal presentation speaker for mobile professionals.And yes, you can turn up the volume and dance in your own living room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal Surf Music!","review":"These guys have the sound, the attitude, and some great new surf songs.

Charlie tells amusing tales with his songs, and focuses on this aspect of his music. No carried-away guitar solos here, or high-falutin' vocal gymnastics. Just good-natured Texas music (I hesitate to call it country which brings up images of Garth Brooks and Reba McIntire in my head, yuck) which is perfect for a backyard BBQ or a road trip or just drinkin' a beer.

The first book lacked on the action and soared on the characters interaction. This second book has action in good quanity and yet not too much.

Multiple points of view showcase Wallace's tug and pull between football and drama, as he chooses his real and false friends. Each point of view comes from somewhat one-dimensional, but intriguing characters who all learn a little bit about themselves, friendship and loyalty.

In the book each chapter changes character so you get to see the book from a couple of points of view. I thought that was really cool about the book. Even though the book is called No More Dead Dogs it isn't about dogs. It is about a boy who doesn't like it when the dog dies at the end of a book. At some parts in the story were funny.the book was so good i couldn't put it down.I would recommend this book to 4th,5th,or 6th graders. this book is not that long it is only about 150 pages long and it has pretty short chapters.I loved this book and I think you should read it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Dead Dogs Rules!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best book ever written!

Korman's humor is geared toward third graders though at times his vocabulary would soar over their heads. Although not terribly written to anyone who is over the age of 11 it would seem jumpy and some may rightfully argue they could do better. I'm not saying it isn't a good book for younger kids who have a parent who is willing to explain what a few words mean; I just suggest that if you have older kids do not make them read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More dead Dogs","review":"No More Dead Dogs is a wonderful book!

He gets a detention and now Wallace can't play football. Everyone is mad at Wallace for getting the detention. For his detention he had to go to the gym to stay there for the rehearsal of Old Shep my Pal. Then someone trashed the play! Everyone thinks Wallace Wallace was the one who trashed the play.

I enjoyed it so much that I began reading it aloud to my 5th grade class. That was a mistake. The book is in 5 or so different points of view and it's difficult to read this aloud, unless several people are reading the book. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend anyone to read it, but if you do it as a read-aloud make sure to have the kids listen to it as a book on tape/cd or with several different experienced readers. Also be aware that the word \\"jackass\\" makes an appearance in the book several times, and that tends to cause a lot of snickering in class."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Dead Dogs","review":"Funny and good book that has a great lesson about honesty.

I was relunctant to write a review for this book, but its atrocities was too overwhelming to ignore. I would NOT recommend this book. Buy Barron's, it's harder, but prepares you much better. This book is just filled with too many errors. First off, some of the multiple choice answers don't match with the explanation. Such as this one problem on page. 83 where the explanation says the answer is A, yet the answer they give you on top is B. Other problems abound when they try to explain simple things such as Electron Affinity. I don't know what kind of explanation they attempt to give but whatever it is, it is far off from what I've learned in my Chemistry AP class and from what my teacher has taught (Also different from the Princenton Review Explanation).

Grey has a certain quality of voice that compels you to give her your undivided attention. Her voice is both powerful and sweet with a distinctive and lovely texture. It is a voice well suited to Native American ballads and the songs of Ireland and Scotland.One of the best things about her singing is that it radiates a great love for traditional music. She just seems to know what is right in the interpretation of a traditional song. She is a ballad singer of great strength with a fine understanding of the importance of understatement. Her singing is richly emotional and she is equally at home with a gentle lyric or a harsh account of life on the frontier.This wonderful cd is a great window into a forgotten part of our musical past. It is a must for anyone who wishes to hear what music sounded like in long ago America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"This is a great collection of very true American music.

Usually, the characters in her books are so well developed that I not only know exactly how they look and act, I've picked the ones i want to be friends with; here, as gray and as flat as can be.I have never been so dissappointed in one of VLT's books before that in the middle of it I went back to make sure of the author I was actually reading.

In fact, much of the book is poorly developed, there is very little flow. The author seems to be writing for a high school rag citing all the petty grievances that he can dredge up from any disagreement with Steve Jobs.

Deutschman always keeps things interesting, but he is almost certainly too harsh in his critique of Jobs. The problem with writing any biography on Jobs is that he is a fairly personal individual outside of his business persona. There is a general feeling throughout the book that Deutschman is captivated by Jobs but does not necesarily like him. However, because there are so few recent biographies of Mr. Jobs, this one becomes a must read. Worth the time for any Steve Jobs fan, not for its insiGHT, but for its insiDE information and story telling.

The authors slap some impressively technical definitions in the text without actually making an attempt to translate what the definitions mean. They provide numerous examples but instead of explaining the examples they add a formula underneath it without providing any real explanation of the formula. This leaves the student frustrated and painstakingly searching the internet for an explanation to the author's lack of explanation. This book is not worth the money they charge for it and will leave your students thinking that mastering the basics of statistics is impossible. This book does not provide a good foundation to act as a statistics book for beginners nor does it offer anything to those experienced with statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"pmoseley","review":"The book was used, but in good condition.

I figured they'd fit in the relatively tiny seats in my '90 Miata. No such luck. They were NOT meant for ANY sort of bucket seat, as there is no fabric allowance for the bend where your butt sits.

Along the lines of bands like Pillar and Justifide, Pax217 is bringing a refreshing feel to \\"popular Christian\\" music. For once, here is an album that is not afraid to tackle hard issues head on, including sexual abuse and rape (\\"What is Love?\\"). This album is innovative and intensely honest, something rare in the Christian music industry. Get it if you're tired of the fluff that encompasses most \\"Christian pop,\\" or if you want a great album that will rock you and challenge you. There is an awesome combination of musical styles on this album, from reggae to punk to worship. Overall, my top recommendation of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engage...The best CD ever","review":"PAX217's new album \\"Engage\\" is nothing short of awesome!

Just one listen will fill your veins with the rhythm that is Pax 217 and you will wonder what your ears had been listening to before. You will jump, dance, and sing along with the pulsation emanating from your speakers. You may even reel at the power of the rhythm and words of a song that looks at rape from the perspective of the Victim's future Christian lover. \\"Engage\\" your mind in the rhythm revolution that is Pax 217."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"This cd is not worth buying at all.

The film has been chopped up, the sound is deplorable (I have a cassette made from a RAI-Italy radio broadcast live from the Rome Opera House--almost the same cast--by a then-20+ year old student with minimal resources and an inexpensive RTR tape recorder and the sound, transferred first to cassette and then to CD, is 10 times better than Bel Canto's. This is not unique in Bel Canto's catalog.

This book irritated me -the author is pompous and the book is shallow at best. He doesn't spend enough time on how to market yourself, but encourages you to spend about $10K for an in home studio - if you REALLY want to make it in this business.

How would they recast a role made famous by Ahnuld? Then I saw this series and was really impressed by this Ralph Moeller. I never heard of the guy before I saw this show and he makes a great hero for a fantasy show. He's a little more like Steeve Reeve's Hercules than Conan since this series was made with a kid audience in mind. Moeller comes across as the nicest Conan ever and yet that's not a bad thing since Moeller makes it work. Yes the production values were low and few saw this series and yet when all is said and done I liked it. The guy who called this the \\"Plan 9 of fantasy series\\" is right. This is a very fun and funny show and the females are hot too. No matter what some Scrooges say I'm not afraid to admit that I had a blast watching this.

I watched this when it was on a small time local TV station in my area and really enjoyed it but nobody I know ever even heard of it. Ralf Moeller was a excellent as Conan and Danny Woodburn really shined. I enjoyed the continuity of the episodes which was something different from other fantasy shows (that may have also hurt the show since viewers had to keep up with it) and it was obviously cheaply made but that was part of it's charm.

Watch out for bear left vs. turn left but unit recovers quickly to get you back on track if you make a wrong turn. Looking at the unit before a turn is best on complex intersections or interchanges.

In short, it is one of the best purchases that I have ever made. Though it lacks many of the functions of newer units (narrating street names, bluetooth connectivity, music playback, traffic updates, etc.), it just works!Updating the map and firmware are also a breeze on the Garmin i5. I am a Mac user, and am satisfied in Garmin's commitment to support the Mac platform.I highly recommend this unit for those looking for a budget GPS solution.

The i5 for me was the perfect unit. It may not have all the bells and whistles of those other units but it gets the job done. It is so small that it allows for many placement options. Normally, I keep it in one of my cupholders since I can hear the voice prompts. On longer, unfamiliar drives, I attach it to the windshield. Also, I consider the fact that it uses ordinary AA batteries a real plus. I just pop in two NiMH batteries and don't have to run a cord when attaching it to the windshield.I have found that its directions are sometimes off depending on the address (can get left and right confused), but at that point, it is usually obvious that the Garmin is wrong.I bought a mid-sized camera case for travel use since it is much cheaper than the Garmin case.Overall, this is a great product at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mounting problem","review":"Guiding the directions and other functionality is good.

But he's no good - - he wags his tail whenever he gets a good hand.The StreetPilot is amazing. It really communicates with satellites. It can tell where you are, and find routes to other addresses.Of course, it's a slow and painful battle to enter the target address with the one-wheel-no-buttons interface. It has a tendency to choose nasty snaky routes with thousands of turns, presumably in an effort to save you 1/2 mile versus a sensible route on major arteries. Every now and then it directs you into a parking lot or a nonexistent exit. It's constantly losing the satellite signal. Then it falls off the window ... again.You can make the effort to use this unit and marvel at the things technology can do.Or, you can use Mapquest, print a nice map, and be ready to go in 15 seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now you'll know where you're going and how to get there!","review":"Do you hate looking at maps or asking for directions? Now you'll never have to again. The Garmin is easy to use once you get used to it and after inputing your destination you don't really have to take your eyes off the road. Just be sure that you're not near tall buildings or tall trees when activating the unit. Gaining satellite access is really important to have it run properly. One thing you should do however, is have an address of your destination. It will save time wasted in scrolling through landmarks. The screen is small, but well lit for night driving. The best feature is that the unit talks you through all turns and changes in direction. It also shows your speed and the time of arrival at your destination. A bit pricey, but overall a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Minor Problems","review":"I have had this unit for about 3 weeks now, and have found some pro's and cons this is my first GPS unit I have owned:Pros:1.Great Navigation2.About 95% accurate3.Very Compact4.Runs on AA batteries5.Easy to set up6.Can add your own POI's (point of interest)7.No maps to downloadCONS1.

It suits us fine - complaints about batteries? It's not Garmin's fault on battery life and that's why there's a cord included. When my batteries warned me they were low, I pulled over to the shoulder, attached the cord and continued. I have not gotten any messages from Garmin about $75 for updates, maybe soon? Either way - this baby got me to all locations without a hitch. And since it talks to me, why do I have to worry about glare? I haven't gotten lost once since I got it. And the dash mount accessory was worth the price. I'm getting a third as a gift for someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but go for C320","review":"This one brought a price-wise revolution in GPS industry.I5 is the cheapest GPS reciever available with the ability to hold all of North America.However, with SD card so cheap and C320 on sale, I do not see any reason for not going for C320 which has a bigger screen and touch screen which makes data entry a breeze wheras entring address from wheel can be frustrating.I am a lifelong GPS user and I think C320 is the best product for under $500. I used C320 side by side by Street pilot I5 and Neuvo and MS streets GPS. Garmin mapping functionality is almost identical but bgger screen and touch screen makes a difference.The only limitation with C320 was no preloaded maps and expensive external memory. Now a 2G SD card costs $40 and 1 G (which will have 90% of US) costs $25. So I do not see any reason for going for smaller Street pilot I5 or much more expensive C330."},{"rating":"2","title":"Input process is a bit slow...","review":"This is a great device, and arrives pre-loaded with maps and local information for the entire country!Two minor inconveniences:First, it requires you to input the state and city each time you use it. This take a bit of time, as you use the thumb wheel to key in letters, and then use it again to select the actual state. You then repeat the process for the city.Second, it's sometimes slow to lock onto the satellites, which may take several minutes. So, you're forced to either 1) sit there and wait, or 2) start driving knowing that you may have to turn around and head a different direction once the unit starts navigating.If you're very Type A, you may want to choose a unit with a touchscreen, and one which locks on faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"The StreetPilot i5 is very easy to use and accurate. The windshield mount is very sturdy. I have no problems at all with this unit and I'm not sure how I traveled without one. My work takes me numerous places in the U.S. and Canada.

Very nice unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses satellite reception on a clear day","review":"I've owned this unit now for about a year. While it doesn't always provide me with the best route, it does provide me with a reasonable route. When it can find satellite reception. Last night, it lost satellite reception for a full half hour.

I use it all the time to find new locations, nearby attractions, and to estimate arrival time.I was leary about the suction cup on the windsheild mount, after reading other reviews. The mount worked great for about six months and then the suction cup became corroded-looking. We contacted the manufacturer who said this was covered under warranty and is sending out an improved version of the mount immediately.I have been very pleased with the performance of this GPS, and now am very impressed by Garmin, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this; here's why","review":"I'm writing this as of Dec. 1, 2006. If you are considering a portable GPS navigation system, do NOT consider the Garmin i5 or any other GPS that does not use the new SiRF III GPS signal receiver. (The only exception is Sony's NAV-U GPS systems, which use a proprietary receiver that's actually even better than the Indian-made SiRF chips).Any GPS you consider buying (except the Sony models) must have the new SiRF receiver. All the new Garmin models (e.g. all the Nuvi's) do, as do new Magellan and TomTom models. The better receiver makes a world of a difference in signal acquisition and retention. Don't settle for less, period, or you'll be quite frustrated at times.One more tip: stick with a dedicated GPS navigation from a reputed brand like Garmin, TomTom, Sony, or Magellan. Avoid PDA-GPS combos and avoid off-brands like Averatec, Mio, FineDrive, etc. The quality differences are huge. The namebrands are just much better investments, period.Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin StreetPilot i5 Automotive GPS Navigator","review":"I wish I would have purchased the touch screen and the Garmin that provided me with alternative routes to my destination.

Sadly, it takes you in completely the wrong direction far to often. When programing in a favorite restaurant the Garmin i5 was 5 blocks short of the correct destination and on the incorrect side of the road. The Garmin i5 has given routing instructions that would drive you into the Missouri river instead of the correct left hand turn (and only option). The Garmin i5 in another instance said the destination was 300 miles away when it was essentially across the street. These are just a few of the errors the Garmin i5 has made. The technical support people were polite but only suggested a new map update. The unit was brand new when making these \\"mistakes\\" and I don't want to spend more money for a map update when it should have had correct mapping in the beginning. If you want a high percentage of accuracy finding your destination it's not the Garmin i5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I have had this product less than 1 month.

The Garmin I5 sells for a great price for a pre-loaded unit with all the states on it and I believe it still ships for free on Amazon.I have used the Garmin I5 a lot in the time I have had it and it has always worked as it should. If you need to stray from your route, it will simply tell you it is recalculating and give you another way to get there..no problem...it even told me to make a u turn when I passed up my destination and we all got a good laugh out of that.We have friends that paid nearly $4,000 for a GPS factory installed in their Infinity and they can't take it with them when traveling and having to rent a car or when using a different vehicle..the Garmin can be taken anywhere and it will get you to your destination just as good as the $4,000 unit will.I would recommend this Garmin I5 or the I3 (which doesn't have the states preloaded)without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin i5","review":"The Garmin i5 is reasonably precise but the size of the screen is very small.The voice feature on my i5 failed.

Find a Good Price","review":"Garmin has discontinued this product (and the i3 and i2).It is a very good product. But, technology evolves. Garmin discontinued this product within the past few days.Prices for the i5 may fall rapidly.Personally, I like this i5 better than Garmin's c330. The c330 does more and has the \\"neat\\" touch screen. But, as a casual user, I like how the tiny i5 can be stowed away without taking up much room. The softball-sized c330 takes up too much room for my taste. I don't want a big, noticeable GPS sitting on my dashboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and easy","review":"The Garmini5 navigator is very easy to use and portable.

It is much smaller in person (the screen is only like 1.5 inches) and the plastic quality looks cheap. I wasn't pleased at all and opted for the NUVI 360, instead. Bear in mind, I did not actually use the product. It just didn't look like something my husband would have liked, so I returned it, unused. Not a bad buy for less discerning tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid frustration","review":"Received unit yesterday. My son and I tried for several hours to figure out why it keeps looking for a satellite signal and never advances further. We tried multiple regions. Unfortunately technical support of Garmin is only open on business days 8-8. No benefit from FAQS site at Garmin web site. After several frustrating hours, I have arranged for a refund.

There is no way to get the GPS to repeat the command (i.e. \\"in 500 feet keep right\\") if you were not listening.The screen is small, but easy to read and see, if you have above average to good vision.

A few comments.- It is sometimes a little slow in finding satellites.- Small screen is no issue at all if you are following directions, but if you want to checkout the area around you on the Map etc, it is not very useful.Otherwise, it is an amazing little unit. Wheel is great way to enter information, and at least for me easier than a touchscreen (where I have trouble touching the right place in a moving car). POI are as expected, and same as what you will get with a more expensive unit.Another neat feature is adding a via point, which is great when you are on the road and feel like dropping into a Starbucks - search for starbucks, add it as via point, pick up your coffee and continue on your way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin GPS","review":"Works find - easy instructions easy to program addresses. small and portable but does get confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it","review":"After receiving my I5 it worked right out of the box as advertised.

I will say this for Amazon, their return policy is excellent. if something breaks within a certain period of time, or is broken out of the box, they will ship another one back to you immediately or in my case, they will refund your money very quickly. I would have no problem ordering from Amazon in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"This might be the coolest thing I've ever owned!","review":"What a neat little gadget! My first reaction was surprise at the small size of the unit. Don't know why, but I expected something a lot larger. Turns out that this little thing is the ideal size. I am still learning to use it, but so far, not one complaint. I don't know how it could be any easier to use. The easy to use scroll wheel dials in the address without a problem. The verbal commands are excellent. The colorful read-out screen is perfect. I have used it a few times with perfect results. When I tried to trick the unit by making a wrong turn, it immediately recalculated the route to get me back on track.The unit works on battery power or auto accessory.

The only tune that worked for me (if I may be just a bit too cute about it) is a re-make of Echoes -- originally by Pink Floyd.

Martinez fills most of the pages with odd sideline stories and flashbacks that have nothing to do with the real Las Vegas. My guess is that he spent all his time in Vegas partying instead of writing and upon returning to NY, not being able to remember many of the salacious facts, just filled in the pages with fluff.The \\"Man with the $100,000 Breasts\\" is a better read if, like me, you're looking for the fun casino war stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.....","review":"This book; diary written in a fashion that often leaves the reader bored.

I was surprised at how little he gambled during his trip. I would have liked it better had he spent more time and detail on the gambling and less on the way he killed time while he was there. It seemed that he got tired of the whole thing about half way through the book and was just rushing to finish, spending very little time gambling and even less time writing about it. I was hoping for more than 138 hours of gambling during a 30 day trip with a $50,000 bankroll.

At the very least, I expected an interesting trip report with accounts of lavish suites and attention showered on this temporary high roller. Although some parts of the book were mildly interesting, there is no meat. I came away from the book not knowing anything more about what a high roller experiences than I knew before I read the book. The tales of the characters he met were somewhat informative and interesting but his account of his attempt at high rolling fell flat. A mediocore book at best. I want the juice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos from New York","review":"While I must admit that I'm not the gambling type, 24/7 had me completely addicted. It's a highly amusing chronicle of the author's adventures in Las Vegas and of the colorful characters he comes in contact with along the way. Martinez portrays the people he meets with respect, regardless of their position in life. You end up really liking him, with his humorous, down-to-earth style and his quirky references to his cat Trotsky and his practical wife Kathy back home. The book also has suspenseful moments when Martinez gets more and more into the gambling himself. After reading it, I'm actually thinking about going out to Vegas myself sometime to check out the mega hotels he describes so vividly and to experience all else the city has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must read' before a trip to Vegas","review":"I read this book as part of a 'homework' assignment before my first trip to Las Vegas. The most intriguing thing about this book is the subtle humor Andreas uses throughout its entirety. And the fact that he thoroughly reasearches not only the hotels and the town, but the people of Las Vegas as well, makes it fascinating. He befriends a tennis instructor, an old casino 'regular' and even ends up at a gambler's anonymous meeting. The characters he ends up meeting are quite intriguing. Every time he would recount his gambling experiences, I would be applauding his wins or feeling sorry for his losses. This book is a definitely one to take with you on the plane as it certainly kept me laughing out loud and snickering to myself in the airport! I can't wait for Mr.Martinez to write similar books for every vacation destination! His writing will not tire you out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"I began reading 24/7 on a flight and upon arrival at my hotel, I cancelled my plans for the rest of the day, called up Room Service and had the sheer joy of reading the bulk of the book straight through to the end. Witty, well-written, highly entertaining, and informative about the phenomenon of today's Las Vegas....... this book is a must-read no matter what level of interest a person has in Vegas or in gambling: even if one thinks it is none at all! The author's daily forays into the casinos caused me to \\"suffer\\" when he was losing and cheer when he was ahead. Best of all was reading about his adventures outside the casino and feeling I was getting to know the fascinating people who crossed his path. I came away with a much better understanding of what the new Vegas is all about. The book is total enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic, funny account of Vegas!","review":"This book was a great read! In addition to the clever premise, the book is incredibly informative about the history and culture of (and behind) Vegas. I got the book in preparation for a trip to Sin City, and now feel doubly prepared to exerience the highs and lows involved in visiting such a unique town. Highly recommended! I am looking forward to reading Martinez's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, not a history lesson","review":"I really love going to Vegas but wouldn't necessarily call myself a \\"junkie.\\" However, its energy and irreverance really get me going. I read this book on the way into Vegas and it really got me in the mood for the experience. Martinez's humor and light-hearted view of his day-to-day exploits really keep the book moving. You feel his pain as his \\"nest egg\\" fluctuates way up and down from his initial $50,000 advance. I found myself yelling \\"STOP WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD\\" quite a few times as he went into a couple free-falls (hmmm, I think I've told myself that a few times). He also interviews various Vegas locals to get more of a flavor of the place. I would have liked a bit more details on these locals stories and some of the gambling experiences. All in all, the book is a fun read and definitely help you get a feeling of the wildly-fluctuating experience of Vegas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"24/7 is a gripping book. Even though my wife just had a baby and free time is at a premium, I found myself stealing away to read Mr. Martinez's account of his month in Las Vegas. What impressed me the most was Mr. Martinez's ability to transport me to the casinos he visited. His ability to capture the essence of the fascinating people he encountered, the rollercoaster all night gambling sessions and the City of Las Vegas is astounding.I also discovered that 24/7 is not just a book about gambling. It is an insightful look into American culture at the end of the 20th century.I've recommended 24/7 to all of my friends and suggest that you pick-up a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"After This I Read Scoblete and I'm Ready to Go!","review":"I loved this book and after reading it I decided to learn something about casino games so I picked up a few books by Frank Scoblete, another great writer of gambling books. 24/7 is so much fun that you'll want to learn the games and go to Luxor and play yourself. Of course, you should probably only count cards at blackjack and avoid all the other games but 24/7 made Vegas come alive.

This is a keeper, and I recommend it to everyone.Lisa Kleypas is a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I have read quite a few of Lisa Kleypas's novels and I have to say this is one of her best. Love the characters, love the story line but I think it is too bad he gave up on rebuilding his gambling hell and instead built a hospital. Maybe that is just me but I think a man can still be a good guy and run a gambling hell, just look at Lord St. Vincent!!! Yummy man that he is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello? The hero goes to bed with another woman!","review":"Is it just me, or are all these positive reviews insane? At one point in this book, Derek, who is heart-broken about losing Sara, goes to bed with one of his prostitutes who looks just like her. This prostitute then goes on to tell Sara about this encounter, and describes it as evidence of Derek's love for her. Sara is so \\"touched\\" by this heart-warming story, that she goes back to him. Yeah, I know that whenever I hear about my man going to bed with another woman, I just can't WAIT to get back together with him. Does anyone who wrote these positive reviews really think that if they were confronted by a look-alike who had slept with their one true love, that they would be \\"touched\\" and motivated to run right back into his arms? Please.

I like a story line, more than just two people finding each other, and doing it. I thought that Sara was vain and immature and Derek missed the mark with me too, by sleeping with the woman that looked like Sara, therefore showing his love for Sara, PLEASE! Add stupid to Sara for believing that zinger.There was no real story appeal here, just primping, posturing, drinking and other immature, silly attention getting stuff that made me not like either Sara or Derek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional...........One of the best","review":"This is my first Kleypas book and was not disappointed.... The way he let her go was touching and the ending well...... it nearly made me cry...Now i have to find her other books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Well, as much as it pains me to have to agree with an overzelous fangirl, see Dori's review below, even I have to admit this is one of the better books to come out of the genre. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that no one ever critcize a Lisa Kleypas book. After all, Lisa Kleypas has written some duds in her time, every author has, this just dosn't happen to be one of them. I wouldn't excuse Derek Craven's going to bed with one of his prostitutes by saying he's tortured, lonely, whatever-it's just the way the character of Derek is. He is nothing if not a flawed individual, and that's exactly why he is so endearing to the reader. Sure, I don't like to think of poor Tabitha (prostitute in question) who will never get a HEA because she is a woman, but the good girl bad boy dinamics of the story were fun to read about, and it was well written. So, while Derek's infidelity might bother the reader somewhat, I don't think it would ruin the entire book for many people."},{"rating":"1","title":"SURPRISINGLY BORING---","review":"Hour after hour of the same thing: the heroine being soft-spoken and perfect, the hero feeling inadequate of the heroine and remaining emotionally reserved, tons of mundane domestic scenes and one of the dullest endings I have encountered in a while. It became so very monotonous. Also, the hero was never really brought to life but remained a flat character that never stirred any attachment or reaction from the reader/listener. I found this narrator, Rosalyn Landor(Audible), who usually adds enjoyment to the experience, quite monotonous here too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!!","review":"Dreaming Of You is my absolute favorite romance novel. I've read so many books by Lisa Kleypas, but this one is just simply the best. Derek is my favorite hero out of her books, he's just so hot! And Sara was perfect for Derek, they make such a good couple. This book deserves a 10!!-Anne Rose Duenas"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lisa Kleypas \\"Must Read\\"","review":"Romance at it's best.

If you have never read a Lisa Kleypas book I can guarantee you will enjoy the ride as much as I have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"This book was ok, even though the start should have warned me it wasn't as good as the reviews suggest when the innocent young heroine shoots a guy and gets over it really quickly. The hero was likable enough, but the story just kind of meandered around and when he couldn't even tell it was her because she wore a small mask over her eyes, well that was just silly. And then he slips into his cockney accent when he gets upset, but only for a moment as it's just used as an effect by the writer. I just didn't get the real connection between these two, they aren't around each other enough in the beginning to really have one develop so suddenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Love Story","review":"I adore a hero who is saved by love, so this book was perfect for me. The pace was just right to keep me from skimming the pages, as I often do with romances. What else can I add that hasn't been said already?

It was so slow paced and dull. Read the reviews, prior to purchasing, and was hoping for something more than what I ended up reading.

What was so good in this story anyway? The only thing that I was interested in, was to know what happened later to that annoying mother-in-law to be (she is very realistic). Other than that, I will not recommend this book, nothing unusual there that kept my attention. I loved Lisa Kleypas's Again the Magic (wow, you need handkerchiefs, that story was like one of Judith Mcnaught books).I expected too much from this book and nothing, no chemistry here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time....","review":"I don't know where to begin. I bought this book looking for a new author because of all of the previous good reviews and have never been so disappointed in a read. I am a huge fan of Judith McNaught, LaVryle Spencer, Sara Donati, Diana Gabaldon, Shana Abe, JD Robb, Julie Garwood..etc and I guess I have pretty high standards after reading their works. This was the fist book I have read by the author and I don't plan on reading any more. The plot was thin and the characters were barely even developed enough for the reader to form any kind of opinion of them. I'm a romantic at heart and enjoy a great love story but this book was not worth my time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming of Derek","review":"At first, it was curiosity that led me to get \\"Dreaming of You.\\" After reading the story of tortured hero Derek Craven and well-bred writer Sara Fielding, I must say that Derek is truly unforgettable. It is unusual, if not original, to find a hero in romantic fiction who was dirt poor and did some truly atrocious deeds to build his gambling empire. Yet, despite his questionable deeds, we are shown in this story that when Derek found himself falling for Sara Fielding, he acted more honorably than his aristocratic counterparts.Sara is also a strong heroine whose love and generosity of heart led the way for Derek to reclaim his soul. \\"Dreaming of You\\" by Lisa Kleypas is destined to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most interesting love story I've ever read!!!","review":"Firstly I read this book in Russian and was so fascinated with the story, characters, dialoques and especially love scenes that I found the original which captured me even more! Sara and Derek were described so ably that seemed to be quite real for me. I did suffered the Derek's resistance to admit that despite of his base descent and dismal past he deserves Sara's love and trust. And that sexual tense 'tween them... who else could describe it better!

There are plenty that are $100 and up and they may be fine, but when I saw this one, I loved the design and the price tag was excellent! When I received the product, the first thing I thought was the black metal is nice and the product is very tall, which was not really a good thing for a short gal like me (5'3\\"), but I really appreciate the bottom hooks. The only flaw that it has is the base is not very stable and wobbles a bit. But you can easily fix it by putting something under the shorter leg. For $25, I think this coat rack is a steal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This coat rack does the job, but in a wobbly way. It could not accommodate my partner's heavy army coat (it immediately started leaning to the side and has been crooked since.) It can hold lighter coats, but I don't expect it to last very long. The instructions are also not very clear, at least as far as the base is concerned. The manufacturer could have put 5 more minutes of thought into coming up with a design that wouldn't collapse as easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"This coat rack is a good deal for the price. It holds a lot more weight than you would expect, and on a wood floor, it doesn't wobble. I only gave it 4 stars because there were a couple problems putting it together (things did not fit or line up correctly), and the plastic balls that cover some of the hooks are hard to put on and fall off easily. Other than those problems, it looks good and holds a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guest room clothes hanger.","review":"This hall tree is a delight in our guest bedroom.

However, the small plastic decorative pieces are a serious chocking hazard. They are the size of unsliced, pitted olives, and look close enough to olives that an adult might even try to eat one. And to boot, they don't stay on well at all... about 1/2 of the times you go to pull a coat off the rack, one of these \\"olives\\" goes bouncing around my living room. Terrible design in that regard. As they fall off, I am just throwing them away.

Works like a charm!The only down side I encountered with assembly was an unevenness in the feet. Despite playing with angles for a few minutes, I never got the top crosspiece to touch both its feet down at the same time. I didn't want to mess around with trying to bend the metal frame, either. So I broke out the packing tape and some tiny pieces of supportive cardboard (You can do it! You don't need that loser anyway! No, that outfit looks awesome; don't listen to them!) and made it stop wobbling. Now it's perfect. A fabulous addition to my front room."},{"rating":"1","title":"rusted","review":"The outside of the box it came in smelled like cat pee, yes cat pee. And pieces are rusted badly.

I love the many hooks to hold all our many coats, umbrellas and hats."},{"rating":"1","title":"ya - this is junk don't wast your money","review":"The only reason I have not sent it back is because it isn't worth the effort. The problem is that they ship you the wrong parts. The two bottom feet poles are not the same - they are mirror images of one another - and if you actually get two different parts they will lock together and make a nice stable base. The problem is the people putting the parts together in China don't appear to know that. What I got was the same base bracket twice - if you assemble that so that the two pieces interlock you get two feet facing down and two feet facing up. The only way to make the darn thing stand up is to flip one piece over and assemble it upside down. That will work, but it makes for a wobbly setup. That's why some reviews say it works fine and some say it is unstable -- it all depends on whether or not they ship you the correct parts. So, if you feel lucky, go ahead and order this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clothing Rack","review":"Great solution to a husband who throws his clothes either on the bed or the chair.

Very sturdy and took as much winter clothing/ski gear that I could hang on it. Tightening the bolt on the bottom once every two weeks for the first month ensured that it wasn't wobbly or rickety at all. The ornament-thing on the top is a little weird, so I left it off--though if you like the look of it, it is surprisingly good quality.I took off one star because the arrangement/shape of some of the hooks aren't as useful or intuitive as I would have liked (I never really used the bottom row of hooks).If you like the look of it, go for it--It looks just as nice in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy workmanship","review":"Has lots of little parts, a pain to assemble.

It wobbles slightly, but the it's the pole that's wobbling and not the base, so it's actually very sturdy and unlikely to tip. I have 5 or 6 heavy winter coats on it right now and haven't had any problems. Looks more expensive then it is, and would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"This is a great coat rack for the price. I was worried that it would easily tip over - it has only done that when I tried to move it with several coats on it. If you keep it in 1 place you will be fine. I have 4 heavy men's coats and 5 heavy women's coat on it- plus several hats/scarves. The low batch of hangers helps stabilize when you hang heaviest items down there. It was also a snap to put together in about 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of hooks! Love it!","review":"In a tiny house with no hall closet my husband & are were desperate for a coat rack to hold EVERYTHING! It was incredibly easy to assemble. A little wobbly b/c of a design flaw in the base but has never tipped. I even tested it by hanging all of our winter coats on one side to see if it would tip. DIDN'T TIP!! It's been a great addition to our house & fits in with the decor. Excellant coat rack at a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"The rack appears to have feet much wider than the hooks, that is not the case.

I needed a coat rack to put my four kids backpacks, lunchboxes, coats, and my husband and my coats on. It fits all of this just fine. The only real issue is it is lightweight so you do you have to be somewhat careful on weight distribution and when you pull things off the coat rack. Sometimes it tips when something gets pulled off. But I'm not to worried about it since I also didn't pay to much for it and didn't expect a heavy duty/heavy weighted coat rack.It is easy to put together. The little plastic balls that go on the ends of the hooks don't all stay on. It is a black coated, lightweight, aluminum-like coat rack.Overall, for the price it is a good coat rack if you are on a tight budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price!","review":"I got my coat rack quickly, spray painted it silver and it looks great.

Unlike many instrumental guitar recordings, McLaughlin's pieces hold up well to repeated listening.

Not just a demonstration of guitar prowess, every song is good. A must for any listener with good taste, both guitar fans and not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Acoustic","review":"What you will love about this album is the pure acoustic sound. There aren't any other instruments to weather the songs down. It is guitar picking alone that makes this awesome album sound so good. With just the guitar picking it doesn't feel over produced or fooled around with. Just pure acoustic talent. You will lose yourself to this music and before you know it...you will be at the end of the cd. I played this outside today and it just replayed over and over again. This will be one of my summer albums that I keep close at hand. I will be getting more of his music in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inspiring, energetic and moving music","review":"Billy is taking the guitar to new realms with the relaease of fingerdance.

(130 frequencies)The \\"Service Scan\\" feature is also very easy to use; allowing you to quickly scan through Police, Fire, Air, or Marine frequencies.Pros: Lightweight, large memory, relatively easy to use.Cons: It does take a few minutes to become familiar with the button combinations required to activate the functions.

I studied it for years as I did other cults and I know people firsthand who were involved with the illuminated cult and \\"ism. Otherwise he has an excellent talent and beautiful spirit in music and melodic creation on the piano and you cannot deny that he has a God-given gift, if and when he ever acknowledges that is truly where it comes from. This one is one I would not buy from him simply because it centers around his deceptive occult beliefs. I do not judge but I say this, with such an awesome talent, it would be better if he understood what shamanism really was and took the road that leads to real eternal life. Otherwise his music is really beautiful and I praise his talent for having music that reflects spiritual beauty in other regards of the heart and peace, which is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"SS Swan Hoop Earrings","review":"The earrings were shipped on or before date due which was a surprise.

I have since moved on to the current edition, which contains a few, but what I consider, significant and useful changes and expansions from the 4th.For a lower division introductory course in ethics, I've found this text exceptionally useful. From an online perspective, I find it straightforward, clear, and concise. Whether used as the essential core resource, as a structural component from which to build and expand, or as a supplement, I think MacKinnon's text well worth consideration.I read through quite a number (or as my daughter would say, 'mass quantities') of texts before making the decision to go with MacKinnon. While this text isn't the only resource I use in my courses, I do use it as the framework around which they are designed and built.

This is where supplemental material is essential to have. Some of the articles in the text are very academic as they were written at an upper grad level. Also, the author kept repeating the same things in different ways, which would further confused me, and the issues could have been labeled better. The positive aspect to this text is that it does a great job covering many issues.

I have a similar product from Clinique, but this pales in comparison. This eyeliner was too dry. The color didn't apply well so it wasn't dark enough.

I love the \\"smoky eyes\\" look so I thought this product would be exactly what I need. I could barely tell I had it on, which was not the look I was going for. It also smeared a little too much without giving me the look that I wanted. With so many eyeliners on the market, including others from Avon, I wouldn't put this product on my \\"must get\\" list. However, to be fair, I only tried it in the black so if you are using another color, you probably will want a softer expression - meaning you notice the color without REALLY NOTICING the color.

The \\"Manfred\\" was Toscanini's greatest Tchaikovsky achievement, but there is a better recording than this one--the NBC/Toscanini account recorded in 1949, and currently available on RCA Gold Seal #60298. The performance is cleaner and meatier than the 1953, the sound is spectacular for its day, and Toscanini has a better grasp of the details. You won't be sorry you acquired this disk for your collection.

The way the story was written was in a new style that I loved completely. This saga has many mysteries which are revealed at the end of this novel alone and more which will be revealed later in the saga. The characters old and new add to the story and intermix ones from the Chaos War Series and other sagas. I will not spoil it like others because all DL fans need to read this great work which shows that Weis and Hickman are DL and they know how to make a grand epic like this.

You might be confused in the begining with all the new and unusual return of old but good characters, but as you read further on, you'll be amazed at the outcome of events.

They aren't heroic, villainous, funny, inspiring, or charismatic.For hundreds of pages, an evil Joan of Arc type character says that something is going to happen and keeps saying that something is going to happen. I'd rather read about something happening. Preferably something exciting.Where is the chemistry bewteen characters?Where are the epic battles?Where are the breath-taking landscapes?Where is the action?Oh, yeah... in the first 6 books, but not in this one.This book was so bad, I couldn't finish it.My breaking point was when Tanis's Son went to a Costume Party dressed as an... (wait for it) ...Elven Ranger.Unless you are a serious die hard fan of Dragonlance, avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons of a Fallen Sun","review":"At first I was confused, then as I started reading more I couldn't put it down not for work or anything....A must read"},{"rating":"1","title":"This bit, put simply.","review":"I read the first and second series when it came out, and visited this series with excitment... only to be disappointed.This is a lukewarm rehashing of some really great books.

I'd never read Dragonlance before. I've always assumed it's low-quality hack-and-slash advertures. Boy was I wrong.This Dragonlance book is well-written, exciting, and best of all has fascinating characters. I loved reading about the kender, Tasselhoff Burfoot. Page 377 has delightfully offbeat descriptions of a gnome and a hedge maze that reminds me of Douglas Adams. Hilarious.I enjoyed this book more than any other book I've read in recent months. And I read a lot. I've read so-called serious books by Patrick O'Leary, John Barnes, William Gibson, Tom Holt, Neil Gaiman, etc but this was better than all of those. I could go on and on about this book. I loved it and will certainly be keeping my eyes peeled for more Dragonlance in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons of a Fallen Sun","review":"Dragons of Fallen Sun is an excellent work in dragonlance. Why am I giving it four stars?Because the story of the War of Souls has just begun. It won't be fair if I gave it FIVE stars and then the other two books turned out to be Dynamite.However, everything lives up to my expectations, and there are a few surprises. The Dead is leaching all the new magic away, a new God arrives on the scene (could it be Chaos?), and a dragon has got the Silvanesti into killing themselves. Not only that, but there is something wrong with krynn and it is up to a hero of the Chaos War and a Hero of the Lance to fix it.A great beginning to a great storyline in one of the most popular D&D worlds of all time. Read it for yourself and see if you agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Start to a Good Trilogy","review":"Not much can be added to what has already been said about this book. Weis and Hickman once again prove why the Dragonlance series under their scribing obtained New York Times Best Seller Status. The book is well written and enjoyable. The characters are believable but do not have the same charm and appeal as the characters from their previous novels.Dragons of the Fallen Sun is like watching the new Transformers movie. It is enjoyable on it's own account. But compared to the original series, it cannot be duplicated to have the same emotional affect on the consumer.Despite this, Dragons of the Fallen Sun is better then 85% of all of the other Dragonlance material that has been published to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow, but good start","review":"I feel the first book started off too slow, dragging out the plot for the series. However it was masterfully written(as to be expected)explaining all the changes that occured over the years and plenty of foresight of what's to come. I have become completly enchanted by the DRAGONLANCE books, reading CHRONICLES, LEGENDS, THE SECOND GENERATION, SUMMER FLAME, and now this book(only two weeks after starting AUTUMN TWILIGHT[the first book]).After reading the reviews it seems the big question is \\"Who is The One True God?\\" The answer is on pg.373 in black and white. This book is a must.... But not before the others. READ THE BOOKS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons Of A Fallen Sun: Great!","review":"Dragons of A Fallen Sun, by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, is a great addition to the Dragonlance series. This story is about about Tas, Palin, and a new addition, Sir Gerard Uth Mondar, along with some other side characters. Tas goes forward in time to after his death. What he finds there is not what it seems.

Five years later I've come full circle, reading the War of Souls again, aware of its full history. I speak of The War of Souls trilogy from the aspects of a new reader and seasoned historian of the world of Ansalon, the world of Dragonlance.If you are like me this book will make as good of a first trilogy as it will a last of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's. The book dives into the beginning of The War of Souls. Its writing and development is as compelling as any other trilogy; Weis and Hickman worked just as hard drawing unique and interesting characters and storylines. I stand amazed at the quality of their writing, hoping that they will continue telling these tales for years to come.Read Dragons of a Fallen Sun and sit with me at the Inn of the Last Home, basking in the world of fantasy that will become a home for your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons of a Fallen Sun","review":"Dragons of a Fallen Sun marked the return of Wies and Hickman to the Dragonlance world. This book takes up where Rabe's Dragons of a New Age series left off. This books begins with a mysterious arrival of a young woman named Mina. This woman quickly draws an army behind her with a new faith in One True God. She follows this god, and does anything and everything for it.This book also follows the struggles of Palin Majere, Silvan (Alhana and Porthios's son), as well as Gilthas, the leader the Qualnesti. All of these stories are brought together into a great story that is bound to make an excellent trilogy. We finally meet some new characters, and are reunited with some old friends.Wies and Hickman do an amazing job taking over where Rabe left off and continuing the struggles that are taking place on Krynn. This book is a great addition to the Dragonlance world, and will make everyone want to keep reading about the Fifth age."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing !","review":"it's going to be very very difficult to wait for the next book. it was like coming back to old friends. a must read if you liked the chronicles etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weis & Hickman do it again!","review":"It's still difficult to change over to all the new characters of 5th Age. Although Tasslehoff is still in this book, he is not the same person - I think he would be better off having died in DoSF. Other than not particularly enjoying Tasslehoof in this book, I immensly enjoyed this new installment. Weis & Hickman beautifully portray almost a new world for the 5th Age. I particularly like the way Gilthas is not the weakling I always thought he would be. Dalamar might not be quite so \\"missing\\" anymore.

This book was one of my favorites except how the change all the characters personalities.

This book, Dragons of a fallen sun, has much of the loved charm of dragonlance. I would recommend this trilogy to early dargonlance readers of all ages. This brilliant book starts with a horrible storm that leaves its wrath everywhere. Galdar, comes in contact with a human \\"girl\\" who gives him back his sword arm. He instantly, along with the small army with him, falls in love with Mina, the fearless girl that is soon to become Lord of the Night for the Nights of Nerka. Weiss and Hickman weave several story lines masterfully, including the stories of both elven nations, the fearful dragons, Gerad(a knight that doesn't do anything...), a HONORABLE kender that changes history, and the main story line,Mina. A great book filled with adventure, heroes, dragons, and the one god, this book is one you will not soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book in my opinion.....","review":"In my opinion, I thought this book was very good. But then again, I think any book written by Weis and Hickman is a good book. It was very creative, and it had characters that you felt you just *had* to know what happened to them. For me, Silvanoshei was one of them. But all in all, this book was a joy and very entertaining to read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all DL fans!","review":"This book is the first of the WoS series and is not related to Rabe's 5th age series. The story explains how the heros of the old age and the new are trying to survive and cope with the lost of the gods, magic and under the the rule of Dragon Overlords.DoFS goes into great extent to explain what has happend ever since Chaos War and the current leaders of different nations and order. Which is a good fill in for those who have not read DL ever since DoSF.The new characters are well designed and unlike \\"The Chronicles\\" the characters are much easier to digest since they are spread into small groups of 2-3 rather then a huge group of eight. Which also allows the readers to witness events that is happening on different parts of Anasalon.The most attrative feature of this book is the mystery that are left unsolved even till the very end of the book.

The other characters are likeable and realistic. Maggie is a good three dimmensional character who has to battle plenty of her own demons while going after Stucky and her befuddled and clumsy but ultimately likeable profiler partner provides a refreshing change from the kind of \\"hero supercop\\" who usually proliferate this genre. This is a great book!

This book has over 400 pages.You can never judge a book by it's cover. A serial killer can be a relative, friend or even a co-worker and you will never notice it.The book is well written and the author goes in the mind of a serial killer and try to determine what can trigger somebody to kill.Some of the important stuff is only divulge at the end, therefore, you want to get to the end quickly to find out the final outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy about the details and an unconvincing main character","review":"I'm about 2/3 of the way through this book and trying to decide whether to finish. It is not a compelling story, and it seems very derivative. I've noticed several places where a small amount of research would have helped get the details straight. For example, Tess's boyfriend rejects the Californian Bordeaux and asks for a New York one. I believe that, as with most French regional wines, the label Bordeaux can't be used unless the wine comes from Bordeaux. Therefore, there's no such thing as a Californian or New York Bordeaux.The interactions among the various law enforcement personnel don't seem very convincing to me, either, but I can't believe at all in Maggie O'Dell as a convincing agent. A woman who leaves her gun in the desk drawer for the movers to find? She is so terrorized that if she was a responsible professional she would have taken herself off the case to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two in a Row","review":"Ms Kava's has done it again.

Maggie is recently divorced from her husband and is now living on her own. Stucky tracks her down and stalks her endlessly avoiding detection. Every woman that interacts with Maggie becomes a victim of Stucky and wind up completely brutalized. This is a bit hard to swallow since the author also has Albert performing tasks.

No 10-month-old self weans, and sending the message that a parent should be forcefully weaning a 10-month-old is absurd if both parent and child are happy with the relationship.

They are very oppossed to extended breast feeding, co sleeping and responding to a babies signals. I'm sure people who follow this advice have well behaved babies, but at what cost?

Women who nurse babies during the night are not \\"all night milk dispensers\\", they are simply meeting the needs of their child and making sure they and their child are resting well. I also disagree with their opinions on TV and pacifiers. Pacifiers can be handy on occassion, so can TV when managed well.

It was beautifully organized, perfectly detailed, and it even had a specific chapter for parents of adopted children. My family made fun of me when I propped the book up to follow the bathing directions as I gave our daughter her first sponge bath.

This is a book for parents who don't want to be bothered with parenting. The advice on getting a baby to sleep is horrible, almost bordering on abuse. This book actually gives tips on how to ignore your baby's hysterical cries. Ouch! Also the advice encourages fear and paranoia in a new mom. The bit on what the baby should be doing every month is enough to drive anyone to the nearest shrink. Talk to your doctor not this book... Read Dr. Sear's The Baby Book and boycott this abusive, non-caring approach by these wacky authors.

I started out breast feeding my 3 month old at birth and was doing great. Then I came down with some health problems that required me to take medicine that wasn't good for my daughter so I had to stop breast feeding. I understand its great for babies but, some women one don't feel comfortable with the idea or two can't because of medicine. My daughter wasn't having bowel movements like I thought she should so I went to my book to see just how many a formula fed baby should have. All the information they had was for Breast Fed babies. Upon, some other situations that I needed the book for all the information was for breast fed babies. Look up formula in the book there's only 6 subjects for you to look under.

Sometimes she comes across like all-knowing and you just have to shake it off and go with your own parenting wisdom--believe me, you DO have some of your own that's better than what's in this book. I will give it credit for helping with some basic questions, but I don't agree with everything. AND if I read the words \\"Best Odds Diet, Recipes\\" etc. one more time--I will scream! I won't be buying the Toddler Years book--I am looking for a friendlier book or simply a medical/developmental facts book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Reference","review":"This is an excellent book when used more as a reference than a month-to-month read.

When I do, I just get angry. The advice is condescending, and unreasonable - such as saying that playpens are bad, any sugar, salt or white flour is bad (ruling out crackers and cookies as first foods), etc. Like I have nothing else to do but give my child quality interactive time while the maid cleans, the cook prepares organic, tasteless, fat-free meals, and the butler and secretary do all the errands, phone calls and bills. We all live in the real world, and so do our kids. We should enjoy life (including food and Teletubbies) and enjoy our kids, and it will all work out. Most of the advice that isn't insulting or silly is just common sense, you don't need a book for it. Just burn it! (and \\"What to expect when Expecting\\", too).

Only thing that really helped me get ready were collections of stories -Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Yearthe only one I actually made it through.

In the Six-Month-Baby chapter they call parents \\"week nerved\\" (mispelling is theirs) because they don't use the Cry It Out method. There is also a constant use of negative adjectives like a babies \\"pathetic\\" hand wave to get parents attention (also in the Six-Month chapter).I may refer to this book occasionally, but I will not recommend it to anyone. It will probably collect dust on my book shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book.","review":"I confess that I was a bit sceptical when I received this book as a gift after having spent nine months with the completely ineffectual \\"...Expecting\\" book. However, I gave it a shot. I won't rehash what the other reviewers have already pointed out (an extremely old-fashioned approach to mothering) -- with which I completely agree.I also found the questions (similar to the ones found in the \\"Expecting\\" book to be of very little help, and quite demeaning.All in all, I found that other books more help (Dr. Sears, AAP, Girlfriends Guide, etc.), but none as much as my own intuition. The \\"What to Expect\\" book goes against this important point in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say....","review":"What can you say about something that is so good?

I think overall, that it was not helpful for the information I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay-but opinionated and sometimes lacking accurate info.","review":"I have read dozens of books on parenting (what can I say, I'm a bibliophile and a concerned parent <g>); this is not my favorite. It is fine for basic medical advice, basic hygeine care and basic dietary requirements for an infant. However, I found it lacking in addressing the issues of long-term breastfeeding (which is supported by MUCH recent medical research), co-sleeping, nightwaking, parental instincts, etc. It's an adequate book for basic baby care. It is NOT the book that I would recommend as a primary reference for new parents (I would wholeheartedly recommend _The Baby Book_ by Sears & Sears for that!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, so I've never been a parent before","review":"I found this book to be a good guide and a general source of information, e.g., when to call the doctor, descriptions of rashes, etc. I didn't expect the book to tell me how to be a mother, just what to look for in behavior, and suggestions as to what to do in specific situations. I really liked this book and the Toddler years one as well.As an older first time parent (40+), the information in this book allayed a lot of fears and feelings of helplessness that most of us first timers experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes a tough, not tender approach","review":"Advice promotes not letting a child change your life too much, which is ridculous.

Don't buy this book!","review":"I loved \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" - an invaluable and helpful guide for the pregnant mother- so of course I thought that this book would be helpful. If I could do it over I wouldn't have purchased this book! Have a question? You probably won't find an answer in this book! Any information you CAN find is very biased. The Question/Answer format is not split up logically and finding information is difficult and you may need to jump from chapter to chapter just to attempt to get an answer to one simple question! I didn't find the \\"When to call your doctor\\" section at all helpful, in fact, it is confusing as many of the symptoms listed are normal for most infants. This book is enough to make any first time mom paranoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I was shocked to see that the authors think that a baby banging her head against a crib and rocking herself is normal. This shows that the baby needs more holding and love. They do say that maybe you could hold your headbanging self-rocking baby more,--but they caution you not to hold her too much!! A baby can never be held too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing one key piece of advice...","review":"The one thing this book should tell you but doesn't is to throw this book away. It seems to be written by someone who doesn't have any kids but instead read a lot of books about them. Any parent who follows Attatchment Parenting (or is loving, thoughtful, and caring)will be outraged by the advice to let your baby cry it out alone in bed regardless of illness or pain. Their advice on breastfeeding and scheduling borders on Babywise and should be avoided if a mom is going to breastfeed successfully. I found this book to be very opinionated and not very informative. If you want to raise your baby without making waves in your household, bottle feed without guilt, sleep through the night when the baby is only 2 months old and generally force your child to conform to someone else's ideals this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I like this book because it is very easy to find what you are looking for. (It is set up exactly as the What to Expect When You're Expecting book.) It has answered a lot of my questions and lets me know what is \\"normal\\" and what may be cause for concern. I also like the ready reference section in the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives a new mother a guilt trip on just about everything...","review":"As all babies are different there is very little useful information in this book.

However, when I found out I was pregnant, I felt confident that I could be a good mother. By the time I had read What To Expect The 1st Year, I felt like a paranoid idiot. NOT ALL BABIES ARE THE SAME!!! In this day and age of EXPERTS on everything, I think we need to remember who the experts are here--the MOTHERS. We know our kids better than anyone. I went and bought Dr. Spock's revised ed. The first sentence is TRUST YOURSELF. I don't feel like such an idiot anymore. Not all babies start on solids at 4mo or can put themselves to sleep, or want juice, etc. Only mothers know what their babies need."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Easy Method of Parenting","review":"\\"Don't worry about it,\\" is the prevailing wisdom of this book. Extremely reassuring, but a bit condenscending, I found this book to offer a pat on the back when I really wanted more thoughtful, researched answers. This book is the bible of childrearing for those who don't like to read, don't have time to read, or just want to make it through the first year as easily as possible. I do not even recommend it as a quick reference book since the format is question and answer, divided up by month, so, without subject headings, it is difficult to access. Do yourself and your baby a favor by reading some more complete and up-to-date authors such as William Sears and Burton White."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to Dr. Sears!","review":"I used \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" while pregnant, so I thought it a natural step to buy this book. I tossed it aside in frustration. Its advice is fine if you have a machine for a baby, but for the rest of us...I was so glad to discover Dr. Sears' series of books. These are the books people need for advice on raising people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor babies!","review":"I pity the babies who will be raised with this advice. I agree with many of the other readers, and can't figure out why this book still sells so well. What got to me was something about how an 8- or 9-month old baby who cries when he or she sees its parents leaving is being \\"manipulative.\\" Do the authors really think babies that age understand this concept? This book put me off parenting books once and for all. Reading this sort of misguided advice dulls parents' newly emerging intuition, which is a far more effective tool for raising one's own precious baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 1 Star!","review":"These books sell so well, you'd expect more people to speak up! The first one, What to expect when you're expecting is good. The others are horrible. The first years and toddler years are full of mis-information and are too far out there! I've given up on even using them. Everytime my son would get sick, I'd look it up in the book, and follow the directions or warnings. I realized instead of being a comfort, the book was only causing more worry (and I am not the type of person to read all the problem sections and worry about each problem mentioned). The solutions to behavioral problems were way too lax, I suppose if you're tyring to abide by the \\"don't hurt the child's psyche\\" idea, they might work, but whatever happened to sincere, but loving discipline? I don't want a 2 year old to run the house, but that's just about what this book leads you to think should be done.This book is a waste of money. I'm ashamed to say I ever used it! The authors are out of touch with reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't care for this book.","review":"I was hoping that this book would have a more useful format.

It is tedious reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Advice, Frustrating Format","review":"I'm a second time mom after a nine year break--what I needed was contemporary wisdom, and this book failed me miserably. The advice was often outdated and uninformative, and the Q&A format was frustrating because the information provided was tailored to one specific question, rather than a range of topics within the subject.I found myself insulted by this book's suggestion that parents who do not agree with CIO are weak. This book provides some of the worst parenting advice I've come across; I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cringed the whole way through..","review":"I liked the What to Expect When You're Expecting book, so I thought I'd take a look at this one. Boy, was I disappointed!!It gives outdated and inaccurate information on breastfeeding and sleeping with your child, encourages the \\"cry it out\\" approach and, overall, made me feed very sad for the parent who takes it to heart (and their children).There are some excellent references out there, like the Sears' Baby Book. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I found the book attempts to package all the answers into too simple solutions. It seems odd that the same author that writes \\"What to Eat When You're Expecting\\" which by the way is entirely too regimental, can also write all these books on child development. Many of the ideas seem half-baked, and made me question their authority. Some of the answers to questions seemed almost flippant, only drawing on personal opinion. I was especially mortified when I read the 3-month section on feeding, and how to get your baby to sleep through the night. I lost more sleep worrying about this than I would have waking up to feed baby. I think that this advice taken to heart would have really deprived and hurt my baby. Luckily I've learned enough on my own, and read enough other books, to recognize what I don't agree with."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money, buy Sears' Baby Book instead","review":"This book focuses on the convenience of the parents. I bought my copy for one dollar at a garage sale, and it wasn't worth it. For example, it gives advice on how a parent can handle forcing a little baby to cry it out to sleep through the night. The advice? Use earplugs, white noise, unhook the baby monitor, etc., so YOU don't have to hear your baby scream in terror.Buy the Baby Book by Dr. William Sears instead. Dr. Sears had eight babies with his RN wife. He has excellent, practical advice that is compassionate towards babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate opinions presented as fact.","review":"I will admit that I found the developmental guides and the nuts-and-bolts medical information to be somewhat useful. However, this book fails miserably in many key areas. The breastfeeding information is not in tune with current recommendations. The authors start to push weaning in the \\"ninth month\\" chapter, whereas the AAP now recommends that babies be breastfed for AT LEAST a year. The authors actually go so far as to attribute all sorts of \\"dangers\\" to such practices as babywearing and extended breastfeeding. None of these are backed up by any research.As others have already pointed out, the authors really push the \\"crying it out\\" approach, not even presenting it as an \\"approach\\" but rather as the \\"right\\" way to parent. They refer to parents who do not use this method as \\"soft-hearted\\" and \\"weak-nerved.\\"Overall, I am unable to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reccomended reading","review":"I really liked \\"What to Expect When You are Expecting\\", but was very disappointed with this one. The authors (who are NOT doctors, or even in the medical field) present their inaccurate information as fact. They advocate the \\"cry it out\\" school of thought, which does not take into consideration the baby's needs. The breastfeeding information is incorrect, and could easily sabatoge a new mother's nursing relationship. \\"The Baby Book\\" by Dr. Sears is a much better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of lousy information while posing otherwise","review":"Does the typical presentation of breastfeeding as a lifestylechoice and formula feeding as 'just as good'. Ick. It fails topresent any of the very real information on the health risks of not breastfeeding, and does very little to reassure mothers who may be a little hesitant about breastfeeding in public. Pump to go to church?! If you believe in God, why shouldnt' you believe that God made breasts to nourish babies?The sleep information is a rehash of the tired Ferber, cry it out theme which runs counter to almost every mother's instincts of what her child needs. The authors seem to think that mothers dont' have any intuition or ability to follow their heart when nurturing their babies. Read \\"the Baby Book\\" by William and Martha Sears- a much better reference and more compassionate to our next generation.The only thing good about it is the breastfeeding preeemies information, and that it isn't as bad as Baby(un)wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for new parents!","review":"This book is a must-have for all new parents! Being a nurse, but having little experience with infants, this book was invaluable to me. Unfortunately, I didn't get it until my son was 6 weeks old. I wish I would have had it sooner.

Now we are working our way through the next book, 'What to Expect: The Toddler Years'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Useless","review":"I read this when I was pregnant. I think its main purpose is to make the expectant mother paranoid.

This book doesn't help the new parent much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Bad Information","review":"Unfortunately, the only good information in this book is the month-to-month milestones (and really, reading about milestones can drive you crazy, so why bother). This book does NOT truly advocate breastfeeding. This book does NOT advocate sleeping with your baby. This book does NOT advocate a truly kind, loving approach to parenting. This book offers ridiculous advice on nutrition including weaning from breastfeeding very early and hurrying up to introduce replacements such as cow's milk at 1 year of age, while along the way, ridding your house of \\"all forms of sugar\\".

Setting up the D-Link adapter was a snap and I had a dial tone quickly. After several days, my line was ported and I thought everthing was ok.That was until I tried calling my dad several times and he just hung up on me. I heard his side clearly, but all he heard was static. Others complained about our connection too. Vonage support helped me change a few things on my account to take care of those problems.However, I still have not been able to use my computer modem to fax. I have tried multiple tips to get it to work, and still no luck. Calling Vonage's tech support is horrible. Long wait to talk with someone who doesn't speak good English nor has a clue about what to do with your problems.The worst part is that Vonage makes you sign up for a contract. If it wasn't for that, people would flee in droves. I think it will get better, but it has a way to go"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"This phone adapter is hard to use.

By the time the child is a more independent reader they are ready for their first complete Bible, not a storybook.The pictures leave a bit to be desired.

It was the most complete collection I could find. Some of the major stories are broken up into two or three stories, so 365 isn't exactly acurate, but it does cover most of the bible without the lists of who begat whom. It is a good starter, but I don't enjoy reading it aloud, and need to find another. They just sound contrived when read aloud. I've also found subtle changes from what is in the Bible. It seems to me that a book of Bible stories could be written to exactly follow the events that happened, in normal, non-sticky language. Also, I had to, um, simplify the story of David and Bathsheba, because, in my opinion, children don't need even that much detail. It wasn't that bad, but, jeez!

The whole story line was just a hodge podge of ideas thrown together. The story of the book within the book (about Jack the Ripper) must have been added to fill a few more pages as it was a pointless waste of time.

Later--much to late--in the book we find out why Winnie is such a mess but by that time you'll no longer care. People don't behave normally in this book. The characters make speeches instead of having converesations and the plot wanders all over the literary map. Is this a take on Christmas Carol? Is it a Jack the Ripper story? Is it a classic ghost story? The author can't seem to make up his mind and so he fails. I didn't like Winnie.

Was I wrong!! It isn't so much that the story is bad, but the woman (Jenny Sterlin) narrator/reader has a voice that is so sharp and grating that it was a literal assault on my ears. She made ALL of the characters sound mean, unsympathetic, ugly and sarcastic... even when their words weren't meant to be. It was impossible for me to warm up to any of the characters in this book. The readers of the other CDs (I felt) read the books perfectly, with just the right emphasis and style. I hope to never mistakingly buy a CD read by Jenny Sterlin again. I also hope that Maguire has the good sense to have a different reader for his other books, because I truly enjoy his other writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was lost","review":"I struggled so hard to just finish this book.

This book was waste of my time and I hope no one else makes the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost: A Novel by Gregory Maguire","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, as I have enjoyed other books by this author in the past. This book was a grave disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly forgettable","review":"Just so you know, this book isn't at all related to the hit TV show Lost.This is just a flat out boring book. After I finished reading it, I'd realized I never even got close to any of the characters, especially Winnie. It was like the whole time I was watching over other people interact with other people, but nothing memorable seems to happen.Another problem- I can't quite figure out what happened in the end. Was Winnie truly a normal person? I don't know and I'm not going back to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge by this read","review":"Fortunately, Wicked was my first Gregory Maguire reading experience and he quickly became a personal favorite with True Confessions and Mirror Mirror, and Son of a Witch more recently. Also fortunately, I hadn't started with Lost. Definitely my least favorite of his novels I felt like it lacked the description, creativity and strong storyline that I love about his other books. For those of you who were unfortunate enough to choose this as your first Gregory Maguire read, please try again with any of his his others and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful writing - I just couldn't finish this book","review":"I'm a passionate and avid reader, and it's not often I choose to abandon a book without finishing it ... but that's exactly what happened with 'Lost'.Other reviewers have already commented on the problems with the storyline(s) and the unpleasant, emotionally detached characters. For me, it was the writing style that really grated - Maguire's intent when writing seems to be to show how erudite and learned he is ... rather than concentrating on what's really important, communicating the story to the reader.I consider myself neither illiterate nor uneducated, but when I have to reach for a dictionary to check the meanings of three separate words in the space of two pages (gelid, cess, emphysematous) - well, all that serves to do is take me out of the story.I can't think of any way in which I would recommend this book (which is a shame as I bought it because I thought it looked like an intriguing tale) so I can really only suggest that you avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read several titles by Gregory Maguire, I loved \\"Wicked\\" and thought other titles of his were also decent. \\"Lost\\" starts out good, but somewhere in the middle it became difficult to read, and I had to force myself to complete the book. It is almost as if Gregory Maguire got lost himself while writing the book. I highly recommend skipping this title and checking out one of Gregory MaGuires other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"This story was such a chore to read. I wanted to like it but everytime I started reading I would start to fall asleep. I gave up before I even read half way through the book. Its very different from Wicked, the Son of a Witch, The ugly step sister, etc. I actually bought the book before reading any reviews on it because I don't normally like to know other's thoughts on such thick books ahead of time but do wish I had saved myself some money on this one.Its a good book for insomniacs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to say that \\"Lost\\" is the perfect title for this book, if you're referring to the reader. I read Gregory Maguires first two books and loved them. Wicked is by far one of my all time favorites. So I have to say I was so excited when I had heard he wrote another. This is by no means his best work and I thought a waste of my time, but needless to say if he writes another I will go right out and by it in the hopes that it will be as great as the first. I think he has to have something better than this. I'm not giving up on him yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A THINKING PERSON'S BOOK","review":"Maguire\\"s LOST can easily be looked at as having a mixed up story line . After reading this book and thinking through the main elements, it is a great story that brings out the ways guilt is often dealt with. Our thinking often brings out ghostlythoughts that disguise the truth. Read this with some thought and you will appreciate what the author is trying to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After WICKED and CONFESSIONS, I bought this book without hestitation. Unfortunately, it failed to meet the expectations created by the earlier books. While filled with Maguire's characteristic delightful prose, the story felt forced and incompletely developed. I never gained that willing suspension of disbelief. The fine prose carried me along, and my positive feelings about the earlier work left me hoping that the book would improve. In the end, I felt dissatisfied. A friend asked, \\"What's it about?\\" All I could say was, \\"I dunno, exactly.\\" I fear Maguire didn't quite know either."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lost\\" lost my interest","review":"Undoubtly Maguire is an amazing writer but this novel surely did not captivate me. I couldnt get through it i was so bored with it. I held out farther than i should have thinking it might pick up and become interesting. Much more of a mystery novel than any of his other books which are much more fantasy based.However, to his credit, i do believe that this style was based on another book or writer's style of writing. I do not have the book beside me to verify, but i would not recomend unless you like a novel that takes a long time to piece together and rather slow process of character/plot development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went very awry","review":"Like everyone else, I LOVED WICKED. I bought this book at full hardcover price (silly me!) because of that.I couldn't get interested in the plot of John gone missing, nor Winnie herself as a character. I tried 118 pages, and just gave up because I don't care how it turns out. One of the worst books I've ever attempted to read, and only the second that I've been unable to finish. Buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost","review":"Gregory Maguire's books 'Wicked' and 'Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister' were wonderful, great reads. However, I found 'Lost'a gread disappointment! It was uninteresting and boring.crc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost","review":"I loved Wicked. But I was completely and utterly lost with this book. There were so many loose ends and no reason why certain things were even introduced. I've read \\"a christmas carol\\" many times. Since this was included in the book, to read first, I thought there must be some sort of twist or direct connection to the book. Red Herring. I read all the way to the end because I just knew there was some reason to do so. There wasn't. I haven't been this let down by a favored author in a very long time. I think there were a lot of directions this book could have gone to tie together things that were introduced. As a matter of fact, there were some great ideas that could be the beginning of many different stories. This was just a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love maguire but i hate this book","review":"this book was attrociously written. i am a big fan of maguires works with wicked, confessions of an ugly stepsister, and mirror mirror. this just sucked though.it was boring and incomplete. there wasnt a steady plot for you to follow what the goal or the climax of the book was. it just kept jumping to other things. its like he wrote this book in two minutes. scrooge had nothing to do with the plat and neither did jack the ripper.to top it off the ending was incredibly ridiculous. i mean what was all the run around for? if u read the book youd probably understand my harshness but by all means i was really diassapointed by this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISGRACE","review":"I have read most of Maguire's books, mostly out of admiration for some of his other work but this was a disgrace. It was like he had ideas for four different novels and just decided to mash them together into one incoherent one. I think Maguire was a bit LOST while writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only he had lost the manuscript....","review":"Lost disappoints on every level. From the scarcity of a plot (200 pages of Winifred Rudge feeling sorry for herself, the rest of them everyone telling her she feels sorry for herself), the failed attempt at a convincing tie-in to the Dickens Scrooge character, fluffy, contrived dialog, shallow characters with comic-book level histories and cliche tragedies, to an ending that is...well, not an ending. Instead, the last page happens to arrive before the climax. What is labeled as a ghost story contains 15 pages of actual ghostings.Maguire attempts in Lost to leave behind the fairy-tale parodies that made him famous and offer a book where the characters are more real. Ironically, he offers a book where the characters are less real than their fantasy counterparts.For better novels with a similar tone and subject matter, find a John Irving novel and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointment","review":"Gregory Maguire previous novels were amazing reads, so naturally i was excited to read his newest novel. His main character Winnie is one of the most unlikable characters that i've ever read, and not because I was supposed to. The reader is supposed to start off not liking her, but in the end she's somehow redeemed...but she isn't. The characters in \\"Lost\\" are disjointed and not fully developed (much like the preceeding paragraph).The plot of the book was never fully developed either, and the end was abrubt and unsatisfying. If you've never read any of Maguire other novels, stop right here and pick up one of his other books. This novel does not do him justice, infact its hard to believe its even written by the same author as \\"Wicked\\" or \\"Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad read","review":"This was perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. The story was confusing and lacked focus. I would not suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Loose Ends","review":"I'll admit I read this book cover to cover, but it wasn't an enjoyable experience in the end. So many questions left unanswered -- so many dead ends to the different plot lines. I'd write a longer review, but I have already forgotten much of it (it was that unremarkable) and it's only been a week. Winnie's character and the haunter herself (Gervasa) never really let their stories develop fully. It's like Maguire got tired of writing. I am reading \\"Confessions\\" now -- I'll let you know if it's any better. I don't normally write these as \\"anonymous\\", but don't want to get flamed -- maybe it was such a \\"deep\\" book - I just missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Read - If You're Not Looking for Another \\"Wicked\\"","review":"Gregory Maguire has a fascinating command of the English language, and a real knack for developing deep and complex characters - something that alone makes this book worth the read. However, this is not the \\"Wicked\\" or \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" treatment given to \\"A Christmas Carol\\", despite what the cover (and familiarity with the author's other popular works) might suggest. If you go into this expecting that, you'll be sadly disappointed.On its own merits, without the context of the rest of Maguire's works, I would probably give this a rating of \\"4\\". However, I felt betrayed as a reader. There were teasing elements to suggest that this might be a twisted fairytale of sorts, like Wicked, but ultimately any fantastic elements in the book are just red herrings.I think a disclaimer is warranted to warn the unwary reader; I felt deceived, hence a final rating of merely \\"2\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really....","review":"a product of the same author who write \\"Wicked\\"? It doesn't seem so, but it's true! I am not a regular reader of fantasy, but I could not put \\"Wicked\\" down! \\"Lost\\" really lived up to it's title--too much meandering, unlikeable characters...read Maguire's other three novels before you turn to this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Premise Falls Slightly Short","review":"I have to admit, the cover of this edition is what first caught my attention when I saw this book. Then I read the description on the back and the premise jumped out at me as being very original. I picked this as my first Gregory Maguire book. The premise is this. The main character is supposedly a descendant of the man Dickens based Scrooge on. She returns to England to her great-great-grandfather's house to visit a cousin. Once she arrives, the house is haunted and the adventure begins.I really like Maguire's style of weaving in various legends and fairy tales ranging from Dracula to Peter Pan to Jack the Ripper. I also like how multiple storylines criss-cross the chapters. I was disappointed in the second half of the book though. The merging of the storylines almost seemed like an afterthought, and the story ended with a \\"pffft\\" instead of with a \\"bang\\". I would recommend this book to others. Just don't get too worked up during the first part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered this a couple of weeks ago and I just finished it lately. This is my first and probably last Gregory Maguire book. Since you have already read the above reviews and know the basic plot information I will skip that and give my thoughts on the book. This book is supposedly a ghost story. It did nothing to frighten you or give you that \\"creepy\\" feeling a good ghost story does. I did not empathize with the heroine. In fact, I found her annoying and not at all sympathetic. In a good thriller you should feel that the hero is in some sort of imminent terrible danger sometime during the story. I never felt that the heroine was in danger. And finally, the ending was just too convenient, like a made for TV movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"What happened to the Gregory Maguire who wrote \\"Wicked\\"? Surely, this book wasn't from the same author ... but, of course, it was. This book was erratic ... it almost seemed like an amateur wrote it grasping for a storyline. I kept thinking that this book would have to get better or at least make sense, which it never did. The main character is a reporter, then there was something about Ebenezer Scrooge, a ghost in the wall, an orphanage in middle of a snowy desolate area, loving cousins ... I mean, what is going on? If you want a good book by this author, read \\"Wicked\\" or \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" but, please, save your time and skip over this book entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book, Especially if you're a Maguire fan","review":"I loved Wicked (and the sequels). I have reread Confessions of An Ugly Stepsister multiple times. I enjoyed Mirror, Mirror. However, Lost has me fantasizing about buying a hardback copy, hunting down the author (whom I normally greatly admire) and bludgeoning him unconscious with his own published work. Every time the plot starts to stumble into something remotely resembling an amusing or engaging story, it deflates, leaving you wondering what the point of spending several hours of your time on this drivel actually is. If I were able to give this a negative star, I would. The last book I hated this much was Cormick McCarthy's The Road, which I also found to be a giant waste of my time (however, in Macguire's defense, I didn't dislike this QUITE as much, though it was close). Don't buy either of them: there are so many better books out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maguire should stick to fairy tales","review":"Avoid this book at all costs. It is far from Maguire's witty, sharp fairy-tale spin-offs. He took Jack the Ripper, Scrooge, phony clairvoyants, mysterious symbols, possession or ghosts or whatever, and a dozen other obscure plot devices, put them in a blender, and dumped it into this book. Maguire is terribly inconsistent, the writing is choppy, the characters are extremely shallow, the dialogue tries too desperately to be smart, and story fails as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I keep reading?","review":"I muddled through \\"Lost\\" for a month before finally finishing it, thoroughly unsatisfied. The main character is so idiotic that I couldn't sympathize with her. Her actions and the actions of the surrounding characters are not the least bit believable, given the course of events. The big interesting question - What is the knocking behind the wall? - is the central and most driving plot point for a short while. It is then ignored for most of the rest of the book, only to be offhandedly explained away with little enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Maguire","review":"I fell under the Maguire spell a few years back with Wicked and have since managed to cycle through the rest of the \\"fairy tale\\" novels, with adoration for both the books and the author. Lost, however, isn't quite up to par with Maguire's other tales. While a darker tone didn't bother me, the storyline itself was very slow to develop and diction wasn't optimal either. The quality of Maguire's normal writing just didn't seem to be there. If you're like me, and searching for one last Maguire book to read, pass this one by. It doesn't quite pass the bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lost\\" lost its appeal","review":"I have read both of Maguire's other books and found them both particularly original and refreshing. Upon seeing a new publication, I was ecstatic. That, however, did not last. I feel the book was way too deep in how many storylines were going on at once and that subsiquently made the book hard to follow. I also found it to be a bit of a downer and not at all exciting and attention grabbing, as his other books were. All in all, I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Mirror Mirror and Maguire's brand of fairy tale","review":"then his will be a huge disappointment Don't waste your money on this book because you wouldn't even know it's the same author. The plot is slow and doesn't even manage to develop by the end of the book. Don't bother. It will leave you saying, \\"that was it?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Me","review":"Unfortunately Gregory Maguire tried too hard. For two hundred and fifty pages I couldn't close this book. The subtle intermingling of supernatural with plain coincidence left me dying to find out just what would happen to Winnie Rudge. Unlike many other reviewers, for me the fault came not with the intertwining of Scrooge mythology or the narrators fascination with children's literature as both themes were masterfully handled. The problem with this book is that the author,much like his main character, didn't know where the book was going when he started. The last one hundred pages were unbelievable and swiftly undecided. Rather than choosing between the supernatural and a character's dementia he went after both. The result is a good idea poorly executed. To the reader it seems as though Maguire couldn't make up his own mind and the book suffers for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not maguire's best work","review":"it seems mr. maguire has hit a creative rut, having found a formula and now simply repeating the process for each new novel. oh, well... stick with \\"wicked\\" or \\"confessions of an ugly step sister.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost......wish I'd have lost my copy before finishing it...","review":"Ugh. This book took me almost 4 months to read. It wasn't because I'm a slow reader, it was because I had no interest in the story. None. Zero.As always, Maguire finishes up the story with just a few pages left. But NO, like his other novels, you can't just skip to the end of a Maguire book to catch the end of the story. You have to read the whole dang thing for it to make any sense (which Lost barely did anyway).I'm being generous with the 2 stars, ONLY because the Rudge/Dickens story line and Ritzi (the fruitcake fortune-teller) kept me slightly intrigued. Other than that, Lost went on and on and on about mind-numbing subplot after mind-numbing subplot.Back to the same recommendation I had after reading Confessions: READ WICKED INSTEAD. Sorry, Maguire, this story doesn't get an A from this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost - I'm lost!","review":"Gregory Maguire is a very compelling and interesting writer. I loved Wicked and will read it again and again. Ugly was not nearly as captivating. Lost I can't quite get through. I've been reading it for quite some time and it just hasn't enveloped me - dare I say, yet? I'm still reading Lost and if my opinion changes I will write another review.Plea to the Author:Gregory - please go back to your 'Wicked' style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, rent it from the library","review":"I won't go into a basic summary of the book because I trust someone has already done that....After reading this short novel, I felt compelled to post a review.The Jack the Ripper and Scrooge and ghostly references felt so wasted; it wasn't until quite late in the book that the darker, fantastical references were used, and even then, not to their full potential. The main character, Winnie Rudge, is a cynical, annoying, Gen-Xer. At times, her pretentious rantings just made me want to strangle her. The narrative is over done. I think Mr. Maguire tried too hard and it just came off corny. I don't know who to be disappointed in: Mr. Maguire or his editor for allowing such mediocre fiction to be published.I know my review might now help alot of people in terms of exact details but I just felt I should shuck my review out there to those who just want a general idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost story line","review":"What's lost here is the story line!

It is barren of thought, colorless bordering on gray/black, bland to the taste of mildew, banal, pointless, tedious.....yada, yada, yada. This man sits with a thesaurus writing words to compose his witless story. A tractor couldn't plow through the boring mess. There are so many thrilling books on the supernatural - bypass this or fall into a chasm of writing despair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Callous toward Adoptive Parents","review":"As an adoptive parent, I realize that I may be a little sensitive toward the portrayal of the adoption process- a long and agonizing wait for a potential child. The adoption process and some-not all-adoption agencies have much that should be changed (bribes in foreign countries, high prices here in the States, red tape, emotional manipulation) but I was really put off by the author's presentation of pre-adoptive parents as all being disfunctional. Once again, I realize this is only a novel (and not a very well reviewed one, either) but it reveals a certain callousness about and/or unfamiliarity with the heartbreaking process of adoption. Where are the bounds of good taste today? in the cancer ward or the neonatal ICU unit? Needless to say, I didn't read very far. We sent this book and the others by this author back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fun is \\"Lost\\"","review":"I bought \\"Lost\\" hoping it would be as clever and interesting as \\"Wicked\\".

Then we read 'Confessions'...super holy moly, really good. Lastly we read Lost. WTF!?!? Bad, Bad, Bad. I am thankful i didnt pick this one up first. The book makes no sense. It seems to me there is a shortage in mushrooms, because Greggy seems to have eaten them all up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost is the right name for this book!","review":"Let me first start off by saying that, I am usually a Terry Maguire Fan. Everything about this book was Lost, the main character Winnie, the plot, me, and the usual Terry Maguire spin. He touches up Jack the Ripper and Dracula, but really the focus should have been on the haunting of Ozias Rudge how that paralleled Dickens and Winnie herself. Winnie would almost become endearing then act completely out of character. Few other characters were formed the way Terry usually allows. The only thing that really fit was the title.I think if you skip this book you won't be Lost for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I now wish it had been Lost in the mail.","review":"The books of Maguire were touted as \\"reimagining of classic fairy tales.\\" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had a very difficult time getting into this book, and the pay off in the end just isn't there. The language is pretty good, though, and there are a lot of original ideas- I could not predict what was going to happen next at any point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Maguire Book by Far","review":"Maguire's obfuscatory writing style and disconnected plots actually worked pretty well in his three other books, based on well-known stories. Without the underpinning of those plot lines, though, his writing is too haphazard to make much sense. It doesn't help that his main character is almost a blank slate. There is so much unsaid throughout the book, and events seem to mean nothing and go nowhere. Worst of all, the mysteries don't entice the reader; they're just annoying and boring. I enjoyed the other three books, but this one is work to get through. Stick to the other three and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost is a more-than-apt title for this book...","review":"I wanted to love this book. I really did. After reading \\"Wicked\\" and \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,\\" I had huge expectations of Gregory Maguire. This fell far short of those expectations.This piece of work is a trite, hodgepodge mess. Maguire seems incapable of creating a compelling storyline all on his own. His talent lies in words, not new ideas.There was no real plot to speak of and the story had no true ending, either. It left me completely unsatisfied. I can't imagine anyone truly enjoying or understanding the book. He had a few good ideas, but none of them ever seemed to go anywhere or be explained fully enough to be understood.A better novel would be made of a newspaper editorial- don't bother unless you're seriously bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"if there was a \\"no star\\" rating...","review":"this book would get it from me. Like many other reviewers here, I too read \\"Wicked\\", and \\"Confessions...\\" and found them to be entertaining and creative. \\"Lost\\" however has to be the worst book I have ever read to date. I found myself getting increasingly annoyed just trying to get to the torturous end of the story, and when I was done I wanted to throw the book away! I actually feel I lost brain cells reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, this was terrible","review":"I was halfway through this book before I got fed up with the fact that there is no focus for where the story is going. It seems like Maguire had a sudden, great idea for a story and then lost steam and interest as it went along. I enjoyed Wicked and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister immensely, but this was just awful. Can I give out no stars???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly LOST!!!!!!!!","review":"I had a lot of hope for this book when I started. With the cover art and the description, I expected something more along thelines of a ghost story with literary connections, etc. Well, lets just say this piece of \\"work\\" does not know where it is going. The ghost story I was hoping for was incomplete and garbled. And what is the point of the whole Scrooge storyline?Maguire could have just as easily left Scrooge out of it and it wouldn't effect the plot a whole lot. I guess Maguire just has to have some literary gimmick.I was left scratching my head at the end of it. I felt a little cheated or perhaps more accurately, mislead. The book isn't horrible but it just isn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapppointing ......","review":"I loved Confessions and think Wicked was brilliant- so much detail, passion and suspense. I couldn't wait to read Lost! What a disappointment. It reads like a romance novel at times. I felt like he had to get something to the publisher and wrote this the weekend before. He is a better writer than Lost! Read Wicked instead (or again) and skip this one. It will only turn you off to a great writer that needs to get back to what he is good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the same league as Wicked and Confessions","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book, which comes nowhere close to the pleasures offered by Maguire's two excellent previous novels. With its hodgepodge of allusions to Peter Pan, Jack the Ripper, A Christmas Carol, etc., all painfully forced, the story goes nowhere interesting, and the central character never comes into sharp focus. She was neither likable nor dislikable. And the author's attempt to inject English flavor into the narrative seemed very self-conscious. I still regularly recommend Wicked and Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister, but it was obviously a mistake to assume that Maguire's future works would necessarily reach the high standards set by those two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up.","review":"Wow, this book stinks. I keep telling myself to \\"hang in there, it will get better.\\" but it hasn't, and I'm tired of being bored. Finally made it to page 100 and I'm a fast reader. I have not been the least bit captivated, I give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot finish this book","review":"I have been trying to plow through this book for awhile; I think I purchased it close to 2 years ago. Although Maguire wrote one of my very favorite books (Wicked), because of books like this, he is not one of my favorite authors. The story drags, it is boring, and simply fails to draw the reader in. This is one of the very few book I've started adn never finished. Just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOST-loved it!!!","review":"I am an avid Maguire fan and after reading the reviews here I was hesitant when I began reading LOST. Now I am baffled that so many people hated it. I loved it!! The story was a little slow to take off but I was hooked after the 4th chapter. Those who were not fans of this book must not read many other Maguire books. The way his story was woven around other little plots is exactly what he does best. My favorite part was when Winnie started battling with Gervasa within herself, and the story of her baby was so sad! I urge those of you who did not like this book the first time to go back and read it again. Leave yourself open to the story and don't be so critical while you're reading. ENJOY it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I \\"Lost\\" hours of my life that I wish I could have back","review":"This book was a disappointment... the plot was confusing, the characters not well developed. As another reviewer said, I feel like I needed a map to understand what was going on in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lost\\" is apt title","review":"I think the author lost focus on what he wanted this story to be about. Jumping between points in time and story lines was confusing. Major plot lines ended without explanation. In the end I was left wondering if this was a story about a haunting, possession, or mental illness...or all three. The theme of loss was prevalent throughout the story, but never with a clear explanation as to what REALLY happened. The characters, including the protagonist were poorly developed. I think that there were 2 book ideas included in this one book and neither was developed enough to make a clear, comprehensible story. This book would have greatly benefited from an editors pen.In a nutshell, the author spent too much time trying to be clever to give the reader a focused story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Having read \\"Wicked\\" and \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\", I was looking forward to reading another of Maguire's imaginative works. However, \\"Lost\\" seems to be just that. Nothing really fits together in this novel, and Maguire had the opportunity to develop the Scrooge storyline wonderfully, but instead chose to go with an unknown ghost and theme of incest. It was, by far, the worst novel I have read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lost\\" is aptly named...","review":"\\"Lost\\" is aptly titled, because the reader feels lost for the first two thirds of the novel. In the final third, you discover some answers, but find they weren't really answers worth knowing. This novel is written in the third person but the point of view is first person, which leaves the reader feeling confused, muddied, and, well, lost. While I realize this may have been the point, it really doesn't work here. Finally, I don't think the author really understands women, which is unfortunate, since the protagonist and many of the characters are female. They all end up feeling underdeveloped and stilted, caricatures of real women. Their dialogue is inexplicable in some cases, and often downright rude for no apparent reason. Frankly, I was very disappointed. Get this one from the library if you must read it, or wait for the paperback. Better yet, take out your copy of \\"Wicked\\" and re-read that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't really like it","review":"I LOVED \\"Wicked\\". Liked \\"Son of a Witch\\" \\"Lion Among Men\\" really wrapped it all up. \\"Confessions of the Ugly Step Sister was wonderful..Loved it. Lost??? I was disappointed. I tried. I read it all the way through. I really didn't like it. Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish","review":"Gregory Maguire is very hit and miss with me. I thoroughly enjoyed Wicked, Son of a Witch, and I liked Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister. I did not like Mirror Mirror, but at least I finished it. I read over half of this book and decided I didn't even care how it ended. I put it down, sold it, and don't care to ever pick it up again. I'll be reading the third in the Wicked Series next and hope it is a hit with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got 'lost' with this book","review":"I had a lot of trouble with this book, and only finished it after three-false starts. Every time I picked it up, I quickly lost interest in the characters and the meandering story that seemed to go nowhere over the course of a 100 pages.It starts well enough, with a rapt car crash observed by the protagonist followed by an interesting scene in an adoption agency. The main character leaves for England to visit a relative, only to find him missing--sort of. Then, the story stops and wallows in itself for page upon endless page.I purchased this book along with Wicked, having loved the musical adaptation of the latter. And though friends' tell me they've loved Wicked, I'm worried about investing any more time in another Gregory Maguire book because of Lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to follow, not wonderful like other Maguire books","review":"Similar to other reviewers, I started this book with high hopes since I have enjoyed all of the other books I have read by Gregory Maguire. Sadly, I came to the conclusion that he was under a deadline to write it (projecting that feeling onto the main character who has writer's block) and just wrote the book as a stream-of-consciousness brainstorm. It never solidifies into a cohesive storyline.My recommendation would be: don't let Lost turn you off from other Gregory Maguire books! I've loved Wicked, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, and Mirror Mirror. I've just picked up Son of Witch and I'm already caught up in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I have LOVED Maguire's books so far - the Wicked series was excellent, as were Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and Mirror Mirror. I purchased \\"Lost\\" with the excitement of a new favorite book to add to my list.I was SORELY disappointed.I actually enjoyed the book up until the last few chapters. The story kept moving, and carried me right with it. I was excited to finish the book... Now I almost wish I hadn't. The story feels like Maguire just got bored with it, and finished it because he didn't want to work on it anymore. The ending is horrible and leaves you hanging, unsure of what just happened.Aside from that, the characters are undeveloped, the side stories are almost too many to keep track of, and you finish the book hating the main character and wishing she'd just get on with it.If you like be unsatisfied with your books, this is definitely one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this for Wicked!","review":"I didn't realize I had grown so attached to my Kindle! I got to the airport and almost cried when I realized I had forgotten it by my bedside. Chin up; I rushed into the bookstore looking for something to read on my long journey. Having read Wicked, I figured Lost was a good bet. Well, it was... lost???... from beginning to end! It just rambled and rambled! Eighteen hours of flight and no Kindle to move on to something else, I had no choice but to read on in hopes that it would get better. It didn't! Skip this, go for Wicked.One star for the illusion that something was going to happen and make the suffering through worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a ghost story","review":"I read the synopsis and thought this book sounded like it had a great plot. That is if the book had ended in the first hundred pages. It started wandering after that and I wasn't sure where the author was trying to go. This is book was difficult to follow. I did not enjoy it one bit. I doubt I would read any other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad at myself for buying this book","review":"Wicked was good, not great, just good, so when I saw this book on sale for $4, I thought, why not. I wish I would have just thrown my money away. This book is shallow and unimaginative, written as if the author hurrily threw it together to ride in the wake of Wicked. None of the characters, especially the main character, are given any personality or depth. The book starts off at its zenith, then falls quickly. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap! Cheap!

This is the single most worthless piece of hardware I've ever bought. The drive neither reads nor writes properly. I sent it back to Yamaha with examples of the problem, ie. The drive will burn with no errors but the finished product is useless. It can be read by the drive initially but will give errors before before the newly created disc is finished loading. Yamaha claims to have tested it and they say it is working properly. They sent it back. So I gave it to a friend to install on his system, the same exact error occurs.

I thought my drive was just a fluke until I came here and saw many other people who have had the same problem.

Well, not yet, I got a build from November 2000, downloaded the December firmware update and the Adaptec software update, but at least on my Win2000 system, the drive had problems reading some CD's (including 2 of the 3 software CD's that came with the drive), would spontaneously \\"unplug\\" itself, and could not write a CD. This was not a problem with the IDE settings or DMA. So best to wait for another firmware update unless you're prepared to take a chance.

Other than that it has been perfect. I have a 2 year old pc with an intel celleron 400 processor and I have burned discs at x16 speed, plus I did not even have to upgrade any drivers, or firmware.

PIII 500mhz with 256MB RAM and PIII 700mhz with 256MB RAM. The drive would consistently lock up the PC and put out coaster after coaster.I have never used Yamaha drives before.

I tried to stop and uninstall DirectCD. Eventually I went to the Yamaha support web site and downloaded the latest firmware.The Ugly: When I ran the firmware upgrade, it hung half way through and left my system unstable.

This is a B-rated movie that I would have been happy with if it showed some good cutting and lived up to its title. It didn't.

While I honestly cannot speak to the absolute accuracy of all of Mr. Bishop's coverage not being an expert myself on either the books or TV series, I do find it a useful resource to my interest in the character. If you like Morse, and also enjoy collecting media related books of this type (TV series and Film histories etc.) I think you'd enjoy having this one.Please note that prices seem to vary wildly on this book, I recommend PostScript books, a UK based bookseller (via Amazon) who are selling it at the proper 'remaindered book' price which with shipping to the US was *FAR* less than most are listing it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"I misunderstood this to be a collection of stories which it definately is not.

The reality was that at times I had to labor to get through to the end of the book, sort of what David Cone's last year as a Yankee was. The book had some good moments but Angell who wanted to write about Cone's craft as a pitcher ended up instead being a recount of his last season with the Yankees and a reflection of his childhood and baseball life up to that point.

Cone struggles with injuries and mechanics to produce a sub-par 4-14 record. Angell struggles with the project in general, producing A Pithcer's Story. Anyone who's enjoyed Roger Angell's previous baseball writing knows that his forte is explaining the game through it's players, relaying anecdotes that give us a sense of being inside the game, and putting the current events of baseball in their historical context. When A Pitcher's Story allows for these moments, Angell shines (see chapters Normal Pain and This Statesman). Unfortunatly, the format (following David Cone through a season) doesn't really allow for this. Maybe David Cone wasn't the right head to get into, maybe Roger Angell wasn't the right guy to try. In either case I hope they can both put the 2000 season behind them and give us one more good year."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FUN!","review":"Just love this book! Inspiring!

This album has occupied the top position on my iPod for almost a month now, and it refuses to cloy or bore. There is something solid and charming about the melodies and Gratz's performance that keeps them remarkably free, one play after another.The is some similarity between Wayne Gratz and Paul Cardall. Much of it is the evenness of composition and performance that makes it difficult to single out one cut as a favorite. But I find myself most interested in pieces like the title song (A Gift From the Sea), Steps in the Sand, and ships which bring in other instruments. The instrumental contrast builds the depth of the work and makes it even more enjoyable.If you like New Age acoustic instrumental work (or soft jazz, or fusion, or whatever you call it) listen here.

The text presents a wealth of insights into this underappreciated painter. The biggest drawback is the book's small illustrations. Aside from the reproductions of several portraits (i.e. Portrait of Procurator Antonio Cappello, Portrait of Procurator Jacopo Soranzo) and a handful of other works (i.e. St Louis, St George, and the Princess), the plates are disappointingly small. This is particularly problematic because Tintoretto's works in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco were painted on a large scale.

This work also encourages leaders to support and encourage volunteers.

He is shot down and some of his crew is killed. What I like about the book is that it is very suspenseful and historically accurate. Some people say that it shows what war is like. NOT TRUE, L.M Elliot didn't ever experience war, she got it all from her fathers stories. There is another book called 'All Quiet On The Western Front' by Erich Maria Remarque that completely blows this away in terms of how realistic it is. Remarque was a German soldier in the trenches during WW1. His book shows how war really is. However, his book isn't a teen novel its adult. But I am 14 and was able to understand it. This book is very good but it doesn't show what it is really like in a war.

He becomes wounded and struggles toward freedom on his feet in France. The major event in the story is Henery Forester is shot down behind enemy lines. Although, he was helped by children and a families. My opinion I thought this book was very good for people that enjoy reading and watching movies of war-- action movies.

This band was never the most original or interesting in the world, but at least they had some energy. While the band's early releases simply retreaded your standard 1-4-5 garage/nuggets chord progressions, at least they did it with energy and attitude. Now, from the look and sound of it, they've decided to move on and retread another bygone era - glam rock. Let me tell you, if you thought these guys looked rediculous before just wait until you see their current appearance. The looks would be no big deal if the songs were there, but, unfortunately they aren't. Give it up guys - you'll never be David Bowie. Hell, they'll never be Gary Glitter either.

Not for me....."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite helpful, but not just by itself","review":"The book takes a different approach on vocabulary building. Unlike the other test prepration of books I have seen, this book does not present you with list of words to memorize.The best feature of this book is that it makes you work on each new word. I agree with the authors on the fact that this is an effective approach. However, the words listed in this book are not quite the standard of GRE/GMAT. This book would be helpful to those who might be writing the SATs or are just beginning their GMAT/GRE preparation with a very limited vocabulary.I don't regret buying this book at all, since it isn't very expensive and also i can use the \\"strategy\\" of this book with more complex words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a series of multiple choice tests","review":"I found this book pretty useless. All it is is a series of 16 multiple choice tests in which you choose the answer that most closely approximates the word given. Sample question: amorphous means a) shapeless b) passionate c) property transfer d) vase-like e) parallel. Each test is preceded by very short definitions of the words plus each one used in a context sentence. It would be okay, I guess, as a superficial refresher, but I didn't find it challenging, and there was no discussion of strategy for the GMAT verbal/vocab section, which is more what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderate","review":"This book was good, however in terms of improving my score on the GRE it really didn't help at all.

Be prepared for school. This book does not use the time and motivation wasting filler that so many \\"hacking\\" books fill pages with. This describes in significant depth the root techniques used in exploitation. It can make some technical assumptions about the reader, and it is helpful to have programming experience, but I prefer this approach. I would rather have the author \\"teach to the highest common denominator\\" and not the lowest... What you don't know when you read this book, you will be motivated to learn.The writing style can be a little empty, and could use a bit more of a layered approach, but this is a minor criticism.I work in IT security, and this is the first hacking book I have ever recommended.

It seems to have a lot to say about certain topics, a little to say about others, and nothing to say about still other topics. The coverage of buffer overflows, format string exploits, and writing shellcode is excellent. But then when we get to the networking section, there are a couple of paragraphs devoted to some topics. There is no discussion of web vulnerabilities in the book. Nothing on SQL injection. Nothing on cross-site scripting. Furthermore, the Windows world is totally ignored; Linux is used exclusively in the book. Nevertheless, the book is worth it if only for its unsurpassed overflow/format string/shellcode explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine book","review":"A book that is providing the hacking knowledge in depth.

He reaches several very definite conclusions concerning personal identity, time, et cetera. Even in his discussion, he effectively rules out many possibilities, and outlines the complex arguments about Theory X. In philosophy, being able to identify the competing claims on either side of a problem is a great success, and Parfit's discussion will likely lead the way for another philosopher to solve the problem that he poses. Also, though Parfit may not be able to write like Proust, his writing is clear enough to be comprehensible. It is important to remember that a philosopher's ability to think is inversly proportional to his ability to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophical Equivalent of a Neutron Bomb","review":"When I first read this book on a trip across Europe, I was blown away: I remember thinking again and again \\"How can something this blow-the-roof-off important be published so late in the game?\\" Parfit shows how some of our most common-sensical beliefs about self-interest, ethics, personal identity, and (perhaps most interestingly) our obligations to future generations are beset with surprising and thorny problems, or even flatly self-contradictory or incoherent. He's also the master of the subtle-but-important distinction. Probably several longish books could be spun out from all the original material in Reasons and Persons-- certainly many journal articles already have been! However: while Parfit's style is very clear, and he doesn't refer as extensively as some philosophers to the work of previous authors, I probably wouldn't want to tackle this bad boy without at least some training in philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"This is the cheapest piece of junk I have ever purchased! the hooks and balls on the ends are made of very flimsy plastic, NOT METAL!

I learned much about the people and practices of that era I didn't know. This book kept me riveted throughout. It's like a time machine in print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early work on depossession","review":"Eugene Maurey writes very clearly and concisely about his experience in the areas of depossession from a distance using a pendulum. The book was published in the 80's, and his experience is from earlier years, and it may seem a little dated now, but it shares the same fundamentals as Dr. Edith Fiore, Dr. William Baldwin and other practioners' work in this field. While others have used hypnotized subjects to verify the presence of entities and their subsequent removal, Eugene Maurey advocates strongly at removing these entities from a distance at all times. The book includes a chart that can be used with a pendulum in order to verify what type of entity is attached, and especially interesting are the too positive entities like crusaders and overzealous evangelicals that can cause as much problems as negative entities. I keep this book as part of my library dealing with SRT (Spirit Release Therapy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer","review":"Excellent introduction on clearing. The author approaches the subject with kindness and compassion. He helped me understand clearly how and why spirits become earthbound to begin with. He removes the superstition surrounding 'possession'. Maurey also discusses the history of exorcism and how the methods used today have not changed much since the dark ages. There are some very good examples of why clearing is best done from a distance and how to do it. If you are sensitive to the spirit world, why not take the extra step? Help them on their journey toward healing. It can be a joyous experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for all ages!","review":"This review is from Debbie,Paul,Ryan and Melissa.

The selections are not all designed for blasting, nor are they all love songs - Walters establishes a comfortable and interesting balance between the two extremes.

I love It!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as 1-2-3","review":"This CD came out too quickly, they didn't let enough good songs get on it. Instead, it is filled with too much cheerleading, a mix that just contains too many songs, too much Dickie V., and oh baby, too much Austion P! Most of the songs on this are songs that weren't good enough for previous Jock Jams, this is a collection of wannabes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has some Great songs!!!","review":"This CD was pretty good. Some of the songs were not as good as the others. That is my view/ I figure different people like different music. I can truly tell you that I hardly ever listen to music, but this CD I would listen to anytime. A lot of the songs are very popular between my friends and me. This CD is one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Put it Down","review":"It's rare when I don't read a book straight through but I had to let this one go. I found the writing stilted (especially the dialogue) with too much exposition. A lot more heavy lifting is required to move this plot forward, especially with the ambitious number of characters involved. Barely two hundred (widely spaced) pages wasn't enough to develop the story line or the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I found this product to do nothing as far as getting ride of snarls and tangles.

She introduces Caitlan who is the original black operator to protect the one woman who can authenticate them and the race to find the stolen bronzes is on! The book moves fast through plot twists and turns of the story line until you just need to find out what happens!

I also love that I now have it available for my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal history and honor blend together","review":"From the first page to the last I was hooked. The glimpses you get of China are different from what we see on news. At the same time you get a glimpse of what an impact it made on the life of a young girl now a woman and a male youth on the verge of adulthood. You also get a glimpse of how this country helped to shape their codes of honor and what is the price of holding dear a country and honor to an individual. The sense of familial history and its importance in the continuity of life are scattered throughout the book. Choices of what cost honor are also embedded in the story. The characters fed well off of each other and the situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell Me No Lies","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It has everything from love, suspense etc. Highly recommended It takes you into the world of artifacts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish This Book","review":"I gave up on this book after 136 pages, which was exactly 136 pages more than it deserved. So far, nothing has happened except that we've met the ever-so-sexy male and female protagonists and we've learned that they find each other attractive.I'm sorry, but this reads like a thriller written by someone who up 'till now has written romance novels. (Which, apparently is fairly close to the truth.) This was a dismal waste of time. Call me an MCP if you wish, but as it happens I'm about to pick up a book by J.A. Jance. She's a mystery writer as opposed to thriller writer, but her books are about a thousand times better than \\"Tell Me No Lies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"There was more unneeded detail in this book than I have seen in a long time. The author, whom I have read frequently, was so wrapped up in showing a painful amount of knowledge on bronze that she lost the thread of the story. In addition, did anyone ever explain to her that a person could look totally hooked on a man without literally falling all over him in public? I guess not. I could have put up with that, but when I finally got to the last page, I didn't even bother to pass the book to a friend. Not wanting to have by head bashed by the book, I simply threw it away.What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"What An Awful Book - Unreadable","review":"This book was recommended to me by my librarian, whose taste I've trusted up until now. This book was unreadable, and in point of fact I didn't finish it. This is apparently part of a new sub-genre; the bodice-ripper-thriller. Over 100 pages in and still nothing has happened. All we know is how attractive the two protagonists are. Yuck. This is the literary equivalent of a chick flick. If it hadn't been a library book I would have chopped it up and buried it in my garden for fertilizer.I am not a misogynist; there are many female authors that I read, enjoy, and esteem: J.A. Jance, Sara Paretsky, Faye Kellerman, and Janet Evanovich to name a few. But I think Ms. Lowell should stick to books with illustrations of Fabio on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, all around good reading material!","review":"Tell Me No Lies is one of the more enjoyable books that I have read. I am amazed at the in-depth research that Ms. Lowell has done, not only regarding the Chinese culture, but also the Pacific Rim trade and governmental bureaucracies. Her characters are real; male and female are readily identified with. It is a pleasure to read this book (more than once)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"Many try, but few succeed. This book has a genuine sexual tension that just tingles along...It's got an interesting plot, in-depth characters, a description of China and Chinese artifacts that you don't often see in romances, but it is the sexual tension between Catlin and Lindsay that makes this a keeper, and one of Maxwell's (aka Elizabeth Lowell) best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic... at a loss of words","review":"This book is amazing. It has a fantastic story line and describes Chinese culture in a different view. Both Catlin and Lindsay are very interesting and unique characters. The concept of Trust is tested many times. This book gives you a unique view into Chinese culture and a little view on Chinese history. I couldn't put the book down, I wished that the book never ended. Each character has a history to dig into. You wonder about each person and who is real and who is fake. The story keeps you on your toes. If you like Chinese culture and secret agents then I recommed this book for an extremely good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning - Absolutely Stunning","review":"Right out of the box, into the ears, plug in the mp3 player and goosebumps! Pure sound - rich bass (no its not a boomer) and impressive range - these are simply the best.Yes, I can understand how some people may not like the \\"in the ear\\" thing. Granted we all have different shaped ears and it may not work for a few, but they are the unfortunate souls who are missing out.Again, these are not big power draining earphones so if deep loud bass is your only judgment for quality, you may want to save your $$ and get something else.If you're looking for great quality (seriously impressive sound) I recommend getting these babies. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Shop around online and find a good deal.Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade to E2C or any other entry level canalphone!","review":"I bought these because I found my previous phones, the E2Cs rather annoying to keep in my ear and also because I felt like an upgrade. If you're more of a bass-head, I'd still recommend the E2C. The E4s bass is slightly better defined but just a tad less deep...and I really mean a tad.Overall sound quality is as good as the very MANY online reviews say it is. Not best of class but very musical. If you are listening to music for pleasure (not work), musicality is a good thing. Slightly exaggerated mids clarity and moderately extended (in duration not depth) bass are some of the embellishments.Overall a good buy for the price (175 USD) and it's a good 70 USD cheaper than all the stores in Singapore.Kudos to Shure and Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost brought a fun party to a halt","review":"A group of us get together about once a month for game night, with word and thought games being the most popular. We've been playing BuzzWords for a couple of months (GREAT GAME!). I bought Last Word because it seemed to be a fun alternative. We played a rousing game of BuzzWords then switched to Last Word. I thought we were all going to fall asleep. It might be better if played in teams, but even then, it took forever for 8 of us to move even 2 or 3 squares. The concept sounded good -- but the execution was pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst game ever","review":"I would never play this game again...i purchased this game a coulple weeks ago because i wanted a game that was 3 players or less..my boyfriend and I started playing and realised that it was very difficult and boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play another game","review":"With eight people playing, this got to crazy (and not fun). The set up is too hard to follow, it is very difficult to teach a group who has never played, and it gets boring quickly. There rules are not clear (if the letter is I can you say ink well then ink pen and ink stain, etc, etc etc). The game is too subjective. People who had longer words to say (like actors and cities) never could be included. It is a poor game."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the hype?","review":"I ordered this game based on the reviews and was disappointed. My family played it one night and switched back to Balderdash! Now THAT'S a game! Wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Random Timer was DOA at opening.","review":"The game uses a Random Timer which is crucial to playing the game. The unit didn't work right out of the box when 1st opened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Versitile Game Ever!","review":"I love this game! My brother and I used to play a version of it when we were little kids, but Buffalo Games made it better than our edition. I love this game because it is so versitile though. It is a game that I can play with a group of people on game nights, or just with my husband, hanging out on the couch on Sunday night. The other great thing is that there are so many different combinations that it doesn't get old. Some games have repeat cards or questions so when you get through them, the game is wothless. With Last Word, the combinations come from your mind, so you are only limited to your own thought process. Overall, a great game that we will play over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun - Easy to Learn and Play","review":"We have had this game for a few years and it is a favorite to play at family gatherings with cousins of all ages - and adults as well, which is a great thing. The rules are easy to learn so easy to play. The buzzer is great, as it's a \\"random\\" timed buzzer, so adds fun to the game to see who get in the last word. I highly recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Word Game","review":"Fun family table game. Good for teens, too advanced for younger kids. Try to advance around the board by giving answers to a word clue (ie. types of vegatables, or car names, etc) that all begin with a predetermined letter that is selected from a role of the dice. I like the interaction because it forces my teens to expand their vocabulary and think fast. When timer starts people yell out answers, last answer given before random timer goes off wins the round and moves one space. Can get loud, but not as bad as I thought as people run out of answers quickly. Timer is random and short so rounds go fast. New topic and new letter each round. Gave 4 stars because timer is not quite loud enough to be heard easily over the shouts. (have to hold to my ear if action gets too roudy). My kids didn't like games till I got this one and several others. It is lots of fun and recommended. Good adult mixer too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun party game...","review":"This is a great party game!!! We had a lot of fun and laughs while fumbling to find words that matched the letter and topic. The only recommendation I would give is to adapt the rules to your liking. My family simply flips the subject & letter card at the same time for all to guess together. The group has to agree on who earned the point for the last word. Sometimes if 2 people shout a different answer at the same time, we would award the person who shouted previously to them or no score at all (if there was no previous answer). The point is to have fun and this game definitely brings it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad concept for a board game","review":"As others have mentioned this is a good idea, but because there is virtually no structure or rules, it is guaranteed to end in argument or confusion. For example, let's say that the category is \\"something you would see in a park\\", and the letter is \\"L\\". Someone says \\"lake\\". OK, maybe that makes sense. Then someone says \\"little dog\\". Really? Maybe... The someone says \\"little cat\\". Huh? Is two words OK? Wouldn't you have cats and dogs anywhere, not just in a park? In fact, couldn't you name just about any object beginning with an L and say that you could find it in a park? A lunchbox, a lion, a leprechaun. You could make a case for anything... and so that's the major flaw with this game. It gets more and more frustrating as people stretch their guesses more and more to include ANYTHING, just so they could claim \\"last word\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still tight ;-)","review":"Oh lordy.

I have spent many of months crushing ice with a meat tenderizer in plastic baggies. Wish I would have found this sooner. It makes the PERFECT size for crunching! And it's SO easy to do! I don't find it hard to spin the handle at all. It might get stuck on a piece of ice, but twist it the opposite way and then go again and it's easy as pie! I do use store bought rounded ice cubes, so not sure how it would work with the square homemade ones.The only downfall is the metal cup tends to slip a bit, so I wish there would be a gripper on the bottom, but it's no huge deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine piece of equipment for your bar","review":"I love this ice crusher. It works well and although I agree that it can be hard to operate, it yields fantastic results, beautiful ice chunks that are perfect to quickly cool down any drink, and ideal to prepare drinks in a shaker, where you are looking for maximum surface of contact from your ice.It will fit more than 2 ice cubes as claimed by other reviewers, I always get at least 4 in (regular cubes). Note that it is not required to close the lid completely before starting to crush. Once you've started turning, try to keep a good momentum and you will have you ice crushed in 5-7 seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"My martinis never tasted better!","review":"I picked this up for the wife because she loves to chew ice cubes and the noise was driving me crazy! Turns out I use it more every time I fix a cocktail because the crushed ice makes a better sipping drink!My dad had the electic Revel and the racket that unit made was not welcome in our house. This unit has a good crank requiring a firm hold on the unit. Backward cranking caused the nut to wind off after a while but it is large and easy to wind tight again. I like the metal cup. I can also place a small highball glass in there if I want to. Remember to replace the cup when you are done to catch the drips of ice melt left in the crusher!The retro look dresses up our counter just right. Worth the extra $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for a manual device","review":"Bought this product for my wife (was on her wish list). The unit looks much better than shown in the photos. As for crushing ice, it does a fine job. Yes, it takes effort and some strength (you will, after all, be crushing ice manually), but the result is very nicely crushed ice. I've been able to load five large ice cubes into the bin. The cover does not immediately close with this much ice, but, while holding the cover down and with a slight turn of the crank, it will fully close. Only two complaints. First, the difference between fine and course ice is not discernable to me. Second, the unit could use a larger, heavier base for stability. Otherwise, I enjoy using my wife's(!) Ice-O-Mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit","review":"Memories of my grandmother's wall-mount manual ice crusher brought me to the Ice-O-Mat.A real disappointment, it is quite unpleasant to use.

Wrong. I returned it and the search continues ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this DVD!","review":"This DVD has two so-called Sword & Sandal flicks. Well, one of them is: Hercules the Avenger. The other film, Hercules & the Black Pirate, is NOT a Sword & Sandal films. It's a pirate film starring Alan Steel, who made some Hercules films before but here he plays a Spaniard. It's not worth your time at all.But that's not the actual worst part of this DVD. The actual Sword & Sandal flick, \\"Hercules the Avenger\\", is one of the worst Peplums ever. That film is a combination of scenes taken from \\"Hercules and Captive Women\\" and \\"Hercules in the Haunted World\\" with some original scenes, badly edited together to create a thouroughly awful experience. Aside from the scene when Reg Park fights with his nemesis, the entire film is a complete ripoff and one of the reasons the genre died back in the 1960s.Avoid \\"Hercules the Avenger\\" at all cost.

If you like being swept away into a totally different world, this is the book for you. C.S. Lewis has such a wonderful way of describing Narnia and explaining what is going on to the reader.

Yes, I have read all of these but all the other ones had too many reviews. Anyway, it has suspense like none of the other books (expect maybe THE LAST BATTLE). There is a prince who always rode out on a horse every day at the same time. Well that was after him mother died, and everyone thought that he was just grieving. But, ah ha, they guessed wrong. One day the Kings best friend decided that he would go out and see what this boy was up to. He had heard rumors of how the prince's mother died.

This book however deals with a old and sad Caspian who has experienced terrible losses in his life.

But, more specifically, she's concerned because she's slept with so many different guys that she has no idea who the father is. Her more conservative sister (Lynn Chen) makes finding the baby's daddy -- and marrying him -- sound like the only plausible option.

This was one of the few movies that has made me both laugh out loud and tear up. The cast of actors was well-chosen, and you can see their synergy throughout the movie. The main character's gay best friend provides a parallel for her own life, and he has some really funny lines in the movie.

I have lost my faith in the system and its head but anyone planning to take this should inquire all the appropriate questions, who's your teacher, when did you start studying, where can I contact your teacher/master, may I see your certifications/credentials?

William Marlowe is a professor of Shakespeare at Columbia University, with a wife named Anne and a couple of kids. While immersed in a seminar on the sonnets, he meets a Dark Lady and a handsome and pale young man. Hijinks follow in New York City. Readers of Shakespeare will recognize the parallels with Shakespeare's own life. Professor Marlowe unselfconsciously, in both senses, follows the trajectory of the narrative of the sonnets.

In one bit he makes fun of the audience when he pronounces a name in its English pronunciation. Mencia then tells his audience that if they want the Spanish pronouncement of the name to get his Espaniol version of the cd this one is English. Well This cd is the Espaniol version. If you have limited or no knowledge of Spanish avoid this cd. What bothers me is that there is no warning that this cd is mostly Spanish. The cd has a warning for explicit language but none for this cd being mostly a Spanish speaking cd. This seems to me to be a bit deceptive in the sale of the cd. Therefore, I warn all those who expect the usual Mencia comedy to skip this one if they don't habla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD by Mencia","review":"This sounds like an attempt to gain the George Lopez audience.

Even thought Don Loritz's book concentrates on language learning, the same cognitive model can be extended to learning in general. From the inner workings of a small set of neurons to the combined computational power of potentially billions (or more) neural connections, he builds on solid brain science and biology. Unlike other authors who approach neural network research from a purely engineering perspective, Loritz approach is grounded in physiology, and his assertions are largely supported by what we know about the brain's structure and how the emergent properties of mind are formed. I would highly recommend it: it's a nice change from the myriad of books which posit how the brain/mind work without even mentioning the word \\"neuron.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is a gem~","review":"I confess to being a diehard Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman fan, but this is such a great DVD.

Of all the live theatre, musicals and concerts I have been to....nothing compared to it. The audience rocked and hooted through essentially the same set as is on this DVD, with some additional songs included, and I've never seen a happier crowd exit a show at concert's end. It's a much smaller and more intimate gathering of people on this DVD but there is still fantastic singing and playing and a most appreciative audience throughout. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bachman and Cummings in concert","review":"Randy Backman and Burton Cummings play Guess Who, Bachman Turner Overdrive, and solo songs in concert.

His jokes often reflect a lot of tasteless topics but that was his act. You either found it funny or you didn't. I found this album to be kind of weak for Dice but the most enjoyable part of the album is that he is performing his raunchy material in front of a sold out crowd in Madison Square Garden. When the whole audience is saying the rhymes with him it is a laugh riot despite their stupidity. The second half is a club performance which has funnier jokes. The song at the end is retarded though. But if you like Dice, you'll like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover blues, here we come...","review":"I remember this album distinctly, because it was one of Dice's first easily found releases, at at time when his records (and comedy records in general) did not sell as much as most comedians wished.It was also a weak effort, especially in comparison to \\"Day the Laughter Died\\", which was a gutsy, comedy tour-de-force. While you can't fault him for being able to pack MSG, comedy is like Industrial music; anything more than 500 people in the room and the effect is jarring. Here, he can't possibly maintain the intimacy he gets from a dingy nightclub (listen to side two to see what I mean), and the bits suffer.Side one is a mob laughing because the guy next to them is laughing. Side two is people laughing because the material actually works. That's a big difference when it comes to comedy.I'd actually only recommend this album to people who already own his first two albums + 40 Too Long, but not to first-time dicers. It's far too hit & miss for the uninitiated."},{"rating":"1","title":"in his own style","review":"Georgie Porgie Puddin PieWhat chemical landfill were they near concieving this guyWhen evolution goes to mutation and the product is of this cutsome morons should just keep their gorilla mouths shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a very good book","review":"I am a beginner in Visual Basic .NET, and I am not really a big fan of this book...This book definetely conveys the ideas however this book does not give u an opportunity to practice and get better.

It worked well about half of the time. The main problem that quickly reared it's head is that the cutting surface is actually a removable drill bit. That sounds good in theory, but it is only held in place by friction. Since it is used to cut METAL, the bit OFTEN gets dug in to the metal that it is supposed to be cutting, and simply spins in its handle, rather than actually cutting anything. Many times i've actually had the bit stick inside the case i'm trying to cut, and i remove an empty handle. Mine is now so loose in it's handle that it simply won't cut at all anymore. It is now useless.

However, if you want you could have the neon full of empty cards, and another color full of shot cards. I however simply have it such that when I open up the case whatever cards face me showing their label- that means that they are empty.

Her songs have an understated sophistication to them. Although Julia does occasionally faulter when reaching for higher notes, to me, it only adds to her charisma and the genuiness of the performance she's giving on her album.Julia's album is perfect for evening get-togethers with friends or even reflecting on lost love?

This album has not been a let down and stood up to repeated listening. The lyrics themselves are meaningful and makes one reflect a lot about love.

It's also poorly organised, out of chronological order. One chapter lists the outbreak for each of the three phases of the war, even though these phases were ten to fifteen years apart.

It was interesting to see a writing genius having people problems, and slightly annoying to see him constantly raising Edmund's hopes and then thrashing him verbally as if he was not important at all. The story has a good ending and it made the journey worthwhile. I am homeschooling my sophomore son, and he just finished all of Poe's short stories. This story is next since he will have a little down time before we tackle \\"Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This book was really great, but the ending confused me. Other than that this book was one of the best books I've ever read. I've never liked mystery stories, bit I loved this one. You must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of The worst Books Ever","review":"This book started out alrite with the sister nowhere to be found and her brother [Edmund] alone,the aunt dead, and only one person who will help him [Edgar Alllan Poe, often referred to as Austin Dupin]. Dupin is a character in a book Poe wrote and when Poe is a detective. Poe is a border line psycho. Poe is writting a story about Edmunds life and wishes the sister to be daed. I didn't like book because Poe kept changing from Poe to Dupin and one minute he'd like Edmund one minute and hate him next. I recomend this book to people who like borring detective books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freak me out!","review":"This book was really cool and it also freaked me out. Poe was always drinking or wanting to drink. Also, he keeps saying he's Dupin, then one minute later, he's Poe! Anyways, it was very mysterious, freaky, and suspensful. I really enjoyed this book. :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"The man who was Poe","review":"i give this story a 3 because it was kinda scary in some parts. but it is a good story. my favorite part is in the end because it had a boat chase. my favorite characters is Dupin because he is like a detective helping out Edmund with his problems, and because his real name is Poe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Mystery","review":"Edmund and Sis are alone. Their aunt has been gone for two days. Starving, Edmund goes to a local pub for food. Upon returning to his dreary Providence apartment, he finds that Sis is gone. Desperate, Edmund turns to anybody who can help. The only person who agrees to help is a stranger named Dupin. Who is Dupin? Can he be trusted? Where is Sis? Aunt? Read The Man Who Was Poe, by Avi to find out.I liked this book because it's a combination of a murder mystery and a horror. I also liked this book because, living in Rhode Island, I can relate to it, having been to many of the places mentioned in this book. If you like a good thrill, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who Was Poe","review":"I thought this book was great! The only thing though, was that it a really depressing book. I liked that it was mysterious and it made you want to keep reading more.Throughout the whole book I was wondering where all of the people were, AVI just talked about the characters and that made it seem more depressing.I really liked this book, it makes me want to read more of AVI's books.I gave this book four stars, because it was a book that I couldn't put down, but it's probably a book that I wouldn't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting as reading a dictionary","review":"I personally like Avi. He is a wonderful writer but WHOAAA this is his worst piece. The book had confusing things going on and too many characters and confusing names that I just could keep up and also it was very boring.

DONT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WAN TO WASTE GOOD TWO HOURS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst avi book","review":"THIS BOOK IS THE WORST AVI BOOK EVER.Avi has written much many better books such as Wolf Rider. It has a really dull plot and ending. Even though someone gets killed it is one of the most boring books ever. It's good in the beginning but it gets horrible.

It gave the reader an eiry feeling of helplessness, provoked by the idea of a youg boy(Edmond)eight years of age all by him self, without any one to protect or take care of him. It makes you want to read more just to make shure this child makes out all write.When Dupin comes on to the seen you find a story take on sucpence. As you hope for trust or freind ship in Dupin. Is this man going to help, or will this misterious drunkerd leave Edmond to fend for himself? He has an unacountable spiret of a wondering sole. On his very next binge his memory could be slerd, and drive demotivated, or will he just forget his perpose for helping this youg boy all together? Will they find his sister in time, or will this strang mans own demons of the past, come back to hunt him, and hindering his sole once again?!!!The story is great, with an ever biulding susspence, whichI have never experianced in any other book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who Was Poe","review":"The reason why I rated this book this way is because this is the kind of stuff I like to read. I like the books of suspenseful story of murder, dark deeds and diappearance. I don't usually read books, but when I was in 7th grade I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Since 7th grade I have been doing this book, as a report for four years. The real reason why I read this is because I like to read Edger Allen Poe books. I told my teacher that I liked Edger Allen Poe and he suggested that I should read The Man Who Was Poe. Thats how I got started on this book. This book kept me in my seat every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Book!!!!!","review":"I thought book was great!I like suspenful books and this is one of my favorite books.I would suggest this book if you like scary and mysterious books.it is a book to read when you're alone.I also think they should make a movie out of this book. Very suspenful,mysterious,and scary!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I Have Read","review":"I think this is the best book I have read because all of the of the other books were really good but didn't make me read more.This book is a great mystery and made me read it all in one day!

It only included death! when someone died there was no fealings in Poe. I hated this book.A part where Edmund meets a very close relitive was the best part in this book.

If you are a sad depressing person then so ahead and put yourself in misery!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I am sorry fo all the people who like this book, but I thought it was very boring and that's all I have to say sbout that. It needs more excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who Was Poe","review":"Have you ever read a book by Avi? I just read a book called The Man Who Was Poe by him, and it's awesome!This book takes place in Providence, Rhode Island. The problem is, Edmund, who is also the main character, can't find his Sis, or Aunty Pru! He goes out to look for them and finds a man who says his name is Mr. Dupin. But, it makes you wonder, is his name really Mr. Dupin, or is he disguising himself? Dupin decides to help Edmund find Sis and Aunty Pru.I would recommend this book for people who like mystery (and murder). This book is a bit like the Charlie Bone series without any magic.To find out if Edmund finds who he's looking for, and to see if Dupin is telling the whole truth, read this amazing book, The Man Who Was Poe.By Rachel Carlson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cathartic, to say the least...","review":"This is the album by which all, and I mean ALL other Dice albums are measured. The man had nothing to lose by the time he did this one, his contract was obviously up and America had lost interest.Of course, all of these things pale in comparison to what is contained on this album. Audience participation. I leave it at that.The final bit 'The Arguement' remains one of his best.Anger, sheer ANGER is what incarnates this highly impressive follow-up to the original Day The Laughter Died. After the disappointing and whipped '40 too long' -which tried to make trite nonsense like picking out a suit funny- this final major label release is unapologetic and vicious.You will feel truly inspired after listening to this album and if your name is Max, I have no pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end is here...","review":"Dice never got any worse than this album, although I've yet to hear his latest. It's an attempt to follow up on his classic 'Day the Laughter Died' double LP, but it misses by far. Only a few good bits on the whole thing, and they're funny by accident. His timing's shot, his raunch is no longer subtle, and he wastes too much time on unfunny bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, how did this actualy get released?","review":"I'm a big fan of Andrew Dice Clays earlier work like 'One Night with Dice' and 'The Diceman Cometh' but this particular CD is just awful, Andrew is more pissed off and enraged than ever here and he mostly yells & complains rather than tell jokes or attempt to be funny ,Dice picks on audience members like he normaly does but goes alittle to far this time ,in fact one couple gets up and leaves at one point, and he gets into a shouting match with another person to the point they're about to fight each other(literaly) You could tell Dice was having a bad night,even a diehard Dice fan will have trouble enjoying this one... All it did was make me feel sorry for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dice's lowpoint","review":"This album is almost sad rather than funny. The jokes are very recycled. The album has some very funny parts which make it a must for the completionists. Overall the jokes are weak yet the material is just as raunchy. The album ends with him getting into a heated argument with an audience member. Those are the last moments recorded from Dice. It's very mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take this title literally !","review":"If ever an album title described the contents, this is the one : a comedy album which manages to produce not a single laugh ! If you're into Andrew Dice Clay, avoid this one like the plague and focus on his other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dice hits rock bottom on this!","review":"Just as I thought Dice was getting better ...\\", he goes and releases this garbage?!I always thought Dice was funny, but his jokes about women could offend quite a few people. Regardless of that, ... so naturally I thought the sequel would be much better. WRONG!Dice does nothing but yell, insult the audience, repeat the same stupid stuff over and over, goes off completely over his trademark \\"dirty nursery rhymes\\", says some of the nastiest things to ever fly out of a human being's mouth, then, to top it off, throws the mike down and goes out in the audience to pick a fight with someone. (Personally I hope Dice got his ... kicked).The man's career seemed to go downhill from there, and it was after that that he decided to reinvent himself as a TV star ..., but he soon after retook the stage as the \\"Diceman\\" we all knew so well.All I have to say is, save your money on this album. It'll leave a bad taste in the mouths of even the most die hard Dice fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have to buy this, at least get the others first!","review":"This is by far the worst Andrew Dice Clay album I've heard. I've listened to Dice for twelve years, and I LOVE most of his stuff. But this one was horrible. Of the sixty-sum minutes, probably about 15 are even remotely funny. Mostly he just fights with members in the crowd. This isn't a bad Dice album, it's a bad album period! If you MUST own every Dice disc, make sure this is the last one you buy. Only tracks worth a listen are Gas, Deaf & Dumb, The Wedding, Pink Spot, Wife Tells All, Surprise, Chinese Restaurant, and Greeting Cards. The most worthless ones are The Argument, Mad Max, and The Contractor. Absolutely pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of the line?","review":"After this pathetic excuse for a follow- up to the classic double CD was released, it seemed as though Dice was finished. Thankfully he rebounded with a good new CD and several hilarious videos, such as the \\"Valentine's Day Massacre.\\" The time is 1994, and his career has now slid down hill from where it previously was. He sounds like a man who has woken up the next morning with a hangover after a wild and wonderful party on \\"Laughter, Part II. The bad news is Dice may never reach the status he once gained in the late'80's. But the good news is Dice is still around, putting out quality material for the faithful to enjoy. This is one of the worst comedy album I have ever heard, and it certainly acts as a black sheep in the Dice CD collection, which is loaded with great material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed It!","review":"This was a very well written book. I can't understand why the negative reviews. In fact, my husband even read it and also enjoyed the book. We will definately check out others by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-dressed grizzly hunters","review":"This book is certainly NOT one you can't put down, in fact, you can hardly get through it! Is it the totally uninteresting characters? Is it the fact of a complete description of the dress of each character as a fashion statement supposed to enhance one's understanding of the character? It it the attempt to be a nature mystery when it feels more like a romance, or a trade magazine for the fashion industry? Is it the continuous descriptions of everything that leads nowhere? I am half-way through and considering giving it up as a lost cause for it to even get anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE!! If you want to buy it, go ahead!!","review":"This book's main attraction is the color pictures. For some people, pictures are their main concern. This book covers a lot in the uniforms. Finding a book about the fascist Italy's uniforms are quite rare. I am pleased with this book. If more books (especially with color pictures) about the Italian military is available, than people who are interested in fascist Italy would be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best guidebook for the area.","review":"This seemed to be a decent guide...and then after using it, it was found to be lacking. The routes are sometimes awkward, and missed better routes that are easier to trek, and thus safer. Some of the trails are either poorly noted, or have changed since publicaton in 2001.This is a guide that can be greatly improved upon.There are locals in the area who can give far more accurate directions, and better yet, guide you to the places safely, if you are not experienced at hiking this terrain. This optionis highly recommneded to photographers or those hiking with children/teens and weekend warriors/older folks.Kelsey's Canyon Guide is thought of more highly by those with both books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've been interesting. . .","review":"This book had a lot of promise. Covert action? Very cool. The problem is, it's horribly written. There's an awful lot of sloppy mistakes and repetition. It's loaded with sentence fragments and poor grammer. (Or, \\"the sentences are fragments and bad, bad written with.\\") It doesn't interfere with the substance, and maybe I'm being too particular that I couldn't focus on the subject--but I couldn't. It was obnoxious, distracting, and I finally put the book down about three chapters from the end. I'm even a history major--I'll read anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor storytelling even poorer scholarship.","review":"We learn nothing new in this book (everything in this book is public record) nor do we get an interesting POV from the author.

But nope, just easily compiled research with weak supposition; makes me think if the publisher was duped by the author that the text would be either a comprehensive text or a critical study. Instead they received about 200 pages of recycled poo.Abridged literature review: The author wishes to convince the reader and the general public that the CIA acts only when the President orders it to do so; and intelligence work is becoming more and more politicized, which compromises integrity from the DCI, down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Executive Secrets","review":"I ordered this item over a month ago and have no confirmation of shipment to date.

At this point it is quite simply impossible to ignore what Harnoncourt, Leonhardt, Gardiner and several others have found about period performance practice. If you want a lively, interesting and very well played Quattro Stagioni go for Fabio Biondi and L'Europa Galante in OPUS111 or Il Giardino Armonico on TELDEC.

His only view of women is as a support system for a sucessful male. He has nothing to say about moving from being self employed to being in the job market. He has nothing to say about reclaiming your life when you have been the beneficiary of a medical miracle. He spends half of the book trying to teach men how to balance their lives. Working women are by definition expert on balancing life priorities. He has a chapter on learning how to communicate with people. Most women already have these skills.

If you have access to decent fresh fish then do yourself a favor, respect the creatures that gave their lives so you can eat, and don't smother them with cheese and heavy cream. With a few exceptions (butter and shellfish) heavy dairy products have no place on fresh seafood and this book asks you to to mask and violate the flavors and textures of quality fish with piles and piles of cheese (cheese and fish? GROSS!!) Like I said, if all you have is stinky, old, nasty fish then this book will provide you with great ways of disguising their flavors.

However, he loses me with the whole flow of the movie. It seemed to be \\"cut and pasted\\" . It doesn't settle down into a story line. The editing is chaotic, the thought pattern is muddled. So there's no chance to really indentify with or connect with the character as with the other movies. As a result, it made the film hard to follow and just a screen full of Spike Lee going wild.

Although of course the beast in this is not unicron but he could be, I think the series ran it's course and did all it could do, if it hd carried on longer it would just have gotten thinner and dragged out. Also it's great that every episode is here just as they were originally, only two tiny things to fault with this set.

The main bands in The Haight then were The Airplane, The Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company.But there were a lot of great bands from all over the Bay Area and in Los Angeles, all feeding off the same Zeitgeist.The original members were initially folkies, but then the British Invasion influenced them.You can hear the twangy guitar of the Beatles, the Byrds and the heavier sound of the Animals in this compilation.This is just before their really big album in 1966 after Grace Slick joined the band from The Great Society.The eight bonus tracks are excellent too.A seminal album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entourage - When/Do U Wanna","review":"Entourage - When/Do U Wanna This is the first and only single I have heard from Entourage, it includes the track \\"When\\" and also \\"Do U Wanna\\". \\"When\\" and \\"Do U Wanna\\" are beautiful soulful tracks.

With no Franco Zeffirelli, Baz Luhrman (or George Cukor) at the helm, and no Olivia Hussey, Leonard Whiting, Claire Danes, Leonardo diCaprio (or Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard) in the cast, this version is straightforward, swift and devastating in its impact. Directed by Alan Horrox, and featuring Geraldine Somerville and Jonathan Firth as the star-cross'd lovers, this film is revelatory in its simplicity, pays attention to the words as the principal vehicle of the tragedy, and relies on acting rather than starpower.

For summer, or for those who enjoy feeling cool in bed, these sheets are perfect, as they dont \\"cling\\" to you like some jersey or flannel does.The sheets are ample in size and fit my double bed well, with a bit of extra material in the fitted sheet especially. Seems as though they did shrink a little bit in the wash, but still fit the bed well. They also seemed to lose some of their lovely sheen after laundering, but that may well be due to the very hard water here.It is difficult to find pale pink sheets so I love the color.Great price for these lovely sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it is Flamenco","review":"Guitar sounds.....slow music........flamenco is not only the rumba sounds, it has many differents sounds.

I guess I could open all the zip files and hope for the best. I found so many error in chapter 2. I am going to give up on this book soon. Since I program for a living and have a Java XML book with examples I can play with the stylesheet examples in the book until it works as discussed in the text. This is a very frustrating way to learn. I even went to w3c to get the recommendation for help. I buy books to avoid this headache. I do not recommend this book.

But, as the book explains, we can do more than simply accept that fact, we can actually be fruitful and grow as a result of our struggles. The 31 Meditations for Growing Kingdom Fruit exercises at the end of the book are especially helpful because it helps you to actually \\"develop\\" the fruit in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly entertaining for young children","review":"This movie is mildly entertaining for young children, but adults will notice the low budget quality. The acting is mediocre, the lines are weak and often anachronistic in the scenes set in 1948. Although it is of relatively low quality, it is a movie you can watch with your kids. The worst part was when Julietta's father sends her to a \\"mad scientist's\\" house/lab alone.

Not a keeper for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great guide for photographers","review":"This is a great guidebook for photographers because it presents at least one photo of each potential destination. So you can get a pretty good idea whether it is worth venturing out from your hotel. The guide is compact and perfect for a one-week trip to Israel. I used it when on business there and had a few extra days to prepare a photo exhibit for photo.net. If I were staying a month I'd probably want something thicker.

The suit fits, but nevertheless reveals much more flesh across the backside than I am accustomed to . . . don't buy this suit if you are shy!

They coppied almost half of this movie from Jaws. They even use the line \\"Out of the water,get out of the water now\\"! How cheap is that! The graphics are horrible and the shark modals look like cheap blow up toys! The acting is okay but compared to Jaws's acting it sounds like Roseanne Barr singing \\"My Heart Will Go On\\"! Yep. Well you get the point.Buy Jaws or Deep Blue Sea insted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"I really liked this movie. No the scenes were not like Jaws as some other reviews have stated. Do these people actually think it had a budget like jaws. It was a really good movie.

I'm the kind of person who can watch b-movies and enjoy them. But, this... I dont know where to start. Anyone who write good reviews and gives the movie five stars, desirves to have their VCR and DVD players trashed! At least the movie has some cool murder scenes. Other than this, it aint worth your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best shark movie since Jaws","review":"After Jaws it will always be difficult to make a shark movie which will be as action packed, adventurous and entertaining. However, Shark Attack is probably the best of the 'post Jaws' era. It would be true to say that the music didn't quite match the thrilling suspense of John William's score but the adventure was something you experience along with the actors. The movie at one point threatened to slow down a little but that quickly turned around with the introduction of the character of Roy Bishop which sprung the movie back to life again with more action, humor and tension. Definately worth a watch!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good effects bad script......","review":"I had to say Shark Attack 1 was a better film and there was only 3 things i liked about this film-1.

Thats all i could say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark Attack 2: Attack of the stock footage and CGI Sharks!","review":"Shark Attack 2 is the name of this film. It's about a guy named Dr. Nick Harris that tries to stop a school of mutant great white sharks, along with Samantha Peterson, a diver, and Roy Bishop, an Austrailian TV show host. This movie is probaly the worst shark movie I have ever seen! The whole movie has only CGI sharks and stock footage! Yeesh!!! Anyway, I guess the shark attacks are OK. But it is still a lame movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one and don't hesitate to do so","review":"this film is an absolute disgrace. Come on now what is it with you people trying to rip off jaws like this. For god sakes quit it and make a good shark movie for once. The sharks look totally unconvincing and unscary. They appear to be nothing more than fiberglass. The shark footages are nice but set for the locations,climate and weather. This is not very good. What saves this movie from sinking is the performance by that guy who plays the Aussie. He was good but believe me watching this movie isn't worth watching his good acting my dear friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE'S ALWAYS JAWS","review":"With the exception of JAWS and possibly DEEP BLUE SEA, you could take all these shark attack movies and lump them together; just change the actors, sometimes the location, but you end up with the same thing: poor special effects, so-so acting and some occasional laughs and/or thrills. This entry like the other two SHARK ATTACK movies is generic fluff, with little novelty or variety to distinguish it. The cast of Thorsten Kaye (as the studly hero), Nikita Alger (the hot diver) and Daniel Alexander (the studly if obnoxious Steve Irwin clone) gamely tries to breathe life, but this is just another movie in which the shark should have eaten the whole bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic sharks. Horrible flick","review":"This was so stupid. Intelligent sharks that swim in schools terrorize alocal tourist beach community. Complete with direct rip-0ffs from\\"Jaws,\\" and combined footage of real sharks with plastic and inflatabletoy sharks. Also the shark thinks it's a lion as it growls before andduring attacks. People underwater with scuba gear can talk, and screameasily too..Hmmmm..LOL..If you like bad films, you might wanna see howstupid and cheap this is. There is plenty nof unintentional humor here. But I cannot give it any better than 1 star. Because that's what it is. A one star mega low budget film. Bad actors. Bad script. Bad director. Bad special effects. But if you hate bad movies, stay away...Truly for lovers of below \\"B\\" grade films only."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never seen Jaws...","review":"and never plan to. I hate shark movies, period, and find their appeal a very juvenile one. To me this was about heroism and romance.

I wish they'd make a Shark Attack 3, featuring him."},{"rating":"1","title":"spleen splitting fun","review":"jese man, talk about b movie magic. ive never cared so much about a man's(whoever the director is) broken dream to make a movie. it is so poorly done, they even let footage of a dolphin substitute for a shark. god bless america!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd try is a charm ...","review":"I've tried two other replacement batteries for my Panasonic phone, and this is the first that seems to have capacity similar to the original battery.

Stay away from the lower capacity replacements. You will be wasting your money. As a side benefit, this was actually cheaper than both others that I tried.

This book will undermine any confidence that you ever had in your ability. If you like a text that gets to the point and applies the issues in a pertinent and concise manner, see Cohen, Howell, etc... Anything but this. Still, it does make for an interesting read at times.

Although the authors suggest that these are \\"real\\" data, no references are given.Hmmmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst textbooks ever","review":"This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever bought. It is written in a way that makes the concepts seem harder than they actually are, and does not really describe the equations and their use.

Highly recommended. Weiner uses Exner's structural summary as the foundation, then incorporates Schafer's psychoanalytic approach for the interpretation of thematic imagery and idiosyncratic contents. Excellent integration of structural summary, thematic imagery, test behavior, and sequential analysis approaches. In addition to translating Exner's often stilted language into much more clinically useful language, the chapter on sequential analysis is worth the price of the book on its own. Excellent case presentations integrating the interpretive principles presented earlier close out the book. A must-have book for anyone who wants to make better sense of all the data provided by the Rorschach method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source for anyone interested in the Rorschach","review":"This book conveys in a clear language the complexities of the Rorschach interpretation.

It is a fine example of Islamic literature. Ibn Tufail was a Moorish writer from the 12th Century. He was born in Andalucia and died in Morrocco. This is his most substantial work. This is a sadly neglected masterpiece. It deals with the spiritual evolution of a man isolated from civilization. Hayy is nurtured by a roe and has to learn to fend for himself as he grows older. He evolves deep spiritual ideas in spite his lack of speech or language. Fate intervenes and Asal happens by his island. Asal is on a spiritual quest of his own. He teaches Hayy language and speech and takes him back to society to attempt to elevate the masses. Anyone interested in Arabic or Islamic literature or in general spirituality should give this book a read. It is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puff Classic","review":"Puff and the Land of the Living Lies is a great video! Puff is a legend of children's cartoons.

When these commercials were made, NO ONE thought they would be of value any time in the future, so they didn't bother to maintain the prints. Complainers should instead be thankful they can see these commercials at all. Anyway, I am still working my way through the first disc of the set, and so far I've been very entertained, even though I did not grow up during the eras of these commercials. Some of the commercials are effective even today (I'd like to try Shasta soda pop, but it isn't available in Canada!), and others are quirky and/or unintentionally hilarious. This is a good DVD set to pull out when you have free time but not enough to watch a full-length movie - just select a category on any of the DVDs, and you'll be entertained for that short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"The numerous commercials contained in these DVDs provide hours of unexpected enjoyment. You'll soon forget that you're watching commercial after commercial as you delve deeper and deeper into a history of popular culture as expressed by the very raison d'tre of American television: commercials, after all, finance the shows that stations air to draw audiences that watch the commercials in the first place. The commercials are very well organized on each disc, and the collection of PSAs are both fascinating to watch as well as enjoyable. The quality of the commercials varies from decent to quite poor, but this can only be expected, considering the fact that commercials are generally considered disposable by the industry and are rarely preserved in the same way as television series are."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! Trip down memory lane and beyond","review":"This product, when considering the price (shop around and it can had for a very reasonanble price), is a time capsule of Americana. Much of the advertising in this collection is older than I am, so for me it's a look into the times my older relatives enjoyed.If you care to look into it as a document of our changing times over the past 60 or so years, here's a tidbit. A \\"Family Size\\" box of Cheerios weighed in at 10.5 oz. WOW! Today, that's a snack-pack.I won't get into much of the voluminous set, but I nearly wet myself with disbelief and glee at the PSA for VD from the early 70s. The PSA was a song called VD is for Everybody and showed regular folks - teachers, regular folks in your life, etc. and a catchy song about VD. That alone is worth the price of admission, folks.If you're at all curious about Americana and the advertising machine of a bygone era, this is worth your time and small investment.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I was eager to get these DVD's (3) and watch old TV commercials.The quality of the commercials is poor, even of the more recent commercials.The price was very low for all of these oldtime commercials, but I am still glad I ordered them.

NOT recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Many of the ads in the set are unwatchable and I can't believe they were included in this poor condition - blurry and the color is all distorted. And these were the ads from the 70's! Some of the ads I saw were regional and therefore would only have been seen by people who lived in that area. There were very few that I remember and I was born in the 50's. All in all a great disappointment and I wish I had borrowed this instead of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Purchased this for my husband as he gets a kick out of things like this.

I can forgive the graininess of some of these commercials, but the DVDs themselves are almost unplayable. 2 of the 3 discs wouldn't play in my friend's DVD player, all 3 make a huge buzzing sound in my DVD player, and disc 3 is so poorly indexed that it does not play all continuously, which would be nice for any retro parties you throw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Every time the commercial should be in color, it is horrible, red, fuchsia or orange. I grew up with these commercials. That's not how they appeared.

I would have given this product 5 stars but the picture quality on many of the commercials isn't that good-- I guess that's to be expected. Nothing here has even remotely been digitalized or enhanced in any way. These commercials have been sitting on dusty shelves in a basement somewhere since the last time we saw them, some over 50 years old. For the price it's definately worth it. I bought another series of old commercials last month and paid $25 for only 3 hours. Those exact same commercials are on these DVDs PLUS 13 MORE HOURS!!! One bit of advice if you buy this product...buy two sets. If you lend this out to a baby boomer you'll never see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too much for the money","review":"Okay, I made a big mistake with this set. I sat down and watched all 16 hours (!) in a day and a half. Not smart. Maybe an hour a day would have been better. But I couldn't stop myself.Obviously the quality varies. Some (especially the early color ones) are nearly unwatchable. But the gems outweigh the chaff. Or something.When you get multiple ads for the same product, they do get redundant. The cigarette category was especially bad in this regard.The good stuff though...WOW!!! The Flintstones selling cigarettes. The Three Stooges selling cigarettes. A (very) young Peter Boyle. More celebrities than I've ever seen on one dvd.Good ads, bad ads, funny ads. Ads I'd forgotten and ads I've never seen before. I was amazed with this collection.I've only seen 2 other collections of commercials on DVD and this set blew those out of the water. And at a better price.Highly recommended for tv history buffs or fans or just people wanting a reminder of a less frantic time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, hate it","review":"Lovely trip down memory lane but very poor quality in operation, often this is a problem on old-compilation discs. It sticks and jumps on the menu pages, refuses to play at all sometimes.

A wise man once said if we forget the mistakes of the past we are doomed to repeat them. And perhaps that is the point of this picturesque tale. The scenery is beautiful, but the advancing of the plot is contrived (throwing characters into the past as observers), and the whole exercise concludes -- unresolved -- as a smarmy, sordid little soap opera. Certainly, the sins of these characters' pasts come back to haunt them. But what do learn from that? In what directions do these characters grow? Little here worth sitting through except a fine performance by Irons and too little screen time from Ethan Hawke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skinhead Oi! at its best","review":"Pure British Oi!

I would suggest to the reader to also check historiographical works on early Islam by Hoyland, Crone, Cook, Ibn Warraq and particularly by B. Lewis and M.

Most kids videos of today don't focus much on these characteristics anymore... you know... feelings. This is why I love this video so much. If you've seen it then you know what I'm talking about.

I wanted to be able to \\"tinker\\" with it (in for a penny, in for a pound!) as in my younger years so I bought the Chilton's and this. To my surprise they are both the same. I don't mean they are alike, I mean they are the same book, verbatim!. Not what Haynes used to be, the quality of the phisical book and the quality of the information inside is not what I was expecting.

Bergman challenges the reader to review personal beliefs, reaffirm them and throw out frivolous ones.With obvious contemplations, Bergman reveals her own struggles with death by faith and reminds us of the importance of living by it.

Surprisingly, much of the album is quite listenable and melodic. \\"Martha\\", \\"Wild Tyme\\", \\"Watch Her Role\\" and \\"Two Heads\\" are pretty normal songs. Nothing really outrageous about those ones.The rest of the album is, however, pretty strange. It's also a pretty hard album to give a rating too, because all the experiments probably make it a tricky listen the first few times, but on the other hand, the songs that are melodic and memorable probably are some of Jefferson Airplane's best tunes.An album worth hearing, and possibly owning. It would probably be wise to save this album for last in your Airplane journey.

I liked reading their stories and felt good that some of these people had similar experiences to my own. I also liked reading about some of the mistakes that these filmmakers had made and I'm glad they were willing to share them so others might be able to avoid making the same ones.

The first one was a real disappointment, and I'd hoped that was just a fluke. This one has little to offer any normal cook or chef, seemingly aimed at people who have an unlimited access to seldom seem ingredients and a larger budget for food than most of us.

This one is different. The food is more 'home cook' rather than 'posh restaurant' but is still very impressive. A lot of hours have gone into the design work in the book. It contains 5 fast recipes for each - soups, starters, antipasti, salads, sandwiches, eggs, working lunches, pasta, shellfish, vegetarian, fish, meat, side dishes, fruity desserts, and creamy desserts, and then also includes menus for complete meals (including recipes) - light and healthy; morocco; country; italian; fish and chips; outdoor eating; mexican; easy for a crowd; tapas spread; cheap and cheerful; summer; indian; thai; sunday lunch and fast drinks party.

I don't have enough room in my kitchen for all the ingredients he wants you to have always on hand. I would certainly buy things to use in a recipe occcasionally, but a lot of things I don't think I would use again. The \\"well-stocked kitchen\\" things are mostly conventional, but I can't keep on hand several kinds of potatoes, several kinds of oils, several kinds of vinegar, and so on.

I find myself referring back to it year after year.The Zen-like Koans, quotes, and stories will have you contemplating the nature of the environment that you work in (if you work in Corporate America) and will probably provoke a chuckle or a wry grin many times through your read.You can read it in certainly less than an hour, and it is very well worth that expenditure of effort.It may also open your eyes a little wider when the universe unfolds in a particularly pleasing or expected manner..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen of programming is a piece of junk","review":"This book is not what I expected and certainly not worth $10.

I'm very pleased with my first 5 seasons, however season 6 is not like scrubs... My advice, don't buy it. They ran out of ideas, they repeat themselves, it is not funny anymore. Before I could not stop laughing at the adorable sarcasm, however this one is really dry. Oh, and what is the musical all about? The whole episode wasted on singing. Useless. As much as I love scrubs, I still regret buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrubs Season Six","review":"In its sixth season, Scrubs is still one of the funniest and most original shows on television. The single camera format lends itself to any number of creative concepts, stunts and gags that would simply be impossible in a traditional live studio audience sit-com. The cast and crew continue to take on unique challenges this season, including the critically acclaimed \\"My Musical\\" episode, with many inspired numbers such as the \\"Guy Love\\" duet and \\"It All Comes Down to Poo.\\"With that said, season six is not the strongest performance to date. Some episodes seemed a little mailed-in and predictable, and one begins to wonder by the end of the season if certain key characters have developed at all from the whiny and neurotic (albeit entertainingly whiny and neurotic) characters they were in season one.Still, the Scrubs library remains one of my most replayed DVD collections, and Season Six is no exception. Even a bad rerun of Scrubs beats most first run comedy these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing wrong with the show....but....","review":"Love the show and nothing wrong with the show itself.

So dissapointed....."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment for/from a die hard Scrubs fan","review":"The decline began with Season Five and only worsened with Season Six. What used to be about comic situations has gotten too wrapped up in storylines that center around interpersonal melodrama. Scrubs is not ER, nor should it attempt to emulate that formula. The gags are stereotyped around flat characterizations. The ironic thing is that the writers are attempting to add character depth, but that has never been the focal point of the series. JD's internal monologues are still a clever narration device, but don't expect many laughs from this season. In my opinion, the first four seasons rule supreme. These last two seasons, however, lack the clever creativity of the previous seasons. They have become gimmicky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like classic Scrubs, but still enjoyable","review":"In the sixth season of \\"Scrubs\\", it seems that the realism of the hospital setting and quirkiness of the show is not quite what it used to be. Still, the ongoing jokes and hilarious characters (especially the janitor) still bring a smile to my face. It's not one of the best seasons, but in comparison to the average sit-com it is still miles ahead of the pack. The relationships between the main characters on the show (and the hilarious supporting characters) have really grown over the last six seasons.For other \\"Scrubs\\" fans, I'm sure you are all happy to hear that there will be an eighth season aired on ABC which will supposedly return the show to its quirkier and realistic roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Well, the sixth and almost last season of Scrubs can be summed up in one word, AMAZING! Now, I've been a Scrubs fan since the beginning, so I'll say all the seasons are amazing, but after watching this one and seeing how everyone has grown so much over the past years, it can't be argued that this is by far one the best. Especially with the cliffhanger season finale, but in order to find out what that is, you must get it. So get it for yourself, give it as a gift, or just buy it for a stranger, but you must watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another evidence of the grandeur of Leopold!","review":"Once more the wizard of the sounds -Leopold Stokowski- returns again with his ineffable good taste and portentous imagination, to let us listen one of the most original proposals about the New World in years.Sibelius' Seventh is fantastic although it will never surpass the impressive performance of Beecham in the middle fifties. There is a lot of mesmerizing landscapes and formidable visions: you may consider this Op like an Epic Pastoral.If not for a classic version of Victor de Sabata in the early fifties with the New York Philharmonic, this would be the most sensual, elegant, scented, balanced, inspired and enraptured Bolero ever recorded.Absolutely recommended not only for hard collectors, but above all, for the new listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 15 reviews?

I don't remember that at all. I do remember really liking this album when it was released although I focused on one great song that none of the reviewers really comment on: Dixie Beauxderaunt.Dixie Beauxderaunt is really rocking and Dan Baird tells a hilarious story in it. I have put this one song on dozens of mix tapes over the years that I made for friends. I'll have to go back and rediscover the rest of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock & Roll with tongue in cheek","review":"This album is a lot of fun to listen too. While it isn't as cohesive as his second album \\"Buffalo Nickel\\" it is still a good album. He's got alot in common with Lynyrd Skynyrd or Steve Earle. While Steve seems to be a country artist that dabbles in rock and Skynryd a rock band based in country, Dan seems to be balanced in the middle. It's easy to dismiss him as a novelty song writer but his lyrics are a lot deeper then the funny word play of I Love You Period. On both albums he sings songs about the simple folk of rural small town America. They're usually white trash and slightly eccentric but always interesting. This isn't in my top five albums (Buffalo Nickel is) but it's still a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I was NOT impressed!!","review":"I bought this for my son, thinking it would be FULL of lullaby's, stuff I could sing or rock him to, I was wrong!!

How many times can my child look at the same ocean shot and still be entertained?! Not to mention, the age goes from entertaining little ones, to the kind of entertainment only a toddler would enjoy. And last, I'm sick and tired of having to fast forward through all of the stupid introductions before the video starts. They have to put the caterpillar clip on TWICE before the video starts.

This film pointed up the fact thatour democracy is eroding away due to lack of morals and ethics on theone hand and fear plus incredulity on the part of ordinary citizens.

That video totals upto 45 minutes of enjoyment for parents and toddler. This video on the other hand features all of 2 minutes of Elmo, Telly, Gabi and another child. There is not coherent plot -- i.e. while they start off with a video game premise, they just throw together all of the skits on numbers, and never have the muppets appear to actually lead in each script. After a while of random skits on half the numbers, Elmo or Telly makes a brief aimless appearance. And even stranger, there is an unexplained scary cookie chasing them. This approach quickly turns off both the parents and the toddlers who wait for glimpses of their favorite characters. Pass on it. AND the DVD version is made without any extras, such as subtitles, or sing-alongs etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor graphics and no continuity","review":"This is the first Sesame Street Dvd that our 16 month old actively dislikes.

But who are you buying the DVD for, anyway? This is definitely not the best Sesame Street video we have, but it does do what is supposed to do. My toddler was counting to 20 (not just 10...) in no time at all and she can even identify all the individual numbers. As for the giant cookie, am I the only one who finds charm in the sheer sillyness of that? \\"Look at the size of those raisins!\\" still cracks me up.The only thing that bugged me was toward the end when Zoe forgets what comes after the letter J. I really think it would have benefited the video if someone would have taken the time to edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak entry into the Sesame Street canon","review":"This math-oriented video is a fairly weak, late-edition Sesame Street product. Included are a couple of older (high-quality) numbers-oriented cartoons, such as \\"King Of Eight\\" and \\"Alligator King,\\" but they are surrounded by a ton of lesser material -- lame, later stuff that has an annoying quality that you don't expect from Sesame Street. Elmo and Telly are supposedly the stars of the program, but the feeble skits they are in (instead of doing or learning math, they mostly just get chased by a giant cookie) and most of the animation is also pretty brainless, even irritating. If you value the intelligence and good humor that was the Sesame Street trademark, this video will be a big disappointment... We watched it once, then I quietly tucked it away and took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review from a Dad of a toddler","review":"I strongly advise you against buying this DVD.This is by far the worst Sesame Street video that we have in our collection...My boy only sees the first two minutes in which Elmo appears, after that he totally looses interests in the video.Overall, don't buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Totally lame!

At the beginning of the cartoon, Lily (sp!) the kitten shows her Daddy her book that contains dots and the numerals next to it. When showned on the TV screen, it's like flashcards.As the cartoon progresses, Lily goes about town counting things from 1 till 20 (I won't give away the plot here).

I taught him to count to 10, and ever since he has been watching this video, he counts up to 16 now by himself! He really enjoys watching the movie, as does my 6-month-old daughter. I personally enjoy the DVD and its innocence. I like that it is simple yet captivating for them. It really holds their attention. I tend to be pretty particular when it comes to movies for my children, making sure they don't teach any bad habits and that it doesn't teach anything contrary to the Bible. I was very pleased to see there wasn't any reference to magic, fairies, etc, as many things tend to include such references these days. I am going to try out other Richard Scarry DVDs and hope that I will be just as pleased with them, too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-neglected subject, writes between scholarly and lay","review":"In the West, the history of Christianity almost never includes the east, and when it does, it stops at the Orthodox church. This book covers the history of the Assyrian church and churches further east. It is fairly readable, and tries to fill in the history of the surrounding regions as well. It changed my perspective of Christianity and gave me a better sense as to what in Christianity is essential.Some problems: some of the footnotes are used for irrelevant tangents, and the scholarly character drops from time to time. Also, the lists of kings and patriarchs should be an appendix, not scattered through the footnotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSING STUD ON POCKET","review":"Since these shorts are so nice and my husband Loves them so much he wore them as soon as he got them, there was a stud missing from the outside of left pocket.

Very soothing and relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent gift for Mother's Day","review":"This is the first CD by Joanne Shenanadoah that I have listened to. It contains such beautiful music. Here are some of the reasons why I urge everyone, especially women, to buy it: Each time I listen to it I feel so moved and so proud to be a woman. The beauty of these songs truly honors all women. The arrangements of these traditional Haudenosaunee-Iroquois chants and melodies by Ms. Shenandoah and Tom Wasinger evoke peace and wellbeing. And the liner notes are wonderful to read: each song is dedicated to one of Ms. Shenandoah's family members with a description of the qualities that person has which happens to fit the particular song. Such a wonderful and loving tribute to her family. As a Kiowa/Chickasaw woman I am pleased to be able to include this in my collection of native and powwow music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Haunting Sounds","review":"I bought this cd recently, and can't stop playing it. The Music is some of the most soothing, warm, conforting--this is the best CD. I have shared this CD with my friends and they agree the sound is beautiful. I would like to know the translation of the words, this I think would make it more meaningful. Sometimes you don't want to sing words that you don't know the meaning of (and I find myself trying to sing along). I wish Ms. Shenandoah would provide an interpretation of what they mean. I would recommend this to anyone who wants music to touch their heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"way cool","review":"I live much of the year in the great basins and ranges of NE California and W Nevada and transect the Sierra with great regularity so I listen to music in environments that range from FWD high desert canyons to FWD mixed coniferous forests and oak woodlands -- from gravel splattering roads and dust clouds to eight lane freeways. Everywhere I go, I find this music appropriate for where I find myself. Perhaps this is the greatest complement that can be given to music in general -- that it fits the spirit and the land. This has become one of my favorite CD's because it fits both the open skies and spaces of the high desert and the closed spaces and limited skies of forested woodlands. There is a peace in the music that extends to, and encompasses, the environment in which it is played. I highly recommend this CD to all those who journey roads seldom traveled.

It runs the gamut of styles, restlessly so, imaginatively so. Nels is in fine form and this is one of the best of his latest batch of recordings. Rainey is a great drummer (see his work with Tim Berne, epecially the Big Satan record), and Parkins who has played with everyone from Bjork to Zorn, is magical, adding in so many subtle layers of sound.

Never before has so much been pressed between the two covers of a book. This anomalous story is impossible to describe except to say it is a bizarre, emotional, spiritual, educational, and moving experience. What a wonderful fictitious tale, based on real-life events, which begin near the nation's capital. Such strong images of characters and places are evoked that it literally lets you bond and become emotionally entangled with the thoughts and feelings taking place in each event. The poetic license incorporated here is a great gift of the author...who is sometimes raw, sometimes very intellectual. His meaningful use of quotations at the start of each chapter adds an especially nice feel. A surprise ending brings the story full circle and makes things feel complete...like getting off a wild ride. I recommend this book most highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because you're an ER nurse doesn't mean you can write!","review":"While parts of this story are gripping, Mr. Deer's writing style is banal and linear. This is most certainly not literature, and episodes of \\"ER\\" or \\"Scrubs\\" are written equally well, if not better. Given the exciting subject matter, you can hardly help but be pulled into the book early. Once you make it through a few chapters, however, the stories becomes tired and thin. The sidetrack in the middle of the book comes off as preachy, not moving. And if Mr. Deer wants to be a writer, then he needs to have an editor! This book is so full of misspellings, typos, and incorrect grammar that it distracts the reader and detracts from Mr. Deer's credibility. I will pass on Deer next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your ....","review":"This book is a great read- quite a story, with humor, irony, wit and insights into the world of the modern American medical world, with sidetrips to World War II and the realm of dreams and visions.

Things sparkle, the world looks different after you read them; you feel more alive. I've never read a book quite like this in my life. I am about halfway through and I find myself reluctant to read on because I don't ever want to finish! Then again, these essays will probably continue to deliver upon second and third readings; they are so rich and refreshing, generous and infectiously exuberant. O'Grady weds highly specific familiarity with nature to a deep, sweeping historical knowledge. The result is precisely the opposite of \\"scholarly.\\" It's wild. And yet it's also ultimately friendly, perhaps even loving in a kind of impersonal, woodsy, ferocious way.

The Power Paw stopped rotating about 3 months in, so I took it apart, cleaned out the hair, and noticed a small piece had broken off the inside plastic piece holding in the roller. I had the plastic piece but didn't realize that's what it was until it stopped rotating again last week, and I found the plastic piece on the other side had a piece broken off. I tried to super glue one of the broken pieces back on (had to use tweezers to hold the small piece) but it wouldn't take. So now I either pay $16 for a new Power Paw or do without.

It's more rock-n-roll and it is an amazing release. It sounds like Lind locked himself in a room with old Springsteen albums and mixed them with old Blitz albums and out comes the \\"Dark Days\\" album.

On investigating, I found the entire model range has the same motor, the difference between models being features. Some of these are useful, some only costly-a matter of personal opnion and depth of pocket.

It was Heinlein, Asimov, and even some Piers Anthony.This book changed how I thought about science fiction. It says something, not only about the fictional world, but about our world. Instead of being about rough sketches of a characters to advance an idea, it's about a child growing up and finding out what his world is and what it means.At the same time... man, is it bleak. I recommend this book to everyone, but some people just put it down midway because they don't like the ideas that that world has to live by. It's not a book for kids, but that's why I loved it, and think it's a book that everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that makes you think and think hard.","review":"This is brutally realistic rendering of society as it could become.

Very well written with deep emotion, it involves you from the opening line and holds nothing back. This one should have won the Hugo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"When the title of the book says Absolute Beginners's guide it means it. The book does a good job of explaining the history of robotics, and describing the various types. But there is a definate lack of explaination when it comes to the robots them selves. Its simply \\"asseble part A with part B, then move on to C.\\" With no reasoning behind why you're doing it. In short the book does a poor job of teaching you robotics but instead is an exercise in how to follow directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I have read this book, and thought it was definitely well done. It explained the tools, supplies, and the knowledge you will need to be a competent robot builder. At the end of a book is a detailed list of books, magazines and web sites for where you can go from this book. The book was great, although the only thing I didn't like was that the three projects were hard to follow. I didn't quite understand all of the actions I needed to take, and these chapters lost me pretty quicky.Still, the book is great to get you going, and has an excellent amount of resources at the end, and I like the author a lot and hope to read another of his books later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bots to begin with","review":"This book is definitely reader friendly. It covers a broad range of topics, from the definition of the word \\"robot\\" to how to actually build robots and where to find robot-related resources online.

Plus there are plenty of photographs and diagrams throughout to entertain, as well as to illustrate various robots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"Cute book. If you want learn about the history of robots and to learn how to make only 3 of them then this is the book for you.The part list should be revised to include all parts used and recommended.

This book is hard to read. The material is straightforward but the author thinks that he is the next Benny Goodman. Like Benny Goodman, he never stops trying to squeeze in a joke. Unfortunately I never laughed at Benny's jokes or author's. If it weren't for the one liners, the book would be quite good. Humor is a tool best left in the hands of professionals. Perhaps the friends and family of the author can arrange an intervention.If you're under 16 years of age it's a great book.

So far that's worked pretty well.At HD the complete 3-light installation kit is usually the same price - or even cheaper! - than 3 bulbs, so I just buy the installation kit instead of the bulbs. Then 6 months down the road when I've collected 3 burned-out bulbs I swap them back into the installation kit and return the kit for a new one with three fresh bulbs.Sure, that's an ethically questionable practice - but so is labeling these bulbs \\"10,000 hours\\" when they barely last 1000."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Anyone who sells this junk should be ashamed.

The atmospheric setting enhances the intrigue, and the rekindled romance is ultra-passionate.

Knowing that their program was bound to be a hit, Valve took the idea running and spliced it into Half-Life, a game based on a combo of the Quake 1 and Quake 2 engines. It was lit like wildfire and Team Fortress Classic mania spread accross gaming circles. As the Half-Life engine grew older, people began to cry out for more, and thus, the idea for Team Fortress 2 was born. Unfortunately, this was over a year ago, and after several incarnations, Team-Fortress 2 is still being hammered together. While dedication to a product is a wonderful thing, I'm afraid that this will turn out to be another Daikatana 2. An aged engine struggling to new ideas of gameplay. In the PC gaming industry technology is updated as fast as light, and unless Valve wants to develop a new engine from now until eternity, when this comes out it will look and play like a two year old game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom does not use it.","review":"I followed the OT recommendation and order the weighted spoon for my 84 year old mother who has Essential Tremor.

I found out that there was plenty of theory for a 68 page book. The introduction is brief, and gets straight down to business. The examples are given in guitar grids and staff notation, so deciphering them wasn't a problem. The chords themselves are given in a lead sheet style. The only caveat is that it reads more like a manual than a well written book, and there are no examples on jazz patterns. So pianists can actually imbibe a lot of theory from this book and it has really helped me for comping.Other than that I think future publications can introduce other aspects of jazz theory to make it more complete for its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic music at its best","review":"The Black Angels are a local favourite of mine.

It took me almost two weeks to read this book becuase I kept wanting to put it down and read something with a little more...plot.The story basically follows along the same lines as the last two in this series did. Princess Meredith must get pregnant and beat her cousin Cel in order for her to win the throne. So, of course, she starts sleeping with everything -including demin-gods and goblins- in sight (who all just HAPPEN to be lusting after her). Sounds like fun, right? Wrong. There's lots and lots of sex.

I was so excited to get this book. I went home and curled up on the couch and read up to page 136 and started shaking my head. My husband asked, \\"is the book any good?\\" My response? I usually only give a book 50 pages. If it hasn't grabbed me I get rid of it. I read a lot and I don't have time to let a writer \\"slowly\\" pull me in. At page 136 this book had not only not grabbed me, it was boring me and I was having a hard time concentrating. I have read every book that Laurell has written. This and the last Anita book have been very disappointing to me. I will still read her, but I may not be as eager to pick the book up off the shelf and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic and Pulsating!","review":"This was definately a great read. I can honestly say I read the entire book in 3 days time. While the large amount of characters may have made it a bit difficult to follow, the explosion of emotions that the book spits out at you makes it worth while. The book is tense one. Many times, I found it to be an extremely erotic and pulsating experience.Meredith is quite an interesting character. As a female you can't help but be sucked in to wishing you were in her shoes. On an average day she has 5 lively, handsome, men at her side willing to please her in any way she wishes. Two at a time even. As the book unfolds she ends up with even more lovers. The men will leave you breathless, and wet.Although this is the 3rd book in the series so far it was the first one I've read. I am actually ordering the first two and the next one now. I'm hoping they are all as tingling as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I actually think I may like this series more than the Anita Blake series and that's saying a lot.

Then 2 days later I found the Seduced by Moonlight in the bookstores. Halfway through I had to check the cover and make sure I hadn't picked up the Cerulean Sins book again. Some of the dialog was Exactly the same. The \\"Take one for the team\\" phrase. Even some of the sex scene's looked like cut and paste.I say again I really liked the first books and look forward to more. I'd rather wait 2 years between books to get more substance, though. Like the other readers, though I'll check it out of the library before I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinking fast...","review":"Okay - we got the whole sex gig. Trying to get pregnant, much weird sex, yes we know already! Now the challenge is to write an interesting story without the soft porn crutch. I admit I have the problem of comparing any of Ms. Hamilton's recent works with her fast paced, full story of her ealier Anita Blake books. None of them will win a Pullitzer, but they were a good read. I could even deal with the sex she began to include because it moved the story along. Now the sex is the story with a few supernatural twists thrown in for filler.If you're into faery fornication - hey this book and all the Merry Gentry Books are for you. However, the sex is souless and even gets boring. There is a better use of my time and money. If you are mildly curious (and hopeful) take it out at the library first, then decide to purchase. I always reread good books, but I've never been moved to pick up any of these books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful Book!","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton has completely lost whatever talent she had. Her Anita Blake books continue to decline. And this latest Merry Gentry book is the worst. No story, no action, no plot, no personalites - nothing! Do not spend any money on this book. If you feel compelled to check it out (which I obviously did) check it out of the library! That's what I did. I vowed to never spend another dime on a Laurell Hamilton book even if I can't resist the temptation to check out her latest release. She once had a good imagination and could write a semi-decent story. Maybe she'll 'recover her power' and write another good book - someday. But this book is NOT it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same s---, different title.","review":"OK, I was almost reconciled to the sex-for-plot substitution. Almost. Both the Anita Blake and Merry Gentry books have headed down that path. But this time, I was more distracted by the annoying overuse of a couple of metaphors / similes involving having the moon inside someone, making them \\"glow\\". I think this was used several times in the same scene. At least in the same chapter. Hello, proofreaders and editors? Other faux pas were equally annoying, and made reading painful.When these books, starting with Anita Blake, caught my attention, they had plot, characters, snappy dialogue, and did I mention plot? If the entire Merry story arc were a week, this book would be a minute. Almost nothing happens to advance the plot, and it happens slowly.I won't be springing for a hardcover next time. Maybe not even a paperback <sigh>. I hate it when a good thing ends badly. As a friend said, \\"When the story is over, stop telling it.\\" Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Seduction is a Snooze","review":"This book is a very disappointing effort. Laurell Hamilton's two previous Meredith Gentry books were sometimes impressively imaginative, witty and erotic. All that seems to have disappeared from Seduced By Moonlight. Only at the very end of the book, maybe the last 50 pages or so (I'm guessing and in no mood to research how thin a section of book it was) does anything worth reading happen. None of the activity promised at the end of book two, except for the brief return to the Unseelie Court, takes place. We have to wait a few more years, apparently, to move Merry a week into the future. Pretty boring. And annoying. I hope Ms. Hamilton isn't turning into another one of those horribly frustrating authors who write multiple-volume novels where nothing happens for volumes and years. I don't think most readers will stick around that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of reading time","review":"What a disappointment to LKH fans, no story line, nothing making sense just sex and that poorly done.

What happened to character dynamics?Her earlier novels I couldn't put down. Her latest novels have been a great disappointment and I hesitate to waste my money on such garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Need a Chart for the Characters","review":"Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, Sex, Sex, and Guess what? More Sex","review":"I am a big fan of the Anita series and the Merry series, but instead of the twisting plots of earlier books... the only twisting going on is different bodies having sex.I don't feel that this book advanced Merry's story very much. There was a bit of character development, but that isn't enough to sustain a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex...filler...sex...filler...sex...DUEL...sex...end","review":"This was a let down from the other two stories in the series. In the two previous books there was actual plot. This one is just a lot of explaining about the laws of the Faerie Kind and then lots of sex but nothing else. I kept turning the pages waiting for forward story movement. And there was nothing. And Merry's life arc is coming perilously close to Anita's as she takes more people under her wing each book and gains bright new and shiny powers each book.Fine we know the Fey are very open about sex. I don't care about sex. Let everyone have sex! Just also let there be some kind of story that makes it worth my while. Where's Cel? Isn't Merry a detective? Why doesn't she solve cases? There was so much good set up in the previous books that this one sadly wastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I've read all of Laurell K. Hamilton's books so far, and this is without a doubt the worst. From her other books, I knew she was not afraid of using sex to move things along, but in this book she really neglected the plot for a bunch of gratuitous, unconvincing sex. I'm not a prude by any means, but Hamilton needs to realize that throwing something in the reader's face is not nearly as effective as teasing them with it. From the first page the characters lacked any personality (especially the males, they might as well be brainless robot sex slaves) and the story had little actual going for it. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of these books, if this is the way they are going to be. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you're a completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 chapters worth of plot-get this one at the library","review":"compared to the density of the first book about Merideth Gentry this one was hopelessly watered down.

However, the one thing that has really disappointed me *as it did in the anita blake series* is all the constant sex. I dont mind sensual books, occasional love scenes, or even a little raunchiness now and then but I feel like its getting to the point where the books are more and more about the sex the main characters are having and not about the actual characters themselves. Also the two series' are almost too much alike in the way that they are written at times. There are comments or even complete excerpts that resemble each other to the point where you could interchange them and barely tell a difference.

These books are soaked in sex, but somehow she manages to make it completely BORING. Also, her vocabulary is incrediby limited. In 15 minutes of listening, the phrase \\"my body\\" or \\"his body\\" was used 53 times!!! Very distracting... Get back to the story, we want to actually hear a STORY, not about how a Fae are equal and wearing fur is bad.Also-WTF? Why does she create all of these strong male characters and have them all start CRYING??? Doyle CRYING??? SERIOUSLY???

The men are beautiful, strong, magical, they haven't had sex in years, they get to have sex with Merry, we got that in the first two books - now give us a plot, action, suspense. The sex captured our interest in the first books but it's not enough to hold us for much longer. As a previous review stated, I'll check the next one out of the library before I write off Merry or spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROST FOR KING!!","review":"No matter what anyone says about this book is the best out of the series so far lets see if she can top this one!FROST FOR KING!!(even though he pouts alot!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got too bored by this","review":"I've read all of Laurell Hamilton's other works and enjoyed them tremendously. However, I found myself so bored by this one that I actually planned on washing dishes to get out of trying to finish this. I gave up after about 110 pages. I enjoy sex scenes as much as most males (I hope), but there was almost no action at all up to the point I surrendered. Too much space was wasted trying to catch the newer reader up to what has happened. I'm sorry that my feelings are such for a very good author but, at least this time, she struck out for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of Hamilton. But with that caveat, this was by far the weakest of the three Merry books (and of all of the Anita Blake books). Nothing much happens until the last 80 pages. The first half of the book is one sex/magic scene after another and really drags - it could have been condensed into two or three chapters. The second Merry book left off with the impending visit to the Seelie Court, and yet Hamilton cannot even get Merry there in the third book.Perhaps Hamilton has bitten off more than she can chew what with writing two series at the same time. This book suffered from some of the same infirmities as the last Anita Blake book (e.g. weak on plot, using sex as a filler, and too short). Here is hoping for better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a 14 year old?","review":"One of the most poorly written, pointless and boring fantasy novels I've ever had the pleasure of not finishing.

Don't waste your time or your money with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Seduced At All...","review":"Definately not enough meat to the story in my opinion. I kept reading, waiting for something to happen, for the story to form, and next thing I know the book was over! I'm usually a fast reader but this book only took me about 5 hours to complete. And all the new men...I had trouble keeping most of them straight because they weren't developed. I ended up with a lot of questions and more than a little frustrated. I'm hoping that Ms. Hamilton wrote too much and divided the book in two, because I would hate to think that shes losing her touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive, sexy and so appealing","review":"SBM is amazing, if low on action. There are scenes that are a bit bloody or graphic, if that offends you, don't read this novel. There is growth and development in the male characters, which seemed very important to me, most notably Rhys and Frost. New characters are introduced and there is a lot of setup for the following novels.No it was not action packed like the first two, but all the action that occured was very intense. If the scene in Andais' room didn't do it for you...you have issues. It was worthy of rivaling the best action movies, not to mention the ball...However, if you have not read the previous two books, don't read this one, it will leave you confused as Ms. Hamilton does not spend half the book recounting the previous two(very much appreciated!)I got the book tuesday and today is Saturday and I've already read the book back to back three times. Probably also due to the fact that I'm having Merry and Anita withdrawl symptoms..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, and another bites the dust","review":"*Cringes*I after Incubus Drams I swore to myself that I would never buy another. But I broke my own promise, and like a junkie. I took that inevitable 'hit' always searching for a glamourous tatse of the first few (the first five books of the Anita Blake series), and of course this one fell short.It was so boring, the summaries of these books promise some serious metaphysical (...) whoopins. But what we ended up with was a bad preternatural soap opera. Come'on Meredith, are you the future queen or a fluffer in a (...) movie? The rising action was decent, the climax was garbage. The male characters were hot, as they always are with LKH. But they were too touchy feely with each other. It was really distractiong from the story line. The falling action was decent, but the ending reminded me of that bad Peggy-lee song (atleast I think it was Peggy-lee) \\"Thirteen men and me.\\"I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My advice to you, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"This book drags on forever. If your a sex fiend, this is the book for you, if not, then stay away! It is soft core porn the whole way through. Meredith repeatedly has sex with most of the men she comes into contact with. The charactors are hard to remember, there is just so many of them. The book was hard to get through, and each event in the story felt like it lasted forever. I am a big fan of Laurell K. Hamilton, but it seems as if this series is going nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I don't think the sex content was over the top at all. Most of her books run on the risqu�� side of things, but that shouldn't come as a surprise. The romantic interludes are not just thrown in wherever they would fit, rather in connection with character development. This book is more of a teaser for the next in the series. It introduces more secondary characters (most of which are in her harem) while giving a background history along with reasons for why Merry will be driven to action in the next book. While tagging along with the plot take some time to notice the amount of mythology that is integrated throughout the book. Laurell really did her homework. So while you're wrapped up in those steamy scenes you're getting a good dose of pretty accurate mythology to boot. It's about time we got some strong female characters that aren't all willy-nilly about their sexuality. I say great job Laurell, another excellent read! I would highly recommend it. Wouldn't change a thing :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum.","review":"I rarely do not finish a book that I've started reading, especially if it's one by an author that I like. I just could not finish this one. Hamilton used to be one of my favorite authors, but not any more. Too much sex, not enough plot, and too much of what Merry doesn't know but everyone else around her does know and has to explain. Substitute \\"Anita\\" for \\"Merry\\" and you've got my feelings on her latest Anita Blake novels, too.Such a shame to see a good author degrade her work to this level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story packed with sex","review":"I really like this series, this book particularly left me hanging as there is not a definite ending, it's more of a to be continued. However, this series is known to all Laurell K Hamilton fans to be where she really started writing what I would call erotica. The Anita Blake series didn't start out with as much sex, but definitely have been giving Merry Gentry a run for her money in that department.Honestly, if you are into erotica, this series has a great and interesting story to it that makes the sex scenes actually make sense and fit within the storyline. And these are honestly some of the best sex scenes I've read.One warning, reading these books will wear out your significant other as they definitely are arousing. My husband loves it when a new Laurell K Hamilton book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"seduced by moonlight","review":"this book was poorly written and very hard to follow, it was boring and very hard to finish and was totally usless in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleah...","review":"As a huge fan of Anita Blake and the Vampire series, I was thrilled that a brand new series was starting. Hamilton has such a vivid imagination; one really begins to believe in her alternate worlds. In the Merry series, however, imagination is left behind for a plodding series of sexual escapades with multi-colored partners. If it moved the plot and was intrinsic to the story line (as with Anita Blake), then I am all for it. But this is just dull, dull, dull. Even the sex is dull, once you realize every scene is the same. There is truly no plot at all (actually, what amounts to plot could be handled in about 15 pages, making it great copy for a comic book). Please - spare yourself the expense and check this thing out of the library if you must. But don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Plot?","review":"I have to say I was somewhat disapointed with this one. I *LOVE* the other Laurell K. Hamilton books. Usually they leave me eager for the next book, and wanting more. This book was the exception.Oh, there's lots of the usual graphic details and yummy bits, but the actual *PLOT* doesn't hold it together.

I don't read a book so 6 pages can be dedicated to somebody's sex life and then 2 to the plot. That's not what I read for. Other people must, because there are a whole heck of a lot of good reviews out there.One more book, Laurell, and then I'm through with you.

On my walker it doesn't rest comfortably the cross bars, so at any given moment, it may angle forward or may angle back, allowing things to slide off the tray.

I thought I had measured correctly for my walker. When it arrived, I found the tray fit over the bars accurately, but it would not lie flat. Thus, the tray slanted anytime it was even lightly bumped. Therefore, it was relatively useless for anything other than light weight, non-spillable objects. Also, keep in mind that the tray will block your access to placing one's body in between the bars of the walker;consequently, if the walker is needed for anything other than balance (taking one's weight off an injured leg), the tray will also prove unusable. The tray itself is fine and should last a long time.

The first two adult books I remember reading, besides the Bible, was the complete O'Henry and Sherlock Holmes. It was interesting to find writers here with similar experiences to mine--in particular, K.C. Constantine and his school problems. Of the writers in this volume (Robert Barnard, Rex Burns, Constantine, Dorothy Salisbury Davis, Michael Gilbert, Donald Hamilton, Joseph Hansen, Tony Hillerman, Reginald Hill, James McClure, and Robert B.

Yet, I found one flaw was very disappointing: The CD sound has a strange tinny quality in several of the songs. Something is just off. The music doesn't sound as compelling with this small, but noticable change.I have absolutely no rational explanation for why someone would change the sound mix from what worked in the original recordings. I don't know if it was done intentionally or on accident, but clearly, something has been changed just slightly in several of the recordings. \\"Fight the Power\\" is the most notable example.I feel sad, like someone drew a moustache on the Mona Lisa or chipped off the nose of George Washington's face on Mount Rushmore. Why would someone mess with perfection?"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't truss it","review":"let's just forget about all the fun that is flavor of love. forget about the roast of flavor flav. this is the real deal. chuck d has a sound all his own that no one else can touch. i rolled up to a local place with this on and people asked who the new artist was, all i could do was shake my head and break the news to them. this is what rap should be and needs to be again. you can play this over and over it doesnt lose it's appeal. so if 911 IS a joke in your town and you just can't truss it, quit tryin to find your old cassettes and buy this boooooyyyyyeeeeeee."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the F? What happened to the profanity?","review":"While it's nice to finally have a Public Enemy Greatest Hits collection and it sounds much better than the original CDs mastering, why do you have to bleep the bad words? Or should I say BEEP! them out. Fortunately there is only a couple instances of profanity used on these classic songs, but when you hear a beep instead of the original word it's very jarring to the ears. Hopefully the first four albums will come out remastered very soon and they can atone for their sins. Even with this flaw it is an excellent collection showing why Public Enemy was #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud Funny","review":"Note: The scene that reviewer Steven Morgan mentions, about the protagonist meeting a girl via a note in the trashcan, isn't in this book. The trashcan scene involves something else entirely, and it's a powerful scene.I had to ask my husband to quit reading this book in bed, because he was laughing and keeping me awake. That made me want to read it, and I see why he thought it was so entertaining. If you've ever been to grad school, you'll feel a sick sort of fascination for the world Heddle so vividly describes. I was also interested to learn more about the politics of physics.Well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The History of the Book in Canada now has one awful addition","review":"This book is the worse; a shoddy, simple, listing of the books published in Canada. There is no insight that is not insipid. There are lame attempts to connect the history of publishing to the growth of reading, but beyond that obvious theory, there is a whole lot on nothing. Academically this book is bankrupt. There is no scholarship, no passion, nothing. And the monies given in grant to complete this project should be considered given in bad faith. What a waste. Hollow, pompous and dull! The history of the book in Canada now has one awful addition. Avoid at all costs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel!!","review":"This was the best Halloween sequel out of them all! 'Halloween' was a better movie, but personally I liked 'Halloween 2' much better. I'm a gore person. I like gore, and believe me, this movie had plenty of it! And is it just me, or did Jamie Lee look really good in this movie? The best quality of this movie is how it picks up just seconds after the original ended. The acting is pretty good, and the atmosphere is great. A must see for all Halloweenies."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!!","review":"This movie is very cool. Unlike most sequels, this one takes place right were the first one left off. It's really spookyand one of the best slasher films ever made.The Micheal Myers mask improvedfrom the previous movie.The movie itself takes place in a hospital were Micheal Myers goes after his sister. There is a very exciting scene that takes place in the hospital bath. This one was the best of the series, it is worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS ONLY FOR TERROR IN THE AISLES!!!","review":"Halloween 2 isn't a bad movie but the real treat is that we are FINALLY getting Terror in the Aisles on a digital format.

I recommendthis for your horror collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"HALLOWEEN IS BACK","review":"Amazing, I love this film. It feels like the first one, but different surrounding. Halloween 2 is a classic and is one of my favorite horror films.The shape is searching a hospital looking for his sister. If you are new to the series, I won't spoil it. Check it out if you like the first one, then again who doesnt like the first one.The only problem I had with this film, is it felt like Friday the 13th at some parts of the film. There is a scene with a cop being scared by a cat. Reminds me of the beginning of Friday the 13th part 2, with the cat scare. Other than the little things, it is a classic. If you love Halloween check it out. After this film, the series takes a huge nose dive, but is brought back to life with H20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame, shame.","review":"This is no where near as good as the 1st one. This one kind of ripped of Jason. Jason is a possed fat dude with a hideous face (probably his father) and can't be killed because Jason and his mom want revenge! In Halloween II, Michael Myers seemed alot like that. Kind of a smack in the face after the amazing original. Basically if any film has a seuel, or is going to be re-made, it'll [be bad]! Unfortunately Hollywood never learns, and now they are doing the unthinkable, REMAKING THE SCARIEST SLASHER OF ALL TIME!!THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE! Why won't they learn! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm saying this, because I heard rumors about a Halloween re-make, and I hope and pray to God that it isn't true! Hollywood you [are bad]! See the first Halloween, and the first one only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST as good","review":"This takes place immediately after H1 with Michael stalking his sister in the hospital.

This is Jamie Lee Curtis' last role before H20 (17 years after this movie). This movie relies more on really nasty murders (not just with Michaels knife) as opposed to suspense, and spine tingling terror of the first movie. I believe horror movies that go on suspense far outweight those that have to show graphically intense needles in eyes, people boiling to death, etc. These things can be done, but Halloween 1 did it with class. There is not the same class here. I believe it was going against the Jason movies at this time and of course we know those are absolutely nothing but plotless gore flicks. I give it two stars SOLELY for the fact they continue the plot by introducing the fact Laurie Strobe is in fact, Michaels sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP! This is a total scam. You are NOT getting a blu-ray in this box","review":"So I was really happy to see this set come out with both the film and TV version all in one set.

The TV version is on DVD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I am really only buying this version to get the TV version on blu-ray and I get a DVD.DO NOT BUY THIS if you are expected to get both versions on Blu-ray.For the price tag I have to say I have been totally ripped off and scammed by Shout Factory.

I was so hyped for the sequel and after I saw it I wanted my money back. Jamie Lee Curtis wearing a really bad wig. The acting is horrible.

Donald Pleasance repeats the same lines over and over. Every kid in the movie wears the same Halloween mask as the killer. I didn't know the mask was so popular.

Wait for a box set or until they make a special edition and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel became what the imitators are","review":"Halloween II left off exactly where the first one ended, and that is pretty much it. While the first one is a stunningly well crafted SCAREFEST, the sequel degenerated into a typical gorefest. Instead of carrying on the tradition set by the first one, Halloween II only succeeded in doing what countless Halloween clones have done: In lieu of skillful filmmaking to create a sense of terror, it instead relied on grossing out the audience. We have Michael Myers stalking the halls of a hopsital in which it seems that Laurie Strode is the ONLY patient.Fine. Some people like gore. But I'd much rather like a well crafted movie. And like Friday the 13th and the Nightmare on Elm Street films, Halloween started out as a good movie which eventually turned into an endless series of inferior rehashes which ultimately parodies itself. As far as I am concern, Halloween II should have been the last of the series. Okay, maybe Halloween H20 should be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Halloween was much better!!!","review":"In my opinion this is a very stupid and unrealistic sequal I mean I know for a fact that there is more then about 10 people working graveyard shift at the hospitals!!!There are always the same amount of people!!!And in this movie there is hardly any hospital staff and it relies to much on killing...I was highly disapointed with this movie it did not at all meet up to my expectations and they were not very high either...The acting was good and that's the only thing that kept me from rating this movie any lower...Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job as usual.!And that guy who wants her is quite charming,in this sequal you find out Michael the reason Michael Meyers wants to kill her is because he is her brother..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not so good sequel of a classic movie.","review":"Halloween 2 has to be the worst way that they could have continued the story. Jamie Lee has hardly any lines, and the new characters just don't match up to the ones in the original. This movie had the potential to be fantastic, but they blew it with the setting. I don't know where, but they could have easily set it somewhere else. Also, this movie is gore galore, {The Hot tub scene!} It just does not do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a sequel","review":"Many horror movie sequels arent even worth watching,but this one is an exception. It takes off right from where the first one left us and immediatly kicks into the murder and mayhem that Micheal Myers is good for. They take Laure to the hospital for her wounds and Micheal follows them to the hospital with Dr Loomis hot on the trail. This film has all the suspense that the first one had ,but it just didnt have that scary atmosphere to it,the first one was a very dark film,the second one is shot in a hospital which is scary in itself, but not like the dark streets of Haddonfield. This movie had a little more violence it it than the first one and a little more profanity. Rated R for mild violence, strong language,A scene of sexuality,and partial nudity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the extras???","review":"AMC showed Halloween 2 for the Halloween season and the vesrion they showed was COMPLETELY different from the theatrical version. There are lots of extra scenes and extended scenes. Why aren't they on the DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bog Average Slasher","review":"This flick doesn't hold up as well as it did thirty years ago. Back when I was an impressionable undiscrimanating seventeen year old the body count was good enough for me. It was also pretty cool watching it with an urban audience who shouted at the screen imploring in vain for the victims not to open door or closet. Now it's no better or worse than any knockoff of the classic original \\"Halloween\\". Events take place on the same evening as the original but it's more preposterous. They open things up by having the action set mainly at a hospital but that makes it more ludicrous. This has to be the darkest most sparcely staffed hospital I've ever seen. Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the original but that only adds so much cred. Proceed if you must but be prepared to be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SEQUEL BUT SHOULD'VE BEEN THE LAST","review":"THIS WAS A GREAT SEQUEL, IT'S GOOD THE WAY THEY STARTED IT AFTER MYERS WAS SHOT DOWN BY PLEASANCE IN THE FIRST ONE.

I could name several other problems with the movie, but I think I'll go back to watching the original Halloween and the other sequals. Do you have to say anything about what I said about this movie?

It wasn't as good as the first one but it was a good attempt to try and make it as scary. I really like how they made it start out with the end of Halloween and continue from there! The first time I watched this movie I had a stomach ache (not a good idea) so i didn't really like this movie because it was a little more gory than the first. But when USA Network showed the week of Hallween, I loved it! SO it is pretty good, but not as good as the first. Oh, and here is an answer to someone's review i read: Watch this movie and you will find out why Michael is Laurie's brother. I didn't understand it at first either but then i saw this BEST SEQUAL!

First of all youn see micheal myers way too often which takes away the suspense too soon in the movie. Plus I felt that the supporting cast's acting left something too be desired as well it was horrrible. I felt that the only thing that saved this movie was DONALD PLESANCE and JAMIE LEE CURTIS'S performances in thier reprised roles from the first movie if they hadn't been in it this movie, it would have been disastorus so all in all I can't really recommend HALLOWEEN 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic scary movie!","review":"A must have for the horror classic collection.

This movie picks up directly from the first. the movie makes sense. Compared to the first halloween, this movie was a bit to gory. One of the reason's why was due to the competittion with Friday the 13th movies in the early 80's. Halloween 2 was still scary and since most of the movie took place in a hospital it made the movie very spooky. The movie had an exiting ending. Unfortunately This Halloween movie besides the original and H20 are the ones worth to watch as far as the series is concerned. This movie is something decent for non-horror fans.

It's pretty sad that the Halloween 2 dvd never had these dust scratches but the blu ray does! How is blu ray suppose to stay on top with all the mediocre releases they have put out. If I just bought blu ray and saw this picture next to the blu ray of Christmas Vacation I would of said I was ripped off to no end!

I used to love it growing up because I was accepting what I was seeing at face value. When I forced myself to sit down and write a script for a video review of it, I found myself looking closer, and what I saw I liked less and less. The plot holes in this movie are gigantic, and for reasons unknown to me, no one else notices them. Is it because \\"Halloween III\\" was that much worse that this one looks so good in comparison? I guess. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween II","review":"Halloween II picks up exactly where Halloween left off. It starts with a recap of the originals ending. Survivor Laurie Strode is sent to the local hospital where she is put to sleep and remains drugged for what little time she is on the screen. The main part consists of Michael Myers killing various hospital employees and Dr. Loomis's search for him. This movie is necessary in order to understand future sequels. It reveals that Laurie is Michael's sister, though writer John Carpenter admits this point came to him late one night when he had a bad case of writer's block. Halloween II contains a lot more blood and gore and feels like a regular crazy guy kills people film. From what I know, the older Goodtimes dvd, which I bought for five dollars, contains much of the same as the new Universal twenty dollar dvd. The new disc contains a new anamorphic transfer (enhanced for widescreen TV's) and a theatrical trailer, which is not very good accorging to dvdreview.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated sequal looks and sounds great on DVD.","review":"Halloween II picks up exactly were the original leaves off. If you are a fan of gory horror movies where plot isn't everything, then I believe you will have a good time watching this movie. Only good sequal to the original other than H2O. Only dissapointment on DVD is that the only added bonus are a few paragraphs of production notes, there is no theatrical trailer included. The sound and picture quality (and low price) make it a worthwhile buy for any fan of the film. In letterbox format for the first time on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the First Halloween!","review":"I thought Halloween 2 was an enjoyable movie to watch, but it was pretty stupid the more I think about it. Instead of Micheal hiding in the shadows he was always seen walking around. The overuse of blood was so opposite to the original. I still recommend this for a good scare or a good flick to watch on Halloween night."},{"rating":"1","title":"good not great","review":"this was an okay follow up. the main promblem is the shape is not creepy enogh. john carpter has said that they only used a stunt man to play him in this instad of a real actor like in part one. overall it has some good parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, So...","review":"The first was a classic. Even Rodger \\"I hate Horror\\" Ebert had to admit it. This is one you have to see if you're a fan of the series -- I mean you have to know what happened the rest of the night, right?? But the execution of the film was pathetic. The sharp sounds of the relentless original score is changed to a farty synth version. And all in all, it is just a generic blood fest. I think the only true sequels to the Original Halloween are this one, and the H20, but this is definately the weakest one of the three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Sucky Sequels Batman!","review":"Of course nothing can compare to the original, but they could have at least made an effort with this one. Slow and meandering with yawn-inducing kills, even part 3 is better than this!This really is a real paint by numbers job that just doesn't make sense. Not that the first one didn't have plot holes, but this thing makes it look like The Shape himself wrote the script and knew where everyone was going to be ahead of time. That or he's a real good guesser, \\"Oh, Laurie must be at the hospital, even though I was busy killing some random girl down the street when the ambulance took her away...\\"I know we suspend our belief with horror movies, but why didn't he just go to Laurie's hospital room and kill her?

This so-called sequel stinks and it can't hold a candle to the original (of which I'm a great fan and could \\"sing its praises\\" until doomsday). Put simply, it should never have been made and John Carpenter's heart was never really into making a sequel to his inspired 1978 film. Just read film critic Roger Ebert's reviews of Halloween and Halloween 2 for a proper assessment of these two movies. As he says, \\"It's a little sad to witness a fall from greatness, and that is what we get with Halloween 2.\\" Probably the only thing worthwhile about the DVD is the audio commentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review #001","review":"This movie was probably the worst sequel I've ever seen.

It cost another 112.00.Third (and probably most important) it is very, very noisy. The information from Generac says the unit sounds like a car at idle and has a decibel rating of 59 at 50% use. Not true. The car they used for the test must have been a muscle car!Getting the parts was a hassle as well as expensive. The fact it didn't have a regulator is just WRONG.

I'm a bass player, and I constantly seek players with a new approach to the instrument. Kai Eckhardt does some of the most magnificent things on the basslines.

Flame's ability as an artist is clear to hear, but frankly it is his lyricism that wins the day setting him apart from the crowd. In this album you find a win/win combo of the rhythm and rhyme mostly missing these days in the rap scene.There's no question the musical quality is top notch but in this album battle rap style meats Christian philosophy and worldview pulling no punches as song after song challenges common assumptions and modern issues prevalent in American culture, be it money, the idea of truth, or real faith/spirituality.I recommend this album to anyone, Christian or not, and further, the whole body of this artist's work.However, for those of us who enjoy rap with meaning in the words that harks back to the days of rap's birth, yet with a clear and concisely spoken Christian message this album is a must have.I only wish more examples of this level of quality art were around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flame by Flame","review":"I believe this is the first cd he has released. As with all his other music, he mixes up slow with upbeat, but he is always real about his message. He's not a preacher, but he sure could be! We met him for the first time about a month ago. He is very down-to-earth, and he doesn't do this music for lots of money or fame. He knows that his gift is to be used to spread the Gospel, and tell it he does, unashamedly! I hope that this wonderful man gets the acknowledgement he deserves, because he is following his calling for God's glory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Of God","review":"The words of this CD reflects the heart of this artist.

It WAS interesting, but I found Shropshire's smart-aleck style of writing so annoying that I couldn't finish the book. Some of it was so smarmy and self-consciously 'witty' that I wanted to throw the book across the room. Many of the anecdotes ARE humorous, but not enough to make me recommend this book. The entire tone is like a smart-aleck sports article, which, of course, is what Shrop makes his living writing. I think part of the fault lies with the editor, because there are some good stories in here--Billy Martin, Whitey Herzog, etc. Parts of this would probably make a decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book flames out worse than David Clyde's career","review":"I'm a life long Rangers fan, but this book was weaker than I had hoped. I was hoping for a great read. It showed promise early, but then flamed out much like Ranger's rookie phenom David Clyde in 1973. Shropshire spends more time trying to be witty and failing than he does in writing well about these teams or their characters. In fact, the 1974 team had the Cy Young runner-up (Fergie Jenkins), the MVP (Jeff Burroughs), and the AL ROY (Mike Hargrove.) The club also finished in 2nd place. Only an old drunk like Shropshire could think of them as the worst team in baseball. Ultimately, Shropshire tries too hard and too often to be another Jim Bouton in Ball Four (he goes on and on about his drinking), but he strikes out. Phil Rogers's \\"The Impossible Takes A Little Longer\\" is a better book about the Texas Rangers and their history (both good and bad.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he live thru the same years I did?","review":"I have to question whether Mr. Shropshire was even in Arlington Texas anytime during these years because I seem to remember things a bit differently. Of course, I wasn't looking thru the bottom of glass when I saw the Rangers play, perhaps that's the difference. In 1974, the Texas Rangers made a serious run at the American League West title, owned at the time by the powerful Oakland A's. Mike Hargrove was AL Rookie of the Year, Jeff Burroughs had an outstanding year and Billy Martin was doing what Billy Martin did best. Winning. If that is the worst team in major league history, all teams should hope to be so bad. Sure, Mr. Shropshire has some funny comments about some off the field goings on (what he could remember I suppose), but I would have to say this book probably belongs on the fiction shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Texas Strangers","review":"The Texas Strangers--that's what the Lone Star State called the team in the 80s. And despite making the playoffs a couple of times recently (only to be swept by the Yankees), the team's legacy of frustration, futility, and fumbling continues to this day. What _Seasons_in_Hell_ succeeds in doing is reminding everyone old enough to remember just how much progress the Rangers have made.Once you accept how bad the Rangers were, this book becomes delightful, and in some cases, laugh-out-loud funny. Hearing Whitey Herzog's evaluations of his charges are hilarious; Shropshire's account of Ten Cent Beer Night in Cleveland should be required reading for any student of the game. This book is not literature, but is a first hand look at the underbelly of the game of baseball as played by the underdogs--sort of like a cross between Ball Four and Hunter S. Thompson.A perfect introduction to the \\"culture\\" of baseball."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Group!

I had heard some buzz about this, too, which is why I decided to buy it. IT IS EXCELLENT! I read it in two sittings and it is evocative of the kind of smart, well-written thrillers that come along too infrequently -- a bit more like LeCarre than a lot of the two-dimensional pulp that seems popular today.

I wouldn't normally take the time to write a review but this album has moved me to wax poetic. It is far and away the best guitar album to come along in years. I guess it's been out for a few years but it still sounds totally fresh. The guitar playing is brilliantly executed and highly innovative, while possessing a deeply soulful quality. His solo guitar pieces sound like a cross between Michael Hedges and Tuck Andress (of Tuck & Patty) yet completely original. The ensemble pieces have find Heines weaving hypnotic guitar textures into fresh arrangements that are full of delightful suprises . i.e. a sample of Pygmy voices, cellist David Darling , and vocalist Vicki Randle of the Tonight Show Band. The real clincher is even my wife likes this album. The first time we have a consensus in years. Anyway, I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound!

What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie","review":"I bought this (DVD version)for the grandkids, and am I glad I previewed it! The plot involves the bigotry of a caucasian community focused against a Native American child. I certainly don't want to be the one to introduce my grandchildren to this dark concept and time. (It is set in the 19-teens.) Perhaps when they are older, and can see it as history, but there are many better films. There is a scene of violence and bullying which I would not want young children to see. The horse dies - this will not please young viewers. This film is old - the color is bad, and it was filmed before people started trying for an appearance of reality. The \\"horse trainer\\" who befriends the boy is completely inept around the animal (an Arabian). Perhaps he had to be to make the obviously gentle horse seem threatening. I can think of no other reason. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but does not whistle","review":"We purchased one of these and really liked it until about 2 weeks later, when the whistle became very quiet and within a few days it stopped whistling at all! We returned it for another one, took it out of the box, and it barely whistled. It looked like steam was escaping from the lid at the top of the kettle. We researched kettles for some time before deciding on this one, and were very happy with our old Revere kettle, which died after several years (due to user error). We've tried this one and one other Revere model, and unfortunately we're back to the drawing board again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing - not the kettle I remembered","review":"We had an earlier version of this kettle in my childhood home - a big heavy workhorse that easily handled a family of seven. This one is smaller, lighter-gauge, and has an unfortunate dribble issue when pouring out the boiling water. It also has a kludgy fill-cap that gets harder to operate as the minerals that remain in the water, even after filtering, collect on the circular opening and cap (visible in image under the handle), making it a real chore to open the thing to fill it. The trigger mechanism on the spout, that is supposed to stay in the 'up' position if you want, often doesn't stay there. Overall, a disappointment. I'm waiting for one of my kids (or me, in a rare inattentive moment) to overboil it or melt the spout or somehow damage it so I can justify replacing this rather expensive and lesser kettle. Revere Ware just isn't a guaranteed brand any more, not since they started using cheaper materials and producing most of their items in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistle broke within month","review":"I had a similar experience to another poster here in that the whistle stopped working a very short time after purchasing. The problem appears to be with the fit of the easy fill lid. It allows steam to leak - which doesn't allow enough pressure to build up behind the whistle at the spout. I've also noticed a crack in the plastic below the spout on the front - which has appeared in the last week (no steam is coming from there).I have a 5 year old easy fill kettle that worked fine until it's untimely user-caused demise - so I'd say that there is something wrong with a particular batch of these produced in the last year or so that has ill-fitting lids and construction not up to Revere's usual high standards. AVOID the trouble and get a different Revere kettle without the easy fill lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Rust?","review":"Very nice kettle.

I quit taking Goat's Rue for 2 weeks though and production went down, so I'll always keep it stocked from now on. It is true that it increases breast tissue from the way my clothing fits.

I am a woman who usually wears between an 8 1/2 and 9 shoe size. Size 7 fits me perfectly in men's. Trust me I tried on the 7 1/2 at the store and they were just too big, which is weird because 8 1/2 in women's has never been too big for me. If anything I have to go UP to a 9. Oh yeah-if you couldn't already tell- I am a freak about buying things so I looked like every possible physical store and online place and at the time these were the best bang for my buck as a starter skate.

Funny, tense, entertaining troughout. Frazer Hines' narration is very good, it's clear how much he enjoyed the series, so he gives his best to make the final product the best possible. The sound effects are very effective, specially that of a heartbeat when something's going to happen. The cast is impressive.

The content and structure is fresh and not a rewrite of material for earlier versions of SQLServer that appends new product features. The Developer's Guide is especially well-suited to someone, like myself, who does not have a previous investment in older SQL applications but is ready to bring SQLServer 7 onboard now because it will be easier to use and its applications will be customizabile with Visual Basic.

Also, look closely at the picture of the lens. It is a 28 x 90, not the 35 x 80 that is advertised. Just try to find that lens with this body for this price anywhere else. The 28 makes a BIG difference for your indoor shots. I hope I don't have the problems Craig Prater wrote about in his review.

In July, the pictures started to develop a gray hue and it was barely noticeable until September when it was evident there was a problem. Looking back at my photo album, I now see the gradual grayness in the photos. I sent it in for repair, as Canon honored the warranty. It took a couple of weeks turn around time.

After the game was over I watched it again off the 3575's hard drive. The picture on the screen was in 16:9 filling the HDTV screen completely. The quality of the picture seemed almost as good as the live picture had been. So, I'm impressed. I'd actually rate the unit at 4 stars but I can't seem to make that change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVDR - Works With Slingbox","review":"I've had the Philips 3575H/37 for about 8 months and found it to be a very capable recorder.

I receive all my local digital channels with an external antenna but can't seem to receive some 60 miles away. There analog versions are watchable but not digital. (May try a booster in the future).

The one I got had poor tuning. Of the four Major Network local stations one was so snowy that it was useless. Of the four indipendent station it completely missed one and the other three were marginal. The remote has to be held within 2 feet of the of the unit for it to function and then it is hit or miss.From the various reviews that I have read it seems that this is consistent. If you get a good one great ... if you get a bad one them to bad. Phillips/Ploaraid evidently have abandoned all semblance of any kind of quality control program. Wallmart is the only national chain that carries this unit ... perhaps this is the reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVR","review":"I purchased this DVR after much research on hard drive DVR's.

The picture qualityis outstanding and the tv tuner in the unit is very good. I have been using it with standard cable but wanted to be ready for the change to digital and this unit is ready for that. The only reason I did't give it5 stars is that the manual poorly written and hard to use. It takes a little time playing with the remote and studing the manual to understandhow it is programed.

I have an antenna and no plans to move to cable or satellite and my antenna works just fine. I've been using VCRs, but to continue using them you have to have a decoder box for each one set to a single station. Expensive and annoying. All I wanted was a digital TV recorder so I could continue to record and watch programs at my convenience. Well this unit does just that. I had no problems setting it up. It was easy to program to record -- just like my VCRs. You can record while watching another program, and recording quality is very good even at lower resolution. This unit was exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips DVDR357H","review":"Great concept is all I can say!! It may be a good machine if you can actually get it set up!

The performance was so bad that I ended up returning the recorder. If you are recording from an analog cable you may be OK, but if you are hoping to record from an antenna be careful. I didn't give the ATSC tuner a real test.Note also that although the recorder has an ATSC (HD) tuner, it downgrades the signal and only records it in SD (i.e. non high def) form.Also the upconverting of analog signals to 1080i is problematic - there are no options to select whether you want the signal zoomed or kept at its existing size. So if there are (say) subtitles near the bottom of the picture you may not be able to see them.Nice features: shame about the analog off-air picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it and I am 60 years old,but still a kid","review":"I recived the 1/10 not the 1/6 car but it leaves tire marks on my tile.

Its in EP, not SP mode, as if someone recorded this off of a local television station! The color is blurred and has very poor contrast, the image is so hazy its almost fog-like, and the audio quality is very poor even with the volume turned up to the loudest.

It holds well for a month or more at a time even on slightly textured surfaces. Do not use on heavily textured or grouted surfaces. Just need to check secure attachment before putting weight on it.

The can itself is relatively flimsy and it does not have a hard plastic liner like the manual (foot pedal) flip-top trash cans do. It is difficult to get the trash bags to stay in place because the plastic ring that holds them will fall into the can. Also, if you place the can in an area where it is close to foot traffic, the lid will open and close when you walk by.The one plus is that you can place it against the wall and the lid will open fine.

Anyone who has ever felt pain in their heart can identify with the lyrics and electronic-rock melodies. Even the slow songs such as \\"23\\" slowly begin catch and replay in your mind, over and over. This CD blends elements of rock and electronics with intersting, not boring, effects. If you are even a mild alternative-rock fan I'd give this CD a spin.If you're adding to your GLU collection I'd recommend getting this CD and the EP both.

It's got the eye candy and James Woods channeling Michael J Fox (too soon?) but is ultimately disappointing in it's pacing, dialogue, and content. As I understand it this is Juliet Marquis's (a model from the Czech Republic I think) breakout role.

She is able to carve and deliver a difficult role through the process of numerous character changes and emotional reactions. The story is believable, dramatic, fun, dark and brutal with scores of humor thrown in via James Wood's character.

If she was this big porn SUPERSTAR then why can't she afford a nurse to care for her \\"Parkinson's disease-suffering\\" father when she is gone? Would not starting a business based on trying to make people cheat be dangerous? Would saying you can \\"take on\\" twenty guys be a bad move? I know that was not Moon but the stupidity is not limited to her story. A little, and I mean VERY little, common sense would have put her in the same place that this lunatic story did.Again and again the actions and journeys taken are unnecessary except as poorly executed attempts to emotionally manipulate the viewer.

However, recently I have not been so fast to do so. A little over a year ago I convenience my daughter to spend her hard earned money on a MacBook. What a mistake. She is on her third one, which has now this morning frozen up and according to the people at Apple on the phone sounds like the hard drive is gone. If so, they want $900 to replace. Now when people ask me about Apple all I can say is - My daughter has had 3 models in a little over a year and all three have had hard drive problems and on top of that Apple's support has been pretty much worthless - so you do the math. I was waiting to order a new powerbook for my self when they finally introduce Leopard but I have to admit this once good Apple seems to be rotting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted","review":"Laptop came with a broken DVD drive and headphone jack worked sometimes.

I understand that this Apple laptop has a problem with the screen. They should stop selling it to unsuspecting customers who then have to suffer through several fixes, which may or may not work.Spending $1,200 for an item should provide you with a superior product; not one that the company knows has a problem that will need fixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great laptop","review":"It has been nearly 10 years since my last Macintosh purchase.

I was shocked at how easy it was to set up on my home and work networks. When I was setting up, I got frustrated because I could not figure out how to setup the computer for my network. While I was looking through the control panels, I get a message that updates were ready to be installed. It did everything on its own!For the three PC's I own I had to call support from my ISP and had to use all kinds of back door tricks to get it to work.I am very pleased at how fast it operates both on battery and plugged in. My PC laptop drags to a crawl when on battery.The computer starts up in a few seconds (a large improvement over the past Macs that I have owned).At this point, I hardly use my wintel based PCs.

It is really quiet. The one thing I like about it is the CD drive. This is really a huge leap over the designs in other laptops: the CD drive does no pop out. The CD drive is always inside the computer. That is a huge plus. Apple is really leaps ahead of other computer companies in terms of hardware. This computer is also incredibly small. From a hardware point of view, it is almost perfect.I have been a windows user for a long time, and I'm pretty much fed up with it. With open office out there, much of the windows office suite is becoming obselete. It's easy to install open office on mac, as well as windows office - windows office will cost you another 200 dollars though. So far, I am very happy with my decision to go mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible design flaw ??","review":"We bought a MacBook this spring and liked it so much we bought a 2nd for my son's HS graduation 2 months ago. Both perform flawlessly. However after only 2 months of NORMAL use the LCD screen on my son's Mac has cracked. Apple quoted a base cost of $750 to replace--more than 2/3rds of the original cost! (Actually, they said \\"Don't fix; buy a new unit.\\") I was quick to blame my son for misuse, but now I'm uncertain if that is fair. I have found many blogs reporting the same fragile LCD cracks on MacBooks, many which seemed to occur spontaniously. Apple, of course, claims misuse and will not warranty. Even the additional Apple Care warranty excludes LCD replacement. Perhaps the cover design inadequately protects the screen. Think twice. Or at least buy a hard snap on case which may provide some protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat laptop!","review":"Although the conversion from being a Windows PC user to an Apple MacBook user is a bit difficult, all the information I needed was available.

Also, for anyone who has owned an Apple computer, you know that their customer service speaks english (well), is courteous, and works with you to solve your problems.My MacBlack replaced a PowerBook G4 and I am very satisfied by my decision. The only design flaw that I see is that the keys are not backlit. Otherwise, I love my MacBlack. It will be my computer of choice for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Notebook","review":"I was a windows user for several years before purchasing this notebook. After experiencing a lot of problems with some previous windows notebook, i decided to give Mac OS a try and was thoroughly satisfied. The operating system is easy, hassle free, and efficient with multiple tasks. Furthermore a lot of the programs i found easy to use and very intuitive. The notebook itself is very well made compared to a lot of the flimsy lap tops i've seen on the market. It's very lightweight and yet is a computing powerhouse with a Core 2 Duo processor running at 2.16 GHz and a 160 gb HD, to store just about whatever you want. If you are having hassles with windows or are thinking of switching over I would highly reccomend this notebook.

The reason I like Mix above all other rappers, that being his sense of humor, refusal to take himself too seriously, and great voice -- with one or two exceptions it's all gone here. He lets his little friends have too much time in front of the mike; in fact, despite the \\"Sir Mix-A-Lot\\" name on the front, we don't hear as much of him as we deserve. His hangers on have no talent, and his back beats are starting to take that washed-out quasi-gangsta sound. Do yourself a favor -- get the \\"Jump on It\\" single and listen to \\"Mack Daddy\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"an average record under hip hop standards (which is bad)","review":"I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say that this album is complete garbage; after all, Sir Mix-a-lot is a talented rapper and manages to maintain his image as a uniquely real artist. I'd say that the biggest problem with this album is that the beats are sort of boring...defintely not the type of stuff you can play at a club or whtaever. His lyrics are good, but not as good as his previous records. My personal favorite song is 'Mob Style', it's really the only one that I can enjoy listening to more than once. In the end, I was largely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"Mix A Lot was one of my favorite artists back in the day. Posse on Broadway was an incredible song with other classics on his first album. The sound was revolutionary. This album is just terrible. I think most of the reviews on this site look fake because there is no one in their right mind who would rate this over 3 stars. The mastering and mixing is top quality but the beats and rap on this is just horrible. I was expecting so much more from Mix A Lot like Rippin or Posse on Broadway and those type of tracks.

Quality of the compressor is horrible, lots of plastic parts and small springs in the pressure switch.When new it build pressure very slowly.I bought this exact combination which seemed like a good price with the nailers/staplers but the compressor is junk.

For a 3 gun kit I thought the price was right and I saw the same kit at Lowes for the same price but I would have had to pay sales tax. Although I have only used the finish nailer, I did test the other 2 guns and they work fine. The finish nailer works great. I have gone through about 1500 nails and have not had one jam. The gun fits comfortably in my hand and is light weight. At start up the compressor is a little noisy but after about 3 minutes it kicks off and only occasionally kicks back on.

This is evidenced by the diverse opinions expressed in these customer reviews.Moreover, the information that Daniel C.

But since I've watched this piece, I'm seeing these films all over cable and watching them just to see if the films are as good as Bass's title sequence!P.S. The Bass piece was clearly made in the late '70s (Bass's shirt has huge collars!).P.S. #2 There's many other great pieces on this DVD (an Eames piece, a montage experimental film from the 1940s, and some recent festival hits).

Lot's of authors write about the splendor of life and the optimism of the human soul. Not this author. Not entirely anyways. Truth be known there is a dark and depressing feel throughout this human perspective, however underneath all the dreadful truisms of the world, shines a somewhat optimistic approach to mankind through all is squalor and hate. Yes, we face a world of misery, warfare, poverty and violence, yet the author somehow bring all of it full circle, demanding a more thought invoking process from her readers to directly stare into the eyes of these atrocities and hardships that unfold daily on the planet we habitate...and to do something about it. Positive thoughts harvest positive results and when push comes to shove, Marlene Samuel's personal perspective on life can bring about change in the most cynical minds (and otherwise) of mankind.

An uncredited assist by Nicholas Ray could not salvage the routine effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitchum & Russell in flawed but fun film","review":"Being that Robert Mitchum is my favorite actor it is difficult for me to say anything negative about the films he appears in. This isn't a bad film, just a little murky. Mitchum is confident and cocky as ever; Russell is sexy as a nightclub singer on the lamb.

Yes, Mitchum sleepwalks through his \\"Bob, Son of Bogie\\" role as an American adventurer kicking around the mysterious Orient. Jane Russell gets to look fetching and sing a few songs but this one is basically a light workout for all concerned. Lacking the comedic flair of its predecessor \\"His Kind of Woman!\\", \\"Macao\\" sort of works as a not-terribly-serious manhunt drama. I suppose the fun for hardcore cineastes is trying to figure out where Josef von Sternberg's work leaves off and Nicholas Ray's patch-up job begins.

It's about a maidenly miss who is trying to restore the family's wealth by recovering jewels her father lost gambling. (familiar enough plot). But the jewels are hidden in a sexually explicit statue at the home of sexually depraved man. So the hero (who spend the whole book complaining about the fact that he is a duke and has too much work to do because of it) takes her to an orgy to recover the statue! PULEEZE..........The only entertaining part of the book was the first chapter when the duke plays a highwayman but it's definitely a short lived part of the book. No more Jo Beverley books for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing book","review":"It's difficult to believe Jo Beverley actually wrote this book. She used to weave an interesting plot with believable characters. The heroine is supposedly a middle class virgin with a strong moral sense. However, thirty minutes into her visit to an orgy, she is playing sex games with a cucumber and other games with the hero. The plot seems to exist merely as a device to allow the author to write \\"sensual\\" scenes-and I use that term loosely. It was difficult to believe in the romance of the couple. There was no character development here-the author was too distracted in emphasizing the physical attraction. In the end, it was very boring and I couldn't finish it.

Her plans go awry when they are stopped by a notorious highwayman. Who turns out to be St. Raven and they set about to recover the family fortune by going into the bowels of this particular devil's hell. Cressida finds herself falling for her guide into this world. But she feels she and St. Raven can never be together as she is not titled and he is a rake. She fears he would be too like her father and she couldn't live with that. Jo Beverly makes you live her stories and St. Raven is no exception. I strongly recommend this book to all of her fans and all of you that love an exciting, romantic tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one went downhill fast!","review":"This is not one of Jo Beverley's best efforts. Very disappointing in fact. The first couple of chapters went well. The characters seemed multi-dimentional and then everyone starts behaving in unbelievable and illogical ways.St. Raven seemed interesting, a bit intriguing and even sexy. Cressida seemed a mindless twit to me. She suffered from the common Regency writer's problem of focusing on the fact that the hero is a rake. That gets so annoying and tedious that I begin to scan looking for story development. There was nothing about these two to keep me engaged in their lives. In all honestly I quit reading after about page 80."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertaining","review":"I have to disagree with what seems to be the general feeling - I didn't like this book! The plot was terrible. Cressida's father loses everything to an evil man in a card game - including some erotic statues. One of these statues has gems in it that would save the family from ruin. So Cressida sets out to get the statue by agreeing to be the man's mistress but a highwayman kidnaps her and ends that plan.The highwayman is actually Tris, our hero, playing at larceny. From there, nothing happens as the pair try to get the statue back.Ms. Beverley tried to make it a very sensual book with the couple dressing up in silk and attending an orgy. But it just didn't seem to work in this case. \\"I want...I want to be closer to you, Tris, than I've ever been to anyone since I slid messily from my mother's womb.\\" To me, things like that kill the mood.I still enjoy Jo Beverley's books, just not this one in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had a great begining...","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is my guess that this is the finale of the Rogue Series. I did not really enjoy the Rogue series because it would have been impossible for Nicholas to spend as much time as he did away from his new wife and child and be the father that all of the rogues seem to have needed. All at the age of 25. I was happy that he did not make even the slightest appearance in this story but the story was still bad. It was great until the end of the orgy, and then it just got boring. She became what I hate most about the heroine in a romance novel - a stupid female- I put this book down several times but I made myself finish it because I had hoped the last few chapters would save the book.

Gives historical perspectives of Wing Chun, Wing Chun theory, basic blocks and strikes, good chapter on wing chun kicks, unusual for a wing chun book. Demonstrates the second form of Wing Chun, which is slightly modified to include more kicks, just a Master's preference. Good chapter on applications. The book has a lot of general info, or will just briefly mention a topic. Pictures are small and grainy. One thing to note is Wong authors the book as Sifu Douglas Wong, in Chinese culture, they don't refer to one's self as sifu, it is considered arrogant and concieted. Other wise a good humble book on Wing chun, which makes for a decent reference to the second form."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute and good size","review":"this toy is just the right size to be fun but not to be difficult to find a place for.

For example, you know what an injector does, but how exactly does it work? How do designers decide whether to use Walschaerts or Stephensons or Bakers valve gear? How does a superheater work and why does it increase a locomotive's efficiency so dramatically? If these are the kind of questions that intrigue you, then this is the book for you.Most of the examples are taken from British locomotive engineering practice, but the principles described are generic. Unfortunately, some of the photographs are poorly rendered and the details described in the text are sometimes hard to see, but the descriptions are very detailed and precise. If the photographs had been better I would have rated this volume 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not an easy read","review":"Unless you already know how a steam locomotive works, some parts of this book are difficult.

I almost turned it off because the language was horrible but decided to let it run and use it as a teaching tool. There are bullying scenes that are so strong in this movie it was hard as a parent to watch. It was however a very big eye opener to my sons on how life can be for some kids.

To me, I feel that this is because the movie focused on teenage situations and it's not easy for adults to remember what it's like to be bullied and how you feel. But, the movie reflects to teenagers and despite the violence, in the end it does show that you don't have to be violent to solve your problems. And for some kids, this movie could be a wake-up call. I admit that the language was a little worse than what it should have been, but that doesn't change the movie. It was filled with great actors and actresses and focuses on friendship and with the every-day tough problems that teenagers face. It also shows how they feel that they should act when everything fails to solve their problem.

The pages are very colorful and the cartoon characters are cute, but the pages are so cluttered with information and speech balloons that they become a distraction and definitely not learner friendly. I did, however, like that it begins with the notes labeled by letter A,B,C, etc instead of finger numbers. Instead of this book I ended up buying Hal Leonard's First Piano book, which is excellent. It moves nice and easy and is very clear and consise giving enough time for practice before moving onto new concepts.

There are several new concepts taught on a page without any means for the child to practise them and actually \\"do\\" them. It's as if the child is expected to memorize them without any experience with the information.I went to my local music store and looked through all the beginning piano books and decided upon \\"Alfred's Basic Piano Library- Lesson Book, Level 1A.\\" It's great- it introduces one new concept per page and has the child practise it in easy steps, little by little inching forward.

Even the ones who truly enjoyed a woman with more meat on her bones would never admit it. Fat women are just not for show. But a word to the fellows: If you do find a woman who is comfortable in her own skin, hang on to her no matter the size, she is a treasure.

The first part (Jesus - Then and Now) consists of some modified versions of the original script, along with still photos from the show. It's well written, as you would expect a script to be, and the photos are great. Unfortunately there is nothing new here, although it is nicely packaged.The second part (Reading the Gospels with Both Eyes Open) departs from the original show, but again, there is very little original thinking here. Wright discusses the discrepancies in gospel accounts, the Jesus seminar, the Dead Sea Scrolls, dating the gospels, the Jewish influences, etc.There is no reference list nor any notes. The index is skimpy, but so too is the content.Bottom line - this is a well written and nicely illustrated sketch of some aspects of Jesus' life. It will not appeal to scholars and is of limited interest to beginners who will find it too truncated."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new under the sun","review":"I regret that I coughed up mazuma for this here book.

I believe that model, PE-400D, has been discontinued. And no wonder -- what a piece of junk! In the first six months of use, I had to take it in for a $169 dollar repair when the touch screen stopped working reliably. Recently (April 2007) it began exhibiting the same problem.I paid $399 for this machine, which was a huge discount over the prices I saw elsewhere for similar machines. But one more trip to the sewing machine shop and I'll almost have purchased the thing all over again, with no guarantee that this repair will permanently solve this problem. (Or whatever other problems start cropping up.)I'm going to donate this machine to some worthy cause, warning them that they'll probably never be able to do anything but straight stitching. I'll also make a solemn promise never to buy another Brother product, ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"Purchased the machine before I retired with every intention of resuming my sewing and embroidery hobby.The machine is neat and compact, but from day one the embroidery feature would result in bobbin thread \\"nesting\\", and broken threads.

The machine was probably used for a total of 25 hours over a period of time.Went to the local Brother Dealer for help and was told not to bother with repairs as they are costly and must be shipped to the plant in Tennessee. which now involves shipping charges.

It's just a crappy machine in the end. It would up and stop working properly in the middle of doing a project. So much wasted thread and materials. My 1st machine lasted about 2 years. I used it for embroidery only. If I would go back and forth from sewing to embroidery, it would glitch up a lot going back to embroidery. Since I have the card program I was able to go out and buy more patterns to use with the machine. That was a nice feature. The machine it's self really needs to be better made. The hoops also don't last very long. I would go thru a new hoop about every 2-3 months. They should make metal hoops for this machine.

I have been sewing for 40+ years so it wasn't because I didn't know what I was doing. I had to take it to the reapir man who after having it for three weeks fixed it. Then about six months later I was going to do some sewing for my daughter and the bobbin threader refused to work. Back to the reapir man again, who could not fix it. He said that he needed schematics and brother will not give them out. So here I set with a machine that can not be used.

It sews perfectly. All the settings are awesome. Tons of different options. I love how easy it is to thread the machine. You can change the color of the thread in less than 30 seconds. Some of fav. things about this machine are: It cuts the tread for you, you can set the machine to sew by pushing 1 button, so easy to put spin the thread on the bobbin and my favorite thing is satin stiching. I comes with a open foot so you can see what you are doing. It was very easy to set up the embroidery. I love the embroidery on the machine. Mickey comes out perfectly! The directions on this machine are very easy to understand and read. I would highly recommend this sewing/embroidery machine if you love to sew. I also have the Brother serger lock 1034 D that is a great serger for $199."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I found that while the sewing machine can do many things,it is poorly constructed. I visited aa Brother Retailer who informed me that they not carry this machine because of the poor construction. They told me that I should be very careful with the thread cassette since they break easily and cannot be fixed and must be replaced which is costly.I find that sthreading the needle and winding the bobbin threads cumbersome and more complicated then is necessary. I still have not figured how to adjust the embroidery tensions to keep the thread from bunching up under the fabric.I am not a beginner when it comes to sewing and presently own a Viking 1100 and a White Serger. I bought the Brother as a way to get into the embroidery sewing. I still have the machine and will try to get it working to my satisfaction.

To get the \\"ultimate graphics\\" of XBOX is easily obtainable: simply connect a control pad to a PC and there you have it. Even a game as \\"childish\\" as Nintendo's Mario Kart: Double Dash can afford me (a 21 year old college student) and his friends all endless hours of fun.

Almost all of the songs sound alike, with a traditional African dance song sound. Unless you share heritage with wyclef or have some sort of peculiar inteterest, I would not reccomend this album to you. In my eyes (or ears) Wyclef Jean's last two albums have shifted away from thw wonderful songs in the Ecleftic days.

Although I have to mention that she thought the paino and voice setting was a bit \\"dull\\", I believe it provides for a more \\"intimate\\" setting. If you are not particularly fond of opera and opera arias in general, this is the CD for you. While this is not my all time favorite album Sumi has done, it does in fact rank high on the list of CDs she has released.

However, Triggernometry boasts a poor selection of 10 awkwardly pop-esque \\"songs\\" and cheesy, unintelligent lyrics that prove to be exemplary of Onyx's shift in tone and mentality. The rest of the CD is basically a commentary by the members about things that they did when they were good. Neither of their last two realeases have even come close to echoing the quality of their first three. IT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE ONYX. Instead of Bacdafucup II or Triggernometry I'd recommend any of their first three albums (most notably Shut Em' Down and All We Got Iz Us) or Immortal Technique's Revolutionary Vol. 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"onyx needs to get back wit DEF JAM!!","review":"ONYX had more love from fans and everybody was feelin em when they was wit DEFJAM! they had more album sales!!

For example, the author even included a statistic on the volume behavior for the 'head and shoulder' pattern, which is very helpful. -You may not find those facts in any other book. The approach the author took is certainly a step forward towards 'scientific' technical analysis.However, the presentation is poor and too wordy which makes it uneasy to follow, especially when you compare it with the classics like John Murphy ans Steve Nison's. There are too many uneccary words and most of the 'trading examples' are nothing more than stories (it is also not clear if those stories are fabricated or real).

After much research, we decided to get this one, and we're so happy with it! Our daughter LOVES it, and has become quite adept at hammering the nails into the holes and using the nuts and bolts. The toy is nicely built and provides plenty of \\"hardware.\\" The only minus we have encountered is that after some use, the nails become loose, so they'll just slip into the holes. We just inserted a bit of cardboard into the inside of the nails, and we have had no problems since.

The guitar and keyboard solo's are true to the original flavor and not overdone. The Animals strong suit, in my opinion, was not their originals, which were often too poppy for my taste(even at that young age), but their absolutely soulful blues covers. I often wonder why the complete Animals catalog is not available in CD or any other format & I often search the used record bins for them, but to no avail.

After you log into it, everything is pretty much self-explanatory.But the router itself is really fast. I can now receive signal in places in my house where my previous dlink router could not, and it boosted my old wireless-g adapters on my family's pc to a noticeable faster internet speed.

Stay away from this one! It does not work!","review":"I invested over 6 hours trying to get this really nice looking router to work! Nothing! Other than just sit there and look nice it did nothing!

I called Linksys Customer Support and they told me to call XBox 360, Sony, Motorola and HP to have all my devices adapters configured to work with this router! Can you believe this? As I told their rep, this thing should be set up with a minimum of time and hassle without the necessity of my having to call all the manufacturers of my wireless devices! Unfortunately, this is the second time I have had a similar experience with Linksys, only that the other wireless router was the one with the SRX400 built into it! I am definitely taking this to the store and getting a different brand!

Then it quit broadcasting at all. We IM'd the Linksys support people and eventually got told it was our service provider's fault (TW)--but the router delivered a fine wired connection to the very desktop I was using to IM Linksys!So, we borrowed another router from a friend, and BOOM--worked perfectly.

When I transferred this notebook to the lower floor, I couldn't get anymore signal. I read about the WRT300N network adaptor and decided to buy it believing that it will help in getting a better range for my notebook. The installation was easy, however, after several attempts, I just gave up because I could not get any signal at all. It was no different from just using the router. I tried to get help from the technical group of Linksys but however, I haven't received any response from them. Really disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disappointed","review":"I've been a long time Linksys user and so when it came time to purchase wireless, it was a natural choice. One thing I've come to love about Linksys was it's tech support and almost effortless setup. Well... surprise... things have changed a bit there. I discovered very quickly that the company had been sold, and the NEW tech support was as good as useless. I called their team and told them of my need to service Internet over a large home, corner to corner. They sold me the WRT300N and several WUSB300N Wireless-N USB Network Adapters. Well, the closest one to the router is only 12 feet and it's constantly disconnecting and connecting and disconnecting and connecting. And all the current support team is good for is having me power cycle the router and computers, and checking the IP settings (which are all correct).I'm prepared to take the loss and purchase another system, but my loyalty as a Linksys client is surely over.As the title says, I'm simply completely disappointed.r"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"this item gave horriable connections. i did the Adaptor+this router Best Value Pack, The Set-up is quick and pointless. the Connection bars we're 2 instead of the other one i got witch was 5. i would say dont use this. wait for the REAL Patents. in 2008.

This product, firstly is an absolute pain to configure with an existing network/switch -- the wizard can't seem to handle that scenario. Next, once you do get the whole thing \\"manually\\" configured, the wireless just arbitrarily drops. At that point, your only option is to reset the router and \\"hope\\" that it comes back on. Worse yet, it also randomly drops both wireless and wired connectivity and must again be reset. My networking cohorts recommended a Firmware update to resolve the stability issues, but guess what -- there aren't any current updates for this model!!
