We eventually opened both jars by heating the lids and using special jar opener pads. The product worked fine with the easy-to-open jars.I think this is a good product for people who have problems opening any sort of jars - including easy-to-open ones. It did not work for me.

Since her Birthday is in May I decided to buy one for her Birthday. At the time this was a new product and I could not find in any stores. I ordered it from the Black&Decker web sire for $49.99 with free shipping.I gave this to my wife on her birthday and she loves it. She uses it all the time for the jars that she can not open. All you do is sit a jar in the machine, close the holders on the bottom of the jar, and then lower the top down to the lid. Then you push a button and it turns the lid and takes it off. A great invention, what took so long for it to come out?

No more searching for the rubber round 'tuit opener that didn't help much anyway. No more spilling pickle juice everywhere when the jar lid suddenly pops open while I'm wrestling with it.

They face a world taken over by the Legacy Virus where Warlock from the New Mutants and Doug Ramsey combine into one being...and then evolve! The other heroes from this world are taken over (ala the Borg from Star Trek) and it's up to the Exiles to stop them.Of the released sets so far, this one ranks well.

These are expensive towel bars and should last longer than 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor design","review":"I purchased a set of matching Danze hardware. Most of it was quite good, but this towel bar was terrible. The whole thing is curved, including the attachment to the wall, so it won't lay flat against the wall. This looks terrible and compromises the stability of the attachment. I installed it with molly bolts and it still pulled out of my wall with normal use. I was determined to make it work, so I connected one end to a stud, the other end is pulling out again. The only good thing I can say about this towel bar is that it is all metal and is quite heavy and durable. Too bad I have to chuck it and repair my wall before buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"check items immediately","review":"This product arrived but i needed to wait for my handyman to install after the painters finished.

When it says IN DETAIL, it means it. A lot of information I was unaware of, particularly with the 100S.

The first 3 of those years were fantastic! The past year, the hair dryer has been burning my hands and my hair. I don't know what happened. The filter is clean and I didn't change my settings. Figured this T3's life was over and I'd just get a new one. Kinda short life for a hair dryer that's over $100. Anyway, I went to look online. But you Amazon reviewers now rate the BabyBliss better than the T3. I was hesitant because of the weight increase. But I bought the Baby B. It dries my hair in half the time of the T3 and no burnt hands. The BabyBliss has a lot more power than my old T3 and scares my long, thick, frizzy hair straight and smooth in 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"My blowdryer came to me defective","review":"My blowdryer came to me defective so I can only give it 1 star.

The only positive thing I can say about it is that it is lightweight. I've had it for about 6 months and the air coming out of it is lukewarm at best. I have terrible breakage close to my scalp, all over my head, which sticks straight up and looks ridiculous. I asked my hairdresser about it and he said it was likely related to my blow dryer. I agree, since I have never had this problem before. I don't find that it dries your hair any faster than any other model. As for your hair staying \\"healthier\\", I've never seen mine in worse shape! I'm ordering a Twin Turbo (the only my hairdresser uses) to replace this subpar product. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good but does not last...","review":"It's a very good dryer, as long as it works. It broke after about a year of little usage.

My first T3 stopped working after a year and I purchased a second. My first broken one, my hairstylist was able to send back for me on her account and they fixed it and that became my back up. My then 2nd T3 worked for a year broke, and my back up (the repaired first T3) lasted 2 1/2 months. This is a great dryer while it works, but at 200 a pop, I expect it to last longer than a year, and I only dry my hair 2-3 times a week for 15 minutes. So, unfortunately I would say look elsewhere until they fix it. My former stylists owns a salon, they only use T3s however, she is constantly sending 3-4 of them back at a time to be replaced. The company will do that for stylists with great accounts for them but for the average purchaser you go through hoops to get it fixed.

Everything is rushed and make no real sense; the character and situations are supposed to be funny but the writing is so poor that everything is disjointed and really misses the mark. The hero can't help being drawn to to girl after one meeting with no real attempt at making any sort of connection between them; likewise with the heroine - she thinks one thing and then does something else completely with no explanation of why or no effort to develop any sort of logic to her actions. I just can't stress how poorly written this book is. I am appalled that someone actually published this!I have suffered through some bad books but this has got to take the cake.

The author made the heroine (Gillian) a complete bimbo. If you like to read about women who live like a witless brainless twit, then this book is for you. The reviews say they made readers laugh? I couldn't muster up the energy to utter one giggle - not when the heroine acts like a 14 year old. I could not identify with the hero (Noble) either. He just shows up - No background on what makes him tick. Thank goodness my purchase was only $.99!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Very Funny!","review":"I loved this book.

The main character is beyond naive. She is actually made to look very very stupid, yet her cousin talks about how smart she is at the beginning.

It is hard to follow and a lot of it leaves you thinking what just happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to read, hard to follow, hard to like.","review":"i struggled to finish this, and the only reason why was bc there was a mystery and i wanted to know what the ending was. As a mystery, it failed, as a romance it failed. The tone was written like a farce, reminding me vaguely of \\"the importance of being earnest\\" at least the film, but it lacked charm. the herione was supposedly clumsy, but warm hearted and charming, but she came across as a ditz, and i failed to see the charm. it really needed 400 pages more to flush out the story better. The story was also difficult to follow because the scene changes without warning so when it happened it was really jarring. I just couldn't connect with the characters and the storyline just didn't flow well. Now that I know the ending I don't even know why I bothered to finish this.There was so many loose ends....I mean why the dogs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noble Intentions","review":"I have to say...this is a first for me...

I read thru the book in one sitting, but had to force myself to finish it just so that I could move on as quickly as possible. The way this author writes, you have to read, then reread the passages because the thought processes of the heroine are such a jumbled hot mess. I tried to like her, I really did, but honestly, literally throwing yourself at your husband in not one, but 3 different scenes, almost knocking him over (succeeding actually once)?! And THAT'S how he's redeemed in the eyes of society?!?! Oh no... 2 stars for the couple of scenes that had me chuckling, and for the fact that it's $.99.

It was very labored in its writing and not very funny, to my taste. There was lots of relatively explicit sex content, but no chemistry between the main characters. I could not develop any interest in them nor see any way in which their relationship seemed plausible. The plot was just one extremely improbable event after another. The characters were not believable. You may enjoy it; I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money or Time !","review":"The only thing that made me feel glad about this book is that I didn't spend any money to buy it.This is the worst of the worst.

Seems the author was attempting to be funny. No one could be so absent minded and not get on your nerves. It is also silly that after one dance, this couple marries in four days.

Thank goodness I only paid $.99"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"It may or may not be fair to write a review having read only the first half of this book, but...I couldn't get through the last half of the book no matter how hard I tried. I wanted to like this story, especially because Macalister has written such funny books as \\"Improper English\\" and \\"Men in Kilts.\\" However, this more historical romance falls very flat. The characters barely know each other and we are barely given time to know them. Their motivations are not very clear as to why they like one another and eventually marry, and the female is the typical nave virgin. I found the book lacking in character development for sure, and in plot as well. It read like a teen book and not the adult novel it was supposed to be. Reading the first half was a bit like having a tooth extracted without a painkiller - excruciating. I will still look for Macalister books, but the more modern ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less if I could . . .","review":"This book came very highly recommended to me, by friends who I thought knew what I like to read. They certainly missed on this one! It took me two days to get to page 49, and I am seldom without a book in my hand! Thus, I decided my time would be better spent in trying to read something else. I found it rather overwritten and over wrought, with a heroine I could best describe as silly beyond belief, and a supposed hero not much better. I kept getting lost in the longer paragraphs, until finally, I just simply gave up. I really didn't give a darn about either of them, or their past or their future. I'm on the side of all the other reviewers here who gave it only one star. I couldn't give it less. I've not tried anything else by this author, and don't think I will, either, as I'm not into vampires and such. They may well be much better, but are still not my cup of tea.Ah, well. To each his or her own, as they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less stars if I could...","review":"OMG this is awful. I love silly romantic books, but this is just way to silly even for me! This is probably the worst historical novel I have ever read. The plot is unbelievable, the reader cannot believe even for a tiny moment that the misterious Noble will fall in love with Gillian.The caracters are another disaster starting with our heroine, I'm sure the author wanted her to be the different, authentic, independent american in austere England much like Henry Jame's Isabel Archer in Portrait of a lady, but Gillian is just STUPID, she is more of a 13-year-old girl of the 21st century that somehow got stuck in this novel.I did not like this at all. Read it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even make myself finish it!","review":"I have read a lot of books, but this is one of the very few I could not even make myself finish!

Since I've also read Huckleberry Finn, Gone with the Wind, To Kill A Mocking Bird several times (plus numerous others) I feel that good writing and entertainment should go hand-in-hand.I like to suggest this novel to those who believe Regency Romances are just bad Jane Austen copies. Gillian and her husband/hero are not the normal simpering characters of the Regency genre. He is gruff, stern, determined, and firm in his notions of women. His Gillian is a bit of a giddy-headed and flighty creature, but she always has a method to her slightly skewed thinking. Together this pair ( and a few others) try to solve the mystery of a murder. Also, the sex scenes are lively and amusing.This is a fun read and still charms and delights readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGH OUT LOUD!!","review":"This book should carry a warning lable:DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IN A PUBLIC PLACE UNLESS YOU WISH TO EMBARASS YOURSELF BY LAUGHING SO HARD THAT YOUR BELLY HURTS.(That is exactly what happened to me.)

I have not read this particular author before and made the purchase based on the reviews from others. Gillian's background from America goes nowhere. She was an annoying, inconceivably naive character that was impossible to envision ANY man, especially one as strong and \\"dark\\" as Noble, tolerating her. I have read characters similar to her, but they are written to be endearing... not this character. Noble, there was nothing special about him. Characters are usually built on their parentage or childhood experiences, these characters seemed to just be pasted into time with no real history and no ability for the reader to imagine their happily ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noble Intentions (MacAlister)","review":"This is a full length, stand alone, very funny, historical romantic comedy, with a little sex, mystery, and suspense.Gillian , the Countess of Chaos, marries Noble, Lord of the Unholy Temper, and sets out to \\"save\\" him from himself.

Gillian is determined to uncover the secrets and lies from the past, and enlists the aid of her language-mangling cousin, pirate/butlers, fighting footmen, ex-mistresses, gaseous animals, and friends and foes alike, to help her solve the puzzle. The question is... can Noble survive his \\"saving\\"?This story is a refreshing, light hearted, mad cap adventure, that I thoroughly enjoyed!Book 2 of this series is \\"Noble Destiny\\" and Book 3 is \\"The Trouble with Harry\\", both written in a similar style as the first, and also very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is Generous","review":"Pay attention to every one star review written about this book - they are all true!

The plot is not well defined and serves more as a loosely drawn backdrop to the lunacy running rampant through the story. The hero has no depth, the heroine is a joke and the secondary characters do nothing to redeem the story. There are a few steamy scences, but unfortunately in the author's attempt to be \\"all funny all the time\\", they come across as silly rather than sensual.

The writing is little hard to read and some of the opposites aren't very clear (in the full/empty comparison, the \\"empty\\" glass isn't empty it still has liquid in it).However the drawings are very attractive and the use of circle cut-outs to connect the opposites is clever and well done. This book doesn't talk down to children and that is something that I appreciate.You might have to discuss with your child some of the opposites (such as the candy/pills, concrete/abstract, before/after) but this a book that is meant to encourage discussion about the world and how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Much to Write Home About","review":"Like Janus, this book had two faces, one bad and one ugly.

However, I was greatly dissatisfied. The fit and finish was very nice with a high gloss coating and relatively simple assembly. Upon first glance I was pleased, but then I struck a key and It sounds just like a xylophone! The sound is absolutely horrendous and that alone gives this thing 1 star. The only thing it has going for it is its appearance. Everything else, including the awful smell (Lacquer i'm assuming) was pretty bad. Though let me just say that I all you want is an over glorified xylophone, then this is perfect. If you want something that sounds even remotely like a real piano, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical treat","review":"Our 3 year old granddaughter loves this piano.

I bought the Schoenhut 30-key baby grand for our grandson's second Christmas and have watched his skills improve in his understanding of how to play a keyboard. I have also seen the other grandchildren as well as visiting children totally enjoy the chance to play a instrument that is designed for their size and small fingers. The legs could perhaps be a bit sturdier to support the techniques of toddler boys, but overall, it is a purchase for which I have no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Jerry Lee!","review":"We bought this piano as a present for our daughter for Christmas - it was going to be the big Santa gift. The first one arrived incorrect, with parts missing, in the manufacturer's packaging (made in China). We contacted the seller - JouJou Baby - and they responded right away, and got a replacement shipped out in time to make our Christmas surprise. When we got the corrected one, it worked wonderfully.My daughter, who just turned one right before Christmas, LOVES this piano! Anytime her daddy starts playing his, she will run over to hers and start playing. Her daddy even comes over to play hers sometimes, and as a pianist, he says it plays pretty well for the toy that it is. The sound is a little different, since the strings are elastic, and it's not perfectly in tune, but this is meant to be a toy, and she thoroughly enjoys it.We are thrilled with it so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Little Piano","review":"This piano is very small, a perfect size for a 2-5 year-old, but not meant for an older child. For what it is, however, it is a great toy. I purchased it as a prop for a middle school musical, and, although it is way too small for children of that age group to use it properly, it worked well as a stage tool for comic relief. Also, the cast members liked to play with it and those who knew how to play the piano could play tunes on it pretty well, though it does not have a full range of keys, being that it is miniature. Also, a bit out of tune, but fine for a young child.Assembly was also a cinch, Two middle-school kids put it together in a few minutes by following the directions. Overall, it seems to be a quality piece, and, although a bit overpriced, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice defective, two times too many","review":"The first time we ordered this piano, we waited until Christmas Eve to take it out of the box to assemble. The first thing I noticed was the bag of screws was already opened, so I'm pretty sure it was already returned. The next thing I noticed was the parts didn't match the manual that came with it. The major problem with this piano was the legs didn't match. Only 1 leg fit the piano, and the screws to the rear leg's base were missing.Returned!The 2nd piano we ordered was a bust too. The keys stuck together. When they finally would depress, they had to be manually be forced up into the rest position.Returned!Although this would have been a wonderful piano, I'm not going to take my chances with a 3rd order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but that's about it","review":"This Piano looks beautiful, which made it even harder to send it back but alas, it sounds terrible and if they had put as much effort in its sound as its looks, it may have been a different story altogether.

The product arrived with a terrible lacquer smell that did not go away even after almost 1 week.

They tried to transcribed the locations of their homeland onto their new environment and failed in many places. This explains why scholars have been puzzled by the many inconsistencies in the stories.There were only two problems I had with the book: it needed more maps and could have benefited from some actual pictures of the areas he was describing. He also blew it at the very end when, almost as an afterthought, he tried to claim that ancient biblical history could have originated from this area as well. Since this was speculation and not proven as was Homer's stories, it should have been left out. It tainted an otherwise well researched book.Vinci succeeded in what he set out to do and proves that history is malleable and not set in stone like many believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the sequel...","review":"I am anxiously waiting for the sequel: The Chinese origins of Shakespearean Drama...or, better yet, the Aztek origins of Dante's Divine Comedy...This is plaunly ridiculous.I can understand why some people would write books just to make a living, but I am not going to be wasting my time reading lalaland fantasy dressed up in pseudo-academic feathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner books cheap print job.","review":"I had read this book earlier in my life and loved it so purchased the paperback edition for a gift. It looks as if the publisher ran the original book through a copy machine--my biggest gripe being the pictues--clear and crisp in the original hardcover--in this paperback via Warner Books are cloudy and very hard to interpret--the pictures are that bad--black and white and very blurry--not one of the pictures approaches newspaper quality. The pictures have 2 colors black and white with no midtones. I will not give this book as a gift. I will order the hardcover original and give that rather than the inferior paperback published by Warner Books. I give this book 2 stars because of the wonderful story. Even tho the original by Farley Mowat is a wonderful story Warner Books has simply presented this story in the cheapest format they could produce--simply living off the author's selling power. I give Warner Books and their money making scheme 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Swahili People","review":"This book should be dismissed as another poorly-constructed attempt to rob African people of the honor of their heritage. Middleton claims that Swahili people are actually of Asian and Arab descent, and the only photos in the book of Swahili people are Asians. You don't need to read this book to know his thesis is completely false. The main countries in which Kiswahili is spoken are Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Uganda. Tanzania is 99% AFRICAN, Kenya is 96% AFRICAN and Uganda is 99% AFRICAN.

Tony Redmond spent about as much time explaining Exchange as he did praising Microsoft and its so-called innovations with Exchange. He touts Digital as having one of the largest Exchange deployments. Well, duh! Would Digital have deployed Exchange at all if Microsoft hadn't ported NT on Digital's Alpha chip? And how could he even name one of his chapters \\"The Joy of Managing Exchange\\"?

Ms. Bonazzi graced the opera and concert stage for 4 decades and her performances will be long remembered and cherished. This recital, a pristine digital recording, was made at Peabody Conservatory, when she was teaching there, and it is an admirable showcase for her special communicative powers. The Brahms and Ravel are pretty well known, but the Britten and, especially, the Monteverdi are less familiar. To hear them sung so compellingly and with such artistry is a rare and satisfying treat. And she is joined by some of the finest instrumentalists of the time--pianist Ellen Mack, flutist Timothy Day, violist Karen Tuttle, and the late cellist, Stephen Kates.

Simply Love is a very emotional romance that actually had me shedding a tear or two!Why only 4 stars? Because on a scale of 1 to 10 the sensuality is a 2.

The character development is inadequate and the plotting is jejeune. \\"Simply Love\\" is a novella that has been stretched to short novel length--with the obvious problems. The inset Bedwyn scenes are just used to pad for length; there's no real drama (we know who will get together and why very very early); and the writing is neither as strongly descriptive or deeply sensual as Balogh's best writing.

It was black and I had it for about 4 years. It worked wonderfully the entire time. I guess it finally wore out and so I decided that I would buy another just like it. I bought this model thinking it would be just as good. Was I wrong. I had some of the same problems that others had. It would beep in the middle of a conversation and then cut out. I would have to ask the person to repeat what they said because I couldn't hear them. I also had trouble with the &quot;tin can&quot; sound. Several times I would call someone and it would be very hard to hear them and there would be a static sound in the background. I would hang up and call back and it would be better. I ended up returning this phone and trying the cheaper model thinking it would be more like the original. This one was no good either. I returned the second model and went for another brand. We'll see how this goes. Very disappointed, Panasonic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Features, Bad Design","review":"Well I'm officlally done buying Panasonic cordless phones.

It has a voice enhancer (VE) which I thought would be great, but it makes the person you're talking with echo (if it's on). If the VE is off then you can hear yourself echoing in the telephone.

Only a few cobwebs ; litle dust; the electricity still works ( who paid the bills?); the lights / fridge/ VCR/ tv all are in perfect working order after such a long time.Surely the family would have removed them.Even the safe was left behind-surely someone would have been curious as to what was in it.

Maybe throw some blame the actors ways as well.What a shame...it could have been quite funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"needed an actual script","review":"This movie should have worked but the writing was so lame it just failed on so many levels. Given the stellar supporting cast (John Lithgow, SNL's Fred Armisen, John Goodman, Joan Cusack, Airplane's Julie Hagerty and even the usually mannish Kristin Scott Thomas), even they cannot save this disaster.One great failing is the lead male role as Hugh Dancy just has no screen appeal at all. He just seems \\"there\\"--that's all. There's no sense of comedic timing or even of how to play a romantic lead. Isla Fisher is her usual effervescent self but maybe she has just rehashed that persona once too much. Her BFF in the movie, Krysten Ritter, just seems like a poor woman's Anne Hathaway.Also, this DVD version gives you only deleted scenes and extremely boring unfunny outtakes.

I also haven't read the book(s) it's based on.I decided to compare this movie (watched on DVD) with 'The Devil Wears Prada', which seemed to me to have the same combination of girl appeal, comedy, romance, and a touch of drama. I enjoyed 'Prada' but 'Confessions' was a really poor 'wannabe' in comparison. There were times when I had to leave the room as they telegraphed the embarrassing comedy moment far in advance. Weak character development and desperate struggling to get from one set piece to another made this movie a chore to watch. I liked the trailer though. Aren't there many more, better, movies like this, where the troubled girl sorts out her life, gets the job and man of her dreams and lives happily ever after?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Great theme (especially since I've struggled with debt), and, of course, the rom-com staples of clothes, cute guy(and, this time, smart!), and the quirky main character made it charming.

I have read all the Shopaholic books, many times, and loved them all. The movie was more of an \\"inspired by the Shopaholic series\\", as opposed to a \\"based on the Shopaholic series\\"; there were some similarities, but overall the movie is not like the books at all.Isla Fisher WAS really good in this movie, and I hope she begins to get a couple more movies where she is a leading lady. Naturally funny, Isla pulls off the Becky Bloomwood character very well. There were parts of this movie where I caught myself smiling, but most jokes I thought were cliche or I have seen them done in other movies.All in all, Isla, still love you, but I still don't like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little from the book","review":"I wanted to watch the movie after starting reading the book Confession of a Shopoholic.

I guess it was a sort of combination of Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, but it was too loosely based on the books to have any of the appeal of the actual series. I don't even know where to start with the discrepancies. I understand that certain liberties must be taken when turning a book into a movie, but this one just fell flat.I also thought that if I hadn't read the books, I really would have had no idea what the heck was going on in the movie. It all just seemed so loosey-goosey tied together into a giant mess. Don't get me wrong, I love Isla Fischer, and I think she could have been great as Becky Bloomwood if the movie had followed the books more closely.I'm all for corny chick flicks, but this one just didn't do it for me. Love the books though - and I'd recommend reading those instead of wasting 2 hours of your life with this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"WISH I COULD RATE LESS THAN ONE STAR","review":"What a poor trick! This movie completely ruins the wonderful series of shopaholic story. Again, this cheap movie simply trashes the books!

I don't think it is even meant to be taken seriously since it is a light-hearted romantic comedy where you just kick off your shoes, grab a popcorn... relax, enjoy. If we will closely analize each character in all romantic comedies, I think the best of them won't even make sense... Like Notting Hill, You've Got Mail, While You Were Sleeping, Legally Blonde..., etc... they are awesome because they have their own silly, fun moments that will stay in your heart years down the road... It's honestly hard to enjoy a romantic comedy if you will scrutinize it as if it's a movie that has to make a whole lot of sense in every aspect... You just take the joy out of the fun ride doing so. Just view the movie as what it is... bruhaha and all... I'm sure it will make you appeciate it a tad more. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"I think Isla Fisher is adorable. This movie, on the other hand, was not. There was no chemistry between the main characters and I couldn't wait for the film to be over. Isla is a wonderful comedic actress and the poor script did not allow her to showcase her talents. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried Too Hard...","review":"I am a big fan of the 'Shopaholic' books. So I was very excited to hear they were making a movie based on the book series. However, i feel that the film tried too hard to condense the highlights of the first two books into this film. I don't think enough time was spent developing the characters of Rebecca Bloomwood and Luke Brandon. The film didn't flow nicely the way the books did. I feel they would have done better if they focussed on one book and did a faithful adaptation. Since they insisted on having the movie take place in New York then they should have focussed more on the second book in the series, 'Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.'While the script wasn't great, Isla Fisher was cute and Hugh Dancy was perfectly cast as Luke Brandon.

It uses air pressure so the harder you hit the surface the faster the wheels will spin. The wheels are modeled after the custom vehicle mags that spin even when the vehicle is at a stop. This is a novelty shoe and after a while will get old. This shoe would be great for kids. The only problems I have are with size vs color. The colors I want but not in the size I want and vise versa. A very limit selection of ladies sizes. I developed a squeak in my left shoe that's becoming annoying. With moving parts in the shoes this is going to happen. Still I'm happy with my selection and got a great deal on them considering their original price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"Excellent resource for collectors and dealers.

The disc drive is extremely loud and is a distraction. It sounds like a computer CD-ROM spinning at 52x. PAL discs play with severe stutter. The menu for playing media files is clumsy to the point of being unusable. I was never able to get audio output from any remote media files, even though DVD/CD audio played OK and the screen output seemed to think it was playing. The construction is poor and looks like a hobbyist put it together with poor fit and finish. Bottom line: poor construction and does not do what is advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who wants to gain an understanding of the psyche of the Iranians and why they feel so bitter towards the way the west has treated them and duped them out of hundreds of billions of dollars.

The seam gave away like it was held together with rubber cement. On both sheets, as I attempted to zip them up (the 1st time), the zipper completely separated. I was being as gentle as I could.Also, these things tear like a balloon that's been left out in the sun. The mattress barely made contact with the frame as I was putting back in place.

Even duct-taped as I did, I am dubious that the super-thin plastic it's made of will not tear with normal movement during usage.Update: JDC supply didn't like my review above, despite telling the raw truth, and offered to send me replacements saying the covers shouldn't have come apart that easily.

The quality of the lens is average and certainly useable, but it would be even better if you could change lenses on the fly to ones of different focal lengths ,such as a 110mm or 40mm to give you more options. Also I would like to see the option to change from 120 to 220 format in case I want to shoot more pics per roll. This is the case for Mamiya cameras of similar design. If my budget was so tight that I couldn't afford the used $300 Mamiya and I didn't want to deal with digital hassles, this Seagull GC-109 would definately be in the running for my camera dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"why would you buy this?","review":"Seriously I bought this camera used once a while back.

If you order this book with the little girl on the cover, you will get 157 pages of quips and quotes that could be interesting had I actually already read the real book.

These are Junk","review":"I purchase 4 of these at Costco. At first they were the kitty's behind!. Then one by one over the course of about 2 weeks of completely sporadic use, the tail switches failed to operate and the lights would not turn off. I was excited that the little light was so bright, efficient (good on batteries), and relatively inexpensive. They were made over seas in CHINA. The time and materials involved in manufacturing these were completely wasted, as the lights are useless w/o an off switch. The heavy plastic packaging used to safely transport these flashlights from CHINA to store shelves here in the US was also totally squandered. Disgusting really. I have since replaced these with a pair of Surefire taclights, which were Made in the USA! Boycott Coast and boycott goods made in CHINA that we can make here. If you don't need it, don't buy it -- unless, of course, it was made in the USA. Then buy all you can...

Most of that time I was a Reformed Baptist. I have read several books on infant baptism according to the Reformed view,though the other books were well done this book surpasses them. In an easy read conversational style writing, it brings many points \\"us\\" baptists believe under close examination. Well done --non threatening --I am now a believer in infant baptism and attending a Christian Reformed Church. I guess you can say I have become a \\"True Reformer\\" though this book. Excellent-I love the systemic approach Reformed Theology has and it is God's truth revealed. The book focuses more on the mode and the meaning of baptism ie. immersion (buried with Christ to new life) vs. the Holy Spirit being poured out upon the individual. Highly recommended to all you dear brothers and sisters in Christ who believe there is no biblical evidence for paedobaptism. This will challenge you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motivational speaker","review":"I bought this book because I heard the author speak at a function.

She has way of turning very tragic incidents into learning and life lessons that completely change her life. True story of a woman who was born with a blood problem - didn't receive transfusion for 12 hours which left her nearly completely deaf. She was treated like an outcast by family, friends, and school piers because her hearing loss went undetected until she was in 2nd grade. She attended a school for the deaf but later (too soon) was placed back in mainstream schools which put her back into more labeling and difficulties. Ultimately she weathers many very difficult/tragic events and turns lemons into lemonade and is now a very well known stand up comedian. It is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"shower curtain only - not a liner","review":"I bought this to use as a shower curtain liner around my clawfoot tub.

The book is not really an autobiography and is mainly taken up with Song Lyrics and where the songs came from what inspired them etc. Tom tells very little about his travels and rarely mentions the various artists that were around the coffee houses of the 60's.

The continuing adventures of Rickey and G-man as they continue to run their successful restaurant and navigate through New Orlean's life provides plenty of entertainment, but this book goes further and deals not only with racism and homophobia, but with the honest and candid ups and downs of a long term relationship and how it continues to grow and thrive amid careers, stress, and the doldrums. The emotional growth of the characters in this novel are realistic and dealt with poignantly, but without overwrought sentiment. Brite's prose continues to be razor-sharp and clean as a whistle, letting the characters shine through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good novel in the series.","review":"Any one that reads Poppy Z.

While this one is not the worst of the bunch, it is not anything to celebrate either. In summary: George goes over a friend's house to help the friend's mother bake cakes. When she leaves him alone for a few minutes he throws everything in the mixer and turns it on, creating a terrible mess. He is scolded and helps clean up the mess. Then he eats half a cake that has already been baked without permission. He is forgiven because he finds the mother's necklace, which she had lost, inside the cake. That's pretty much it. The new book lack the imaginative and sometimes educational tone of the originals, and it's a shame because I love George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is exactly what I wanted!","review":"A Real and complete bible.

It was great to see some of the characters from the first book back, and some new ones as well. Where as in the first book, Claire had to face Hell itself in a major battle, the enemies were a bit less intimidating in the Second Summoning. I think Austin is simply hilarious, even more so in the Second Summoning than Summon the Keeper. Byleth and Samuel both add more comedy to the story than before as well. Another good thing about this book is that Diana, Claire's younger sister, plays a larger role. She is really funny, and adds new twists into the story. The Second Summoning is a great read, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Summon the Keeper, or Tanya Huff's other works. If you are expecting a more 'fantasyish' type of fantasy, like Huff's Sing the Four Quarters books, you might be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the trilogy","review":"Claire Hanson is a Keeper---basically acting as a fulcrom to balance good and evil wherever she is summoned. She's accompanied by Austin, a senior citizen--who coincidentally is feline. In the first of the book, she's reunited with a former companion, Dean, a Bystander who she parted with when she realized that the life of a Keeper wasn't safe for 'bystanders.' The subsequent good feelings of their reunion creates an angel who is brought to Earth---without a summons to fulfill.All things having to be equal, Chaos spits out a demon in female form who is Samuel's counterpart. Add to the complexity, Diana who is Claire's more powerful younger sister, and you have a whole lot of tension going on.Huff is not known for her humor, but I think she should be. Of the three books (Summon the Keeper, Second Summoning and Long Hot Summoning) this book strikes the best balance between humor and plot.All in all, the whole series is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay attention to HELL and don't forget to feed the cat.","review":"Hooray!! Tanya Huff continues the story of Claire Hansen, a Keeper in 'The Second Summoning'. For those of you that haven't read 'Summon the Keeper', GO read that one first.. This is absolutely the best read that I've had in a long time. It doesn't help that my daughter kept asking what I was laughing so hard at.

You gotta love the Cat Austin - he really brings this book to life and it's his mission in life to keep the soppy moments in perspective and himself fed:)For a good laugh this is highly reccomended, but read \\"summon the keeper\\" by the same author to get the most out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Book In a Great Trilogy","review":"This book is the second in the series.

But how do you know if your dog likes it until you try it for a little while? Gave up trying to get a refund and gave it to our son and daughter-in-love and their dog loves it!

Unfortunately, screwing the bottom of the pole into the base was a BIG PROBLEM. The threaded bolt in the base had about an inch of threads, while the bottom of the pole had maybe 1/8\\" of threads, not nearly enough to hold the pole securely to the base. 3-4 turns and that's it. Needless to say, it's easily stripped, which I did. Rather than go to the trouble of returning it, I broke out the Gorilla Glue and it seems to have done the trick. But I shouldn't have had to do that. Would've been 5 stars except for that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gatco Pedestal TP Holder","review":"I was disappointed with this item.

You also find gold which you can save up to buy weapons, armor, etc. This game is worth buying because its really fun, and it is long, me and my cousin loved this game! we stayed up all night and day for about a week to beat it. I bet you will not beat it on your first try, but after a few more times you'll get the hang of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but below potential","review":"I expected much more. I played this just after Summoner2. The graphics in Baldur's gate were much less attractive, and the product felt a little canned due to the lack of choices in the game. The zoom-in map feature was good, but it was annoying that it couldn't be panned. The storyline was fine. Overall a mediocre experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from normal role-playing games","review":"This game is fun, if a bit easy. It's the first role-playing game I have EVER seen where it's more than one person can play at a time! Even if you can beat it in a few days, you can always invite someone who hasn't played it over to play it with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a waste of time..","review":"I finished this game in seven hours...I was expecting AT LEAST 20-30 hours of good solid gameplay. It looks like this was very rushed, and hardly any thought was put into it at all. To anybody looking to play this game, RENT IT. I started it on a saturday morning at 8am, and finished it by 2pm or so. It's really a short game...very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blockbuster's going to have to fight us for it","review":"My boyfriend rented this game a week ago and I haven't seen him since. Actually, that's not entirely true, but he has spent just about every spare minute playing. The game is very entralling and has seemingly endless levels of increasing difficulty. After watching him play for hours on end, I managed to pry the controller out of his hands just long enough to play it myself. It's sufficiently simple for a relatively novice gamer like me without losing the interest of a more experienced gamer like him. He doesn't know this yet, but I just bought him his own copy.My only complaint-besides having to compete for attention-is that some of the creatures are a bit weird, like the jello-like blobs. I'm not quite sure what they're supposed to be. Even still the game is very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all, a good game.","review":"This is a fun, entertaining game with lots of action, but not a lot of variety. Basically, you're doing the same thing over and over: hacking and slashing. Has a Diablo kind of feel to it, as many reviewers have stated, so if you're expecting this to be like Baldur's Gate for the computer, you might be dissapointed.Great feature is that you can play two players at the same time, adding to the fun. My brother and I played through it in four days, so it's not particularly challenging, but it was engaging and quite addictive.The one drawback to the game is the storyline. It's totally convoluted and makes no sense. Things do not connect, giving you a logical story arch with a satisfying resolution. The characters seemingly get involved in missions at random and I couldn't fathom why the main characters even continued on their quest. But aside from that confusion, the actual gameplay was engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the PC version - but fast and fun","review":"To start - if your expecting the game to play like the PC version of Baldur's Gate, then you will be way off the mark. When it started I was disapointed - but that quickly changed. What the game lacks in RPG depth, it makes up for in speed, fun and pure gameplay. 2 minutes into the game I was hooked, and quickly spent the rest of the night playing this game. It's mostly hack and slash type gaming, but the graphics, sounds and suroundings are just awesome. There are interactions with other characters, but it's pretty one dimensional - so don't expect a lot of roll playing value here.I'm rating this as a 5 star, because it's just pure fun, and a great game that my girlfriend enjoys playing with me - what more could I ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring game","review":"I rented this game and lost interest in it before my rental was up. I actually got the final level and realized i had no reason to continue playing. The story becomes uninteresting very quickly. Graphics are good. Control is good. Dialogue is unbearably boring. Levels are redundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"OHHH MYYYY THIS IS A SWEEET GAME!","review":"Excellence comes along only a few times a year and hear you have it BGDA has everything I turn my system on for. Great graphics, excellent sound, great storyline, and awesome gameplay. I was playing this game alone at the start until my nephew came by and we could not take it out of the machine. Characters are constantly in change and the challenge is excellent. A light RPG atmosphere, the most similiar game I can compare it to is Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. Another title that was ahead of its time. You will play it for hours and beg for more. When you do beat it will you be disappointed its over, and not relieved. You can start all over with the same characteristics you ended with and continue to build your character for the obvious sequel that will follow. Hopefully they will allow you to take your character and load him into the sequel. I have been waiting for games like this and hope this will only lead to more of the same. MASTERPIECE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Anyone who was drawn in by the depth of the PC Baldur's Gate Game will hate it. I thought, \\"Wow, a Baldur's Gate Game for the PS2!\\" and I bought it. Then I could only choose one of three pre-built characters, which lacked my favorite, thief. Then everything went downhill. I just ran around fighting anything I saw move. I hear complaints on how short it is but I wouldn't know, I quit it one hour into the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original","review":"I was pretty disappointed by Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance. I love the PC Baldur's Gate series for everything that is missing from the PS2 version. The characters are hardly customizable. The story line is fixed and rigid. There is little sense of adventure nor of ownership of character as in the PC versions of Baldur's Gate. The hack and slash style of this game requires no thought or stategic planning as did the older versions. I am pretty disappointed because I was looking forward to this game for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is DAA BOOMMMBB","review":"This game is cool, I beat the whole game, the gauntlet, extreme mode, i even got the onyx sword with does 90-140 damage which is daaaa bomb and Drizzt is a unknown char u can get from cheat codes, he can fight with 2 swords in his hands which he is da bomb also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldur's Gate?? Are you sure?","review":"Well after hearing some great reviews about Baldur's gate from a friend i decided to rent the ps2 version.Well, what can i say? I beat the entire game in 2 days. Yes. in easy mode, but still..geez.Anywayz, i talked to my friend and i guess this game is missing all the spiffy role-playing elements that make Baldur's Gate so great.So i ask you, why the hell make a ps2 version of a game but then fail to make it actually like the Baldur's Gate games?A waste of money if you bought this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a weekend of fun.","review":"I'm not really a gamer, so i'll say this. It atleast got me playing untill the end. However, i RENTED this game and BEAT IT before i even had to turn it back in. So it gets 1 star for keeping me playing untill the end...but the end was too near. There really wasn't much to it.So yes, finally, i beat a game. Yah for me. However even i know a horrible game when i see one. Its not worth the money. Rent it if you must because you probably won't have it longer then that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when could magic missiles miss?","review":"I enjoyed Baldur's Gate I and II for the PC, for hack and slash \\"rpgs\\" they were immersive, and while not as fun as sitting around the table with my friends and my dice, they were a good waste of time. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is different. I picked it up because it was cheap, and I'm kind of a nerd and collect Forgotten Realms stuff, and it did say it followed 3rd edition rules. Right. What I got was one of the worst games money could buy that basically, in my opinion, made fun of d&d. And the magic missiles... I missed a lot with them in this game...in d&d they can't miss. Period. This game was awful... I miss games that had a plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"is this for you!","review":"If you play PS2 games you will love this!

I read many reviews and completed all the practice tests and essays. After exhausting Barrons, Princeton, and Kaplan..all of which were helpful in one way or another my mom bought me this book.I opened it up, eager for a little more practice. Being already familiar with the AP format, I quickly realized this book was way off base. Sure it talks about world history, but not in the same focus or emohasis as the ap test. Furthermore the multiple choice questions are weird and ridiculous. This book really will not help you at all. After reading the first chapter and some practice questions i was fed up and returned the book.

The most popylar by far is \\"Man with Hex\\" giving a swing beat with the theme of the movie Labyrinth with David Bowie's rendition of \\"Dance Magic Dance\\". The songs flow right into eachother with fast pased swing with songs like Spanish Fly, Catfish Ball and the perfect end to the cd with \\"devil is Dancing\\" This cd is long out of print and hard to find, if you dont own it already, get while you still can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunkley is God!","review":"First off, let me say... WOW!!! This guy's voice is by far the most creative, powerful, and ear-bending thing, out there, to date. It carries this band to heights otherwise unattainable. The lyrics are also perfect for his style. Don't let the fact that his songs have appeared in major motion pictures steer you away from this mega singer/song writer. He is far from commercial fodder. Rather, in this day and age of poprock nonsense, he may very well become the godfather of resurrected American music. Anything this man puts within his powerful pipes would surely turn into artistic gold! Here's hopin' for more Bunkley!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking tunes that really swing ya!!","review":"The Atomic Fireballs rock on their first album debut. They are sweet in concert and bring that energy on to their album. The swinging picks up with Man With A Hex, and keeps swinging through the final track. The only reason the album doesn't deserve five stars is because there are only eight songs. The Atomic Fireballs rank right up there with other swing bands like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue. If you're into swing this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Find","review":"This book will greatly aid you in your study of the Bible. It is easy to understand and most useful.

They have created a fantastic well-thought out setting with interesting character races, thought-provoking prestige classes and, best of all, one of the most unusual worlds ever to be created for D&D (Although it can potentially be used with any d20 game). In addition the artwork is very nice and complements the book well.That being said, this book is not your typical D&D \\"medieval\\" setting. It has more of the feel of the old (out of print) role-playing game Skyrealms of Jorune in that Bastion Press has created a truly unique world.It has a tiny flavour of Ravenloft in that characters are brought and imprisoned here, but it is not a horror roleplaying game otherwise.Because it is so unique some people may not like it, but if you want something which is definately not your run of the mill \\"medieval\\" fantasy realm then give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"the quran women and the modern socity","review":"thee cover on the book the quran women and the modern socity is very ugle. the book cover needs a new designer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This cutting tool worked great for my son's pinewood derby car.

While a lot of the chord progressions, melodies, and even lyrics have a distinctly country feel, there is none of the unpleasant \\"twang\\" that I personally associate with most country music.

No in depth analyses of the stars or movies are in here although there are a few paragraphs on a select few. How is George Clooney an action star? It seems the author is gong for increased sales by including a popular star and favourite of many women but to say he is an action star, please. Why this book is laid out like a textbook is anyone's guess. I guess the publishers took one look at the substance and said there are better similar books out there in the entertainment category, such as 1000 Movies to Watch Before You Die, so we'll try something different and try for education but they failed. Give this a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is suppose to know action right?","review":"This book is nice to have but It just pisses me off. He blantaly does not know what he is talking about.

I bought the original recipe treats here because the premium was too expensive. What I recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust (Amazon shipped it thrown in with several books, with no padding around it). One of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces (the other dog would eat sawdust if I offered it to him), which makes me think they have gone bad.

And my guess is that once wireless home networks are faster (they'll have to be much faster), this dream will become a reality. But right now, it can't happen -- unless you're talking about smaller files. The transfer speeds over a home wireless network are too slow to make this a practical solution -- certainly for large files. What's more, the Maxtor is noisy. Very noisy. The noise wouldn't be a problem if you were just turning on the drive periodicaly (to save or grab something), but if it's to fill the role of readily available shared storage, it has to be on quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using for music streaming","review":"PROS:This maxtor Shared storage Plus is compatable with the ROKU Soundbridge music streaming device. I bought both together, and filled up the maxtor with mp3s. When I turn on the ROKU, it finds the Maxtor drive on the network and streams up the music via the ROKUs wifi link. The ROKU plugs into any stereo, and has its own display of song info and remote control.This is great beacuse now my computer does not need to be on to listen to music. Now I dont need to use Microsoft windows mediastreaming service, which ties up a lot of RAM on a computer otherwise.You can plug in old USB drives into the maxtor, which makes them available on the network, (But not available to stream music from).CONSThe maxtor takes longer to transfer files to than a normal USB2.0 drive since it is going through your network.The green light on the front of the unit is always blinking sporadically even when your not accessing the drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little noisy and not quite 500GB, otherwise fine","review":"The drive is pretty noisy when not in standby mode. So you'll want to tuck it away somewhere (near a network connection, of course).I've had mine for a couple of months now, and no problems. I haven't tried the print server option, nor have I daisy-chained another hard drive. The basic operation as a shared file server is working fine, however.Setting up the drive was extremely simple. You basically just plug it into your router or network switch. Build quality seems good, too.My main gripe with this drive is that, while advertised as \\"500 GB\\", it's actually only \\"465 GB\\". Out of the box, if you show the properties of the drive in Windows, this is what it says. This is how much you can store on the drive. 465 GB is equivalent to 500 billion bytes, but this is definitely not the same thing as 500 GB (1 KB = 1024 bytes, and so on). Maxtor knows this; they are in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine seized up after one month","review":"I have no idea why but it just stopped working.

I know, because my previous Maxtor external drive is still percolating away after nearly five years. However, I outgrew it, which is when I made the mistake of getting *this* unit. After a few config problems, I got it working for my Mac and one of the PCs -- for all of four weeks, after which the drive apparently committed suicide (after emitting a series of noises I hope never to hear from a HDD again). It's still under warranty, so I could in theory ship this unit back and get another one, but I lose the data that way; if this is the best the Seagate-owned iteration of Maxtor can do, I'm better off popping the case and seeing whether there's enough disk left to attempt a rescue on.

It's such a letdown after such a long wait. Pebbles and Marbles is okay but everything else is unacceptable, unless you're one of the non-objective fans for whom Phish can do no wrong, or in serious denial. When you see positive reviews that post excuses (\\"you have to remember that Phish just came out of a two-year hiatus\\" or \\"you have to listen to it a few times\\") you know it's a bad album. I tried playing it at work and the consensus was it's a horrible album. I wouldn't try this album if you're wanting to check Phish out. However if you can spin a cacophonious mess into positive asset (i.e. showing the versatility of the band, beautiful lyrical imagery, etc.) then go for it.

Phish reportedly spent two weeks writing and recording this album; all I can say is, they should have spent four - at least then they'd be able to drop some of the tedious odes to tequila and random jamming that make this disc a yawn. One has to admire their confidence in assuming they could crank out something good and get going right away, but there are times even a revered jam band ought to pause and consider that their poor fans need some quality to hang their hats on, especially from a studio release when the band could have taken a bit more care if they felt like it. Sounds like they didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Phish creativity and originality","review":"Solid jams filter through most songs on this album. Very easy on the ears as far as simple chord structures and basic rock and roll tunes. But, this CD lacks the Phish creativity and originality that makes Phish Phish. It seems like they got together for 4 days, came up with some new riffs, decided to add words, recorded these jams, and made a CD out of a jam session. The Epic tunes that take you through many emotions such as YEM, Reba, Antelope, and many others may be history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best work to date...","review":"This CD is of dubious production value, but that gives it the same charm as live material.

P & M, Seven Below, and Waves are the only tracks even worth listening to. Not that they're even that great. They just arent awful. phish should be embarrassed by this album. You know all those \\"OK\\" Phish albums? this makes any one of those shine with brilliance. There is absolutely NO coherence to this album. It was not concieved AT ALL, it was just thrown out like a product on a shelf. If you folks consider this a \\"Good\\" album, I think its time you start exploring the rest of what the world of music has to offer.

The answer to that question would be....VERY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty","review":"Sadly, this is probably the most disappointed I've ever been with a CD purchase. The songs are just plain bad and good playing does not cover up that fact. If you absolutely must own everything Phish has ever done, please make this the very last one. What did they spend making this record, 3 days? Seriously, it doesn't sound like even that much time was devoted to it.

I was obviously very excited for its release, since the band has not put out a studio album in two years. However, I'm sad to say that Phish has moved in a different direction from their previous albums.The vocals are raw, even weak, and the jamming is incoherent. I believe there should at least be one great song on every CD, but as hard as I tried, I could not find one on Round Room. My advice is not to buy this album. I find it painful to sit through the entire CD, and one can only hope that Phish won't play any of these new songs one their upcoming tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Phish music in my opinion...","review":"I picked up \\"Round Room\\" this afternoon. Now I'm not a die-hard Phishead by any means, but I do enjoy their music, particularly Page's awesome keyboard work as I play keyboards myself. Anyway, my personal favorite Phish albums are those from Junta up to Hoist, and it seems like every album released after Hoist has seemed to be just a little more \\"un-Phishlike\\" than the album before, and Round Room, in my opinion, is no exception. To me, comparing \\"Round Room\\" to albums like \\"Picture of Nectar\\" and \\"Rift\\" is just like comparing DMB's \\"Everyday\\" to his \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" and \\"Crash\\" albums...that signature sound from the earlier albums just seems to be missing in the later albums. I didn't find anything particularly appealing on Round Room, which is a big difference from Phish's earlier albums on which I really like pretty much every track. But that's just my two cents..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the old energy?","review":"I have been a phish fan for a long time and enjoyed their concerts more than any other band. Hearing aboutthe return of phish and the release of a new album made me very excited. This new album unfortunately is pitiful in comparison to previous efforts. The fun loving goofy phish lyrics of the past are replaced by boring, unclever songwriting. There is also a complete absence of an impressive jam/composition like \\"Run\\", or \\"Reba\\", or \\"Guyute\\", \\"Hood\\" etc etc etc etc. Where is the effort? Nothing special whatsoever. I still love them and will travel to see them anyday, BUT this better not be the final studio effort...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The album that made me stop reccomending Phish","review":"This album is a waste of time. Phish could have paid attention to song structure, innovation, and technique, but instead, they simply jumped the gun and release a pile of sub par songs that have no tension and release as they used to in the older days of Phish. Walls of the Cave could have been interesting if, number one, the jam actually went anywhere instead of pleaying the same chord over and over, and two, if a sizeable part of it wasn't such a blatant Genesis ripoff. There are also songs on here that belong on Trey's crappy solo albums that are simply music for people that posess but one criteria for a good song: that you can dance to it. This album is shallow music and sadly, marks the end of my support of Phish."},{"rating":"1","title":"?????","review":"What happened to the rocking jams? A little disappointed by the slowness of this album. Hopefully the tour will be a little more lively. Good album to slow dance to I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"This album is terrible. To me, this ablum sounds like exactly what is is -- something concieved, written, and recorded in four days. The lyrics are awful. \\"Mexican cousin\\" is painful to listen to. This tribute to tequila might be appropriate on a new Sammy Hagar album, but as a Phish song it just dosen't work.I've been a long-time fan and I am egar to see Phish this tour, but I hope they leave most of these new songs on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album.....Different yes, Listen to it more than once!!","review":"When hearing this album for the first time I was a little nervous. I listened to the whole album straight through and just kind of sat at my desk waiting for some thoughts, but I had none. So I played it again and there it was, the feeling, the buzz, the dream while still awake. I knew that Phish was back and better than ever. They have matured and went beyond just playing games and having fun. They obviously are still having fun with the song written by Gordon, \\"Mock Song.\\" This album shows their maturity and their ability to jam butkeep it controled. There are times when they jsut play notes in their live shows, but here they keep it mellow and controled but also so beautiful at the same time. This album is great and I hope people listen to it more than once before they judge it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i love love jam bands, especially phish. but i do not love this album. anyone who knows anything about phish knows that this band's specialty is their live performances and not their studio albums. i'd prefer to listen to a live phish cd any day over one of their studio albums. but, as a huge phish fan i of course bought their new album to hear what i'd be hearing at future shows and i do not like it. this is the first time that i have picked up one of phish's new cd's and actually not looked forward to hearing one of the songs live. I was so siked to hear the stuff that phish has been doing over hiatus and i was expecting something really sick but instead it was just disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking??","review":"Trey & co. must've had precious little time for this one. The whole thing sounds rushed - hacked out in the studio and almost NO production whatsoever, it is a LONG departure from Farmhouse (Farmhouse is probably Phish's studio gem, IMHO). Sorry guys, they can't all be winners... One note, though - \\"46 Days\\" is a good cut, but I wouldn't spend the whole $15 on one song. Buy it used if you want to experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible comeback","review":"After three times i still thinks it is the worst one to date. I really hope it grows on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting day in jamband history","review":"Just as everyone else probably reading this is, I was extremely excited when Phish finally released a new album. I rushed to the record store and could hardly get home to listen to it. Round Room is perhaps Phish's greatest attempt yet at conveying their live sound on a studio album. It still holds the same great Phish sounds, with the flowing jams and flawless grooves. It's great to realize that Phish will never lose their unique sound, no matter how long their hiatis. It lacks some of the catchy melodies and lyrical beats of some of their other albums, but this is perhaps a good thing. I believe we were all a little afraid after Farmhouse that Phish would become a radio band with shorter songs and catchier beats, but this album puts all our fears to rest, as it goes back to their older sound, with longer songs and smoother grooves."},{"rating":"2","title":"phish has matured rather well","review":"this is just a beautiful disc, perfect for sunday morning with a cup of coffee and a soft rain or snow falling otside.the band sounds very relaxed, mature, and in control of the emotional flow that this disc represents, it also has a nice humorous side as well, a phish trade mark,.i feel this disc will seperate the true phans who love phish's dreamy side ,from the youngsters who just want to go to the shows, trip out and act like knuckleheads.. i cant take this off my disc player..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phish has nothing left to say","review":"Phish has become the masters of making money for nothing. After releasing a flurry of live albums, they offer up this CD touting the fact that it was put together in four days.Well let me be the first to say; it sounds like it.The songs have no soul, little groove, and the lyrics frequently sound like a feeble attempt at the rhyme game (\\"what rhymes with 'burned'?...'learned'...OK, let's go with that\\").It is unfortunate, because I expected that their time apart would help them incorporate their new influences into the band. But I don't hear it.All of their studio albums (aside from Farmhouse) have offered interesting twists on the Phish sound. This one offers nothing new, nothing interesting.As the title says...I'm starting to wonder if Phish has anything left to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but good.","review":"Round Room is definitely different, though it does seem to take on some of the quieter softer aspects from some of their other albums (Rift, Story of the Ghost, Billy Breathes). It does have a lot of strange, nontraditional sounding melodies, chords and notes, which I definitely like. It also has a somewhat unpolished, live recorded feel to it which I think is great. Phish's funky side is not really apparent on this recording, but the melodies and rythms are nonetheless captivating. The main thing I like about this album is that it does not grab you right off the bat. I've only listened to it about 4 times, but I feel it will be one of those albums that you will need to listen to many times before you can really appreciate it. I'm really looking forward to see how they'll play this new stuff at MSG and Hampton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish is Back!","review":"It was a two year period of nervousness, anticipating Phish's return. It is clear from this album that they have grown musically, and have benefited from their hiatus from the touring circuit.Round Room harkens back to the raw Phish, the Phish that thrives on live performance and spontaneity. 46 Days shows that they haven't lost their talent for creating a groove and riding it out to its fullest. Friday is the quintissential ballad, showing their prowess for both melody and improvisation. Walls of the Cave takes the listener back to Rift and hints at their former focus on orchestration and perfection, while keeping their new loose style at the fore. All in all, a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"Possibly the most comprehensive Phish album to date. While it lacks some of the improvisational flare of Lawn Boy and Junta, it ranks right up there in my book. The band's side projects prove to be influential, as jazz and funk undertones drive the album. Pick this one up for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I've been listenin to Phish since 1994, and I have always loved their music. While I gravitate towards their live material, Round Room is about as live you can get in the studio. Even though their are a few clams here and there, Round Room is a snapshot in their history. It was the first time they played together in over two years. I think Waves, Wall of the Cave, Friday, Seven Below are some of the best tunes they've written. And to think that they recorded this in four days is unbelievable. I don't know a band out there that could do that. Maybe Miles Davis or John Coltrane, but they're dead. This cd is a must-own for anyone who appreciates creative and inspiring music that is totally in the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Really Gets Going","review":"I love Phish music and don't bash stuff just for perverse fun. I also own and enjoy all their other studio releases.But honestly, this is not a good cd. It never really gets going. Each song sounds like a laidback intro. I kept waiting for the \\"real song\\" to kick in. After a few minutes the next \\"intro\\" starts. It sounds to me like Trey and Mike are trying so hard not to get in each others way that they end up doing nothing. And the lyrics. Yikes. Frequently a little loopy, here they are embarassingly hippy-dippy.I guess this is a glimpse into why it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubble","review":"I am a casual Phish Phan.As such, this CD is quite tortuous to get through.

Let it be said however that this is a great album. This is one of the best Phish albums out there. I have seen them live and loved it, and I listened to past albums and liked them.The reason that I felt the need to comment however is this: This is a great album stand alone. Of the reviewers that enjoyed this album very few seem to be willing to state that, and I almost didn't get this as a result. Completely outside the context of Phish's other work (although it can be seen in that context) it is a great album with suburb musicianship, killer songs, and a rawness and energy that some of there other recent albums have lacked (not to say that well executed style isn't something I don't enjoy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but they could have much better","review":"Ok, i know that most fans are dissapointed with Round Room and i cant say that im not. However, I cant say the cd is a complete loser. Maybe its because I havent heard them since they went on hiatus. But in any case, there are some songs that are delightful to listen to. \\"46 Days\\" is an amazing song though it does seem it needed more time in the recording studio. The bottom line- If you have the money and nothing better to spend it on, get Round Room. If not, dont bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Phish Album Ever...","review":"I mean come on. I have been there with Phish, seen 70+ shows, breathed there music for years. But do people think this is really \\"fresh\\" or \\"groundbreaking\\"? There are maybe 3 songs that would be worth seeing live, the rest forgettable. The lyrics are good dont get me wrong, but what these guys are capable of musically is absent from this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Round Room is a poor substitute for the Farmhouse","review":"Round Room is a fantastic album, but it cannot live up to its predecessor, Farmhouse. Farmhouse, like Hoist and Picture of Nectar, withheld from the longer jams, and for good reason. Wouldn't it [be boring] to hear the same twenty minute jam over and over again? For example, the Tweezer on a Live One is a torturous 30 minutes long, and although the quality rocks, I know it by heart. All in all, I love the song structure on Round Room,... and the jamminess of this album leaves a lot to be desired. Keep the jams on the stage, and the hooks ringing in my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the sap?","review":"This album has five pretty great songs; Pebbles and Marbles which has sappy, stupid lyrics but an amazing jam that makes up for it; Seven Below, which has sappy, stupid lyrics but a great jam; 46 Days, which is one of the best Phish songs ever; Walls of the Cave which has stupid, but not sappy lyrics and an amazing jam that makes up for it; and the concluding track, Waves, which is altogether fantastic. Just for the record, I'm a huge Phish fan. The songs Gordon wrote, Round Room and Friday, flat out \\"are bad\\". All the other songs \\"are bad\\" in the way the song Billy Breathes \\"is bad\\". So, some of the jams are great. But overall, this album \\"is bad\\". I really wanted it to be a good one and now I'm ashamed for having been such a huge fan in the past.

After a few listens, which I didn't enjoy, it's scrap plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"phu-get-about-it","review":"Having been a fan since 1994', I find this effort to be a big departure for the band and a dissappointment for me personally. The songs are mostly soft sounding ballads and lack the risk taking elements that have defined Phish in the past. Had the ballads been more in the vein of 'Billy Breathes' or 'Strange Design', I would have welcomed them but these songs are not of that caliber. I have heard that this album was thrown together from impromptu practice sessions for the upcoming tour. I can believe that, as it sounds unplanned and amateurish. If this is the future, I'll be on moe. tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and sloppy","review":"This has got to be Phish's most ridiculous album ever released. Hopefully the members of Phish will put some of the proceeds from this album into taking voice lessons, purchasing a guitar tuner, and finding a producer to give them better guidance. It's very disappointing to see this group putting out this type of drivel when they have the capability of doing so much more . The only thing keeping this from being a 1-star review is that they at least made an attempt to create a raw-sounding record with few overdubs and a \\"live\\" feel, but it just comes across as sloppy and unrefined. Very poor writing throughout, aimless noodling, and bad musicianship make this album laughable. Perhaps Phish should consider a permanent hiatus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"As a longtime Phish fan, I am very disappointed in this album. I found the songs annoyingly similar and bland and hardly representative of live Phish as many other reviews I've read have stated. With the exception of a few moments on this disk, the sound is a wash of noodle-y guitar and uninspired vocals.If your favorite parts of Phish are the superlative musicality and creativity of Mike, Trey, Jon, and Page, then you can do better with any of their other offerings.I'm afraid even the magic of Phish's live performances will not be sufficient to improve these exceedingly mediocre songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"obfuscatory","review":"The book tries to make things simple and fails miserably. The round-about explainations are confusing. The maladroit, verbose language obfuscates what they are trying to impart.

What ahould be simple and direct is convolved (no pun intended) into meandering examples unworthy of the name, the point of which often a mystery even to those who are very experienced with ODEs, and obfuscatory verbosity. I'm baffled as to how they book's author (or anyone) thought this might be a useful style. If you are a Professor, then please be nice to the kids and don't use this.

The book is very comprehensive in teaching all aspects of DE's. However, the book is very dry and difficult to get through. The worst thing is that is impossible to get through this book without some supplemental material. For examples, the book uses proofs instead of examples that can be applied to the homework several times. In addition the examples on countless occassions are like it can be shown through some simple calculations(which they won't show you)(it skips steps) that you can get to some other formula and you're like how did they do that? In addition the notation/symbols they use are not defined all the time, and this leads to extra confusion when trying to learn something new.

When our first attempts at sweating copper pipes failed, we looked to this book and found very thorough instructions on each step of the process. The information on different types of solder and flux with a wider working temperature range was especially valuable. As a result, our next attempt with the copper connections was successful. The section on installing a pedestal sink was very clear and helpful, as was the information on choosing a toilet. The book also helped us diagnose and solve a problem with water hammer.

Along with a quick online service sign-up, you are set to go (including installation) in your car within 30 minutes of purchase. Their customer service is also EXCELLENT if you have questions and want to talk to a real person. The choice of channels is top rate, especially being able to hear CNN and other news casts live. This proves invaluable during an emergency where you are connected to a global viewpoint rather than your local stations periodically breaking into the commercials and songs. It is small, professional looking, and easy to operate with a customized background color- you choose it. I was extremely impressed with the price for all that you get. I thought satellite radio was far too expensive, but it is now affordable. You cannot go wrong with this product. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reception - very portable","review":"I bought the Roady without knowing much about it. The SkyFi seemed too pricey, and the price for the car kit was outrageous. I went with the Roady because of the lower price for getting it into the car.Once I put the Roady in the car, I loved it so much I wanted to listen to it at home. I found at a home kit wasn't available (that's why only four stars). By doing a little research on the web, I found that as long as you were able to move the antenna from your car to your home, it was an easy fix if you have decent stereo speakers and a universal power supply.I now listen to the Roady in between Morgantown and Pittsburgh, PA all the time, and it's a delight to be able to hear the rebroadcast of all the Sunday talk shows on C-Span Radio in the afternoon.If the roady had a home kit available (with a second antenna) and it came with a remote (although the extra $15 is reasonable) it would be perfect.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"XM Rocks, Delphi Roadi Stinks","review":"XM is the best thing to happen to radio ever.

I have just had to make arrangements for replacing my second defective unit in only 3 months. The first had output jack connection issues after 5 weeks. The second's display died after 6 weeks. I rarely move it from the car. I will give it one last try with a third unit. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show shame about the lack of extras","review":"This is an excellent end to the series. The only downside is the lack of any extras on the DVD.

There are lots of teeth grindingly difficult to watch bits - so as long as you have a cushion to hide behind you'll be fine. The special starts where the second series finished with our anti-hero, Gervais, still feeling hard done by regarding his successful TV show.Gervais doesn't let up on himself here and his character moves through a steady downward spiral until his C grade status as a performer is fully realised on Celebrity Big Brother. The final scene in the BB house is worth the price of the entire DVD.I won't go on and on, it's good. I don't think that it cops out and there is some very funny, and stinging stuff in there. Including an amusing cameo from George Michael."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to a very good series","review":"The ending to Extras is just as good as the ending to The office.

There's a little angel-like picture of the cat with angel wings leaving each time the cat dies. It's interesting but oftentimes, I think a little much for the toddlers. There's a bunch of info in this book that makes it fun to discover and explore and actually, I think the artwork is better than the actual story. The idea behind this is good, but I think I agree with the other reviewers that more and equal focus should be placed on the story itself, and not just in the illustrations. My favorite part is seeing what's going on behind the scenes in the illustrations alongside the pages.It's a nice book but maybe look for another one of Brett's books if you're reading this to a toddler. It's not as entertaining as say her Gingerbread Baby book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little macabre","review":"Sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but I was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book. Maybe I should have expected such based on the title, but I found it unsettling nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death is not charming","review":"I agree with the reviewer who found this macabre.

All other chapters are on growing fresh cut herbs. Most herb growers fail because they do not market their product intensely enough. This book does not help in that regard. Just growing it won't get it sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent basis for discussion","review":"This book outlines techniques for arguing and understanding your partner pretty well. It has some detail about things you and your partner can do to spice up your relationship and open lines of communication. However if you are looking for a serious in depth book to heal deep wounds this book does not stretch that far. I know some things are only for counselors to fix but I have read other books that have gone into more detail when it comes to specific relationship problems. This book also downplays some issues that I would consider serious problems in a troubled relationship. All in all this is a decent book to start anaylizing your situation with, but it wont save you the expensive therapy trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best in Classic Rock Sheet Music : Piano, Vocal, Chords&#65533;","review":"This is rather a criticism about the way in which you present the book \\"The Best in Classic Rock Sheet Music : Piano, Vocal, Chords\\" .One cannot understand the actual content of the book without an excerpt or sample of its pages.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless...","review":"This 2002 release is a remastered 15 song retrospective of his 5 Epic albums. It includes a 16 page booklet with liner notes and photos. The diversity of his music is amazing. Clive Davis gave Winter lots of money and full musical freedom to sign with Epic which Edgar took full advantage of. His first stage leaned heavily in a jazz vein, and then he entered his second stage by forming White Trash with the extraordinary vocal talents of Jerry La Croix. White Trash was sort of a cross between Blues Brothers style blues and Sly & the Family Stone with a mix of rock, soul, blues and \`honest to goodness' gospel. Then he went into a pop/rock direction with his electronic rock smash \\"Frankenstein\\". Various musicians who played in the different incarnations include Rick Derringer, Ronnie Montrose, Dan Hartman, Tommy Shannon and his brother Johnny. One thing that all these different styles of music do share is that they are all sound timeless. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case for work outs!","review":"I use this case to clip onto my waist when I work out.

Throughout this philosophical lecture-filled book, this decorated Vice Admiral sprinkles historical naval decisions to underline his points.This is recommended for those who believe in the careful study of history and the wisdom of those who pass them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed, incomplete selections","review":"James is wonderful and to the extent that this volume contains many of his important writings, it is wonderful. However, because the volume does not include the crucial \\"Essays in Radical Empiricism\\" or the key chapters/essays from either \\"Principles of Psychology\\" or \\"The Will to Believe\\" it is very incomplete. Readers interested in James would do better to pick up a copy of the \\"Writings of William James\\" edited by John J. McDermott (whose own introduction to James is also far superior to that of the editor of this volume)."},{"rating":"2","title":"James should be in everyone's library","review":"William James is a national treasure. So this book, which was realtivly inexpensive and contains almost of all of his important work with the exception of principles in pyschology, is an excellent addition to a home library. However, the pages are bible thin and the book is dense for its portable size, making it a little wonky on the ergonomics. still worth having, but it requires a little care in handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Readable Economics Text","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be packed with Laffer curves and consumption functions and would make technical economic theories simple. It instead is one of the most layman-readable economics texts that I have read. Outstanding coverage of the areas of economics that truly matter, and those that would be deemed relevant to the non-economist. Those who enjoyed Milton Freidman's Capitalism and Freedom would find this text equally readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best available guide on laissez faire economics.","review":"The title is indeed an apt one. In the course of 167 pages, Jim Cox is able to prove the potential of free market economics, as well as show some of the many flaws of existing economic systems. The book is tremendously uplifting for anyone who has questioned the feasability of a libertarian laissez faire economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a readable and an informative guide to economics.","review":"Jim Cox has provided an excellent tool to enable readers to more clearly understand the free market and just how crucially it is tied to our liberty. Cox writes in a way that is understandable, interesting, and thought-provoking. I believe Cox has well accomplished his purpose of helping his readers to grasp some difficult economic topics including price controls, heroic insider trading, and the market versus the command economy. Cox includes an overview of the schools of economic thought, the Great Depression, and a history of economic thought. The reader is provided with excellent references for each chapter for more detailed study. I especially like the quote from Milton Friedman at the beginning of the book: \\"Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.\\" I believe Jim Cox's work will help the reader understand how important economics is to freedom and our way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Biased.","review":"This book is fine if you want a very concise explanation of different topics in economics, however in many sections it is obviously very biased. Instead of offering only the facts and analyses it deliberately attempts to persuade the reader into siding with the authors view on topics. eg the section on inflation repeatedly refers to inflation as \\"theft\\" and \\"stealing\\". Although some may in fact agree with the wording, when teaching economics the author should attempt to stay as neutral as possible. In summary, although the book is fine for the initial explanation of each topic in economics, it is very biased towards one school of though or another. Would not recommend for those wanting a real education in economics as the author often displays only on point of view on topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show Stopper","review":"I cant tell you how much I enjoyed the original model back in the early 70's.

I came across a decent one tonight, and THIS IS NOT IT. The lead singer is flat, tries to imitate Stevie's and Christie's voice, but falls quite short (even on her face - did people encourage her a little too much in her singing? Sometimes when listening to these albums I note that although they aren't the real thing (who can ever be but the originals?), they could do well with their own works. Sorry to the singers on this, but if singing lessons are in the future and not insulting the real band by the \\"tribute\\", you could have a future.

I hope in the future Gordan will consider leaving out all the boring parts. I also hope he will keep his high paced action too. So overall it was a fairly good book with only a couple of draw backs. So i hope you enjoy it as much as i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Older Book Worth Searching For","review":"There are two main threads of interest in this novel. The first is the strange overlay of Western law enforcement methods on the earlier Japanese equivalent of how to run down the perpetrator of a homicide. The second is that of a dysfunctional family and how it continues to function in a society that is still partly the Japan of the ronin era but now definitely emersed in the twenty-first century. As a psychological mystery, this one is first rate. As a \\"whodunnit\\" it will probably disappoint the average Western reader, with an ending that is really surprising but hard to accept as possibly happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid premise for a work of fiction","review":"While the setting of the story is interesting, the basic premise of the book is stupid. There are too many characters in the books and because it is a translation, whatever possible charm or interest in could have had in the original Japanese has been lost. It was so horrible and confusing, I found it implausible and impossible to read to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"READING THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU WISH YOU COULD BRING THE OLD DAYS BACK","review":"Reading this book will make you wish you could bring back the old days -- when people had manners, dressed appropriately, and knew the difference between men and women. It is a great read. They did so many things differently back then: dressing, grooming, socializing. I love the part where it says that you should wash your hair at least every two weeks, and calls women's trousers \\"masculine attire.\\" I did find it amusing that the author seems obsessed with \\"party dresses.\\" I guess people went to more parties back then; they certainly knew that you should dress up when you attended one. I know the Bible says we shouldn't ask why the old days were better than this, but reading this book will make you ask that very question. Ah, remembrance of things past..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Windows Into Yesteryear","review":"I loved looking over the photographs taken for these post cards. The settings, Ohio's northern shores from about a hundred years ago up to semi-modern times, shed light on how different life once was, and how much most things stay eternally the same. One thing I thought was particularly nice was that there is a lot of happiness captured in these shots. Families from other eras were photographed enjoying their time away from work and school and that spirit of joy is easily seen and felt in these snapshots of summertime landmarks and people who made use of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Projector, but no HD","review":"I've owned and run this for about two years.

It is what it is and that resolution isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"We purchased this projector three years ago for our basement theater room. Was ok as a beginner projector, but not great. We bought an extended warranty plan for three years and about two weeks after the warranty ran out started having problems with it turning on. Had to send it to an approved Epson repair and was told that the power assembly needed to be replaced for a cost of $400. They also said the bulb needed to be replaced, when we only had about 800 hours on it. The tech said that you can't just go by the hours on the lamp because ours had black burn marks on it and the picture quality was being affected. Since a replacement bulb is another two hundred dollars we decided to purchase another projector. This time we went with a sony and can't believe the difference, it's far and above better than the Epson. Unless you want to buy a new projector in a few years I would stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend this watch company","review":"I purchased the Activa Midsize Two-Tone Multi-function Digital Watch #AD046-002 in the autumn my kid for Christmas.

There is a slight odor but it doesn't smell like poop. Just a musky, faintly chemical smell. The lid is well-constructed and low profile. The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is that the description doesn't mention that you need a four-foot deep hole to put it in. I decided to do a proof-of-concept by putting it in an oil-drum full of garden soil. This seems to work fine but I live in So.

Digging a hole 4 feet deep without making it too wide was very difficult! Since our hole was just a bit too wide, the dooley is slowly sinking into the ground somewhat over time. Also, the plastic lid has a crack now -- we don't know how that happened. But it means the air around the dooley is a little smelly. Finally, I find it hard to collect waste and add water as often as is ideal. I'm glad we're keeping fecal waste out of the landfill, but I feel the design could be better.UPDATE: We finally dug up and threw out the whole thing. The lid was plastic - bad idea! It cracked and broke over time. The smell was horrible. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work in my soil","review":"I tried the Dooley 3000 septic system, and had it installed as per the directions exactly...however, the soil here did not cooperate. So not only does it not work, more than once I've found the thing open and stinking since, even though it is out of the way, the lid is easily stepped on when they are playing in the yard and charging around. Now I am going to have my yard guy fill it in or cover it up in some way since I can't imagine how to get it OUT of the ground at this point...which also makes returning it rather impossible.If you are on a sewer line, I'd recommend the Doggie Doo Drain instead, also available from Amazon, and at $44bucks, it's cheaper and works a treat. Especially if you have heavy clay soil with poor drainage as was my case, or live in cold climates...it works ALL YEAR ROUND. An added plus is that it does not require enzymes or ongoing maintenance whatsoever. I have two large labs and keeping their yard ready for play has never been easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinkhole","review":"We had used the pyramid style doggie dooley for years until the lid broke off well below where you would attach a new lid, thus making the whole thing useless. We cut down the top and buried it.We replaced the old doggie dooley with the #3000. After 18 months, the whole thing collapsed into the hole. We never could get this one \\"digesting\\". The solids built up in the tank and I believe the added weight made the whole thing collapse. Not happy with the product this time around.Now we are faced with digging it out of the ground. We plan to make a larger flange out of plywood to slip over the doggie dooley before we replace it in the ground. Hopefully this will work. Since I have to clean out the whole thing to get it out of the hole, I'll try restarting it again. Hopefully it will work this time.We have one lab on high end dog food so the stools are relatively small and hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best doggie doodie disposal system.","review":"I have been using this product since April.

The GBA has the speed, you need for doom, but not the Display. Its mostly dark brown on light black on a non illuminated display - you just can guess what happens. You can only play through, when you know the levels from the original PC-Version (for goods sake they copied the automatic map feature). There are only very few changes for better gameplay on the GBA, such as no moving bridge in Part 1 level 3. Also you can only save after you completed a level.

Twenty-four of the original 29 labrinthine levels are back, complete with indoor and outdoor environments, sprawling staircases, satanic pentagrams, and secrect doors have been beautifully translated. The wall and floor textures are impressive, but tenebrous tones in some levels make it hard to see where you are going on the tiny GBA screen. Switching weapons with the shoulder buttons take some time to get used to, but the control scheme is like a virgin: nice and tight. Some players may find the games non-stop action a little repetitive, but gamers looking for a healthy dose of brutal nostalgia can do no better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom on the move","review":"Doom was the original first person shooter, and although it looks dated now, it looks fantastic on the GBA.Thanks to the power of the GBA, the FPS style and graphics are nearly the same, and all the original levels are there.Being an old game, most people won't be familiar with Doom at first, but you'll soon notice some similarities with the Quake series, run on a very similiar engine and by the same developers. The ever popular Shotgun, Plasma gun (best known in Quake 3 arena) and the infamous BFG are all here, with the cliched enemies that make ID so well known in the FPS genre. Theres 28 levels and 4 difficulty settings, so you get a lot out of it, plus there is a deathmatch mode, for people lucky enough to have a link cable.Buy this game now, definitley one of the finest Game Boy Advance games about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Nice, But...","review":"I love the game, but it just loses \\"something\\" in translation to GBA.

For once, readers are given a glimpse of the proud and unshakable cultures of these two exploited peoples.Red, White & Black compares race relations between several different cultures and regions.

If it was a choice, I would choose negative 5 stars for this waste of paper and ink. It is, hands down, a boring book with absolutely not point at all except to critizice the immigration of the early Europeans.

Mr. McBride is a monster bass player, as I stated in my previous review, but apparently he does much better playing in other people's bands, with other player's compositions. This is not an unusual situation; there aren't too many great jazz players who are also great composers.I stand by my original review.

There was nothing in the Amazon description stating the size of the pillow except the picture when I ordered it. On comparing my Serta pillows with the pillows sent by Amazon, both sets of covers were similar. On examining the interior foam pillow itself there is a MAJOR difference. My original Serta King Size pillows have a Grey color foam where the Amazon pillows have a whitish-yellow foam and are much less pliable than my Serta pillows. This leads me to believe that the pillows Amazon sent me are not the same product as my Serta KoolComfort Memory Foam Molded Pillow.

(That one isn't a lie) check it out (click on her name at the top)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever think just why people don't like the game?","review":"Its because of those crazy occultists that start to play the game, far after they've lost it themselves. Anyone with their head on straight is perfectly fit to play this game and have a good time without killing people in strange rituals. The game is only as evil as the players who play it, and then only for those players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Role Player Review!","review":"As a Christian and as a role-player, I must say I was -extremely- disappointed by this book. The author obvoiusly has no clue about the -real- content of the book(s) and is just repeating comments about the game they heard as sheer rumor. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Not recommended - even as bird cage liner."},{"rating":"1","title":"More lies and slander about Dungeons and Dragons","review":"This book is just another good example of one more thing the world does not need: A bigoted, small-minded, hypocritical, self-serving hatemonger who can lie and attempt to frighten simple-minded people with impunity. Rather than bother with unessential things like research, the author merrily twists the facts to show that D&D is an occult menace preying on the minds of our children. It's too bad that the book is so badly written and one-sided that even the most hardcore bigot would have trouble believing it. Poorly written and laughably ludicrous, The Truth about Dungeons and Dragons is useful only in that you will get many laughs out of it. The truth may be out there, but it is definitely not in this book. If this is best argument against Dungeons and Dragons that anyone can come up with, then I guess fans of the game need never fear that it will be banned"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Researched","review":"The author fails to account for the moralistic population who participate in AD&D. AD&D requires a great deal of creativity and imagination to play. The materials to play AD&D are simply the canvas and the paint. Joan fails to delve into the minds of good people who take these materials and craft a wonderful and intellectual experience. The players are the artists and, as history proves, art is one of the most controversial elements of our culture. Joan stands as another critic who will fade into oblivion while her subject thrives on through time. After reading the baseless content within the book I seriously doubt Joan holds the beliefs she does. A sincere effort would have been thoroughly unbiased with concrete examples. Without such content the book has no merit. I finished the book feeling that Joan is probably a good person trying to earn a paycheck."},{"rating":"1","title":"More B.S. than i can handle","review":"This woman has no idea what she is talking about. i'v been playing AD&D for 2 or 3 years now, And i can tell you this has no truth in it at all.

I even doubt the person who wrote this book actually played, or even watched a game. They say it promotes homosexuality, You could look through every single book and not find that word, the only time they ever say \\"Sex\\" is when referring to male and female. They say it promotes satan worshipping, the word \\"Satan\\" is not in those books, there are gods plural, but anyone smart enough to understand D&D should probably know the difference from whats real and whats not. This lady is trying to kill every childhood joy with the books she writing: GI Joe,Nintendo,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a total lie.

For that reason and that reason alone, I gave this book the \\"1\\" middle finger. Were it not for this point, however, I would have given it a four, because I laughed and laughed at what foolish things mortal put in print. It seems they are willing to believe in anything, from games summoning demons to books holding powers cosmic. Personally, I think someone should start a campaign burning volumes such as this. I don't think it would matter, though, because the people involved in these works apparently aren't interested in literacy and the art of reading without a match anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORDERS ON AND CROSSES OVER LINES OF ABSURDITY","review":"This type of book is a fine example of why an author should never write something without first studying the subject matter. It is one-sided. There are no realistic statistics provided. Both sides were not represented seriously. The conclusions are drawn popular tripe. An extremely poor work...even with syntax. BTW, I do not even play the game but have researched it since I first read this book and find the author's conclusions to be based on more fantasy than the game itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disinformation","review":"AD&D is an interesting game. Further, it is what you make it. The author's book is at best poorly researched. Does that mean that a parent should automatically allow their child to play? Not necessarily. But reading this tripe won't help you make an informed decision about whether or not your child is mature enough to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't read the book, but have read the reviews...","review":"Just like all other games, AD&D (and Magic the Gathering, which I'm sure has been persecuted also), is just that - A GAME. I've played AD&D since 1988 and MTG since 1994 and am far from considering Satanism or Witchcraft as a hobby and/or religious choice. I am a perfectly normal, Christian, intelligent, and sane human being.

However, I have read some of the Players Handbook pertaining to my character and have played about 4 sessions. I don't see anything wrong with the game at all. I am very down to earth.

It has in no way EVER been linked to a satanic cult or been played by druids. If you were to ask a druid about it he would probably respond, \\"What the #$%^ is Dungeons @ Dragons?\\" This book is a collection of misguided statments, personal speculations listed as facts, and fabricated stories. I was laughing so hard that my sides ached for hours. If you are looking for a book that has no basis in reality, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it possible to give it zero stars?","review":"I guess not, and that's too bad, because that's what this book deserves. I can't say anything another reviewer hasn't already said, so I'll just sum up some key descriptive words: ignorant, false, ignorant, lacking in factual information, ignorant, faulty logic, ignorant, mis-use of statistics, and utterly non-scientific. Did I mention ignorant? If an RPG gamer wants a good chuckle, by all means help yourself, but please pick it up at the library to avoid lining the author's pockets. A waste of perfectly good trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"I made an account here just to write this...i find it absolutly unbelievable that anyone could think like this. Im fourteen years old, play the game fairly often...and am completly normal! The only thing Dungeons & Dragons has done for me is allowed me to find new friends (many in fact), provide hours of fun, broaden my imagination, and create a great hobby, not to mention many other benefits. The only negative here may be the money! i have to save up for each book! :) But i love it and thats what matters. So i feel anyone who takes the time and energy to actually express that this game is satanic, bad for the youth, etc. is completly and utterly wrong and making a big mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesse Folks is the Target Audience","review":"All I can say is if you take to heart anything that Jesse Folks says, you are the target audience: ignorant, ill-informed, and a product of a cult enviroment that has nothing better to do than criticize that which you do not understand.

This book is a complete waste of anyone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a farce.","review":"I found this book quite untrue and insulting. The authorhas obviously not played the game or read the books, and hasjust based her review on rumors. Contrary to what some people might think, dungeons and dragons has nothing to do with worshipping Satan or delving into the occult. Most people play good characters which would oppose such actions so I don't know where this accusation comes from. If D&D influences people in any way, it helps them expand their imagination and channel their anger into fantasy instead of real life. D&D players are completely average normal people."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh man...","review":"oh man... how is this not in fiction?i have a good friend who is gay. he has been so long before he played dnd. yet according to miss joan, dnd is the cause, and it is a horrible thing. and dnd is why i have a failure of a life. oh yes. my horrible, failed life of good grades and being a sociable person with a job whom people like and goes to church and believes in God. yeah. right. get a life. but seriously, this is the funniest book ever. get it used, though. as little as possible should be done to get her excited and thinking she has a viable point.

This is the TV series, which consists of 27 episodes. Story wise, the two Lodoss series are wonderful (though I can't say as much for the odd Crystania offshoot series). If you like Final Fantasy, Lord of the Rings, or Dragon Warrior and the like, I'm sure you'll enjoy this series, with it's incorporation of magic, elves, dwarves, humans, dragons, and other fantasy elements. This story picks up where the OVA left off (for the most part, there are a few story discrepancies that can be traced to the comic series.) Although very long, this is one of the best anime series I've seen. If you're familiar with the OVA, this picks up with the story of Parn, and continues to a new hero. If you liked this set, check out the 2 DVD OVA series, but most who see the TV series have already seen the OVA."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of the superior first run","review":"Take the rehash last few six or so episodes of the original and throw in some new lifeless characters, stir well and you have Heroic Knight. The new characters are never really delved into in the same way you felt about the original characters - in fact, even the appearance of the original characters is glossed over and reduced to throw-away lines.Not to say the new characters could not have held up the movie, but they are never really given the muscle to come out from the shadow of the original. In fact, by the time we get to the end I was hoping for the heroes to fail so that we could cut their numbers in half and pray that those who survived wouldn't sit around whinning about how terrible things are and how much they will rise to the challenge. In fact the entire last half of the series sounds like the one-liners from motivational posters."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"if you watched the first one you might not want to use your money to get this one. the move is based off 5 years later of the first one and it does not even go along with the storyline of the first. for some reason unknown that the movie characters dont even know each other from the first one well in my own opinion it is just not right i would not recommend anyone to waste there money like i did"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality anime","review":"I got into anime a few years ago and compared to some of the other anime I've seen this is very poor in quality. I only managed to watch the first few episodes and could not get myself to watch anymore. Based on what I did see, the animation was subpar - which would've been fine if there was an engaging storyline. Unfortunately, it lacked character development and a good plot.

But it is not, not at all. Two of the main charterers are duplicated, but the story line are completely replaced by a very stupid plot and some other else charterers.

Forget you saw the first one, and you'll like it a whole lot better. Great characters, good storylines, average animation (compared to some other animes out there), this is like a soap opera with swords and magic.

There is one extra track, though: the Jimmy Reed song \\"Baby What Do You Want Me to Do\\" (there is no indication that this song was part of the same set as the rest of the CD).Here's the problem: Etta is in great form --- but each of her songs is faded out in the middle of the song! You are robbed of hearing her final build, not to mention the complete presentation and playing of her fine band.This lame, stunted presentation keeps getting repackaged. It's also the first of the two live sets on disc three of \\"Etta James - Live and In the Studio\\".This CD is worth its $1.66 price on Amazon --- but don't pay a penny more.

It will take a century to respond after you press the shot button and another century to process the picture.I tried to contact Canon but I guess their customer support is just like their camera - it doesn't work!Do yourself a favor: don't buy a Cannon A300.Paulo May - Brazil"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st Digi Camera","review":"I rec'd this digi camera for X-mas and so far have been very happy with it. I'm an old school claims adjuster and very used to my Nikon 35mm camera that I have been using for 19 years. I can't believe all I need to do is take the mem card to Wal-Mart and have the pics processed in 15/20 minutes. NO more film, processing and having to wait for a day or two to return to PU the film. I did buy the 128K mem card ... and rechargeable battery ..., but I find these costs reasonable considering the films packs I used to buy and then the film processing costs and travel time to pick up the film. From what I hear battery life is not to great but again I have been lucky. Although I have 4 spare batteries in my camera bag; I'm still on the first set . My boss has an Olympus and he goes through a 10 pack in a day. The pics are great along with the photo detail (very sharp 4X6's).Good luck with your camera. I'm very happy with mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I bought a Canon A300 to replace a lost Sony. I found the camera to be adequate except for two things: Battery life and delay upon hitting the photo button. Simply stated, the same type of batteries that last 18 hours in my mp3 player last 5 minutes in this camera. Battery life was consistent over several sets of batteries. Secondly, this camera is completely inadequate for taking pictures of small children because the children will have moved by the time the picture is processed. While the camera takes adequate pictures, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entry Camera","review":"I bought this camera as a spare for taking pictures while on vacation. It is nothing like my 10D or Pro 1, but I only paid $150 for the A300. The pictures are very decent, and much better then most, if not all cameras in this price range and class. Simple to use, readily availble AA batteries, and it shares the same Compact Flash cards with my other cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"It takes good pictures, but I have absolutely no patience for this camera . . . it eats up batteries like CRAZY (I think one time a set of batteries ran out only after TEN minutes, ahhh!!). The other issue I had with it was that it takes FOREVER to snap a picture . . . everybody is sitting there smiling and waiting for the picture to take, and IT DOESN'T SNAP! I discovered quickly that I must be an impatient person, because I just don't have the time or money (on tons of batteries) to deal with this camera. I'm actually going to try to sell it on ebay or something, because it's in perfect condition, but yet I can't return it to the store anymore (anybody want to buy it?). I usually only buy canon and think it's an excellent brand and have some really nice higher-end cameras, but I just don't like this one very much and can't wait to get a different one . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for taking the step from 35mm Digital","review":"The Canon A300 packs a lot of features for a low price. Its user friendly, has a good internal zoom lens and comes with great photo editing software. I strongly recommend getting recahrgeable batteries. The best thing is that I can shoot all the pictures I want and then edit them later. If you're wary of making the change from film to digital, don't be. This camera makes it painless for the digital novice and the pictures are very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep looking","review":"I liked the camera for the most part but is was cheap feeling, light, and plastic feeling. I took it back because the flash reload time was near 10 seconds between photos, it could have been me but it did have new batteries and I even contacted customer support to find out if there were any adjustmenrs I could make, they were of little help but did respond quickly. My advice, Try the A70 or a Kodak, I bought the A70 and am much happier, the flash reload time is minimal. If you are interested in cheap megapixels though I could find no better value in the market from a reliable manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Time digital user","review":"I read the available customer reviews about the Canon A300 digital camera and noted the complaint about the lack of battery power. (eats batteries). I ordered the A300 based on recommendations from others about the machine being a good place to start. Now that I have had a few days to play with the A300, I can say in my experience the machine lives up to the manufactures claims. It is still on the supplied AA batteries after initial set up, 25 Shots and download time to my computer. For the price I cannot see how a novice could go wrong for a still digital camera with sound and movie options. My recommendation? If your new to digital and want to get your feet wet, try the Canon A300. Downside... could use optical zoom. However, keep your resolution high, and go easy on digital zoom and you will still get a quality shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features and good photos. Batteries a deal breaker","review":"You may notice other reviews mentioning the battery problem. They are not exagerating, We used up a set of batteries just setting the preferences. I thought it was just cheap batteries that came with the unit. We got it going and took about six pictures before the battery light came on and the screen went black. After the second set died after 7 pictures, we knew this wasn't going to work as a nice point and shoot digital. Too bad. The price is nice and the pictures came out very crisp and full of detail. But who can carry four sets of batteries to take as many pictures as a roll of film? Sorry Canon. Nice idea, but AA's do not power this piece of equipment. Go back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems...problems","review":"I am not a novice when it comes to digital cameras; but after following the instructions to the letter, I never got one picture from this camera.

It turned out pretty good, the first big thing that surprised me in Call of Duty 3 is that there is a destructible environment. You can destroy walls and fences but there are limitations like only a part of the building can be destroyed not the whole thing but the fencing can be totally destroyed. Another fun thing is you can use mortars and THAT IS VERY FUN trust me and you have to use a very interesting button to move the mortar but I won't ruin it for you. There are also very detailed weapons in the game like the FG42 and others. The missions are about 20-30 minutes long so you can pass the time quickly and there are some surprises along the way. Very good graphics too; you can see small details of weapons and vehicles. But the game is too short there are only 14 missions.

The German point of view, in most instances quite obvious and reasonable, is ignored. For example, the Stalingrad tragedy of the Wehrmacht is judged to have been a German blunder when, in fact, Hitler's decision to hold on there as long as possible, saved the entire German southern front from collapse.We are told that a single German bomber crew, apparently lost in August, bombed London and thereby provoked a British war of terror called retribution. What happened in May 1940, when the RAF bombed the German city of Moenchen-Gladbach and other population centers, causing the Germans to abandon their policy against terror bombing only some time later, is withheld.

However, it was not the thriller I expected. It was a very well written work of fiction that contained excellent character development. I got to know each character from the narrator's viewpoint but I did not get emotionally attached to any of the characters in the book - not the narrator and not even the \\"dead girls.\\" I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters but just wanting to find out what happened to resolve the questions of the mysterious deaths. The narrator is a science teacher and I found his accounts of the events in this small town somewhat clinical in description.

The opening scene is rather graphic and almost leads you into believing this is a pulp novel.After the opening scene the book is indeed wonderful. The characters are well written and well thought out. Each persons motivtions and movements are as mysterious as the next. Just like in real life you only get a slice of what they are thinking without the whole motivation.Unfortunately the only other down side to this is the ending. The ending seems rushed and the murderer' identity and words make little sense(not that it necessarily should given the horrific nature of the crimes).Overall well worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Hitchcock was alive today...","review":"If Hitchcock were alive today I'm sure he would be drawn to this dark, psychological thriller about a small town caught in a maelstrom of suspicion.

A worthy successor to PSYCHO and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of a chore than a thrill","review":"As a reader who, for better or worse, is driven to finish any book I start, \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\" was an absolute nightmare for me.

After a few chapters the book changed from what I thought was going to be a gory blood and guts murder to an even more frightful witch-hunt in small town America. This book raises questions about social patterns and the non-acceptance of those who choose not to conform. The scariest element of this novel is the realism; how do we treat people in out society we feel are different or threatening?I loved the book, great suspense; however, the ending felt rushed. I needed a better explanation of why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and Intense","review":"Everyone said it begain with the disappearance of the first girl. But it began much earlier than that.So begins Dobyn's novel, Church of Dead Girls. This compelling book presents two different genres - an engrossing thriller that will keep readers turning the pages, and a study in small-town life that may keep them up at night longer than the thriller itself.Sharon Malloy is the daughter of Aurelius's most respected physician, a typical teenage girl. When one day she disappears - seemingly into thin air - the town is thrown into a panic. And when other girls start disappearing, too, a modern-day witch hunt seems to appear. Everyone with a difference - a belief in Marxism, differing sexuality, a medical problem - is seen as a potential suspect in the disappearance of the girls.Dobyns does a great job of revealing the heart of the town, and what might lurk under any picturesque community in the face of terror. Overall, the book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow paced mystery at best...","review":"I'm an avid reader and enjoy well put together novels but this isn't one. I continually waited for it to pull me in and it just didn't happen. I constantly found myself skipping over rambling details in the hopes I might somehow get involved with this book. After 200 pages, it's in the trash can. <sigh>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in the Execution","review":"This book had real possibilities. The title is good, and the premise is good. For me, however, the execution failed. I found the book to be far too long and too laden in the middle. I do not doubt that the attempts to find the girls would be a huge issue in the real world, but in the novel it becomes tedious, and the murders and violence later in the book seem less motivated by a real need within the plot and more like throwing a bone out to keep the readers interested. Unfortunate that the book couldn't live up to the expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Understand The Rave Reviews...","review":"The reviews on the inside page of this novel were impressive, so I bought it. The quote by Stephen King on the front cover said \\"very rich, very scary, very satisfying\\" -- I found that to be VERY wrong.Half the book was dedicated to characters who, ultimately, had little to do with anything. I was extremely annoyed with the constant repetition of things, particularly in dialogues between the detective and Aaron. How many times must you ask the (exact) same questions?I forced myself to finish and it was no surprise that the ending was the final disappointment. So much time had been spent on insignificant people -- one hardly even knew who the heck the \\"madman\\" even was.Dobyns writing style is commendable, but the meager plot and lack of suspense really bothered me."},{"rating":"2","title":"unputdownable","review":"I picked up this book by chance and was expecting another \\"seial killer terrifies town\\" type thriller. What I found was a well-written, intelligent and compulsive account of what fear does to a community. The gradual disintegration of the sleepy, dull town into a suspicion-laden, self-destructive gang of vigilantes was beautifully described and I think the author managed to create a climate of terror far more powerful than if he had stuck to what has become almost a formula for the mystery/horror novel. I am looking forward to reading more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and L o n g .","review":"I am now wondering if I read the same book as those who say things like \\"mersmerizing\\", \\"hypnotizing\\", \\"chilling\\". When? Where? Who? Not only was this book dull and uninteresting, the story was shallow to say the least and very unoriginal - what little of a story there was.The only readable chapters in this book where the first and last. The middle of the books seems to belong to another story... Dobyns seems to fill the book with long descriptions and life stories of charachters who in the book leave you wondering what relevance they had to the story. Lots of them could have been left out.This is just not a good book. Sorry Mr. Dobyns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"This was the most slow and boring book I have ever read.

What a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G !!!!!","review":"I expected a 'thriller', especially given Stephen King's commentary prominently displayed on the cover; however, I had to force myself to read the entire book. Such drudgery! Although I'll admit that parts are well written, it is painfully slow. Only about the last 50 pages had any real tension.Perhaps if it hadn't been billed as a 'horror thriller' I would have approached it differently and enjoyed it more.Also very annoying were the author's arbitrary changes in 'person'. The story is purportedly told from one guy's viewpoint, but we often are \\"in the heads\\" of other characters. This can change from paragraph to paragraph, and clearly the main 'storyteller' would not have been privy to the thoughts and privacies of the other characters. Very strange, and I saw no need for the \\"1st person\\" viewpoint at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Church of Dead Prose","review":"This has to be among the worst books I have ever forced myself to finish. The prose style reads like something ground out by a twelve-year-old and one cries out for even a two-dimensional character to relieve the tedium of the one-dimensional ones Dobyns has created. It also seems obvious that he completely ran out of his small fund of ideas at the end of the novel. With no attempt to build tension or even to explain the actions of the killer he simply ends the book. Personally, I'd rather he'd finished it a few hundred pages earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get through it","review":"I really wanted to like this book because a friend told me about it. However, the more I read, the more boring it seemed to get. And the fact that there were so many characters in the town to keep track of made it all the more complicated when I didn't pick up the book for a few days. The premise of the novel was good, but ultimately, I put it back on the shelf without finishing it.

As much a meditation on small town mendacity as a suspense whodunnit, Dobyns' novel shows how a town populace is torn apart, turning against one another, when shaken by a series of bizarre and inexplicable murders. The plot intercuts between both themes, is heavy on characterizattion and displays a writing skill far beyond the book's generic level.

They love it and wait for the 4 pumps everyday before they eat. NO FISH SMELL ON THEIR BREATH AT ALL. Honestly, and I use 4 large pumps for my two German Shepherds. Their coats have been alot softer and smoother to the touch and I have been using salmon oil for about 3 months now and I can honestly say there has been significantly less shedding from this time last year. Great product, great price and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every bottle I've tried, the Pump leaks all over","review":"The oil inside is fine, but they must be using a cheap pump!

Now I'm trying other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly, leaks, and so far ineffective","review":"I have a golden retriever who has been suffering from dry skin for the past 6 months or so. In search of a solution, I purchased this salmon oil with very high hopes due to the great reviews. However, the bottle is flimsy and the pump leaks leading to a very stinky and messy situation. It is super gross when I try to add a few pumps of the oil to my dog's food and a drop splashes on me by accident. The smell is very strong and lingers even after being washed with soap! The worst is when it gets on my clothes. The container is very oily and I have to put a dish under it to catch the leaks. The scent of fish oil is very unpleasant. Everyone in my household hates it. However, this could all be overlooked if it did wonders for my dog's skin. After nearly a month of use however, he is still as flaky as ever.Two stars because, he does like the taste. I have tried giving him fish oil pills before and he would avoid those like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, smelly, squirts all over AND my dog won't eat her food!","review":"I was excited to get this item based on the positive reviews. I can't tell you how much I hate this product!! The slightest touch to the pump will squirt out super-smelly salmon oil. My arm and counter were full of it this morning (the first time using this product). When I finally was able to get some in my dog's dish it came out in loads and the bottle leaked something fierce. I checked the tightness of the neck and it was good. I don't know what is causing the leakage, but the smell was horrid. Then, on top of that, my dog (a siberian husky who LOVES salmon!) turned her nose on her food and wouldn't eat it. If I could, I'd return this product in a heartbeat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"I have four, count'em, four dogs. Two little ones and two big ones. One of the little guys doesn't like the salmon oil, but the other three really seem to enjoy their food much more with the salmon oil added. My wife says the oil has an unpleasent smell when freshly applied but I can't smell anything. She's a fussbudget. This product does seem to improve the flavor of their food and if the health claims are true, so much the better.Not a perfect score, but 3 out of 4 dogs ain't bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I remember Creomulsion from when I was a kid, it worked so well and actually coated your throat and eased the cough, I thought it had been discontinued since I could not find it anywhere,Now that I have found it I am ordering 1 adult and 1 childs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated Reading!","review":"This is a very good book for those in the military establishment to study and heed.

Saint Francis was one of my mom's favorite saints to pray to and she also loved animals. So, I was curious as to her quite devotion to this saint, now that she has passed. This story brought much understanding and peace to me. It is so well written and illustrated, I could read it over and over. I also like the way the author begins the story and explains his devotion to Saint Francis and the impact he had on his life. The author is also the son of a man who had a great impact on my life, Robert F. Kennedy. His father would be proud of this book and the work he does for the environment.

It wasn't very informative in the sense that it didn't raise too many points that made me think, \\"Hmm, I hadn't thought of that.\\" But it is a fun take on the decision to remain childfree. The book seemed slightly more aimed toward girls - animated pictures of girls wearing cute outfits (that they can afford and wear without getting them ruined, because after all, they have no kids) in their cute apartments, sipping cute cocktails. But I think for a light read, something fun and not very controversial, this book would be a good choice.

No. I'd call it a bound Powerpoit. And, was it helpful in the \\"to have or not to have children\\" debate? Not even in the slightest. If anything, this book just made me more confused because it drew such a definite line between breeders and non-breeders so while it's essential to be able to joke about it eventually, it's also important to actually take the debate seriously including all the ways to handle overbearing family members who may take a \\"sorry we've decided not to have children\\" not so funny. This is a serious debate and I was hoping for a little humor in an otherwise rather serious subject but what I got was a joke... making thorough fun of breeders and non-breeders alike so today I walk away more irritated from having purchased it than well informed on how to handle this decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting a Big Chance at Satire","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I know it is supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual for those who chose to remain child-free. I expected it to provide some form of witty social commentary. Instead it wallowed around in the tired \\"aren't babies stinky and dirty\\" territory instead of providing comic relief.

When I saw his book on Amazon, I was so impressed by all the reviews that I immediately checked it out of the library. About the only thing I agreed with in this book is the idea that we are responsible for changing ourselves. Otherwise, I found this book to be merely an exposition on how to be selfish. As a married woman of nine years, I found the section on marriage especially laughable. This book emphasizes individuality at the expense of community. If any of the previous reviews were written by anyone other than white male Republicans, I would love to know about it. You want to justify your selfishness and learn how to defend yourself to others? By all means, buy this book. Just don't live in my community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Choose Helplessness or Self-Responsibility?","review":"That's the core difference between people who love this book and people who hate it.Those who hate it cannot stand the fact that the book gives you ideas about how to accept personal responsibility for what happens in your own life while avoiding the traps in which other people, events, and poor personal choices would place you.Those who love the book feel the opposite. They are eager to pick themselves off, dust themselves off, and learn how to avoid getting knocked down anymore.Notice that in each case where someone panned the book, they blame someone else or other events for the pain in their lives.Those who praise the book accept responsibility for attracting stuff, good or bad, into their lives.That's the difference.If you want to continue to wallow in self-pity and anger about the negatives in your life, skip this book.If you want help overcoming challenges and difficulties in your life, read it.It's that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indispensable guide to life and living","review":"Do you want to live the life others have told you that you must live, or do you want to be free to create the life you want for yourself?Harry Browne's book is for those in the latter category, who want to free themselves from the traps so many people fall into--related to other people's expectations, work, relationships, and more--that lead to frustration and an unsatisfying life.Browne shows you how to start being yourself and getting the things you really want, while feeling good about it.

The police state of America will continue to collapse.The one small (very very small) criticism of this book I had was that the book is too passive.

Perhaps with the its republication we will see the return of rocketing gold.Browne gives us a map of the psychic focus a person needs to play and win by taking care of business. Browne is an American teacher of self-reliance just as Emerson was. Dale Carnegie was another. In fact, all the writers we as Americans seem to like and quote: Hemingway, Mailer, Emily Dickinson all find their own way to individuation, to being able to be themselves. Since I was driving a cab in Harvard Square at the time of my first reading of Browne's book, his suggestions about how to interpret the economy in which we live, and how to do business in it, are quite affirmative and useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air!

Ms Wolfson retells the myths from Mallory's Morte d'Arthur with such vivid clarity that the travails and passions of the Knights of the Round Table have the ring of truth. Maybe Arthur's provenance was uncertain and his place of birth disputable, but Ms Wolfson makes us believe in this much loved hero for all time. The book is complemented by superb illustrations and supplementary questions and answers to each section.

The book is an easy, enjoyable read and may be perused by persons with no background in meteoritics. The biographical sketches of Ninenger and Haag alone give unique worth to the book.The only real reservation keeping this book from a five star rating is its Apprndix C, listing suspected impact craters.

Other than that it's almost useless as both a reference and a tutorial, being a lot heavier on theory than practice. The code is really top-notch object oriented C++ which makes it EXTREMELY difficult to follow and learn from. Obviously the author had usability in mind instead of learnability, eventhough the usability of the source code is questionable: it's useless for C programmers and it skips all system specifics and uses existing API's to do the work. Nothing about DSP programming is even mentioned in the book. Still, some of the theory parts are pretty interesting which is why my rating is 2 instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed that recording is not covered!","review":"I am SO disappointed in this book!

I wonder what would have happened if I dropped it from eye level to a hard floor or cement.The truth is I loved the camera, but if you figure that at some point in the camera's lifetime that you might drop it, I would either look elsewhere or keep your fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud camera","review":"My husband and I bought this camera, it worked for 2 days and just stopped reading the flash.

A loose connection was fixed under warranty. At 18 months it died with an E18 error. The lens will not move in or out when turned on and then it beep and displays 'E18' on the display. We were on vacation so I replaced it with an A95. It's the only camera available at Best Buys that still uses CF memory cards. Hopefully Canon has the E18 issue resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"E18 Error","review":"before buying the camera, i read a bunch of reviews about it, and there were tons of people complaining that after a few months, the camera stops working and gives you an error that says \\"E18\\", and basically when you try to turn the camera on or off, the lens motor makes some weird sound and the lens doesnt move and the screen just stays black and says \\"E18\\". I've had this camera for about 3-4 months and i've been very pleased with it and the quality of the pictures, but looks like I had to learn the hard way about the E18 error. Definitely not worth it if the camera will only work for a few months. Trust me, do not take your chances. Do a search for \\"Canon camera E18\\" and you will see that this is an issue with many canon cameras. I wish I had taken other people's advice, but oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I love this camera. I have so much fun with it and the pictures are great.

This camera has all you could want and I could not be happier with it. I make incredible 5x7 prints that put film camera prints to shame. The A60 can be a simple point and shoot camera or let you take manual control of aperture, shutter, ISO, white balance, etc if you want to. It uses CF memory which is very cheap (256 mb card holds 247 pictures at the highest resolution and costs around $40.00). It also uses AA batteries which are cheap and available everywhere. Get NiMH rechargeables for longer life. I have had a few digital cameras over the years and the A60 is the best and also the cheapest. Go figure. I think this camera is being discontinued as higher megapixel cameras are becoming more popular. Don't be fooled by the hype. This camera does it all at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and least expensive digital camera I've ever owned","review":"This camera has given me no problems.

I've owned several digital cameras and this one by far has the best image quality.-Low price. I think it's the best camera on the market under $300!-Great software, easy to install and use!-Great battery power!The Not So Good-Video output is not the greatest.

It even includes an excerpt from a Hebrew prayer book, making the jump from a mechanical understanding of the words to a personal understand of the language a bit more palatable.While it has practical uses, it does not give the calligraphy strokes for writing in proper (or ancient) Hebrew.

(BTW - the coax signal is digital. Use the cheapest cable you can get, if it is short).Another problem: If you put MP3's into it, you navigate subdirectories with names in 8-character format, so the filenames are jibberish.Got it at Fry's for $69, with HDMI cable.

Around 60% of the story seems to consist of the exact same circular conversations and arguments over and over and over and over... There are many other problems, the grating nature of almost all of the characters, the lack of world building (which was sad because the Cheysuli had the potential to be quite interesting), but it's the repetition that really got to me. Conversations that had to happen once, maybe twice just kept resurfacing, which finally made me realize, this apparently \\"strong-willed\\" heroin never actually does anything, never takes action to change her situation other than to whine about it again and again. This apparently fascinating culture is never actually explained except when the characters mumble sagely (and vaguely) about \\"the prophesy\\", which they do again and again so that the culture never acquires any depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Hoolies.","review":"I'm a massive fan of the Sword Dancer series.

My jaw hit the floor. I got halfway, started reading the reviews here. They say it better than I can.Minimal character development. Plotline seems forced. Patriarical society that views women as wombs (and even the prince physically forces Alix away from her father after just a few minutes, for no good reason, with a smile on his face). The \\"willful\\" main character just takes it. Oh, she complains. Yes, she has many complaints. But she never pulls her arm away, spits in someone's face, or knees him--even when he's an admitted rapist calling her a whore and feeling her up.In short, if you love strong female protagonists, PLEASE read the Sword Dancer series.

The book is very friendly even for a novice like me in the art of wine appreciation, and it gives easy to follow recipes. I am up to the challenge of indulging my craving for sweets and wine! I plan to send a book to all my friends and family to create a network where all the recipes will be cooked or baked and later shared and combined with the wine suggestions to improve our palates, delight our spirits while giving us the perfect excuse to get together.

There is lots to read and absorb for each recipe, and the recipes themselves look extremely do-able in one's own humble kitchen. I bought a copy after glancing through it in the bookstore because I know this is definitely a book that I can use (and not just leave around looking pretty).

There are unpopular characters used only to counter the look-alikes from the rival company, most notably Maki Genryusai, a Final Fight character, and Mai Shiranui, the infamously voluptuous SNK female mascot.Unlike the better-castedMarvel vs. Capcom 2, however, this Vs game has austere input commands, so making devastating super combos is actually challenging (but not as much as in the Alpha series).This is a superb multiplayer game for those children of the Eighties.

But 2d fighters arent acceptable anymore. its almost 2003!! Tekken 4 is 3 d, if this game was 3d it would be almost as good as tekken. The last 2d fighter game i liked was ultimate mortal kombat 3 in 1997."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of both worlds","review":"What do you get when you combine Street Fighter (with a little from Darkstalkers) and King of the Fighters (with a few from Samurai Showdown). What you get is one of the classics in the realm of 2D fighting games.The idea behind this game is simple. A tournament is being held to determine 2 things,1) the Best Fighter out there2) The best team out there.Along the way (if you are good enough) one of the bosses from either series will pop up (usually Bison or Geese), however if you are really good (1st place) you get to face off against one of the hidden bosses (the end result of the Akuma vs Rudal battle).Over all this is a simple 2D fighting game that is loads of fun and well worth owning. It's focused on combat but doing a non stop barrage of fireballs never hurts either now does it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capcom vs. SNK makes its mark in the Milleneum!","review":"That title was pretty cheesy but is related to the game since the subtitle of the game is \\"Mark of the Milleneum Fight 2000\\". Anyways, this game holds up true to the first Capcom and SNK cross-over game of Capcoms famous vs. series. This games has some added features which include the brand new editable groove feature which allows you to edit the charge bar you see on the bottom of most Street Fighter and King of Fighter platforms used to execute hyper combo attacks. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Capcom or SNK games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and good fighter","review":"When I played this game, I knew it would be a great follow-up to the first game, Capcom v.s. SNK. I was certainly right. This game adds more characters and fighting techniques. My personal favorite three on three team includes these females: Mai, Morrigan. and Yuri.This game has an enormous selection of characters, from Ryu from Street Fighter to Mai from Fatal Fury. Anyone who likes fighting games should definitely buy this magnificent game for PS2.This game has simple gameplay which is easy to get the hang of. I think everyone should buy this game, which is a great and rare one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL I GOTTA SAY IS...","review":"buy it, it's great, i love it and i can't wait to EO comes out on gamecube to see what it has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad","review":"the case had no cover and the disc looked ruffed up but it plays like nothing is wrong so i will give it a shot. after i fully play the game i will see if there are any more problems with disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I just discovered Jonathan Troper last year. I've now read all of his books and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice quality","review":"I bought this about a year ago, and have used it often. I like that it's extend-able, but I thought it would allow you to angle it up or down, too, as it pulled out from the wall. It does not. It's a straight pull out, and that is all, though you can push it from side to side, easily. Be sure you locate it on the wall at the height you will use it, as it's not going to angle up and down.The mirror itself will turn all the way around, and it flips over to show either a magnifying mirror, or a plain mirror. The magnification is pretty strong, so you will see every pore, so be ready. If you're half blind, like me, that is good, but it may be too much if you see well.It stays where you put it, and it's really quite nice in quality. I was pleasantly surprised, and overall, I'm quite pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN","review":"POOR PACKAGINGMIRROR APPEARED NICE QUALITY, HEAVY AND GOOD CHROME FINSISHJUST THROWN IN TO LARGE BOX-NO BUBBLE WRAP NO PADDING"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muay Thai Kickboxing : The Ultimate Guide to Conditioning, T","review":"I found this book to be the most infomative on the subject(s) I have read to date. Mr. Boykin did a splendid job of organizing the subject matter. I especially like the way he presents health and physical fitness benefits that one may derive from the study of Muay Thai/Kickboxing ... this was well balanced in the book. Many of this type of book tend to lead too heavily in one direction or the other (fitness/competition)whereas, Mr. Boykin presents that well balanced presentation that will surely be invitation to many that would otherwise avoid Muay Thai/Kickboxing training. He makes his presentations in clear and concise text. Plenty of photograghs to aid in the understanding. This will go on my bookshelf... top shelf with my favorites. Thank you Mr. Boykin ... you have restored my faith in this type of \\"martial art\\" study. As a martial art enthusiast, I look forward to seeing more of your work, ideas, and input."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Seen Yet","review":"Chad Boykin's book is by far the best I've seen yet on the topic of Muay Thai Kickboxing.

Whether you're looking for self defense training or a serious workout or both, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not expect anything","review":"Basic technics, training drills are given without photos, no combinations, no serious muay thai. Half of the book is about weight training, which is not something that you would look for in a muay thai book. If you need conditioning, purchase either Matt Furry's or Christhensen's books. Self-defense chapter is useless because with only few pages you can not learn anything, purchase Gracie's one if you need a self-defense book.

This book is a collection of essays that are poorly written and constructed, have almost no point or conclusion and for the most part leave the reader thinking, \\"whaaa?\\".In almost ever essay they use very large ambiguous words and quote many authors but actually don't define the term they're given. They end up using poor examples to express a word they forgot to define in the trample of nonsense. All in all the title of the book should be Irony because it's written by english professors."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is the devil!","review":"this book is the devil! i am using it in a lit studies course and loathe every second i waste reading these essays. they seem to be written mostly by stuffy university professors who are attempting to sound like they know what they are talking about. It is not a dictionary, nor does it help the reader properly understand a term. If you are curious about a word that is discussed in the book, i suggest looking it up in the dictionary. it's easier. and you'll actually learn what the word means without having to search through thick sentences that really make no sense and large words that you know the author just pulled out of a thesauraus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Artwork","review":"Some Hope by Edward St. Aubyn is a trilogy of novellas about the cruel and sadistic British aristocrat David Melrose. In some ways, the book is really about son Patrick Melrose who suffers at the hands of both his perverse father and his drug-addicted mother.The first novella is literally saturated with examples of the evility of David Melrose and the sufferings of his family at his hands. In the second novella, son Patrick trudges through the harrowing New York City scene mingling with all those lowly commoners called Americans. The third novella concerns Patrick's experimenting with various and sundry illegal drugs.This trilogy of novellas shows how being raised by twisted parentsleads to the children becoming equally twisted adults themselves. This is a most unusual and excellent work of literary art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised and ordered from Amazon/'s Audible Books","review":"The Audible download was described as a trilogy, but it is not. It is only the first two books in this harrowing, fascinating and brilliant series of novels. Apparently the third book is lost in Audible cloud, but I have the Patrick Melrose quartet in one volume, and my sense of loss and agrievement has been assuaged.I will miss Patrick, and his brilliantly written, terse story when I've read the last volume. I will put them away, and pull them out in a few years and return to his world, so richly and unsentimentally described. St. Aubyn's deft portraits hit close to the grain, and will be as fresh 20 years from now as they are today. Cultures may change. People don't.So, no stars for Audible/Amazon, but five for these fast paced, deeply felt and entertaining novels. And buy the books, you will not like being cut off in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Writing Marred By Loathsome Characters","review":"The trilogy the title refers to, revolves around Patrick Melrose at three points in his life. The first is at five when he's raped by his sadistic father. The second is in his late twenties as a a drug addict who has come to claim his father's ashes. The final section is a glimpse at Patrick as a recovered addict, navigating life while trying to put the demon of his father to rest. The technical writing is great. Beautiful witty prose, descriptive and vivid characters and smart witty dialogue. Yet I found it increasingly difficult to hang in there when I detested nearly everyone in the pages of this book. Sneering snobs, and drug addicts. Not my idea of an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read from Tamara Thorne","review":"This was a great read from tamara Thorne, who never disappoints. She's much better than alot of famous horror writers out there, her characters are always interesting, story lines always at the top of the game. Eternity is great: time-travel, Jack The Ripper, serial killers, mysteries - one after another. You won't be disappointed. A great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"book","review":"was not interesting poor rating reader was led to believe something different went reading the cover review; long and boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and silly","review":"This is one of my favorite books I love the cast of characters and wish such a place existed so I could move there, without the killing of course. Well, maybe even that I am a little sick in the head and this book was a perfect match for me. It is a fast read and an extremely entertaining one. I make all my friends read it and they then fall in love with Thorne. So my advice would be to read it and then make everyone read it and whoever doesn't like it you should never talk to them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Horror, A Little Mystery, A Little Romance","review":"This was one of those books where you just have to suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride. It wasn't a horrifying as I thought it was going to be, or maybe I've just become inured to murder and mutilation in stories. (Scary thought, that.) It was pretty clear-cut as to who the killer was in both locations, and any other town faced with that number of dead bodies would have surely called in the FBI. But leaving all that aside, it was an interesting premise, with a stalwart but emotionally wounded hero, a heroine who's rediscovered her personal strength, and a child who wasn't obnoxious."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Taters'","review":"This is a well-produced, profusely illustrated and very informative book not simply giving many great recipes, but with an introductory section on the history of the potato,its many different varieties and methods of cooking.

The authors have included extensive research about the Potato's family history. Given the task of providing a complete guide about the subject, they have created the absolute \\"definitive\\" book. As for my own use of the book, I was given the task of producing one of the recipes, the \\"Herbed Potato Bake\\", pg.142. Rave reviews from the Guests. Get this book. Lots of ideas that we all have a tendency to forget about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine for a great price","review":"I picked this vacuum up at my local Fred Meyer for about $150.It isn't as loud as some vacuums I've heard, but any vacuum is going to be louder than you'd prefer.The rotating upholstery attachement is wonderful! It removes cat hair from the sofas very well. Cat food on the floor though is not a good idea... it spins so fast that it will shoot the little pieces out faster than the vacuum can suck them up.All of the attachments are nice, it's just too bad they don't all have a home on the unit itself, so you have to find a drawer or closet space somewhere.The height is very comfortable. I am 5'9\\" and don't have to stoop or stretch in any awkward way. The long cord is very nice as well. I can plug into the hallway and reach every corner of my 750 sq ft home.In general the suction is great on a berber carpet; I have not used this machine on longer pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for beginners","review":"For many years I have been growing roses and have read many books on the subject.

I was expecing a more informative, colorful book. The material seemed to lack something. I didn't get very much out of the book and the mostly black and white pictures / drawings didn't help me much visually either. If you're wondering if you should purchase this book, keep going and find something better.

I don't know why Mr W chose to ignore the fact that orange trees can be grown from seed or from cuttings, but he did. I wrote ehow about this two months ago and still they have not addressed the issue. I guess Mr. W has nothing to say on the subject. If his ehow is any indication, I suspect this book will contain likewise unhelpful information for those who wish to grow plants from seed or cuttings, rather than line the pockets of the nearest lawn & garden store owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to understand, full of information","review":"This book is for the beginning rose gardener.

I purchased the kindle version so I would have it with me, in case I needed the info at my fingertips during a session or wanted to show patients the pain area diagrams[home health or traveling situations]. The book not only increased my skills, but increased my credibility with patients and clients as I can show them what the issues are, work on them and assign their case specific homework [stretches & exercises]. I recommend it to massage therapists, physical therapists [and their assistants], occupational therapists [and their assistants].

Levinson points out the aburdities of the general workplace with great wit - it may not be Nietzsche, and he may exaggerate his experiences, but the writing would be pretty dry otherwise. Those who decry him for his attitude - well, it's hard to have a good attitude when your bosses treat you like s--t, when you're nothing more than a cog in the machine; it's a nice guilty pleasure to read about his vindictive actions against his a--hole employers. The fact that he has this book published as well as a forthcoming novel just proves that he has managed to rise above his past situations of brain-dead employment."},{"rating":"2","title":"He hits the nail on the head","review":"I too wondered (as another reviewer did) why Mr. Levison, during the years he was doing these make-do jobs, didn't continue to pursue work using the writing skills he obviously has. Maybe he did, and just worked \\"in the meantime\\". I also don't recall details of his financial obligations--family, housing, education loans, etc.--which is to say, his bottom-line needs. Granted--working full time does not leave a whole lot of hours free for job hunting, and the economy and employment situations in the US has been a roller coaster ride for many years.But there is truth within his observations, and he writes it like it is. He offers a perspective on what is the working reality for many decent, hard-working people. Work at this level has become a game (on both sides). I think it helps to consciously be aware of that. He presents these sad realities with great humor and irony! An easy, quick, entertaining and informative little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully funny!! Encore, please????","review":"I really loved this book. It's one of the few that I felt the need to read multiple times. I find the author, whether he's being serious or funny, to be a riot. His writing style is very light and simple. Just reading about all his different jobs is so interesting and fun - probably because I can relate to never seeming to find the right job.

The cast is excellent; all the major performers singing both movingly and very well. The innocence of Edith Mathis' Pamina, the forthrightness and innocence of Gedda's Tamino, the calm wisdom of Sotin's Sarastro, and the humane comedy of Workman's Papageno all shine. Fischer-Diskeau's performace as the Speaker is a bonus here. Horst Stein's conducting is fine, if not extraordinary, and Peter Ustinov's staging the best I have seen other than Bergman's and less self-indulgent than Bergman's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Travel Books","review":"I think these Nat Geo books are the best.

It runs, but you need to use the keyboard to play the games. The original Intellivision had a hand-held numeric keypad and thumb-wheel joystick; most keyboards -- especially laptop keyboards -- just aren't up to the task of duplicating this.A few of the games work well under this constraint (Astrosmash, Space Armada,), but most don't.I was also stumped by a few games (notable Poker and Blackjack) that seem to get stuck waiting for input from \\"Player 2\\".

That is the idea I got from the tagline \\"A field guide to the creatures that cannot rest in peace.\\"Instead of a \\"field guide\\" I got a history book. Detailing some old wives tales and ghost stories. It was a somewhat interesting read but I never actually finished it after losing interest after awhile.

I hadn't read much about Voodoo before, and this was really excellent to start with. It has information in regards to rituals, gods/demons, history, and people of note. Same goes for the vampire and ghoul sections.If you already have a fair sized library about vampires and other oogy boogies, I would skip this one. As it doesn't go into detail.

Unfortunately, the Kindle version bears little resemblance to the online version. Only short excerpts of most articles are available, with a link to the remainder of the article online. This defeats the purpose of the Kindle, which shouldn't need a constant internet connection and cannot render most web pages satisfactorily. Additionally, the current articles online are not available on Kindle at the same time, in spite of frequent updates. You'll want to check the web version anyway. On the plus side, it's cheap and the articles and news items are often interesting. Amazingly weak effort by Huffington Post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor conversion to Kindle","review":"Horrible conversion from web to Kindle.

Most are fairly comprehensive. Topics comprise a real \\"mixed bag\\" - mainly timely news stories, but also on occasion delving into financial commentary, media and celebrity news, and science and medicine. Most are from other sources - The NY Times being one example. A negative of the blog is that a few articles require clicking on a link to pull up the full story. Otherwise, the headline is all you see. Since the basic Kindle e-reader is \\"inept\\" at navigating the internet, these articles don't get read. However, the problem exists only with a small minority of the stories. Also, while many articles are quite objectively written, a few evidence a liberal slant. Doesn't bother me, but might some.

The full 3D real time strategy, while a cool idea, is difficult to manage and the graphics end up just looking like a bunch of colored polygons flying around in random directions.You really have to WANT to like this game to be able to get into it.

The lack of emphasis on the later completely turned me off this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought!","review":"This book is written for parents/guardians of kids/teens who have been through a traumatic experience, not for parents/guardians of difficult kids/teens, although that is how everything I read about the book before I purchased it led me to believe!

The first clue was the bashing of \\"traditional views\\". When someone is so intent on bashing other opinions, usually they are not too secure in their own. After reading this trash, now I understand why. What is really disturbing is that the authors actually quote Scripture but their message is far from it. The bottom line in the book is everything the child does is not their fault or their responsibilty. It is something in the parent that makes the parent upset by the behavior. God help the families that actually by into this message.

My child would keep fighting even if all 4 of his limbs were broken. In his mind he is trying to survive at the most basic level, even in response to smallest upset. What works is to prepare him for what to expect in the day and compassion when he is on alert, or worked up, then later discuss the problem with his behavior. He is now a different kid : ) Consequences are necessary, but not in the moment, that just amplifies the problem.

However, I quickly realized that this book applied to me as well. Working from a scientific and evidence based approach, I began to understand why I reacted the way I did to small issues (a life or death response which left me upset and mystified). The authors explain the fight or flight response in detail, and discuss how to be with someone who is responding in this way to small stresses, like \\"please turn off the tv.\\" The approach is not airy-fairy \\"do these 10 actions and everything will be fine.\\" This is hard work but practical and do-able.

Also, it's a bit of a pain to add or remove pages, as you have to remove all pages from the top, not the center like a 3 ring binder does. The positives - It's extremely durrable. I was skeptical at first, being the binders are plastic, but it really does lock well. The case exterior is made up of a very strong nylon, and the zipper is no cheap piece of junk that will unravel after a few uses. The cds and inserts all fit snug, so there's no fear of your disks all dumping out if it would happen to slip off the seat or table. It also has a nice elastic pocket-organizer inside the front cover, for some of the booklets that are abnormally large. Overall, another great product from Case Logic that I would definately buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for all our DVD's","review":"Ok I do hate that we have to take all the pages out to put in a new page, but this is perfect for all our DVD's.

I am back to buy a second!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made -- a disappointment","review":"Compared to past Case Logic purchases and to recent purchases of similar no-name products, this Case Logic CD wallet feels very cheap. They nylon is very thin and looks like it will not stand up to much wear and tear. The slots are about half a millimeter too narrow: CDs fit very snugly, while CD liner notes are a struggle to get in and out. Overall, it will suffice, but it's a disappointment.

It&#699;s built like a 3 ring binder, (the page adding feature is what made me want to buy it in the first place) but the binder rings tend to open and the pages either slip or get squished while you&#699;re flipping through the book. My husband and I finally submitted to duct taping the rings shut, and while the pages don&#699;t slip anymore they don&#699;t turn too great either. My suggestion? Pass on this one and find something without rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD wallet - too large!","review":"I bought this case because I got free shipping by getting another item - it is too large, unweildy to handle when filled with CD, though it does hold a lot of discs.

It has just one fault, and that is the zipper. The problem is closing the album. The zipper runs fine for about 1 1/2\\". Then it must make a sharp turn, and there is nothing for you to hold onto to keep the zipper straight. This is where the zipper will fail, and then it will not close at all. It opens fine, has good storage, but closing it is a real nuisance.Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case!","review":"This case was exactly what we were looking for to store our back-up anime and movie collection until it grows and we need to purchase another.

The plastic inserts are heavy duty and I feel this will last many years.Hope this helps your decision :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to store and transport your CD collection.","review":"I recently compared many brands and styles while looking for a larger CD case for my collection. I ended up deciding on this one, as it seemed preferable to all other options I've looked at. The \\"pages\\" hold 92 CDs, and there are an additional 8 slots inside the front cover, making for a total capacity of 100. The clear plastic makes it easy to quickly flip through and find what you're looking for, and yet the slots are still sturdy enough to hold the CDs in place and afford some protection - I've seen other cases that are so flimsy the CDs will just fall right out of their slots at the slightest disturbance. And for its large storage capacity, this case is still of a size that lends itself to portability - whereas the models that hold 128+ CDs begin to get rather ungainly. The handle on the spine is also nice, making it easy to carry. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"organization is the key","review":"all my computer games are now in one place and i can find what im looking for. no more hunting through cd cases trying to read what the game is. will get more of these as i get more games. takes up less room than all those plastic, breakable cases too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality for Price","review":"I caught these at a great price ($12.99) and I feel it was a good deal.The case seems sturdy enough.

I finally decided that I did not need all the plastic cases and floor space taken up. Amazing how many pieces fit into this case. There are even slots for 10 CDs in the cover at the front that I use to keep commonly accessed media.

I've had to return this item twice now, because the company doesn't ship what is shown. Very annoying.

We have several other case logic CD cases, which all have black pages with full square pockets that accommodate liner notes as well as CDs. The product we received looked the same as the others from the outside, with the nylon cover and zipper, but inside it was a three ring binder, with white binder pages that had CD pockets with the corners sewn, preventing insertion of any liner notes. Unfortunately we don't trust that we'll get the right thing if we order again, so we will try to find another of these in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatively easy to page through","review":"Like any binder this size, trying to flip through the pages takes a pinch of patience, but it's really not bad. Being the nerd I am, I alphabetized and spaced my DVD collection in here, filling it about 50%. It's still not too unwieldy. I'm pretty happy with the quality and construction.

Less than 12 months ago I purchased several of these CD/DVD cases, and all five have fallen apart with gentle, typical household use. If you look at the picture you will see two plastic straps holding the individual CD/DVD pages in place. Unfortunately, as you flip through through the holder, the two solid plastic straps begin to cut and wear away the thin plastic pages they hold. The pages eventually fall out and the CD/DVD holder is then useless. They were the WORST waste of money; do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big problem not yet mentioned","review":"One large problem that I have yet to see mentioned is the following.You will probably be adding your discs in the wallet by Genre, and then alphabetically sorting either by artist or titleAs you fill the book, every time you want to add a new disc, (ie Carly Simon), but all the spaces between \\"R\\" and \\"T\\" are taken, you have to remove all the pages to fit one in where the \\"S\\" are to accomodate your new disc.In a normal binder where the rings split in the middle, you can flip past the last \\"S\\" page and add a new page there. However since these rings force you to add a page in the front, you have to remove them all every time you add a page. The second problem is that because these pages have \\"slits\\" for holes and not \\"circular\\" holes, replacing the pages in the binder is a real pain.Be forwarned. this is not a problem if your collection is not growing. But if it is, it will likely quickly grow disorganized due to the difficulty in adding new pages where they need to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen","review":"Case Logic cases were once the epitome. I have bought over 2 dozen of their cases over many years, and still have all of them. Their overall design, craftmanship, materials and selection have all gone down, while prices have gone up.They used to provide a hard leather cover with precision metal fasteners, which have lasted me over 20 years. Now I get a very thin nylon membrane over cardboard, with cheap plastic fittings that are poorly assembled and do not last.I have no complaints about the seller; just the manufacturer.The ad claims \\"Durable padded outer-material resistant to heat, moisture, and tearing\\". Resistant by what yardstick?

The cds have been well protected. They don't scratch and the pages are tight enough that they don't slip out if stored upside down. The handle is really strong, and I've had no ripping even carrying the case entirely filled.The one problem I have come across is with the zipper. I put a lot of heavy wear on this case recently, so for normal use it will probably be okay. But the zipper on my case has recently started to seperate from material, making it really difficult to zip up. For storage around my room, it is still wonderful, but it does make it a lot more difficult to travel with."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not purchase this cd wallet!!","review":"I purchased this CD wallet thinking it had everything.

I always carried it in my hands, and kept it under the car seat while driving. I have never thrown it, dropped it, or lost it.Well, recently I realized that many of the CD sleeves were cracked along the edges, and some so badly that CDs won't stay put in them.I have owned this product less than 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best!","review":"I currently have three of these cases, one slightly older, and I plan to purchase another.The \\"binder rings\\" are probably the best feature as compared to other higher end portable storage units.The only problem I had was CD-booklet storage as the sleeves are just wide enough to hold the CD edge to edge with very little expansion room for the booklet to fit; This does tend to hold the CD itself better so the trade is probably worth the difficulty.My older unit holds my CD-Rom discs and has been accessed quite frequently with no sign of wear and the zipper is fine.If you need portable, hideable mass storage for CD-media this unit is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned in a heart beat.....","review":"As soon as I received this case I returned it.

I am also in agreement with the reviewer that said the 3-ring-replacement here is not very user-friendly, even when it does work as intended.

Might want more bookshelf room soon so I'm thinking about getting a second one for kids movies - Defiently a space saver for those DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy product","review":"I'm really disappointed in this case. The sleeves barely have room for the CDs, and the fit is too tight for *most* booklets. The sleeve plastic is really fragile - several split when I was putting CDs into them. I'd read the other reviews before I bought this case and they were pretty positive, which makes me wonder if Case Logic has using a different supplier now. A friend has their DVDs in a similar case that's several years old, and it's much sturdier than this one. A good argument for not buying things online, I guess, because if I'd looked at this case in a store, I wouldn't have gotten it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good storage solution","review":"I had an older case logic binder which was great. When I needed more storage space I thought I'd purchase another case logic. The model I had before no longer existed so I went with this one. It's a good build and it works well. It's not too big as some reviewers suggest. The plastic sleeves that hold the CDs are cheap, even cheaper than the ones that came in my old case logic binder...but they seem to get the job done...and they're probably equivalent to other sleeves on the market. Would recommend and/or buy another if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great capacity!","review":"This case holds a lot of cds (with or without sleeves). The only thing I would change is if you need to remove a sleeve, you have to take out all the ones in front of it. It would work better if it were like a 3 ring binder where you can open it and remove a sleeve where ever you wanted to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This Product is great. I am copying VHS tapes to DVD and storing this under the bed to save space. So far no problems. It is big and when it is completely full, I expect it will be to heavy to hold just the handle...I don't mind as I just hold it from the bottom on my side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Overall a good product. CD slots inside seem to be a little too tight and made it hard and in some cases impossible to insert liner notes. Really like the quick lock system so pages don't fall out. Also like the fast file for CDs at the front of the wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"I was a bit worried about how well the pages would stay in, but I don't think that'll be a problem. Because of the mechanism to lock/unlock the straps, they come out easily and stay closed very securely. The case is a little bigger than I need (should have gotten one size smaller). The handle is kind of stupid as it doesn't hardly give enough room to fit a hand under to carry. The nice thing about it though is a hand slips in and stays tightly for sorting while holding the whole case on an arm. It's nice for looking through, but not for carrying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Great product","review":"After looking for a case to expand my daughters expanding DVD collection, I decided on this unit as the best value with great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and cheap.","review":"Very functional, and great for the price.The locking system is better than the regular 3-ring binder for preveting wear and tear on the pages. The only drawback is that you have to take out all the pages if you want to re-arrange them; that doesn't happen with the 3-ring binders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal for the money.","review":"I bought this to use for photo CD's I got through quite a few photographing and having an album to store them in makes it a lot easier and faster to find what I'm looking for. I bought 2 of them and probably will get another one before too much longer.Pros: Holds a lot of CD's.Case/cover is fairly sturdy and zips easily.Easy to flip pages.Cons: Feel pages are a bit \\"flimsy\\" at times but it holds up and I mostlikely won't remove CDs in and out that often, this is more of astorage unit for me, since the jewel cases were getting out ofhand (over 150 of them).I think it will do good for what I need. The only thing I think I\\"ll miss is some sort of plastic page or cover where I can insert some sort of indexing page so I can easily find what I need. Other than that its a good one. Will probably buy another one just like this next time, its a very good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encyclopedia of US Army Insignia & Uniforms","review":"This is a great reference book if you are a Militaria collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap plastic","review":"The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suncast 175' Hose Job","review":"This is a terrible product. I have used it for a year now. It is flimsy, bends and flexes far too much when it is cranked or moved. I think it is made of flexible vinyl or polyethylene. This is the wrong type of plastic for this application unless it is very thick. The wheels fall off. It bounces when moved because the wheels are either out of round or hang up on the axle. I heavily greased the axel, but that had no effect. I usually give products a good review, but this thing is horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hose reel","review":"This hose reel is misleading.

First one lasted 2 years, second- three years of gentle use. The reason of death in both cases is that the plastic part on the side of the cart to which the short hose connects(the one that came with the cart) shoots out of the cart under the pressure of the water and water gushes through the hole. Replacement of the 2 rubber O-rings on the part did not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Constructed Junk","review":"I have owned 2 Suncast products - and they were both JUNK. This hose reel is made of thin, cheap plastic. It is very under-built. With a hose on the reel, the handle is not even strong enough to tip it back and roll it across the yard without snapping loose - you end up just dragging it around. After one season of use, the inlet hose connection to the reel leaked non-stop. I bought mine at a local hardware store for $20. Speaking from experience I would say don't buy this product or any of the other junk Suncast makes - it seems that cheap plastic junk all they make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very fragile","review":"I just finished using this for the first time and already the wheels are starting to wobble. I believe the impact of trying move it, with the weight of a mounted hose, placed too much stress on the very thin plastic. The wobble makes it now difficult to move further, defeating the purpose of the \\"mobile.\\" I don't anticipate the whole thing will last very long. I am very disappointed in this product and feel my money is basically wasted. I will not buy this brand, nor probably any plastic hose reel, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the reduced pricel","review":"I used this item about 6 times and it cracked .

This book clearly refutes that view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad anthology","review":"This is a prime example of how an anthology of poetry should NOT be made. The editors are in reality just the compilers, they have limited themselves to putting together the table of contents. Except for a page long vague introduction and copyright acknowledgments there is no information whatsoever on the selection, or even elementary info on the poets: neither their dates, nor whether they are contemporary or of old, living or dead, etc! Not to mention not crediting the translators, or even mentioning that some poems were translated--how the reader is supposed to know that Federico Garcia Lorca or Czeslaw Milosz did not write their poems in English?! The fact that the acknowledgments at the end of the book are arranged by poems' titles, and not in alphabetical order, therefore very difficult to navigate is just a minor nuisance. A really bad book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gray and dissapointing","review":"I was less than thrilled with this book, for which I had high expectations. For one things, the \\"illustrated by\\" suggestion on the cover is a joke. There are very very few, small illustrations. Also, I find that many of the topics of poems in the book are inappropriate or incomprehensible to kids. Likewise, many of the poems have language that is not practical for kids and will likely only confuse them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As stated by another reviewer, the book has just a few black & white small illustrations: the cover is deceitful. And I don't know what to do with such poems as \\"Don't write poems about what's happening. / Nothing is born or dies in poetry's presence. / Next to it, life is a static sun / without warm or light...\\" (Carlos Drummond de Andrade, a poet I appreciate, but not for children).

In tracing the pathways via which three family's meals reached the table, Singer and Mason inform, reason, problematize, and sometimes shock. But they do not preach. Increasing awareness and concerns about what we eat and where our foods come from are changing global and local and global norms. \\"The Way We Eat\\" is an indespensable resource for those seeking to act as global citizens rather than simply global consumers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on a broad range of subjects","review":"I really thought this was a great book. It is well written (believe it or not it is a \\"page turner\\") and it covers a broad range of topics in an open minded and sober manner. It deals with ethical, envirnomental and economic political side of what we eat, as well as other topics and uses a narrative thread following 3 different families with different lifestyles. I got a lot out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry","review":"This film's pacing is torturous. Not much of a plot, either. The acting is very amateurish. If the firector was serious he wouldve gotten trained actors instead of making a cheap play for street cred by casting indie musicians in the main roles. With the exception of some characters who overact, most of the characters overacting are borderline catatonic. It's like a zombie movie movie without the blood and gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great questions, unimaginitive question writing.","review":"This book has taken up the greater part of the past 2 months. It's a great challenge for trivia lovers like myself. However, most of the questions are taken directly (some word for word) from well-known trivia sources.

It puts a lot of screws in real fast. For an old guy like me, this type of tool takes a lot of force if above chest level to keep engaged on the screwhead. but that is the nature of this type tool. Super easy for decking. Sheetrocking was a little more difficult. Would definitily recommend having one."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT TOOL!","review":"I have owned this tool for over a year now and have driven at least 1000 screws with it with ZERO problems. I am an avid DIY'er and am remodeling our house and when it comes time to hang drywall, this tool is an asset! The depth control works very well and just sinks the screws below the surface of the drywall and the head of the plunger leaves just the right dimple to fill with compound. I have used this tool while remodeling 3 rooms of our home and for installing sheets of drywall in a garage addition and all I can say is I LOVE THIS TOOL! If you are going to be installing drywall and are considering this product to speed things up, GO FOR IT! you won't be dissapointed! I have not tried this product for screws longer than 1-1/4 but if I need to build a quick frame for something, I doubt i'll be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Saver!!","review":"I have been using this to hang drywall and HardiPanel on my home's lower level. It takes about a minute to screw down a sheet once it is in place. When I think of time I would have spent nailing or using a non-collated gun, this tool is worth it. Even on the small job I used it for, it saved me at least an hour of time. I will update this review after rebuilding my lower deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are times the screws get hung up in the head.

All you need to do is keep the tool at a 90 degree to the work surface and have a wrist strong enough to hold the drill. Pople with issues only have them cause accidently they are at an angle or their wrist gets tierd and can't push the drill all the way down to fully set the screw. I strongly reccomend this product to my friends and reccomend standard drills to my enemies. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome tool","review":"The only reason i had bought this tool was to do a picket fence for myself, because it was cheaper for me to buy it than rent it for time it was going to take me to do the fence. this ended up being one of the best investment in a tool that i have made. I used only one bit for 700 ft of picket fence and never had a problem. After the fence project i have used it for hanging plywood and drywall. once you get used to it you can hold the trigger and go, with the clutch once you have set the screw the bit will stop and when you retract it from the material the clutch will engage and you can start all over. you can hang a 4x8 sheet of plywood or drywall in less than 60 secs. you may not use this tool all of the time but when you need it nothing beats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"great price. fast shipment. works great. easy to order. made the job at lot easier. able to finish alot quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Tool, Save Time and Money","review":"I've been a tile contractor in the twin cities for over a decade.

I use the duraspin to sink my field screws, then come backwith my cordless for inside corners. When you got something over your head to putup, this gun is especially useful.

But even before I realized that it was defective it was apparent that the swiveling mechanism was of poor quality because it is not possible to lock the screen in the forward position. Once I realized the product was defective I called Polaroid to inquire about an exchange or refund because the retailer from which I purchased it does not exchange electronics that have been opened. Well Polaroid does not exchange or refund its defective products. My only option was to mail them the defective productive, at my own cost, to get repaired and then it would be returned to me approximately 3 weeks later. Essentially I paid $230 for a refurbished product. Its not worth the risk of buying a product from a company that will not even back its own products."},{"rating":"1","title":"already have this - looking for another","review":"This is the worst manual I have ever owned.

This one seemed to have the best reviews, and Amazon had the best price, so I purchased it. Unfortunately this manual is very general - there are a few good tidbits like testing some of the fuel injection components, but one of the main issues I am having (vacuum-related) is not addressed. In fact, there is not a single vacuum diagram in the entire book that I can find. On our vehicle, a previous owner has capped 2 vacuum lines under the dash and I wanted to reference the line color to a diagram - no such luck.

I was very pleased because I know now that I no longer need to carry the camera and a video recorder.The pictures are beautiful.

I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was going to buy the Sony...","review":"I was going to buy the Sony 3MP digital camera for my first digital camera purchase. My friends liked theirs. Instead, I let the Wolf (Ritz) camera store salesman talk me into the Canon S50.I'm so glad I bought the Canon! The picture quality is far superior to the Sony and even the 8X10 pictures I have printed are exquisite!I have taken pictures ranging from the deep blue of the Pacific Ocean at Cabo San Lucas to closeups of people indoors and out and the quality is excellent - better than my 35 mm film camera.The camera is light and portable and easy to use. On the Auto setting, it really is point-and-click.I have to confess, I haven't read the two inch thick instruction manual yet though I am looking forward to learning more about its features. In the meantime - I am getting great shots and enjoying the camera!I strongly recommend the 256K memory card and an extra battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one word, Wow!","review":"Finally decided to get S50. Am I happy with the decision I made!Since, My brother owns S45, I didn't want to get the same one. Just paid a few more dollars for 1 extra Megapixel.We did comparison tests on my bigscreen Sony Digital TV. Crispy sharp. They both perform just about the same except when you zoom the picture to the max, you can tell, then, what an extra megapixel means. Otherwise, aside from the body color( which I'm trilled with since it's diff from all the other dig. cameras) and more pixels, they are about the same.It took me a good 2 months to do research before I went with this one. I'm a 100% happy camper. Still trying to find out all these features that come with the little one.

What would I be doing posting a 5 star review on the S50 then you ask? It's very clear! The S50 is an all around great camera for traveling, parties, awards ceremonies & anything where a purse sized powerful beauty is needed. The zoom's not that long and red eye is frequent, but when it comes to color reproduction this product shines! Perfect for outside shots with crystal clarity.

Now, if only I were able to make out the subject of my photographs it might be something. All I get is blurred, messed up images. This is pretty consistent in any of its autofocus modes. Sure! I see this thing attempting to focus, but it always gets it wrong. I sat here for one hour trying to take a sharp picture of the stuff on my night stand, and was able to do it only on the manual focus mode. Even then, the picture was not that sharp. My old Sony 1 megapixel camera takes far better pictures. Is my camera defective? I Don't know, but I read other reviews that mentioned the same problem. Whatever; I am returning it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY AND FUN","review":"This product is light, compact and easy to use. It is great for active people and easily tucks into a pocket, purse or diaper bag. I prefer the viewfinder over the screen display but love that it has both. Recommend buying another battery (not much warning) and definately another card because of the file sizes (I got a 512 MB). Don't forget a card reader if you need one.At this point, I have not used the enclosed software. I bought the camera immediately before an unexpected trip and am using another program just because I already knew it.Two of my friends have already bought the same camera. My last digital was an early Nikon Coolpix which always seemed to have trouble. This Canon has run smoothly since Day 1 and has taken about 1400 pictures in the last 6-7 months.

It helped me give up some of my \\"issues\\" with digital versus film. I have yet to print any photos, but they look GREAT on-screen and on-line (my main reason for using digital). Love the quality, love the compact size and the light weight. Good zoom capabilities. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the lens cover. I feel like it could come off each time I open or close the cover (in fact, the one we looked at in the store had it's cover broken -- almost didn't buy it because of that).

This camera has two major drawbacks; Autofocus and Chromatic Aberrations. I take a lot of panorama and mosaic picture and even if one is out of focus it is all ruinded. Every fourth picture I take with autofocus is slighly or completely out of focus. Chomatic aberrations (purple or neon effect) appears on shiny surfaces and this is really annoying in high resolution images. This camera is good when it works but most of the times it does not. If you take more than 30 images a month I DO NOT recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camera","review":"I have used many different film cameras Including a Canon body with EF lenses. This camera takes excellent pictures and has all of the functions of my $500 Canon body I bought 10 years ago. After reading some of the poor reviews on this site I was nervous about purchasing the camera, however after receiving it and taking some pictures, it is all Canon promises and more. I do get some out of focus pictures now and then but that is primarily due the the camera not being able to obtain an autofocus lock. Nothing inherently wrong with the camera and I always can override the autofocus with the manual and the pictures then come out excellently.I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants to be able to have the flexibility and quality to take very good pictures in a small format camera. The only downside is the fact I can not put my EF lenses on this fine little camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital camera with growing room","review":"The Canon S50 has lots of strengths: crisp, sharp color, excellent automatic focus and exposure settings, sharp optics and snazzy design. And a few annoying weaknesses; major redeye problems, an optical viewfinder which only shows 82% of the picture, one second shutter delay and a tiny multi-function switch. It's very durable; I dented mine dropping it from an overhead train compartment in Japan. The 32 meg compact flash card included only holds ten pictures at the highest setting but you can buy a 128 meg on the internet for $35. The very compact battery charger charges Canon's proprietary battery in 80 minutes and works on 110/220 volts. You can buy a clone battery on the net for $5.95. I recommend substituting a neck strap for the provided wrist strap. Included software is okay but I like ACDSee better.On balance, an excellent value at Amazon's price. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Camera - Terrible Lens Cover Design","review":"My experience with this camera has been pleaserable for the most part. However, the lens cover is another story. The lens cover openning and shutting is the key to get the camera operating. After seveal years of use, something happened where the lens cover would no longer shut, making the camera in-operable. I sent it to Cannon for ~$150 service. After getting it back, it worked properly for a few months and then the same thing happened!

The CD discussions of the symphonies are worth the price alone. He is clearly passionate about the music, as well as what's behind the music, delving into the composers life and perhaps Mahler's perspective. After listening to Zander's discussions and taking in his performance, it is quite interesting to go back to other versions I own and listen to them. Luckily, Mahler's genius is so great, that any well performed interpretation stands on it's own even if you disagree with certain aspects of it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"If you are a classical music lover, you must purchase this CD. It is absolutely great.

Definitely check these out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content 5 stars--video 3 stars","review":"Having watched this entire set, I can say that the quality of the content outweighs any qualms about sound or video quality. Yes, the picture looks more like an old VHS tape than a new DVD, but it's not THAT bad. I found it it didn't get in the way of enjoying one of the best documentaries ever made. Bottom line: if you're picky--make that super picky--about video quality, avoid this. If, however, you are really interested in an excellent documentary on the Silk Road, then take the plunge.

While I recognize that I run my car for an extended period every day, I am not disappointed with the cooling ability of the fan. I used the fan for about 2 weeks and then out of no where, it started to make a terrible noise. The bolts that held the face to the motor came loose and got cought in the actual fan blades, causing the blades to stop rotating. I thought I solved that problem by screwing back in the bolts, when the motor case on the back came loose and caused the fan to slump on the clip. Then the bolt came loose again, rendering the fan useless. I decided to try to rebuild this fan (which by the way, sells for $10 at walmart) and came to realize that instead of using a screw thread, it used a plastic bolt in the motor case that was completely inaccessible without completely destroying the fan.

She deserved better than what she got on THREE'S COMPANY. It was especially interesting to read about how Suzanne reacted when she met the actress who replaced her on THREE'S COMPANY. The book is also about how Suzanne and her husband blended their families together. Suzanne's husband was very resentful of her son and it was sad to read about the way Bruce was treated for many years. But in the end everything works out for the best.

But I can be sure that this is not the limit to this system's capability. First off,the gameplay is just plain boring,since there are very few dirrerent enemies, and the level design barely differs at all. It is also very short, it only has 12 levels where as every other FPS games for the GBA has at least 20. This game also throws you right into gameplay without telling you anything about whats going on. Overall,I'd wait for Doom,Ecks vs Sever,or Dark Arena. But if you can afford it, this game still has it's fun points(though few and far apart)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A game that promised but couldn't deliver","review":"This has to be one of the most dissapointing games I have ever played. With all of the features and the fact that it is the first first person shooter for the gba, it was a game to look foward to. To make a long review short this game SUCKS and I don't mean that lightly I mean it really really sucks, the graphics are good but the gameplay and level design definatly doesn't do the system or the engine justice.

Right?","review":"Can FPSs be pulled off on the GBA with great results? Of course they can, and we have seen exactly a dozen on the small system. Some good (Duke Nukem Advance, Ice Nine), some bad (Wolfenstein 3D, Medal of Honor: Underground). But is the one that started it all any good? Back Track is the tenth best FPS for the GBA and the 1st released for the system. Back Track is a campy sci-fi FPS that limits you to the point where you can see only two feet in front of yourself and lets you man artillery like a bubble gun, yes, you heard me right, a bubble gun, and that's right, you guessed it, it fires bubble gum. What!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"This is the first game to show off the GBAs ability to do raytracing style games like Doom, Duke3D, etc.. sadly this one should have never been made.

This book is a gem and I will be recommending it often.While the discussion of mood disorders, diagnosis and treatment, pre-conception, during pregnancy, and postpartum is completely comprehensive, this book doesn't just focus on psychiatric diagnoses. It talks openly and wisely about the emotional adjustment required when one becomes a parent.

The zooming mechanism is noisy and appears cheap. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a bad A70 that was damaged in shipping? I've decided to get another type of camera at a local camera shop this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Camera, Bad Company","review":"It's a great camera, but hope you never need support. The Canon support structure is bad and nearly non-existent. Very difficult to get to them. I have major problems with my Windows 98SE system and their TWAIN driver and after a week and four or more tries I finally got an email response that said it's a windows problem and they won't help (WON'T not CAN'T). The TWAIN driver doesn't work with my OS and it maybe my old hardware as well as the OS but everything else I try works. It's just their attitude and difficulty getting them to respond. By the way, the camera works okay on Windows XP. Just beware if you have older Hardware or OS - Support is basically not available or helpful and the TWAIN driver may not work or it may hang your system."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have 3 of these, very impressed","review":"I have been using my A70 almost nonstop since i bought it, and have had no problems, I take it snowboarding, hiking, climbing, etc and I am not gentle with it.

The picture quality is nice, and the camera is easy to use.However now that 2007 is around the corner, I'm starting to think of upgrading, one thing that I don't like about this camera is that it is pretty bulky when carrying it in your pocket. This camera is bigger than the newer cameras of its class, and at 3.2MP its starting to show its age.Overall, nice camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"good first camera","review":"I'll make this short, but this is a good first camera.

I literally bang it against my hand and then the screen comes up clear. However, since I'm past the warranty, I don't feel like getting it repaired. I'm tempted to look into other Canons like the SD400, but I'm reading how that has a LCD cracking problem.

We bought it for about $300 and we've had it for less than 3 years. We've need to repair it 2 times. After using it for less than a year, the LCD screen stopped working and the camera took all-black pictures. Canon fixed it because it was still under warranty. A year later, the camera had the same problem but Canon would not fix it. They said I could pay them $150 for a \\"refurbished\\" exact same model and send them my old camera.

A panel on the body also has begun to loosen, even though the camera has always been cased, and never mishandled.In reading other complaints and problems in this forum, it seems that Canon sees users of its consumer cameras as idiots, who will gleefully send these cameras back to the factory and pay a further $150 (plus shipping) for a refurbished replacement.I suggest you purchase a higher-quality brand (Nikon, Leica), and leave Canon to sort out its obvious Quality Control problems on other, less-informed consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Problem","review":"New AA battery always shows up as low after a single shot.

It's a cheap camera and the image quality reflects it.

The only bad thing is that some of the pictures have looked blurry or soft (but you can just delete them and take them again.)and the LCD screen has looked fuzzy a few times.All the good stuff overshadows that, though. The camera has preformed very well in the inside(bright and dark rooms. Dark are excellent.), outside, and in dark outside scenes. I took 6 pictures the lunar eclipse last night and they are all crystal clear.It powers up very quickly and the menus are easy to navigate. The digital zoom is very useful in far away subjects.

The all-automatic setting makes pictures totally easy for the novice and the manual settings allow you to experiment. The user manual is pretty good at explaining basic operation and features and the free software helps you get your shots on your computer for editing and uploads.Only two complaints: the visual display is very hard to see in daylight (use the old fashion viewfinder) and be sure you get rechargeable batteries.

After doing some research, by comparing to other digital cameras at the same price, the choice was easy . A70 outstands them all. The image quality is very good for 3.2 mpixels, the manual mode is excellent for such a cheap camera, and it is possible to use extra lenses from Canon. The only problem is the Red eye effect which is quite intense with this camera. This is not very important of course because it can be corrected with the use of software. Another drawback is the use of 4 batteries, where other 3.2 mpixel cameras use 2 batteries. Last but not least the flashcard included is way too small and the purchase of a bigger one is mandatory.In a few words :Pros : good quality, excellent manual mode, excellent video modeCons: Intense redeye, small flashcard, 4 batteries required.I highly recommend this one, it's a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer Quality Control is very bad","review":"After reading some other reviews before me, I guess that the Quality control at Canon (Malasia) is very bad.

Also, professional reviews have been the best for this camera.I got mine after a long wait and I started learning the operation of the camera. I even took a few snaps of my Kitchen (photo had lot of shades, they were just experimental shots though).Next day when I switched the camera on, nothing shows up in the LCD except for some default menus.

When you turn it on, all you get is a black fuzzy screen. After reading several of these posts, i understand this is a common problem. In fact around the same time this happened to my camera, one of my colleagues had the same exact problem with his canon.

I called Canon and was told that there must be something stuck in the lens. I asked whether this was a factory defect and was told that it could be. I now have to send this relatively new camera in for servicing for something that appears to be a known issue to Canon! Can you say class action lawsuit?

Too bad Amazon editorial reviews never bothered to do their own research before recommending a completely useless product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe mine was a lemon, but...","review":"...out A70's digital pickup elements died after just a year. It would play back fine, just couldn't take pictures. We sent it back twice for fixing until it finally ran out of its warranty. I absolutely loved the features of this camera though, and was sorry to give it up. And, sorry to say, I wouldn't buy another Canon because of this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Just like the other review, my canon powershot A70 became non-functional, just beyond the warranty period. Instead of the picture, it produced orange and black stripes. The Canon Service Center determined it to be a non-functional imaging unit and indicated it would take a minimum of $100 to repair. My options were either to junk the camera and lost $300 investment in it or agree to their demand. I would have expected Canon to repair it for free because the camera was discovered to be non-functional within 13 months of the purchase and at the time of discovery had not been used for over a month. I have reluctantly ponied up $100 for the repair but would warn any one considering a canon powershot to be aware of the reliability problem with their imaging unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I was looking for a small good quality digital camera for around $300. I wasn't sure whether to get the canon a70 or the Kodak EasyShare DX6340. I read reviews anywhere i could. I saw some pretty discouraging reviews of the canon. Although, i liked the size and the layout. I also heard from friends and family that i should definitly go with the canon. That the lense was crystal over kodaks glass. I'm very glad that i chose the canon. It takes amazing pictures and i couldnt be happier! I strongly recommend the canon a70 to anyone looking for a great little camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"A\\" line cameras are perfect for the point and shoot","review":"I am completely satisfied with the camera. I would recommed you read your manual before you begin taking pictures. I was amazed by some of the features it does have. I also like the fact I can use regular batteries in it. Make sure you invest in a rapid charger and couple of sets of rechargable batteries.It's not perfect taking pictures in low light. I still did receive some red eyes even with red eye reduction light on.I would recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after one year.","review":"Great while it worked, which wasn't long. After 9 months of ownership the camera stopped working, with all the pictures coming out black. Because it was still under warranty Canon repaired at no charge, but the same problem occurred again 3 1/2 months later. No longer under warranty, my only option now is to spend $100+ to fix the exact same problem, which is only guaranteed for another 90 days. Not worth it. I will be spending the $100 towards another camera, and it will definetely NOT be a Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera.","review":"This camera is very user friendly, takes amazing pictures and video footage. I am not a technical type at all and after reading a few pages of the manual I can operate mose features of this camera. I have had it for 6 months and it travels well too. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new digital camera user","review":"I admit that I don't have anything to compare this to--but I am very happy with this camera. Is simple to use, takes great pictures. I'm sure there are people who have a lot of experience with digital cameras that could find something to be improved on this rather inexpensive, average number pixal model, but for a newbie like me it's great!! I'm glad I bought this one rather than the other 20 or more I looked at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I received this without a CF card so I emailed the seller and they said they did not get one so that's how it comes. I must admit I assumed it would and should have asked before purchasing. Yes it was cheap but it was also used. I purchased this for an older person and thought it would be easy enough for them to use. I still can't get it to work! I downloaded the manual and went through all the steps but it still doesn't take pics or show them on the screen. Shipping will cost me more than it's worth to send back so I will find a different camera and keep working on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A temporary camera","review":"If you want to spend the money for a great 1-year camera, the Canon PowerShot A70 is the one for you.I agree with all the great reviews of the A70 digital camera. It takes wonderful pictures and is easy to use. I have used the video function numerous times and it works great. When I bought the camera, Consumer Reports recommended this camera.HOWEVER, this camera is apparently designed to \\"fail\\" between 1 and 2 years of use, depending on how often you use it. After exactly 2 years of use (4,217 pictures), my camera also now gives me the black/purple screen that numerous other consumers have complained about. When the camera decides to be operational, the majority of the pictures now come out blurry. This camera has turned from the best camera I have ever used to an unreliable piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everthing is great until you have E18 problem!","review":"Think again and google the internet (canon digital E18 issue) before you buy it. You don¡t want to bet on your luck. Everything is great until you have E18 problem (the lenses jams, google the internet to see how many complains out there!).I had sent my A70 back to the repair facility (in IL) and got it back two days ago, but the problem happened again after about 20 pics taken. Have to send it back to the repair factory again. It's costly when the shipment cost adds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in warranty service","review":"Bought this camera along with the accessory pack for my daughter as a college graduation present in May 2004.It recently dropped out of her purse into a puddle, it was in its case. It worked initially, then stopped working.The company offers nothing to replace or fix this camera other than she can spend 150.00 to get a refurbished one or she can send it in to be repaired which would cost over 200.00.That seems out of line for a camera which cost 219.00 originally and you can get now for 175.00.They didn't even offer to look at it for no fee and give options for repair or credit for purchase of another canon camera.She was very happy with the performance of this camera and is devistated that all is now lost. I will be hesitant to purchase another canon product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera but has the CCD Flaw","review":"I purchased this camera back in 2004 and up until recently it worked flawlessly. That was until the CCD Started acting up and gave me a pink and white screen when I was shooting. I later found out this model and a few others have a well known manufacturing flaw which canon admits to and promises to pay for shippping and repairs. I sent mine back hoping they hold true to their word. The camera was great for the time and would recommend it for a cheap point and shoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over a year owning it....","review":"I bought this earlier in 2003 since my children live in MA and I live in CA and I was tired of disposables and the trouble of the new xray machines. I love it. I wish it was smaller but at the time I purchased it it was the lowest cost for the best resolution. Canon has come out w/a smaller version that I would buy now - but this is a great camera for those looking for a real-size camera that offers FULL manual options for picture taking. The batteries last the life of adding in a larger card to take over 100 pics. The software is very easy to use and now I print specific pictures for my children and myself. Canon keeps coming out w/higher MP at a lower cost so now this model is not the optimum to get. I won't buy a new digital until a 4MPx is $200 and the size of a credit card since, when this one is 'off', fits in any pocket of my clothing. Drop me an email w/any questions - I'm an honest person who shoots straight...m_jessing@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera, Camcorder, Great Price!","review":"OK So the camcorder comment may be a bit overdone...but this really is a great camera. The price, for what you get, is very fair and unless you're taking pictures for publication in National Geographic magazine, it's going to do a great job for you.From still shots of a european vacation to shooting thirty second videos in the manufacturing facilities where I work, this camera does a great job and with a little tweaking it will make great videos in Windows Movie Maker where you can cut custom DVDs. I use it to make training DVDs for machinery and equipment.One thing in particular that needs to be pointed out is that you definitely need to upgrade to at least at 256 MB memory card (around $75), rechargable batteries (around $30 for batts and charger), and a padded case to protect your imvestment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannon A 70","review":"Great camera. Easy for a beginner, just point and shoot. With it's advanced features an advanced user can use it like a full function SLR. Great definition in photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is defective","review":"I bought my camera about 2 years ago. The camera worked beautiful. I started getting error messages about a year ago. I thought it was the memory card so I continued to use the camera. The problem worsened and the camera would get stuck and wouldn't take pictures. I took my memory card to have pictures developed. The memory card was empty. I lost all my pictures. I went to get a new memory card and took a sample picture. I was able to view the picture and then tried to take a second picture. The camera said memory card error. That's when it was confirmed that this camera is defective. If you want a camera to buy, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. Defects need to be handled. Canon need to give people refund on this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3.

I guess I'll have to buy a new camera soon, not a Canon, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"My A70 died 12/25/2006","review":"I bought this camera after several relatives bought it and said great things. I thought the bright light pictures were good, but low light pics always blurred.I had some LCD trouble in November, but was able to turn on/off the camera and get some pictures from it. On Christmas Eve I took pictures without any of the previous trouble. On Christmas Day - trying to take pictures of my kids opening presents - my A70 DIED. No pictures for 2006!The camera was less than 3 years old. I've owned Canon cameras for over 20 years and this is the first time I've gotten a defective product from them. Looks like others are having same trouble.I don't recommend buying the Canon A70 camera. My aunt's camera died also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camera - won't last you a year!","review":"I've had the camera just about a year - and a great camera it was for the first year. Then..... Almost to the day, I started getting the E18 Error message (the lens is stuck and won't move in or out - takes 15 minutes every time I turn it on to be able to use it - then it just stops working completely!) So, I checked for reviews on line and, surprise, surprise - HUNDREDS of people are reporting this problem but Canon doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.So, no. I won't be buying another Canon product. Not if this is what they're like. Stay away from this one or you will regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I chose this camera because it was highly rated and was supposed to be a good value, but it has not lived up to the hype. The resolution is WORSE than my old film camera - a very inexpensive point-and-shoot - and it is very frustrating to use for several reasons: 1) the shutter does not go when you push the button - there is a several second delay - not a big deal with inanimate objects, but very difficult to photgraph people without getting funny expressions, and nearly impossible to photograph the baby without a lot of trial and error; and 2) the flash takes a LONG time to recharge, so after getting a funny expression in your first photo due to the shutter delay, you have to wait and wait and wait to try again - trust me, this gets really, really, really annoying very quickly. I love the flexibility of having a digital camera, but we're going to have to spend more money to get another one that works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am regretting buying this camera. I have a Canon scanner which is not compatible with the software for this camera. SO, I am spending several hours trying to set my computer up so I can use EITHER the scanner OR the camera. BEWARE. I can not use both. I have contacted Canon tech support simply to get to this point-there is no software available to fix this glitch.Also, the zoom control is coming loose after shooting about two dozen pictures. And the viewfinder scratches very easily, even if you are VERY careful.This is my first digital camera and I am quite disappointed. It simply is not doing the things I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust, dust and dust. Poor focus, heavy, so so picture","review":"I returned the camera the next day, even I had to lose the gift card of $50.3 pieces of dust on the top of the lens once I opened the package. And one piece of dust under the lens.fuzzy focus. Picture is just so so. The camera is very heavy with the 4 AA batteries.Japanese camera is not as what I thought before. The 1 M kodak I bought 3 years ago takes sharper picture than this one.I would rather buy Samsung Digimax 4500, digimax 3500, Digimax V3 and digimax V4. They also have full manual control. And they are much lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider this Review before Purchasing New Models","review":"I know this camera is old. However, it is similar to the newer models. Don't buy this camera. I bought it quit after 5 years of use with great care in handling it. The reason I bought it was because it took 4, AA batteries. This seemed like a good feature at first with not having to recharge the battery all the time, but it also made the camera have a delay while taking pictures. The delay was long enough for me to miss many great shots. The batteries just aren't strong enough for a fast flash.My next camera will probably be a Pentax Optio M50. It is great for casual shots like when the family gets together. It is also only around $200 at the time of this review. Canon has good cameras, but this series is not one of them, and I give the A70, 2 stars for working 5 years. And all things considered 2 stars is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 2 years","review":"work okay for a little less than 2 years. it was always slow when you pushed the button but other than that it was fine. then all of sudden all the pics had white lines.

My recommendation - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"We bought our Canon Powershot A70 for a small camera to take on trips, etc. We've already sent it back to the factory twice and although Canon upgraded us to a new camera with more megapixels, this new one is broken, less than 6 months later. Don't waste your money. We will be shopping for a non-Canon product next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has NO Staying Power","review":"I based my purchase decision largely on reviews I read on this site. Just about everone was THRILLED with their new camera - so I purchased.I, too, was thrilled - for about 1 year. Then the camera began producing pictures with black lines through them - or red hues. I thought perhaps I got the camera wet - as I also have the underwater housing and take it scuba diving.I surfed the web looking for a repair store in my area - and found many blogs where COUNTLESS people complained of the exact same issues with their PowerShot A70. I contacted Canon, as given sheer number of people who complained, I concluded there must be a design defect. Canon did not stand by their product at all.My conclusion? The camera was not built to last. A good starter digital camera, to be sure. But you should only expect it to work for about 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Problems","review":"My A70 has quality problems...even after Canon repaired itunder warrantly I continue to have the problems.

Giving the cameras a couple slaps seems to solve the problem at the moment, but it keeps on coming back, and sometimes the slaps don't work.

I wouldn't recomend anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I get a lemon?","review":"I recently got the A70 and immediately like the feel and was impressed with the ease of use and picture quality. However, I am concerned about the construction quality. After taking about 20 or 30 shots, the switch to change between shooting mode and replay mode broke so that I could no longer review pictures that I took (would not switch into review mode). It appears to be still taking pictures, but I'm not sure. Also, the zoom control feels a little loose and the LCD monitor flickers. I'm returning this one and I guess I'll try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens cover failure","review":"The lens cover failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired.

I purchased this one after returning a Sipix 3300 camera. I did a lot of research on digital cameras before making this purchase and I don't regret it for a minute.

I haven't used the software the camera came with yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"E18 Error Message","review":"The camera has worked effectively for 1 year and 7 months.However it has now stopping working, and the message givenon the screen reads E18. Apparently this is common problemthat has to do with lens misalignment or something. Canon'scan fix it for 100 - 200, or replace it with a refurbishedmodel for 150. In any case this seems very frustrating forcamera to only function for about a year and a half.Another issue is that if you purchase the wide angle adapterlens it will not work with the flash. I believe this is a designflaw. The lens is so wide it blocks the flash, and creats acurved dark area on the images.One last issue is that the view screen cover is plastic orsomething and is very easily scratched. I also somehow gotdust or dirt underneath this screen which was under warrantyand was repaired.Otherwise its a pretty decent camera. Not a true pocket sizecamera.

Then the lens retraction mechanism failed and I got the dreaded \\"E18\\" error message. I emailed Canon's support desk and got a speedy and thorough reply. But since the one year warranty had expired, I was told my only options were that I could send in the camera to its service center (average cost of repair: $100 - $200) or I could pay $150 and they'd send me a factory refurbished A70.

The battery meter always showed full, and we used several brands of batteries, including the lithiums, always brand new, with no change in behavior. When the unit would shut down, all the internal memory would be cleared, so you'd have to go back and re-measure everything you hadn't written down.

After reading Elvenbane, I looked forward to the next book for a real long time, but when Elvenblood finally came out, it really disappointed. The book is too bland, not much excitement, action, not much of a plot at all to tell the truth. It just can't move you like the first book did.

I don't believe that the feelings and actions of the characters are accurate reflections of teenagers. Sure, we all get angry, but most of us do not blow up buildings because of it.

I used a screwdriver with what I thought was normal force, not a power drill.They looked like they would have worked ok if they'd not broken during installation, though. I ended up ordering a version of these that has metal-to-metal contact at the installation point instead of plastic-to-metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tie down I have ever seen","review":"I used a set of these tie downs on my old truck. The two main features I really like is the virtually flat mounting when not in use and the fact that the U shaped ring is closed.

When they arrived it was clear that they were stronger than the Highland Bull Ring and had an extra plate to latch into the stake pocket and provide a solid connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and heavy duty","review":"We have been carrying huge loads of limbs and brush since the hurricane and the one pair bull rings that I have has been great! They make it incredibly convenient to anchor the straps. Save a lot of time over trying to tie rope into the stake holes on a fully loaded truck. The best thing about them is that they push down for a low profile sleek look when not in use. Easy to install, although I did have to use a hammer with medium force a couple of times to get one of them to seat well in a 3500 chevy 8ft fleetside.Going to order a couple more pairs today to finish the set. We would have made it to the dump site before closing if we had all 3 pairs the other day. Would have easily saved us the 10 minutes that we needed. The time and gas of going there again the next day would have just about paid for them. It's time to work smarter, not harder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size of rings","review":"These seem ok.

The title track is superb with Ann Wilson. It along with the remakes of Biggest Part Of Me and You're The Only Woman have received a good deal of airplay on the radio. My favorites are Vertical Disbelief (That's Not Me) and Everlasting. This CD also has guest appearances by Steve Perry (Journey), Dewey Bunnell (America), Timothy B. Schmidt (Eagles) and of course his good friend David Benoit. You won't be disappointed with this one. Just don't expect the progressive rock sounds of Ambrosia. That type of music is probably gone forever. Thankfully, David Pack's lively voice is still around to remind us of a time that seems so long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Of Movin' On","review":"Absolutely fantastic album.

Especially Steve Perry fans. He is awesome with David Pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable music","review":"I really enjoy listening to this CD.

ALmost every other recipe called for Lobster! Lots of Shrimp (which is not THAT expensive) recipes too but a few called for Filet Mignon!! I suppose you could substitute them with Chicken/Beef or other seafoods, but I'm curious as to whom this book was intended for? I am assuming the very rich.

I went through the ups and downs with Jackson throughout the story - I was anxious for him, cried, laughed, and cheered him on. I have had a difficult childhood and rooted for him and his sister - I could identify with them and it was so uplifting that it made an impact on my life. I love reading a book and it truly impacting my outlook - my spirit. I would recommend to anyone to read \\"Jackson Rule\\" - it was a great romance with true emotions and the book was written in such a way that I did not put it down until I was finished reading the entire book. 5 stars for sure - I LOVED IT!!!

Song selection is superior and better array of sound. I felt then and still do the song baby im a star is just awful and a total ego driven song on helen part (sometimes a record comp has to say no) Sing in the sunshine is a nice collection of songs and just a little bit a disco here and there-my feeling is there was just not a great stand out song on the record, but still enjoy listening to the cd. Helen reddy was one of my favorite singer when these records were released and she hold up well even after 30 years, and i think that sums up pretty well for her and the listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poorly made movie.","review":"If you want to see a good horror movie, rent one that was released in the theaters.

When you start using JNI it looks complex. After a while you realized is simple. This book help me to understand and use JNI. Now after a year of using it I decided to write this review. This book is the best out there for JNI. Sure it could have more examples and longer explanations. Every paragraph in this book is important. The author is very concise but cover the whole subject. In the back you get a reference to the JNI API. I look at the other books (2) and I am very happy I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of the book?","review":"While I have enjoyed many of Sun's books, this one is simply inadequate. The organization of topics was mediocre, but, in my opinion, the book is a disappointment because of its sheer lack of depth (just 300 pages). What few examples that were provided are typically discussed in two or three sentence paragraphs, often leaving out several key concepts contained in the example. In addition, many more subtle patterns/topics seem to be left as an excerise for the reader. Unfortunately, this probably _is_ the most complete JNI book to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't find it useful","review":"We tried to use this book for our Java/JNI development effort. It seemed like a good resource at first, but fell apart when we tried to write JNI code based on the book's examples. The examples were full of bugs and almost never worked. Time and time again we had to go back to the JNI chapter in Sun's Java tutorial. As limited as the online Sun JNI tutorial was, it was much more useful than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book falls short...","review":"While the book has some good information and examples, it definitely doesn't take the reader through JNI in a clear fashion. Further, Liang shows his obvious bias against native code, and only spends one chapter discussing the procedure for embedding a JVM with C/C++."},{"rating":"1","title":"only covers cursory overview of JNI","review":"Though I liked presentation of the book and how it explained concepts, the book only covers very cursory overview of the JNI and fails to show any complete realistic examples.

It is unfortunate that a picture of the bracket is not available because that would show how they work, but nevertheless, they work and are GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does the job","review":"This product is fine. The railing holders of a number of years ago were far more sturdy.

The only reason why I have to get a new one is because I carried it in my purse and broke the LCD screen.Generally, I really liked this camera. It was quick and easy to use (hence carrying it in my purse) and it took pretty good pictures. I did have some blurry ones, but not too bad. Usually if I was in too much of a hurry.The only drawbacks are that it takes lousy nighttime pictures (everything is dark) and it has a fairly slow shutter, so you have to wait for the camera to focus.It's the first digital camera I owned, so I can't compare it to others at this point. I thought it was good for the money. (I paid about 90.00 from wal-mart)I used rechargeable batteries, and usually didn't have to recharge them for weeks. I would use the camera several times a week. I did use it for an entire week when I first purchased it (for a trip to Vegas) and the rechargeables worked well the entire time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So pleased with my new camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I dropped my camera a few weeks ago and wanted another one just like it.

He wanted an easy to use, good quality digital camera under $50 and this fit the bill. He's had no trouble with it. Taking pictures is easy, and so is transferring them onto his computer. He did spend $8 on a thumbnail flashcard, since the built-in memory is pretty feeble, but that was a modest investment. Now, he can take hundreds of good photos without frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first time","review":"The premise of this sequel was set up very well in \\"First Comes Love.\\" The widower and kidnap victim, both survivors and in need of love. Seems like a great set up but I was very dissappointed with the actual story and character development.First of all what I fell in love with in \\"First Comes Love\\" was the characters interaction with the town AND each other. In this sequel there was more dialogue in the minds of the characters than each other and the town characters. I found that the author could have done a better job in letting Honor's light shine with the town.I did not like the secondary story. It was very contrived and not at all as good as the secondary story in \\"First Comes Love.\\"Although I liked Honor and her need to optimistic at the end of the book she seemed to be very selfish by inviting all those people to Bram's home especially when there was a true risk to her and his safety. It seemed her need to belong outshadowed him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid in Disguise","review":"This is the sort of material that WAS the pile-on Michael Jackson, while pretending to be about analyzing the pile-on. We get the usual garbage written by an amateur armchair psychoanalyst, who never met--much less interviewed--Jackson or any credible source such as his longterm associates, friends, and family. Therefore, the entire thing is a fiction of the worst kind that is now eschewed by a public that wants something very simple, really: a fair, balanced, knowledgeable, and insightful account of the life of the foremost creative genius of American popular culture. Not more sensationalist tripe written for a fast buck while the going was good.It is tragicomic that this lame effort purports to have once been recommended as library material. What a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michaels dream reached","review":"This book covers Michaels early success.Although it was published in the eighties,the reader can get a good idea of the huge success he was if they are not old enough to remember or were not even born in that era. The book shows how hard Michael had to work to prove himself to his father, how he had to overcome racism and the speculations about his sexuality. How the publics opinion about him changed from one of admiration to ridicule was very heart breaking and upsetting to him. He never gave up on his love for his fans and his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful look at Jackson, black pop and celebrity.","review":"Music critic Dave Marsh (of \\"Rap Confidential\\") looks at the life of Michael Jackson up to the end of his disasterous \\"Victory Tour.\\" Between a series of open letters to Jackson, he looks at his history, as well as the history of contemporary black music and the responsibilities a black artist has to his audiences.

I would recommend a read if you are a Jackson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail on the Head","review":"This book was written in 1985, its like this guy had a crystal ball. If Michael Jackson had read this book in 1985 and recognized it for the sage advice and on point assesement of Michael Jackson's life, career and place in American history (and musical history) Michael Jackson could have changed his destiny.This book is well researched and well written. Anyone who has read major books on Michael Jackson and recent articles probably came across some quotes from Dave Marsh's book. Marsh's book is well worth reading for your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential if you loved 2001","review":"I highly reccommend this book to you if you enjoyed the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey (or the movie, for that matter, but read the book version of it before you read this.) It consists of chapters that were originally written for the book, but were not used. Also included are occasional musings by Clarke on the making of the book, and behind-the-scenes glimpses at the making of the movie. He kept a journal during the entire 4-year process of the making of the works, and some of them are excerpted here. It's interesting to see some of the ideas that were thought up, but abandoned. For instance, what became HAL was originally a walking robot; the initial \\"Dawn of Man\\" scenes involved an actual alien, and there are numerous alternate endings (all of them every bit as ornate as the one we're all familar with.) This is sort of the literary equivalent of the movie industry's \\"The Making of Kubrick's 2001\\" (which I also reccommend.) A highly worthy buy for the fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the \\"modified for the movie\\" 2001.","review":"This is the original version of what most people know as \\"2001: A space odyssey\\".

It covers topics like early friendships; the nature of friends; the skill to make friends; the loosing of friends; between boys, between girls and between groups; making friends of different ages etc.A very good definition of friendship and its nature and how it is different and yet connected with love or even wedlock. There are other things parents should look into (e.g. moving houses, changing schools...) if they want their children to be socially or indeed personally successful.This book basically draws our attention to the relavant problems, giving us the basic principles involved without too much analysis or practical advice. The book is easy to read and full of examples. A very informative and engaging book that would take you half a day to finish. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really excellent piece of work","review":"I used this round table discussion as a discussion anchor on the role of neuroscience in our technological future as well as its role in the context of general psychology.

It was a little too scary for me as a parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This book is poorly written. It has no character develpment, no plot, no reason to read this book. I am actually amazed that this book found a publisher. It has been a very long time since I read something that had no redeaming qualities. Reading this book was a waste of my time and my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worthy of its Pulitzer nomination.","review":"Lee Martin's suspense is so carefully planned and his characters so deeply drawn, that we have sympathy for the vulgar Raymond Wright as well as the sweetly charming Mr. Dees, and we read with heart pounding trepidation, hoping that, somehow, no one is guilty.If great novels help us understand the human condition then this must surely be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine line between fiction and reality","review":"This book is dark. It involves the abduction of a nine year old girl from a small Indiana town in the summer of 1971. Unfortunately, this story happens all the time in real life and I wouldnt doubt it was based on one or more true stories. It was totally believable. There are two men in the town with dirty secrets. One has a thing for children. The other is addicted to drugs. They are next door neighbors and use and blackmail each other. The story builds like a jigsaw puzzle, a piece at a time. Each time you think you know what really happened, there's something else. The author examines the guilt of all the characters, raising complex issues of morality. You do find out what really happened, as well. There is \\"closure\\" on that matter, which sadly is often lacking for families that actually go through an experience like this. I think it's definitely worth reading, although some may find the story upsetting. I'd be interested in this author's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable, but dark","review":"I read this book in less than a day because it was suspenseful. I had to find out Mr. Dees role in Katie's disappearance. However, having two children, it was sickening to read so much from the point of view of two disturbed characters. If you are looking for a book you can't put down, then this is a good choice for you. Parents should beware, though, that this is very upsetting and will probably keep you awake at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews here.

Like Stephen King, the author is an excellent writer, but his subject matter leaves me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just going back and forth a bit much","review":"I really wanted to read this novel. But the book kept going back and forth just way to much for my liking. Trying to keep up with this book was just hard for me.It wasn't what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted and poignant","review":"I think that it's a little unfair that this book is being compared to Mystic River. No, this is not an original story, but it is told in an original way by a very talented writer. The story held my interest from beginning to end; I wanted to read more, to find out more about the characters. I felt their pain as if they were sitting next to me telling their part of the story. I was particularly moved by Clare Wright's speech to Gilley at the end of the novel. I felt she had to to something to give voice to the pain she was feeling as well. This book was unnerving at times, but very, very good and I will recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent read","review":"This book was very good and I highly recommend it. It was very insightful and intuitive as well as sensitive and perseptive. The reader gets a chance to step in side the shoes of not one but 4 characters and see the story unwind at a seemingly quick (but sometimes moderate) pace. The start of book is rather repeatative and slow but once the story seems to unfold its hard to put the book down and many avid readers will finish this in one sitting. A very intelligent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever, yes, but not so bright...","review":"The mind boggles that this book was a Pulitzer prize finalist for fiction. It depresses me to think this is the level of writing that's considered possible prize winning fiction in 2011. The descriptions of small town America in the late 60's are good, but that's the only thing that's good in this book. There's no plot development; no character development; the protagonist, Mr. Dees, is a big wussy priss who totally lacks character and is afraid of his own shadow. He's neither likeable nor interesting, traits he shares with all the other characters in this book. I read reviews from people who liked it, but frankly, I don't get it. This is not worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Wow ... was an incredible disappointment. After reading the other reviewers' glowing comments I was excited to begin this 'riveting' novel. Too much dialogue, barely fleshed-out characters (especially Stephen) and not much personal investment in the heroine. There are SO many other vampire-based novels I found more entertaining (Laurell K. Hamilton series, Katie Macalester, and more). This definitely won't hit my \\"keeper\\" shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"This was one mixed up, scrambled, messed up, too many things going on at the same time, book.

Unfortunately, the clothes, for the most part, won't actually fit onto the doll. I found this out too late to return it, I waited too long to open it. Don't make the same mistake. Stick with the Silkstone barbies, the quality is vastly superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vividly told, absolutely candid story","review":"John Mantle ran his own community newspaper, the \\"Fort Mill Times\\". He was at the top of his game, as well as a successful businessman, avid motorcyclist, and pilot. Then he was felled by a catastrophic stoke and in the flash of a second nearly died, but survived paralyzed and unable to speak. He was dependent on his wife for every aspect of life from basic hygiene to exercise. Cyclops Awakes is the story of John's tremendous struggle to come back from such a devastating health crisis, and his search for sanity on the hospital stroke floor. Here also is the story of small-town journalism and the mindset of a conservative South Carolina community that rallied around its opinionated, liberal publisher -- a community that simply refused to let him curl up and die. Cyclops Awakes is a vividly told, absolutely candid story of the human condition and highly recommended for anyone attempting to beat the odds of a major stroke or other quality-of-life injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Tbis is amazing book.

It is very rare that I come across a CD where every song is just as good as the next. This is definitely a must have CD! This man has it all...Great Voice and Great Looks. Glen is a very talented artist and has a bright future, I just can't wait until his next album is released.

The air was heavy with smoke and ash and the really frightening thing about it was that NOTHING seemed to stop the conflagration's exorable march across the state. I picked up \\" A Fool and His Bunny: the Art of Will Bullas\\" because I could not concentrate on anything heavier with all of the bad news coming in over the media.This zany book was the greatest stress-buster of the holiday. Seeing Bullas' \\"punky derm\\" and \\"last call for the bear bar\\" made me realize that we humans take ourselves too seriously. Maybe we couldn't have fireworks or backyard cookouts or even leave the city because most of the roads were closed, but I was safe and comfortable and able to laugh at the absurdities of Bullas' wonderful paintings. I still don't know why the introduction was written by Clint Eastwood, but maybe that, too, is a subtle putdown! The book raised my spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Foold and His Bunny: The Art of Will Bullas","review":"This is one of those special and unique books.

Wav Rally really does not have a good game play and only has one track that is unlocked. It is hard to see where you need to be on the course. Splashdown has several courses that are unlocked and tricks are much easier to pull off. I love the 360 degree invert!

I was hoping it would be as good or better than Splashdown but I was horribly wrong. The first flaw I saw in this game was the control. It is extremely difficult to get your jet-ski to turn in this game. You almost have to come to a complete stop to turn around and get to your target. The next biggest flaw is this games sound. Terrible. The jet-skis sound like old used cars. I own a jet-ski. I know what they are supposed to sound like. The graphics are nice. The water is beautiful but it doesn't look like water. It looks more like jello. But hey, it's pretty jello! I did have trouble with the graphics when there was a lot of action on the screen. It suffered from a bit of a slow down.

There is no doubt that relationships are also key to ministering, as modeled by Christ ministering to the woman at the well.

My first complaint is scholarship : Hybels has simplified \\" Anthropic Principle \\" theory to make the point that God is at the center of creation. He could use any number of ways of making this point without the simplistic and distorted way he has. My second complaint is credentials: when confronted with the gym attendant,who was obviously in need, Hybels had to stop and question whether he should repsond. When his sailing buddy asked for prayer, Hybels gave a sermonette instead. I'd like to read a book from one who responds without questioning, and helps to heal. The whole first chapter could be replaced by two words \\"Mother Teresa\\". But that's a completely different form of evangelism."},{"rating":"2","title":"So What's Your Story?","review":"Great book!

This one allows for the most correction of any splints I've found. It really allows you to bend the toe completely into the correct position. With two adjustable velcro straps this splint has a nice range of adjustment that you control. This is especially good to use after you've abused your feet (worn bad shoes, gone for a run, etc.) I have tried to use it several times at night and it always wakes me up and I take it off. Good to use for waking hours but use a softer splint for nighttime. You cannot walk while wearing this one unless you balance completely on your heel.My foot size is exactly between the two available for purchase- I chose the smaller one but am thinking about buying the larger one. I've noticed this splint does not hold up to regular wear very long.

Overall, I find that they work really well in alleviating foot pain, so long as you use them consistently. I would wear them each night right before going to bed - initially starting with a very loose fit, but over time making the velcro just a little tighter to help correct my foot problem. The problem is that sometimes the brace isn't very comfortable. On me, for some reason I don't feel as uncomfortable with my left foot in the brace as I do with my right - and what would happen is I'd wake up in the morning, and discover that in my sleep I'd kicked off or removed the right brace b/c it was bothering me. Somehow though I guess the left wasn't so annoying, because usually that one was still on. If you can manage to get a comfortable fit with this thing, it works well - but if it isn't comfortable, the truth is you probably won't wear it and/or benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I was very happy with the electric skillet when I first saw it.

It is visibly unlevel (I tried various locations in case it was my countertop), and I have to put a pot holder under one end to make it level.

The light always lasted a long time, far beyond any trip I've used it on. The batteries are not that hard to replace, (nothing to unscrew) Open the compartment at one end and canister slides out. It can be a little tight because the ligth is made to be water-resistant, so if I were to improve anything, I would make easier to slide the caniseter out. Overall, a very good light, and the only one I've found that has 3 colors that can be switched with one button click.

But THIS one comes as close as you could imagine. The transformation takes a bit of learning to get down, but to me it's now second-nature (it actually isn't too far departed from the original Optimus figure's transformation process). AND...the gaggle of accessories accompanying him is insane. A cartoon-accurate rifle. The Matrix. Opening wrist communicators. Megatron in rifle mode (complete with removable parts!).

My biggest gripe about this item is the statement on the box that says \\"Real Movie Sounds\\". That awful base that comes with this toy, which supposedly has lights and sounds from the Animated Motion Picture (1986), does not have actual dialogue from the movie. Peter Cullen's portrayal of the ORIGINAL PRIME is not heard in this base. The only authentic sounds coming from the base are the original 'transforming' sound effects from the G1 shows and the animated movie. Basically, I wouldn't buy this item if it were FREE.

Once you have the toy out, you find that notwithstanding the high-quality materials, it is badly designed. Parts of the toy keep popping out of place, and some of the joints are jammed so that transforming becomes an act of both strength and frustration. All the vaunted battery does is light up a little LED--not very exciting. The moving mouth effect is cute, but besides the nice die-cast metal, that's about the only good thing there is.

Some of his quotations are so bad that you'll laugh out loud. On the other hand, the data that he brings together is fascinating and he makes a good-faith effort at interpretation (unlike some of the 19th century sources that he quotes from). A quite interesting, if deeply flawed investigation into the subject.To sum up the greatest underlying error: the assumption that cultures will always move \\"upward\\" in the complexity of the counting practices and never revert to a system that he considers more primitive. Numerous historical examples are available to counter his assumption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story but-----------------","review":"Wonderful story set in the wilds of an Island off Canada.The characters were wonderfully down to earth.Along with the mystery of why Eva Haines second cousin, Doris Bonhomme dislikes the Lords so much.Little Fanny is an engaging 5 year old who has a very vivid imagination.

After two session on this software she found the activities to be too easy, the only difficultly being mouse speed. She has asked to go back to Pooh.The games are not intuitive and there is a lot of verbal instruction. There are also several logic flaws, such as arranging items for a picture and then the picture taken has nothing to do with the arrangement. In the phonics section, if you select the wrong letter the character actually says, \\"Wow, that was off.

This tutorial has a bunch of popup windows that move all around the screen so you have to keep jumping around to close them, I'd close one and another would immediately open. I couldn't figure out how to stop this tutorial popup frenzy so I had to suffer thru it. The manual has a lot of detail about game concepts, but not enough in the way of game interface and how to perform rudimentary things. I've never launched a game before that I couldn't figure out by experimenting.

Also, I have a mild case of guilt for polluting the earth with the small motor and batteries that eventually have to go into a landfill.

I found it took less than a minute to de-gunk the sprayer by doing a few practice sprays as it took in the hot water.

Yet, it simply won't spray.Since the sprayer won't work, my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed. So, at this point I don't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters, but the sprayer definitely doesn't function as it should.

I applied a good coating to the most nibbled plants and so far no one has snacked. The container comes with a battery powered pump. The batteries are included but I had to replace mine to get it to work. The spray nozzle is slow and doesn't put out a lot of solution so it takes awhile to get it to cover the leaves well.

Here in Colorado this year we've had feast and famine when it comes to rain. We're faring better than the middle of the country certainly and my garden has been pretty productive. But the squirrels and rabbits have wreaked their havoc so I decided to use some of this stuff and it works. I've had to make three applications because of heavy sporadic downpours, but it does deter the little pests and they stay clear. I would recommend it and the powered sprayer (just be sure to do your maintenance so the sprayer doesn't become clogged) really is much simpler to use than pump...pump...pump....I would say buy it to any gardener who asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Know If It Works Because It Doesn't Work","review":"I was excited to try this product out to protect my roses from hungry deer - but I could not get the battery operated sprayer to prime.

I like the battery powered spray handle. It is easier to use than a squeeze spray and delivers a nice fine mist.So far I have not had any deer eat flowers and Hosta. This is especially noteworthy since there is a numerous deer population that is not afraid of humans. They literally stare at you from 25 feet away when I leave my house.There is a lot less odor with this product than with others I have used. I hope to update as the growing season progresses.UPDATE: The Deer must have aquired a taste for this product because they have devoured all Hosta and many flowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept my Garden Safe for 1 Day","review":"I ordered this product in desperation.

I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprayer Worked Well But Limited Repellent Effectivess","review":"The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks, not the claimed three months, and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them. I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard. Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well. I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger.

Save your money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use. Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing. Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds. Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver. Even then, when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry, NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers. I guess anything is better than starving. Ditto with the squirrels. They eat their way through the product to get to the food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I took a chance on this product because it seemed to have pretty good reviews. However, not from me. I sprayed around my fence line and even sprayed it on the grass hoping it would deter the rabbits. The next day I had about 4 of them in the yard again.

It might be that Ohio squirrels are somehow different :) Live animal trap is next on my list of possible solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squirrels love it","review":"I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels. Well first of all, it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds. Then, when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least, the squirrels don't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell. Even my dogs don't seem to be bothered by the smell. In fact, they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs, I can't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but don't waste your money if you have squirrels. This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason it isn't called Rabbit Off","review":"Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program. However, while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels, I guess rabbits didn't read it. The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect. But, judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards, I suspected it wasn't working. My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere, perimeter and main lawn, and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away. Maybe they like eggs, but it doesn't appear to work on rabbits, at least not the ones I have here in San Diego."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deer Around Here","review":"I swear some of the deer around here have a death wish because they love to jump out into the road after they see our van. We live out in the country, so our garden is prone to a lot of animals. We sprayed Havahart's product as directed and the only animals we have seen in the garden since are rabbits. Perhaps with regular use we won't have that problem next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good repellent that wards off little creatures.","review":"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here. I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants. This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries. The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle. No more pumping my old sprayer. The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray. Lightweight is good. Most importantly, it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures. Also, the battery operated sprayer is reusable. I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out, but I think the half gallon will last awhile. This is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Applicator","review":"The spray-on applicator (blue bottle) frequently sticks and often is defective. The product keeps deer away, as advertised, but the applicator is awful. The product often sticks in the bottle and cannot be sprayed, or the trigger breaks. I think they are making the product so thick that the applicator can't handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken bottle","review":"Like another reviewer, the spray nozzle on my bottle broke within five minutes of the first application."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was useless","review":"As it's getting close to cold weather, I tried this out today.It doesn't spray. The pump runs, but no spray. I took it out and tried it with plain water; that doesn't work either.I assume that the tube or the intake ball is clogged somewhere, but I'm not sure it is designed to be taken apart. I tugged at it lightly with no results.Disappointing. I'll pour the product into a manual sprayer, so it's not a total waste.Nope - that didn't work either. It's too viscous for my manual sprayer.So now I want to dump the stuff, but I see that it is an environmental hazard! So I'll have to keep it until the next hazardous waste collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprayer failed...","review":"The bad news: sprayer stopped working after 5 minutes use...The good news: my clothes and hands got enough fluid to repel rabbits and squirrels for several years..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it were better","review":"The repellent works well -- until the first rain.The accompanying sprayer worked for about 6 seconds, then became clogged. As did the pump sprayer I tried, although it did last for a few minutes.It's a shame the repellant can't be made to last longer, and that it can't be made to be more clog-free.Non-the-less, I'll probably order it again, until I can find something better and more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"I got this repellent primarily to keep squirrels away from around our bird feeder. I paid close attention to see if the product was actually working and I did see a s difference. Squirrels were still around but they would not come close to the area I treated with the repellent. The effect lasted for a few days (which is expected) so I am pleased with this repellent.The battery powered sprayer works well and it makes it a lot easier to spray. I do recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urbanized \\"wild\\" critters are accustomed to man","review":"I had high hopes for this product, as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds. This product works as advertised, flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters. Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action. However, the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells After three days or so, the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant. They are persistent pests that won't hide in terror on seeing me. Believe me I am quite scary. I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid and Pet Safe Animal Deterrent","review":"Havahart's Deer Off Repellent is an excellent choice for those looking for a kid and pet-safe deterrent for unwanted deer, rabbits, and squirrels. Deer Off features a battery-powered sprayer, making it simple and easy to use.The product features a dual-action all-natural deterrent, largely made of garlic, that rebels pests with both scent and taste. The 64 oz. bottle will protect up to 1,000 square feet. The manufacturer claims that the repellent will last up to three months with a single application. Both the Organic Materials Review Institute and the USDA have approved the product for organic gardening.While three months haven't gone by, I can say that the product has seemed to have kept the deer away from some of our garden's prized possessions. The battery-powered sprayer is simple to use - there's no need to mix or pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Practical for My Needs","review":"I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while. It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time, and the relatively large expense of the product. I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds. The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals, so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well, other options","review":"I live in PA. Deer have eaten my roses, strawberries, tulip bulbs, hibiscus plants and even my kiwis. I sprayed the product around my remaining wisteria bush and my beleaguered Kennedy rose bush that is on its last leg. So far I don't see any new damage.

This simple device with handy ready-to-use repellent really does work. After using the convenient battery-powered sprayer for a few days, so far no varmints have returned. They probably didn't like the smell and went to another house. We always have a squirrel problem, and I'm waiting to see if squirrels disappear, just like the deers. I don't like to hurt these \\"visitors\\" but we get tired of our lawn being torn up by these unwelcome visitors. I hope the readers using this sprayer get as good of results as we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective; battery-intensive","review":"This product is supposed to repel deer by smell and taste. I'd have to say it doesn't work at all. Deer were eating my marigolds prior to spraying. After spraying on a dry, windless day, the deer continued (they come in early am before dawn) to eat the marigolds. Worse, now they've taken an interest in the buds of my lilies and coneflowers, which they have never eaten before! So I went back to spraying with Bobex, which is expensive, but works.The battery-operated sprayer is another problem. After spraying for ten minutes or so, I could hear the batteries were dying. I maybe used a third of the contents, and the batteries were near dead. I think the idea of adding even more batteries to our landfills is a bad idea, to begin with. Make a high-quality manual spray pump instead, that's my suggestion. And, of course, create a product that actually repels deer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail & Fail & Fail","review":"I was only able to \\"spray\\" with this for a minute or so. Then the spray turned to a stream which dripped off of everything. I changed the batteries thinking that maybe the batteries that came with it were old, but that didn't help at all, so it's a mechanical fail.I'm a person who cares about the environment, and the packaging disturbs me. The holster is plastic and doesn't have a recycle number on it, so that will end up in the landfill. The battery powered sprayer doesn't either, so the outside of that will end up in the landfill. Even though I'll see what I can do about recycling the insides, I'm sure many people won't and that will also end up in the landfill. To save the earth I'd rather buy this in a gallon jug and use my own pressurized tank sprayer than fuss with a battery operated sprayer. Environmental fail.I put this in my own tank sprayer. Even after three applications on my purple coneflowers, the squirrels are still eating the flowerheads.

But when I did get new batteries I was easily able to spray this around the perimeter of my garden. (the garden that already has deer fence and chickenwire yet animals still eat my stuff.) Whatever you do don't get this stuff on you! And don't wipe your face or ANYWHERE if you do....burn stink burn!A few days after spraying, and I still find fresh evidence of critters eating my garden.

Sadly, it did little to discourage the deer from making a meal of my flowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective at all","review":"I live in a semi-rural area on about 2 acres with woods. We have lots of deer. I have never successfully been able to get my day lilies to bloom because they get eaten as soon as they begin to bud. I sprayed this liberally all over my day lilies and surrounding plants when they were full of buds. 4 days later the buds have been eaten - every one. Although it's easy to use and doesn't smell too bad, it simply doesn't repel deer. I would not waste money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR USE ON EDIBLES","review":"It doesn't mention this in the product description (but does on the bottle), but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants. Well, I'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem, and if I can't spray it on things I'm going to eat, it's useless to me. This, despite saying it's safe for use around kids. Had I known this from the description, I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses, and it does keep the deer away (although it stiiiiiinks).If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale, I'll update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on ornamentals, organic but you probably don't want to use on your veggies","review":"We back up to woods so I was not sure if it was deer, ground hogs or rabbits, but our squash plants were getting decimated. After spraying this on the leaves (but not the squash) the damage stopped. Although I consider the ingredients organic, I can't imagine the residue would taste good on your squash.One complaint - common with other reviewers - is that the sprayer gives a weak stream. For my targeted purposes (Squash leaves but not the blossom or squash) it worked out OK, but I could see this being a major pain if you were, for example, spraying down a hydrangea bush or other large plant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well!!","review":"I have tried lots of different types of animal repellents, but to no avail! This one works pretty well! I did notice, however, even in dry weather, that it didn't last quite as long as I would have liked (only about 4-5 days) before I had to reapply.The sprayer takes a little getting used to since it's a powered sprayer, but once you figure out what direction to aim it and how long/hard to squeeze the trigger, it is a breeze and beats the hand cramp you get from normal self-squeeze sprays!Overall, it works a little better than the other products out there, but it still is not the \\"magic potion\\" we've all been hoping for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says so far","review":"So far so good. I had no problems assembling and using the sprayer and I haven't noticed any animal issues since the application. My only concern is that we haven't hit the rainy season yet. I'm not sure how the product will fare through our heavy rainfall but at least the summer foliage has been saved."},{"rating":"2","title":"goodbye critters!","review":"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area, but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels, rabbits, cats, and raccoons. I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused). I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away, but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, I think.","review":"I had something eating my sunflowers that are starting to pop up, so I sprayed this stuff around. I have deer, possum, rabbits, raccoons and even coyotes lurking around the area, so I have no idea which was the culprit. Since I sprayed, my sunflowers have been left alone, but whether or not that was because of the \\"Deer Off\\" stuff or not is hard to tell. But I will give the stuff the benefit of the doubt and say it works and give it a four star rating. However, more testing will be necessary to be sure.The battery powered squinter is pretty cool, but I'd rather just have a squeeze handle if that would save me money."},{"rating":"1","title":"one hundred used for a penny","review":"People are writing great reviews so they can get rid of their copy.

It seems that this is the trend with the majority of the games being released on the GC, they have the potential to be great games, but due to lack in innovation they are bad ports of their N64 counterparts. This game is no exception. To start off on a good note, the graphics on this game are decent. The water looks real, but does not come close to the realism found in games on other consoles. But the gameplay and lack of levels and modes leaves this game in bad shape. The controls are incredibly stiff and the lack of levels, count 'em 6, boggles the mind and leaves you wondering whether the GC is really a next gen console or simply based on technology from the past century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exxcuse Me!","review":"Thank you so much to those of you who really know an astounding game when you see one! This game is very much worth the (price), and will most likely be remembered as one of the top 3 launch games for the Cube. Every last detail is crisp and beautifully done. The controls have a slight learning curve, but everyone who rides jet-skis will agree that the real thing takes some time to get the hang of too. The sound is great and I really appeciate the rumble effects also. All of the pieces of this game come together to create a realistic and captivating game. Now, please disregard those who tell you this is just a cheesy sequel or has terrible handling. (Because they are obviously haven't got the level of comprehension to see a masterpiece.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ON GAMECUBE","review":"This game is probally the 2nd best jet ski series out. It has beautiful graphics, challenging gameplay, and lots of cool tricks. Racing is very fun and freeride is where it's at. I know freeride? Yes, I love games with freeride. It gives you a chance to explore and be free. That is why i love freeride.The games have been coming since Wave Races first appearance on the original game boy, then to nintendo 64, and now with the gamecube. I love this game, but the is a better jet ski series out.It is called SPLASHDOWN. It is for the PS2. SPLASHDOWN RIDES GONE WILD IS THE BEST JET SKI GAME TO DATE.Buy wave race and if you have a PS2 get Splashdown and SPLASHDOWN RIDES GONE WILD. If you are awed by wave race you haed will explode with splashdown.Still Wave Race Blue Storm is a must have if or if not Gamecube is your only system."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth it...","review":"I'm a huge Axis and Allies fan, and I was expecting some great new things to come out of this book. I got it, and I was sorely disappointed. For example, it talks about each country and what they produced such as Germany and subs, America and bombers, etc., and tells you that each country will get free units based on that at the end of each turn. A good idea, but everyone gets almost exactly the same thing! It makes no sense... It goes so far as to include a \\"Reduced Soviet Effectiveness\\" rule making all Russian units -1/-1! Infantry that hits on a 0 attacking? Yeah, that's a good one... Sure, the Soviet units were of a lower quality in the war, but they had masses and masses of them to make up for it, which doesn't happen in this game.This book is frankly just not worth it.

I've replaced the memory card and am still having the problem. Sometimes turning the camera off and on again seems to fix the problem. Also, the shutter speed is incredibly slow.

As another poster mentioned, make sure you track which screws come out of where. There are three different sizes and it gets tricky putting it back.Oh and I just want to say that Canon really sucks.

The only two quibbles are the lack of a battery level indicator and the limited accuracy of the viewfinder.

A little research seems to indicate that the MTBF (mean time between failures) is about 16-18 months on this and several other Canon models. A high percentage of cameras are failing. I see no signs that Canon has any intention of doing the right thing, all they will do is try to charge you more to repair it than the camera is worth.While it works it's a good camera and takes decent pics, but this price for a camera that becomes a useless hunk of metal at 18 months is truly unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pics until it dies","review":"My wife and I received this camera as a Christmas Gift last year.

Contacted Lights of America and they request that I send them the fixture to determine if it can be replaced under warranty. I have these lights installed on a timed switch so it would give me 5 minutes to 30 minutes of light to work around the garage or make my way back to the house. With the limited amount of time this fixture was used, I expect them to last a bit longer. I tried switching the bulb and it just would not come on. I suspect there is a flaw with the photo sensor and I will take it apart to direct wire the bulb instead of sending it back for warranty replacement.

It's an OK piece, but not what it was supposed to be, and obviously not worth anything more than a cheap non-gold model because it is in fact a cheap non-gold model.

I don't know who was worse, Hilary Duff \\"singing\\" Beat of My Heart or Lindsay Lohan \\"singing\\" Confessions of a broken heart\\". I dont think either girl can sing really. Lindsay has one up on Hilary for her acting career. Far more top selling movies than Hilary. But Hilary has better record sales. But my god, the Beat of My Heart performance on the AMA's was HORRIBLE. THe lyrics were the most simple lyrics I have ever heard in my life. It's like she jsut repeated the same thing over and over and over. And what is up with her teeth? Did she go crazy with the Davinci Veneers? Come On??!?!?!? Hoorible, song, horrible performance, but that is all I'm rating. Her album before last, with that Rain song was catchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Hilary is just awful...her voice, her acting...just bad. Yeah, some unknown 7-year old will probably disagree, but hey, she has no talent in singing. She doesn't write. She doesn't play instruments. Hell, does she even sing? This puppet is a fake. Another comment, if you go to her Metamorphosis CD and look under reviews in fall of 2003...her dad wrote a review, I swear it, it was something about the people on Amazon saying she's ugly or something.

The girl already has released 2 albums in 2 years and yes ALREADY A GREATEST HITS! Oh wow! HOW GREAT! I get a whole new album huh? Oh wait, this is just REPACKAGED GARBAGE. A remix?

Yeah Right!","review":"Hate her, her music, her movies, and her dumb Stuff by Duff collection!!!!!!

It is pretty impressive. The only things I have to say are Mr. James Dean is poorly sung and the Why Not remix is basically Why Not, with different words and better sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"I'm 12 years old and a lot of people consider me too old for Hilary Duff, but I just love her songs. I'll admit it, she doesn't have a great voice. But when you listen to her songs, I mean really listen, they all have great messages that are really inspiring. And I know she doesn't write them on her own, but I really can't imagine anyone else singing them. Her voice fits all her songs very well.I do think she shouldn't have done a greatest hits cd already. 2 Cds doesn't really give you much to choose from, and I don't really agree with the songs she picked, but I'm okay with it, all her songs are pretty good. I think it's great for Hilary. At first I was with everyone else saying she only got a record deal because of her acting abilities, but she's really stepped up to the plate and is becoming many little girls favorite actress AND singer. She's joining the ranks with Jennifer Lopez, Raven and Lindsay Lohan in the double performance category.Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Hilary","review":"This is my favorite of all 4 cds!1.

In Our Lips Are Sealed, Haylie Duff even sounded better than her. This was not a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOLESOME....","review":"I must say even though i am not a fan of Hilary Fluff considering I'm 36 yrs of age. But my sixteen year old daughter seems to have no problem with it. I will say this, even though HD can't sing worth a lick I've seen old dogs with no tricks at all could howl better than this. Anyway, I've listened to all of the lyrics on this CD and they are pretty clean and innocent. You can't say that too much about most music today which only glorifies sex, drugs, gangsta this and that and so on. So, even though her vocal range, and vocal strength stinks. It's okay to listen, and dance to her music without cringing everytime some singer, or rapper starts talking about sex,drugs and other graphic overtures. As far as I'm concern... as long as HD does not let the overly sex crazed world, and music industry mold her into some sex porn singer and every word that comes out of her mouth is either a groan or a moan she will always be invited into my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for all parents!","review":"\\"Most Wanted\\" came in really handy when my wife and I were in the middle of potty-training our daughter a couple of years ago. Reading the little CD helped, but it was the pictures of Hillary that captivated my daughter. Although the CD didn't necessarily have that big of an impact on the actual training of my daughter, it made going to the bathroom a little bit easier for my daughter to do since she knew she'd get to look at the CD when she did good on the potty.Recommended for anyone with a child going through or about to go through the ups and downs of potty training. If for no other reason, buy it so that your child can have something to look at while they are learning the wipes...er, ropes of using the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"UMMMM.......No.... WHO WRITES THIS ?","review":"Horrible!!!!! First off. So who writes this? Not Hilary Duff. She's not a musican that can write lyrics. WTF. She shouldn't even be doing music!

Try taking the ugliest girl that can sing and try to sell music i highly doubt that would work. Its all about the image. WTF is up with hilary's sister?! OH crap the same thing is going on with the music industry. The LOOKS. Trying to bring someone with the name thats in the family to fame and stardom. STOP PEOPLE!!!! YOU ARE KILLING ME!!!!

And this is a great collection of the songs plus the new ones and only her fans really get the purpose of a collection album. Thats because shes been sooooooo successful all over the world and has a huuuuuuuge fan base of 7 year olds to 70 year olds. Who else has that and who do we want our kids and teens looking up?? Anyone as awesome as Hil u can think of? Not really. Unless Paris Hilton counts as a role model............This is a really great fun album to dance to and sing to and its a fans perfect collection!! CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW ALBUM NEXT YEAR HIL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy? Oh man its worse than that!","review":"Just more talentless bubblegum pop garbage! the only reason she is succesfull is because all the little kids love and buy anything they see on TV and they just keep following the crowds.I even hear some kids say: \\"are you gonna bye Hillary duffs new CD Most wanted? thats great! I havent heard it yet but im gonna buy it anyways\\" Some people should just take the time to explore other rock / pop singers that are awsome but never get to be in the spotlight all because people like hillary duff, avril lavagine, aly & AJ, ect... keep hogging it.Im not totaly \\"anti\\" Hilary duff but I think she should let the real stars have thier turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, enough blonds already","review":"Well I thought Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson were enough pop blonds for the music world. At least their music was bearable. But Hilary Duff, a one too many blond, I can't stand. Her songs are so boring and bland and lack creativity. The lyrics are pointless. This is all a ploy by Disney to convince their unsuspecting viewers to listen to crappy music. They think that by making one of their actors into a singer will work becuse since people like the actors they will buy the music. Sadly, this has worked. Please, save some money and buy another CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty of Music.","review":"Don't waste your money on this album. And don't be fooled by anyone who says that Hilary Duff makes good, fun bubblegum pop - this noise is bad. I enjoy pop music myself, and this just doesn't cut it. Her whiny, weak voice irritates me like no other. I have no idea how she even got a recording contract. Actually, I have no idea how she even became an actress, because her acting is horrid as well. It seems that Miss Duff also has problems choosing appropriate music, because her adolescent, shaky voice would never work with the rock tracks of which she seems oh-so fond. And what's with making a greatest hits collection after only two albums? There weren't any hits to begin with!\\"So Yesterday\\" doesn't even adequately describe this music. How about \\"So Never?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Jesus Mary and Joseph, Batman!","review":"My Giggly Gosh, this record is so original and creative. Obviously, Hilary Duff put a lot of time into writing all of these songs.

I mean, this just kicks bands like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Mars Volta to the curb!! I'm so glad that Hilary Duff was born-and get this, now she's going punk! And let me tell you guys, she is really turning the punk scene upside down. Goodbye, Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Black Flag, for here comes the most punkiest girl in town! She just embraces the whole punk ideal of rebellion and non-conformism-I mean look at her style of fashion!

You're giving me a \\"not helpful\\" vote because you think I just hate Hilary Duff. Look at the CD itself, people!

The next morning, (Saturday) i went out with a mallet, need i say more. I threw the pieces away, but the next day repented and bought another. My favorite song is \\"Wake Up\\". Sort of.

I think the song Beat of My Heart pretty much sums up her 'talent'. Within the first verse, she's already botched some pitches. Secondly, can the girl please sing more than just 4 notes? She doesnt sing more than 4 or 5 pitches on the whole CD. Her sister actually has a better voice. Listen closely to Our Lips Are Sealed and hear who sings the most (and not to mention, in tune). The only explanation I have for her success is that people find her tunes catchy, and are not buying her record because she's talented. People are still buying into Lizzie Macguire. On a sidenote, has anyone else noticed that her current tour only goes to three cities in the USA?

If there was, we might actually have had REAL music today. Hilary has no talent at all and doesn't deserve anything she has.

Secondly, she doesn't have the voice for something like that or for anything for that matter, whereas other artists can sing anything and have the voice for it and can back it up.

Her voice gets improved with vocal inhancers, which proves that she can't sing.And have you seen in her in magazines lately she's skinnier than me. That's just sick. I don't get what Joel Madden sees in her, she's not that attractive. Well anyway don't buy this CD. Its a waste of money and your ears will bleed and cry for the madness to stop.

Nothing new and just old boring bubble-gum pop. The worst part is that it is A RIPOFF OF POISON'S OPEN UP AND SAY AHH!!!! That is actually a really great CD and one of my favorites from the 80's.

Anyone who says it is good probably only likes popular artists, not good ones. I disagree with the rating of an A+.

Four stars? You people have no taste in music what so ever!!!!! Trash like this is what is killing modern music. \\"Wake Up\\" is by far the worst song I've heard all year and I can't believe that the idiotic music video for that garbage got no.1 on MTV's countdown and what's even more outrageous is that it stayed at the top for several weeks.

I admit, about 3 of the 12 songs, I liked, but, then, it got annoying to see the girl EVERYWHERE! You can't go to Target without seeing Stuff by Hillary Duff, a very ugly and cheap clothing line, that includes ''cosmetics''. Haha. You can't turn on the TV without seeing Lizzie McGuire on Disney, you can't go to the movies without seeing a preview for a dumb movie that will get a thumbs down or you can't go with a date to the movies without getting a chance to see ''the latest it girl's'' movie. or she's on some dumb tv special, singing horribly for 7 year olds at a sad concert. Most Wanted isn't good. I hardly think of it as a flippin' CD. It's a sad, horrible, and sick joke. Enjoy it while it lasts, kiddo.

I have to deal with the pain of my sister obsessed with this god awful poser of an actor and an even worse singer. This is absolutely shockingly bad and painful to go anywhere in the vicinety of were this cd might be playing. It is just so sad how fake singers are and hollywood just wants to through more hot teenage girls in to entertain braindead girls.

Digitised, manufactured trash which is hardly worth of a radio listen, let alone a purchase. What is even more unbelievable is that this talent-deprived 'singer' has only had two albums, if that's what you can call them. yet she is already releasing a greatest hits album, lending a new meaning to the term 'disposable'.A boycott of this album is a cry for quality music, and if you look for it carefully, it does exist out there.

This album is the confirmation of my hypothesis: She's PLASTIC!!! That's the truth because this CD really succks: it only has 3 or 4 new songs and the rest of the album are pure remixes and old songs. That's why she doesn't sell too many album.

Because it's got some of her best songs on it. The three new tracks are all awesome and some of the 2005 remixes are better than the originals. The only shortcomings of this album are that they should have put Someone's Watching Over Me on this instead of Mr. James Dean and if you already own the first two albums, this one is a bit of a waste.But if you're a new Hilary fan, this is what you should listen to first. Go backwards. First this, then 'Hilary Duff' and then 'Metamorphosis'."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is TERRIBLE!!!","review":"What is wrong with you people? Are you insane???

At first when I heard Joel Madden (her boyfriend) from Good Charlotte was going to help write some new songs, I thought omg this is gonna be horrible.

If you aren't a Hilary Duff already once you get this album you will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Wanted Indeed!","review":"Hilary Duff has yet released another album which is surely to sell platnium record sales like her other albums. Some of my favourites include The Beat of my Heart, and Wake Up which was co-written by Joel from Good Charlotte. If any of you guys love pop music, go to your nearest store and get a copy you wont regret it. It features the best songs from her first and second album and new songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really the \\"Most Wanted\\" songs","review":"I own this cd and like it. But I have all of her other cds so really this cd had nothing new except the 3 new songs. Break My Heart and Beat of my Heart are sort of the same. I think she should have done a different title, there too much alike. This is a good cd for first time Hilary listeners, because it has all of her best. But it seems like the \\"best\\" of Hilary wasn't what I thought were the best songs of her.

Very sad. I hope she stops making music after this final release and gets back into acting which she was okay at in the first place.

Her voice sounds like an eight year old. Hilary is a very trashy actress. Lizzie McGuire was a good TV show thats because Hil didn't have to act.How are actors actors if Hilary always plays the same person in every movie she's in. I don't really see how people can worship Hil if she's an average girl who has a decent voice and can't act.

Her second album was 3 stars and this album I give 2 stars.If you do not own this album but you are a Hilary Duff fan then you might want to pick this up because it has the classics like COme Clean remixed.I highly recommend her first album, it was truly flawless, relaxing songs.

I liked the direction she was trying to go on her last album although it was a little much for her young fans resulting in a 50% drop in sales from her first album (which sold 3 million) but she doesn't really have enough credibility to sing that kind of music. Still nice try but since when has it been alright for a 17 year old with marginal singing talent, 2 albums and 6 singles, none which have cracked the Top 30 on Billboard been allowed to release a greatest hits/best of CD???!!!

Hilary Duff has always been a bad actress and a dreadful singer. This is by far the worst album of the year and most certainly one of the worst albums of the decade and probably, along with her other albums, the worst album of the century. Do not waste your money on this crap. I'll be happy once Hilary's career is over. \\"Wake Up\\" is the worst song I've heard all year. It's even worse than \\"Laffy Taffy\\",\\"My Humps\\", and \\"Wait\\"(The whisper song). But is this really a surprise? Hilary Duff has been known to release dreadful songs. \\"Why Not\\" was also a horrible song and I had to sit through and listen to some girl on a cruise ship sing it.

She used to be 1000000% gorgeous and the hottest thing on the earth, now she looks like she's dead, and she has her sister's ugly horse-like face. So, let's review that review. She's become very ugly, she can't sing (As if that's not obvious), her chest look even flatter than it used to, she's made the most annoying song ever, and I have officially lost all respect for her.

Kids aren't getting any smarter, I can see but sometimes you can't even blame Neilsen Soundscan, MTV, and the radio for every few thousand missteps in the industry (for Hilary's fans, Neilsen Soundscan is a company that tracks record sales and other media).

Most of her songs on the CD have a great rhythmn to dance to and nice lyrics. In particular the songs: Wake up, The Beat Of my Heart and Getaway are some of the best songs to dance to or work out while listening to the CD. Although, it would have been nice if they had kept the original version of \\"Come Clean\\" on the CD instead of mixing it. In conclusion, I think based on what I have heard from this CD Hilary Duff has a bright career ahead of her and fans can expect great things from her music in years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has the worst , most digitalized voice i've ever heard","review":"Come Clean sounds like a robot singing not a person.

What is the world coming to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a kid, I just haven't got an account!","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD.1) I haven't bought any of her other stuff and I liked the song Come Clean but it sounds nothing like the original!2) All the songs sound the same.3) On some of the songs she really can't hit the notes and it puts you off listening to the rest of the CD!4) Her sister is on this CD making it seem like she is only cashing in on Hilarys fame!If you like any of Hilary's songs I would reccomend buying the single, don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give up music already","review":"I hope she goes to school and stops doing music forever cause it's not her thing at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Ready to Wake Up Now","review":"I just had this horrible nightmare that my favorite singer Hilary Duff released a \\"greatest hits\\" album with 3 pretty crappy new songs and \\"remixes\\" that are mostly just really bad beats looped over the originals(or worst). Now I'll be the first to admit that Hilary Duff is a great singer(maybe the best) but I can't think of a bigger letdown than seeing this disc for the first(and hopefully last)time.

She sucks. Especially that song Beat Of My Heart which she constantly says the same thing over and over agian. Should just stick to acting you freaking lip syncher since you can't perform with singing with your real voice. Go be with your sucky unhelpful boyfriend because he certainly didn't help Hilary make a good song. Wake Up sucked. Stupid 5 year old songs including 5 year old voice. she needs to hire someone to become her stylists. If she has one fire the one she has and hire someone else! I can even write a better song than the Beat Of My Heart crap. It's called 'Stupid Pop singers Who Ruin Music'.

First off, I don't see why in some stores you have to pay as much as $20 bucks for ONLY 3 new songs, which by the way are NOT the MOST WANTED. The rest of the songs we've either heard before or have been remixed. What's the point of this? You really can't be serious if you actually call this a cd. How the hell can \\"Wake Up\\" or those 2 other songs be Most Wanted if they had not been heard before. It's funny, most people will actually waste their hard-earned money in buying this cd of already heard songs and cheap remixes. They'll never learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Artificial Music...","review":"The new Brittany/Christina/Kylie? Maybe; this dreck is for people who mistake the package for the actual product.

Theres like, no new material, it's just a compilation of Hilary's \\"best\\". Hilary Duff can't sing. This album is evidence of that. I was able to put up with this, because she WAS a good role model for young girls. She didn't dress trashy, she wore natural make-up, she looked & acted her age.Suddenly, now, upon the release of this album, Hilary is no better than Lindsay Lohan. She's got huge veneers now (which she claims she HAD to get beecause her teeth hit a microphone & fell out .... smells a bit fishy to me) which look totally fake. This would be manageable, if the girl didn't lose about 20 pounds. She's turned into the anorexic that she said she'd never become.So, not only is she a bad singer, but she's a hypocrite as well. Why are people still supporting her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hil another CD!! Good!!!!!!:)","review":"I love this cd. The photots are great the autographed 1s.

Her \\"sucking in air\\" almost drove me insane. Her squeakey high voice took 5 years off my life. Huh??? I think my mom is calling me. I can't hear now because her overplayed songs on the radio made me deaf. Save your money and use it on something non-Duff related."},{"rating":"1","title":"A greatest hits album? That's Hilary-ous!!!","review":"I'm sorry, the above was a very bad pun. But seriously, a Greatest Hits Album!!?? She's only put out two and I mean TWO CDs. She hasn't put out any good singles (well, actually, she hasn't even made any good songs, but that's a different story), and she's only been a \\"singer\\" for a few years. This whole album is just a bunch of recycled bubblegum put into one very disgusting disc.I listened to Wake Up and it was absolutely insane!!!! The whole message of the song is this: \\"Everyone knows me and my name and they talk about me and sometimes they even say things that are, like, not true! I just need to get away.\\" Sorry, Hil, but that's what happens when you're famous. The whole song is basically just that and some random words put in like \\"London, Paris, maybe Tokyo\\". Everything else on this album is pretty much, like I said, recycled bubblegum pop. Please don't waste your money on this. Just don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Blame You And Your Children","review":"A Greatest Hits compilation from a teen android with an eating disorder that stepped into a recording studio for the first time two years ago.I would hang myself, but I think I'll stick around to descend into complete self-loathing and watch Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Brittney Spears and Jessica Simpson--which will probably happen next year.Our parents were right all those years ago: that \\"(fertilizer) you're listening to\\" has taken our souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just checking","review":"This is so bad! She's remixed her songs with worse beats and added that dumb and annoying 'Wake up' song, that I can't stop hearing on Disney Channel (Yeah, I watch Disney Channel sometimes, but is that YOUR problem?! No!) and I mute the TV each time it comes on. It's a pathetic waste of a sort of good beat, and she looks SO UGLY in that video. She used to be 1000000% gorgeous and the hottest thing on the earth, now she looks like she's dead, and she has her sister's ugly horse-like face. So, let's review that review. She's become very ugly, she can't sing (As if that's not obvious), her chest look even flatter than it used to, she's made the most annoying song ever, and I have officially lost all respect for her. Yep, that sums this whole thing up.Mike Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Hilary Duff, do us all a favor, and never ever sing again. She has one of the worst voices I have ever heard, even in mainstream music. Her voice is incredibly weak and nasally, and she has no range whatsoever. Despite all the editing done to her voice (and trust me, there's a LOT), she still sounds terrible. Her lyrics are pathetic. The single Wake Up, anyone could have written in their sleep. It's that bad. While some may find this 'catchy' at first, it very quickly becomes annoying.And for all those people who are curious as to who I think are actually good singers? Amy Lee of Evanescence, Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil, Kelly Clarkson, and Mariah Carey are all worthy of a mention, and much less of a sellout than bubblegum pop teen icon Hilary Duff."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% overrated garbage","review":"Hilary is one of the worst and overrated singers ever and this collection of horrible songs should be rightfully called as worst songs instead.

Don't buy this horrible compilation. AVOID. Get something better.

I'll tell you........","review":"I never thought it was possible, but Hilary Duff became a singer. Why is it that people who act always think they can sing? Well, I guess it works out for most of them, but Hilary crossed the line. Her voice may be smooth, but she doesn't have talent compared to other wonderful singers, at all! She keeps making these albums and the only people who buy them are the people who are fans already not because Hil can sing!

They are far from being a masterpiece. How long do you think it took No Doubt to get famous? Took nine years. That's nearly a decade. Hilary's happened overnight(Sorry I took that from another reviewer)No Doubt got a contract because of their musical talent. Hilary got hers because she was on a stupid TV show and the record company want to make as much money as possible. Bottom Line: They didn't care if she could sing or not, they just wanted to make money out of this cow.If you want a band that is worth your time, check out No Doubt.

There are a lot of toy cash register to choose from and yet we decided on this, as my daughter likes the idea that it talks and scan the barcode, besides that - the barcode scanner doesn't scan all of them (which we've found out), the drawer goes 'ca-ching' and that's it folks!

I never saw any barcode stickers but we did find that it would scan real barcodes but they all came up as 4.99 or .99. I liked the microphone and the fact that it kept a running total of the barcodes. I didn't like how they gave more denominations of money than there were slots for in the drawer. I would have lived with all of those things, the reason I returned the register was the drawer would not open. We were able to pull it open a couple of times and that was it. When I went to the store to exchange it I saw 3 that had obviously been returned on the shelf. I opened another box and tried to open it's drawer and it would not open. That is when I decided to return the item instead of exchanging it.

Zillionz must know about this problem because I have seen the other reviews but continues to sell without fixing the problem. I read the reviews before I purchased this but thought the drawer was getting jammed due to kids shoving things in the drawer incorrectly. This is not the case. Great idea but POORLY made.

I saw in the reviews that this has been an ongoing problem with this toy. I bought it thinking the money was causing those drawers to stick but now I see this is just very poorly made. The company should not continue to sell something that clearly doesn't work. Too bad because I love the idea and all the other features.

My qualms about this products are: They provided less money, the box (holding the money) does not open unless you pull it out--after a while it does. My nephew had to pull it out several times for it to work. Kids will enjoy turning the switch from English to Spanish to French. My niece loves to use the speaker and change the language to French. As for the money change, I expected more dollar bills and coins for them to learn to count and pay.

It would probably keep you hooked for a while, and don't think that it's bad since it looks kiddy. It's fun and something you shouldn't pass up. I would have given the game 5 stars, but there are a couple of cons to the game that prevented this. There is a time limit throughout the whole game which would probably frustrate many people, and the game is fairly short compared to other games of our time. You have up to 30 days to finish the game, and each day spans about 20 minutes. That's only ten hours of total gameplay to beat the game (but there is also a challenge mode which is fun to play few more times than once) The game also began to become a bit too hard in the second half, so I just stopped playing. Even so, the game up to that point was fun. So instead of buying the game, rent it or borrow it from a friend. But you really should play the game at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrots and Onions","review":"As Captain Olimar you solve puzzles, destroy massive mushroom/chicken creatures, collect items, and raise thing which you named after carrots, all while listening to a simple devestatingly (in a good way) odd sound track.

The game takes no skill really because you just need to push A a lot in order to attack someone with those little guys. This game is very challenging becuase you are timed 30 days and have to do as much as you can in one day. I really suggest this game to anyone who wants a game thats challenging and long. There might be only 5 levels, but you goto to them over and over again to do different things. The controls of this are really simple and comfortable to handle. The game clearly explains the controls a lot so you don't forget. So once again Pikmin is one of the most innovative game out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent but don't buy","review":"Ok, I bought this game, and I was impressed. The graphics are incredible, the story is original (if juvenile), and it was all around amusing...for a good ten minutes. Pikmin then begins to devolve into something little more than brainless drivel. The concept seems fairly difficult before you play the game, forcing you to control not only the half-inch Capitain Olivar, but an army of quarter-inch centurions. After playing the game, you realize how infantile the gameplay actually is. Great gift for small children, great to rent if you're bored, but don't make the same mistake I did...don't waste fifty dollars on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a good game","review":"DONT get this game its very boreing and slow its inovative but just not goot at all thank god i rented this game its not worth 50 bucks go get luigis mansion Pikmin is not worth renting 2 times"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Nintendo...","review":"When I heard gamecube was going to be oriented towards kids, I didn't think it would be this bad. The game takes elements of strategy games, but totally dumbs them down to make a more child-friendly game. It looks great and is fun for a few hours, but by then you've beaten it. Like the rest of Nintendo's launch games (other than star wars, but thats not a console-selling game), it doesn't offer enough playing time to warrant buying it. Do yourself a favor and just rent it to save yourself the agony..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite cutting it","review":"This game is very disappointing. Here's the storyline: A midget hero trying to fight giant birds and animals and gather ship parts with \\"people\\" even smaller. C'mon!!! The creators could have done a lot better than that, although I can't argue its originality. It starts out pretty fun, but gets old, fast. Unfortuneatly, the game seemed more of a task, than as entertainment, and thus was not very fun. Furthermore, I never was motivated to beat the game, and resent wasting my money. I advise you to keep your money, but if you ever find it on a $5 rack at some garage sale, who knows, you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAME EVER!!!","review":"I cannot wait for the sequel of this game to come out on Oct. 26.

This game is great but I liked He-Man: Savior of the Universe better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tedious, slow game","review":"This is ok for the first few days, but then it gets way to boring. Always having to make more pikmin, while battling creatures, watching out for your existing pikman, and trying to find a stupid part all at the same time. And, you only have 30 days to find 30 parts. I have trouble finding one a day, much less getting it to the ship. If you love the arcade style Nintendo games, youll love this one. Otherwise, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pikmin=Frustrating!","review":"After looking at a whole bunch of customer reviews, Pikmin sounded like a really fun game, so I got it. However, I was VERY mistaken. At first, Pikmin is a fun and addictive game, but after a while I found there to be no appeal in the game. The game has some VERY serious flaws. First, the days are too short, and until you are very experienced, you can hardly do anything in a day. Second, when you are learning to play, you keep forgetting which button does what and how to move the camera. It can be very frustrating when you release all your Pikmin instead of throwing one. I would like to emphasize the poor camera controls. Also, there is no replayability, as beating the game takes out all the appeal- that is, if you can even like the game well enough to finish it. The game isn't fun at all, and is very frustrating. Customers, I urge you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a total waste of money. At least rent the game before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I mean, come on. You can do better than that.","review":"Nintendo did a horrible job on this game. I don't mean that the graphics are bad or anything. I mean the fact that this game is timed! I mean, I am the kind of kid that likes to look around and explore, and you can't do that when every second = an hour and there are only 24 hours! What the heck! I also hate this game because the Pikmin are so incredibly dumb! There is no dynamics to how each part is carried back to the ship. Even if there is a Giant Crabdog blocking their path, they insist on taking the route closest to that, which is hugging right up against the crabdog and resuming course when they have gotten past the Crabdog. AKA waking up the Crabdog, which is deadly to your Pikmin because Giant Crabdogs are both deadly and impossible to kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pikmin has several elements that make it annoying to play","review":"The concept of the game was interesting at first, but it soon became incredibly annoying to play. Camera angles are terrible, you have to watch the same cut scene every night, and the short length of the days are more annoying than they are challenging. The implementation should have been much better than it was. The only good thing about this game is the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pikmin","review":"Pikmin is a stratagey game. Not terribly hard, but repetive. Which makes it boring after a half an hour of gameplay, so much so, that you don't want to play it again. Not because of the difficulty, but because of the repetiveness.In this game your a little space dude that crashed landed on a planet and lost all his rocket parts. He then meets pikmin, and starts his quest to find his rocket parts in 30 days.This game starts off mildly entertaing, but after you find five rocket parts it starts to get plain boring. The same stuff every day, find a rocket part, bring back the rocket part, enemy gets in your way, pikmin get eaten and you destroy your enemy. Not to mention that there is a time limit of about 12 minutes per day, which puts makes you rush, not enjoy the game.So, as you can see, this is definetly not one of Nintendo's good games. If you still want this game, do yourself a favor and rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rocks","review":"I just got Pikmin today and played it for an hour. This game is unbelieveable, a freeform game just got me all excited.

I recomend this game to any one who likes freeform."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN FUN FUN","review":"There is just one word to sum this game up FUN!!!!!!!!The graphics are awesome and they look so real.They are cute and very interesting.When I first seen the ad for PIKMIN I asked my mom to take me to the local video game store and to buy it for me.Just to sum it up this game is super.The second should be great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still chuckling","review":"Shigeru Miyamoto continues to solidify his status as the Beethoven of video games. Pikmin is pure genius. I only have two complaints with my pikmin experience. 1. It was over too soon and 2. Now I have to go back to playing lesser games until Mario Sunshine comes out.What sets Pikmin apart from so many other games is little touches like Pikmins digging up nectar under the grass and getting so drunk off it they want even look at you. There is also a huge array of other little critters that will manage to frustrate and challenge even good gamers.I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a break from the typical shootemups that are so popular right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pikmin","review":"Pikmin is fun. The story is kind of, uh, pointless, but it's fun. The only down side is the entire third level. It's so big that it takes 2 minutes to get from point A to point B.Then you have to come all the way back to point A because you brought the wrong color Pikmin or not enough. That level is dark too which makes it harder. Overall, It's a great game, though. If you like a challenge, this is definitely your game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great game for strategy lovers!","review":"When I first played this game I couldnt keep my jaw from dropping. Pikmin puts a mix of simple controls with amazing graphics and astonishing gameplay. It is also very educational with strategy and not one of those \\"slash and gore\\" games.

WHEN I BEAT THE GAME I DIDN'T WANT IT TO STOP THEN I SAW THE CHALENGE MODE IT SO MUCH FUN TRYING TO RAISE SO MANY PIKMIN IN ONE DAY AND THERES SO MANY LEVELS I THINK PIKMIN IS THE #2ND BEST GAME FOR GCN. SO U SHOULD GET IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"Why everyone thinks this game is so much fun, I can't understand. Thats just the thing; the game isn't very fun. There is nothing very entertaining about walking around, finding ship parts, and bringing them back. A game needs challenges, which Pikmin doesn't have. Sure, there are monsters to kill, but all you do is lead your Pikmin to them and hope they come out on top. And the monsters are too silly-looking to be taken seriously. It can be fun to an extent, though. Commanding vast hoards of Pikmin do give you a certain type of pleasure. They do your bidding, and you relax. For example, you have one set carry back a ship part, another set carry a flower, have another set work on knocking down a wall, while you and another set scout ahead.But the game just isn't entertaining or engaging. I was never eager to go back for more, whereas in other games I can't stay away. I'm glad I just rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Tough......","review":"For the gamer that loves a challenge, this is for you!!!I am an adventure type game lover and like most any game with a good plot (purrty graphics don't amuse me much) but Pikmin didn't catch my eye. The only reason I rented it was because everyone I know said it looked awesome. I decided to try it myself. The first part of it was alright. Getting the first part of your broken-down ship. Once you get into the next level, it just went downhill.We have the time problem wich goes way to fast. Since you have 30 days to reassemble your \\"Dolphin\\" (the spacecraft's name) and there are 30 parts of your ship missing. It takes me 2 days to actually find 1 piece for me.Then there are the enemies. Say there are 5 Pikmin in the front of the bad guy. One swipe or chomp...BAM!!! You have 5 less Pikmin. If they had life, it would be a little more interesting.This is my opinion. Other people may like it.

You dont even have enough time to do anything in the short days.. Awful Game Dont Buy Or RENT IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!","review":"... I rented this game because of other reviews but the graphics aren't that great. The graphics are like Super Mario 64. The buttons are so darn confusing. Once I tried to seperate my pikmin in colours and they all ran away. The Game is to short it's a game that most people would beat in one day. The story line is Your rocket gets hit by an asteroid and you land on a weird planet. Your oxygen supplie will only last you 30 pikmin days. You lost thirty parts of your ship that spread out all over the pikmin world. One pikmin day is like 15 minutes so that means you only get 450 minutes of gameplay! One other thing If you use all 30 days and you've only found 29 or less parts you die and have to start a new game. You don't even fight you don't controll the pikmin. You just stand there while they kill the bad guy ( boring ). If you don't believe me still don't buy the game just rent it you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable!","review":"This is such a cute game. My little nephew got a game cube for his birthday along with this game. He brought it over here and I immediately became addict. Olimir's space craft falls onto a unique planet where there are a lot of different creatures. he immediately finds a mushroom with a breed of red looking creatures he calls Pikmin. As you travel throughout different levels you come to know of yellow and blue Pikimin. Red are fireproof, yellow throws bombs, and blue can go in the water. These magnificent creatures can knock down walls, cute down flowers, defeat enemies, build bridges, and carry ship parts. It's definitely a game for little kids but just as addicting to the older ones too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't Pokemon, get it straight!","review":"Alright, first of all, this isn't Pokemon. It's not related at all. It is a totally original and fun game. It's like a strategy game, only with a Nintendo twist.

I was wrong. The first thing wrong was the time limit. Each day was only fifteen minutes. The second thing wrong was that if you went into water, all of the pikmin drowned. The overall gameplay was boring. It seemed like you spent so much time fighting the big bosses and then trying to rebuild to the number of pikmin you had so you could fight again.

At first I thought this game was a waste of everyone's time, but i was wrong. I was fooled by the way the pikmin and the little space man was drawn. But now i know that i was completely wrong. This game is great! It is definitely going to be the first in my library. I know what you are saying, \\"he hasn't even played it and he's writing a review!\\". You don't have to play this to know it is great, just from watching the demo's and the commercials you know it will be a hit. From what i have heard, the control is easy and it is a very fun game, so if it looks great and is easy to control, plus fun, then you should definitely consider buying this. This is a great one for kids that will excercise their minds (some adults could use it too, way more than any kid I know). So if you are looking for a game to go with that new gamecube, get Pikmin, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is awesome","review":"OMG this is a game 2 beat all games except super smash bro. meele ok it has everything a game from nintendo needs!the story line is great. plus the pikmin r soooo cute! i always debate which pikmin is the cutest.see it is about captain olimer who gets hit by a....... u have 2 find this out. a friend told me a secret that there is purple pikmin and try 2 find the cheat website. the sound andgraphics r awesome. iam the biggest gamer in the world and pikmin was the best new game out. yes i know that it is hard at times but its awesome at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun AND Addictive","review":"I own Pikmin and I just can't stop playing it.

Any one who thinks they are to mature for this game, aren't mature enough to play it. Don't under estimate this titlt by its looks because just about anyone can get into it.

He *loves* the wooden spoon, whisk and rubber spatula. We decided not to give him the metal spatula, though, because its front edge is pretty sharp. We also haven't given him the metal \\"crock\\" that the utensils are supposed to go in. The top edge of it is also quite sharp, and as you can see from the picture I uploaded, it's so small and tippy that he couldn't possibly get the utensils to stay upright in it. I'm thinking we might get a larger pencil cup (or even a soup can!) and stick it to his kitchen with double-stick tape for him to keep his spoons and spatulas in.The age recommendation on the box is 5+, but I think the wooden spoon, whisk and rubber spatula are fine for toddlers.

They can also actually be used for real food preparation, if you wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"We ordered this utensil set for our 3 year old to go with her play kitchen.

It is a must for any Titanic History buff. Great Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The big surprise in this book, unfortunately, is that it is not well written. I have not read any of the author's other work, but given her credentials, I assumed that she is an accomplished writer. Halfway Heaven gives the impression that it was a rush-job, with the author trying to get it into the stores as quickly as possible while the memory of this terrible event was still fresh in the public's mind. Sure, she went to Ethiopia and did some other research, but the various threads of the story are not well integrated; it seems like more of a verbal scrapbook surrounding the main event. I also agree with the other reviews that describe it as exploitative and voyeuristic, but enough has already been written about all that. Skip this one. I gave it 2 stars only because it is compelling in a few places."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought it is very sensational","review":"which is ok if that is what you are looking for.

I would add that to my mind, you have to be very careful that you are not exploiting people or trying to profit from tragedy when you write about crime. The only reason to do it is to honestly shed insight into the larger meaning of a tragedy. Thernstrom failed to achieve this synthesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but frighteningly accurate","review":"I attended Harvard, and was in the class of '96. I did not know Sinedu or Trang, so I cannot speak for the accuracy (or lack) in Ms Thernstrom's depiction of them. However, she is dead-on in her description of Harvard's attitude towards mental health problems and treatment. I disagree with the comments implying she had an axe to grind with Harvard; she states in the book that her own experience had been much more positive, and she said very few things I considered to be unfair or vindictive. I didn't agree with everything she says in the book, and I agree that she includes some details which are extraneous, but on the whole I was extremely surprised at the book's quality. I read it only recently, and very reluctantly, expecting it to be as exploitative as most other \\"true crime\\" books, but it is not. I will recommend this book to others, not least because of the accuracy of her description of Harvard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - VERY POOR picture quality","review":"The first two seasons on DVD had great picture quality and looked crisp and clean.Unfortunately this third season of MacGyver on DVD has abysmal picture quality.

Many of the exercise instructions are difficult to follow, are accompanied by poor quality screen captures, and are inaccurate and poorly written.

The hero does not swoop in and save the day because she can't cope; he just brings love and romance. And helps her solve a mystery that arrives with him! Wonderful.

Desire is a thoroughly enjoyable book to sit down and lose yourself in for a few hours. Unlike many of Amanda's books, this is set in a much earlier era and placed well outside her usual haunts of London. The characters are memorable, funny and witty. Our Hero draws you to him but I'm afriad I can't say the same for the leading Lady. I admire her courage, but on the odd accasion she seems overly bold and quite demanding.Her treatment of Sir Gareth put me off and for a woman so learned and apparently kindly, I fail to see why she should attack his appearance every second page.

There is no real ending, and the game ends once you figure out that the game is getting boring. Rent only. Unless your of the hardcore type and must own EVERYTHING that is Mario!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi's Mansion. It's so fun it's scary","review":"This game looks like the best title at release for Gamecube. It is the sequel to Mario Is Missing, but it is alot better. You play as Mario's taller brother, Luigi. Luigi must search a haunted mansion to find his missing brother, who is none other than Mario. (gee, who saw tht coming). You have to capture the ghosts that inhabit the mansion with a vacume cleaner like tool. You have a Game Boy Color that acts as a special camera to help find ghosts. If your looking for a game to start your Gamecube collection with, look no farther than Luigi's Mansion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but short","review":"Luigi's Mansion is a good game, it's fun and stuff. But, it just seems too short. Fun, but short. It's a good concept, too, playing as Luigi in a haunted mansion trying to find Mario. A nice change, playing as Luigi. Just wish it were longer with more to do. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi is a star!","review":"This was a great game. At first, I had a little trouble controlling the little vacuum thing, but eventually I got used to it. It's really fun to play. Nintendo did such a great job on this. They stepped away from Mario for a brief moment, and let Luigi get the spotlight, which is great because I was getting sick of Mario anyways. The graphics are truely amazing. I love how the house is all dusty. It really brings out the old, haunted mansion feeling. They also had a bunch of added features, like how Luigi whistles. It's not the only music in the game, but the other music is just creepy. This game is a must have if you love the Mario series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi's Mansion, Ups and Downs","review":"What I like about Luigi's Mansion is when you first play it, you have just about no idea what you're doing, but after you beat the first boss, you'll get to know the drill. I like how you can shoot fire, water, and ice from the Poltergust 3000 and use them for special purposes. Also, King Boo is plain sick. With the blue tongue, pink eyes and scary noises, he makes the perfect bad guy. It's really fun when you first play it, especially for me when facing King Boo. I also like the suprises...The biggest downside of this game is once you truly beat it, it's pretty boring. I beat it, and never even played or watched the game since, unless I was helping my friend on one of his files. Also, the game's pretty hard to beat without the guide."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},M={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-e69b2c78"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/67.md","filePath":"sponsor/67.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/67.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
