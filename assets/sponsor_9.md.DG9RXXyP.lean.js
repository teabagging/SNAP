I've also used them on my mp3 player and GPS; worked like a charm! The rubber grips make the screwdrivers very comfortable and nearly impossible to slip out of your fingers. They also hold a nice magnetic charge IF you have a rare Earth magnet handy. The bits are very narrow and a decent length (about an inch) which helps me get into places some of my fat boy screwdrivers can't get to. The sliding case is also very nice and durable. I feel like a dork for saying this, but even after all these months of using this set, it's still cool to open the case every time.

Two of these drivers worked well to extract the miniature screws from a broken Samsung Exhibit II smartphone. The smallest flatblade also fit the screws in my sunglasses.These tools are reasonably comfortable to work with (though the handles could be longer). The tip of the smallest flathead either deformed during my first set of usage or came that way-- still functional but clearly (if slightly) damaged. Based on reviews of competing products, miniature/jewelers screwdrivers aren't made of the hardened metal used in larger drivers.The color is nice, and Stanley generally makes good products. For the price, can't complain. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"This is my second set, no complaints, does everything it should do.

For the price you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"The precision set I've had for almost forty years is missing most of the pieces. This set was a bargain, seems well made, and as another reviewer remarked, the case is outstanding. I used it a few days ago to replace batteries in an external sensor for a remote thermometer. The yellow color is another plus for me, as I tend to lose small items in a large tool box.

Perhaps in other circumstances these will work out fine, but for my purposes they failed horribly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought along with.....","review":"I bought this set along with the Stanley 66-039 set.

First, these are comfortable to hold as the shafts have some girth to the. This provides for a superior ability to hold them and twist between your fingers with good control. I also like the yellow color - these will be hard to misplace and not find. Made in China, of course, but Stanley has done a good job of designing these screwdrivers.The case is well thought-out and instead of a flimsy, fragile, clear plastic cover Stanley chose to provide a very simple \\"flap\\" lid.I doubt you will pass these down to your grandchildren but for the price these are a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good deal for the price","review":"I ordered this to remove my hard drives from old laptops. It came exactly as pictured and worked great. The case is also nice because it keeps everything together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked","review":"What can I say, this is a screwdriver set. The handles are easy to get a good grip on for tight screws. The metal is of good quality not wanting to strip out. What gets me...they're not magnetic?

If you're working with watches or glasses, this set might be too large."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice drivers, not so good package.","review":"I like this little Stanley 6-piece precision screwdriver set.

The one star is simply because the sets I purchased are worthless for what I needed them for due to the wrong picture online.This set of screwdrivers does not come in the very resilient slide case shown in the picture. You will recieve a set of those screwdrivers in an open face box with just a little strap across the center of screwdrivers. While the cheap-o box that is now shipping is fine if you are throwing these on a shelf at home, I recently lost a set of the pictured screwdrivers which were perfect for carrying in my laptop bag. The big difference is the new packaging will allow cords and other items to come into contact with the sharp screwdriver blades... which is a bad thing.Ordering online is all about the visuals presented and in this case the product pictured does NOT match the product shipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad deal!","review":"How can you go wrong for $4 :-P But the case is a little tricky and I have to see how things go... so only gets a 4 so far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the job","review":"I bought this toolkit to enable me to upgrade the RAM in my laptop. The toolks work splendidly. They look cheap but I don't think that matters: they function well enough to get the job done.The container has little pop-in slots to hold the screwdrivers. You feel a satisfying 'click' when you push the screwdriver back into its designated location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for laptops","review":"Yeah, this doesn't really work well with little laptop screws (#00 or #0) screws if that is what you are looking for. It didn't work for me, but given the price, it is a neat toolkit. I bought this for the sole purpose of removing the HDD / RAM and upgrade to SSD and higher memory in my Dell Inspiron. Using the star #0 and #1 on this set made my problem worse. I ended up with stripped screws and having to invest in something more powerful to work with small screws that need heavy torque. This is probably useless to me now since it didn't work well, but given the price, the product seems to be okay for the $6 I paid for it. I would go for slightly expensive precision tools for laptop screws rather than this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"great litle box","review":"it's pretty good, if it had other types I would give it a five star but is a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't fix eyeglasses","review":"The blades are all too thick to fit the screws on my eyeglasses, which was the only thing I bought the set for.I got the same set that adam284 uploaded the photo of, which is fine, just different than they picture.

I don't know why I continue to cart them around with me from move to move. The first time I used each of them on a tightly set screw, the ends twisted, which made them pretty much unusable.This new set of screwdrivers that seems to be much harder metal/steel. The design of the handle is great. You can rest the palm of your hand on the wide black end of the handle, and the yellow part turns independent of the end of the end of the handle. So you can twist the screwdriver with your fingers while resting your palm on the end of the handle. Nice. I've just tossed out the old ones and put the Stanley set in the tool drawer.Other reviewers have already commented that this set does not have a clear plastic cover... it is just the yellow tray with a little yellow strap that folds across the screwdrivers and clips on the side of the tray to hold them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"eyeglasses screwdrivers","review":"Found as eyeglass screwdriver, it was a nice little set but none fit my eyeglasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I didn't realize that these are really very small, short, and delicate screwdriveers. Under the product dimensions, I read that they were 12 inches so I was thinking they would be, well, longer than they are, which in reality is probably more like 5 inches with the actual metal part maybe only a little over an inch. I guess I should have realized that when they said 12 inches, maybe they were talking about the size of the packaging.... They are very lightweight and not really meant for any kind of serious screwdriving. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"As a violist who has had trouble in the past finding a great shoulder rest, I was so thrilled when I tired the Mach One. The Mach One is very comfortable and stays on well.

He shows you-- the writer-- how to integrate other people's texts into your work. He takes great care to explain what is needed, when it is needed, and every option imaginable as far as slants and takes on what to do. I recommend this book to anyone who is writing research, critiques, or even to anyone who grades student papers. It has given me insight far beyond what I had thought I needed, and because of that I have learned a great deal. It's an easy read; it is brief, to the point, organized, and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing terms, doesn't offer much new advice","review":"I had to purchase this book for a required writing course at my university.

Well now I realize that I was INSANE to purchase this instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This book was a waste of my money! You need to know the actions and mechanisms of drugs, side effects, half-lfe, etc., and this book has none of that. What it does have is cutesy little songs and poems to memorize, so hopefully you'll be able to pass the NCLEX. Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; not entirely dependable","review":"I bought this book, so I'm using it, but finding its helpfulness to be uneven. Some of the info seems to be either slightly outdated or at least has large gaps. For example, I've just used it to review Type II diabetes meds we were given in lecture, and it doesn't have any info at all about 2 of the 5 categories of NIDDM drugs I'm supposed to be familiar with. It also has an awful lot of typos, which disappoints me that it seems nobody proofread it with much care.On the positive side, I do think the little drawings and mnemonics will help me remember the info I find helpful. So it isn't worthless, but I hope to eventually find a better pharm review book."},{"rating":"2","title":"its like meds for dummies","review":"I really love this book.

I don't care for the flimsy plastic clamp base found on all swing arm lamps today. Only one caution: The metal lamp shade gets hot from that 100 watt bulb. Be careful when moving your lamp while it is on. I highly recommend this lamp to the perfectionist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite Disappointment","review":"The book, despite the inconsistencies that have been pointed out by other reviewers, moves along with an interesting and well-paced plotline. Well....for two-thirds of the book, that is. Sadly, Goblin Market was much too similar to the Bazaar from Robert Asprin's Myth series. The pathetic nod to Fritz Leiber's Fafrhd and the Gray Mouser was enough to make one retch at first read. And then the storyline devolves and becomes something right out of the X-Files with a good splash of Tolkien and Chinese myth tossed in for fun. Mercedes Lackey is well known for her character depth -- not in this one. A very bad writing indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the last one","review":"This book was much better than Beyond World's End. The story line made sense, as compared to random people jumping in and out of the last story. This story line did have a lot of different threads running through it, and it was sometimes hard to remember what had happened to those people earlier, although that problem got better toward the end. I do recommend that you read Beyond World's End first, even though it isn't as good. You won't understand some of the things in this book if you haven't the other. If you've read the Diana Tregarde and the SERRAted Edge books, they'll help you, but they aren't totally neccessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mamoth read but well worth it !","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even though the size of it in hardcover was rather intimidating. From the first pages I was thoroughly entranced, and I was thrilled when some of the characters from the SERRAted edge came into the novel. I really enjoyed the fast paced action, and the humour that was subtly threaded through the work. I would recommend that you read Beyond Worlds End before you try and read this novel, it would also help to read the Tannim books in the SERRAted edge and the two Bedlam Bard books.A great read over the weekend, all I can say is that I can't wait for another book in the series (come on - there has to be another one with an ending like this!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't imagine Shanghai without it . . .","review":"After a three-week visit to China and Taiwan, I am happy to say that the Time Out guide to Shanghai was by far the best single-city guide I used. It's replete with valuable information about attractions, hotels, restaurants, shops, spas, etc. and also contains a useful historical overview. Beyond this, however, the layout is terrific, and the book is remarkably easy to use as a result (certainly much better than the Rough Guide and Lonely Planet in this regard). The maps, in particular, are helpful. My only complaint: it would have been nice to have more place names in Chinese, but there are four pages in the very back that list major sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Mini Utility Saw.","review":"Stanley Mini Utility Saw.

The villains earned my scorn and the story unfolded well with plenty of cliff-hangers and foiled plans that added well to the suspense.I had to slow down a couple times when I didn't pick up early that Black Michael, the duke, and the King's brother are all the same person, but that was more due to my reading it quickly than to the author's style.The message of honor and true love rings true when contrasted with believable descriptions of scoundrels and rakes in it for themselves. There were also very good swordfights, both with steel and wit. Entertaining all the way to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written escape novel","review":"Being in my mid-fifties, I initially thought this book would be too silly for me.

This is a simple coping saw that will perform its job with no fuss. There is no wizbang feature that nobody needs. Just a wide frame that holds a thin coping saw blade. The new Stanley saw has a soft molded handled which makes it a pleasant to use compare to the older wooden handle in the picture. This really help especially when I work in the cold garage in the early morning hours. I use this to trim dovetail joinery and other woodworking tasks.One tip for the newbie, you need to buy a bunch of coping saw blades. The blades are designed to make delicate cuts and are therefore very thin. They break very easily.

Trent is an interrogator who is good - too good - at what he does. Jason is a slightly less than typical 12 year old who is asked to \\"help\\" him with a murder investigation. What happened when these two came together made me want to scream!!I don't think this book is realistic. Yes, I realize it is fiction but, it is suppose to be realistic fiction. As far as I'm concerned it could be fantacy. I read many young adult books so that I can keep up with good literature to recommend to my students. I would not consider this good literature - fair maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"This is one of those books for teen-agers that will probably disturb adults much more. It clearly portrays the ways in which children can be intimidated by adults, something that Jason (the main character) seems to take for granted. He is taken in for questioning as the prime suspect for the murder of a seven year old girl, and most of the book consists of a dialogue between himself and the detective, Trent. Trent's ambition is to always get a confession, and Cormier does an excellent job in describing the detective's warped feelings and personality. The narration jumps between both Trent and Jason, and I was throughly exhaused and chilled by the time it was over. I found the ending plausible and very disturbing. This was a book that serves as a good reminder of how emotionally dependant children can be and how careful adults should be when speaking to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"An amazing novel by Robert Cormier is titled The Rag and Bone Shop. It is jam packed with adventure and amazement. Here's how the story goes. A 7-year old girl is brutally murdered and there have only one suspect, a 12-year old boy named Jason. They take Jason to a professional interrogator. The interrogator knows Jason is innocent after a grueling and painful session. But is he innocent the interrogator questions.

Robert Cormer sticks to the story and doesn't wander off. The mood of The Rag and the Bone Shop stays mostly sad and scared.The book has exciting parts, sad parts, and gross parts, and is better than I expected. I couldn't put it down when I started. Some parts took my breath away with excitement and grossness.

The interrogator was convinced that the boy was innocent. But his pride and desire for promotion prevented him from stopping his persistent interrogation.

Trent is the interrogator hired to interrogate Jason and make him confess murdering Alicia. I read this book in one day for the same reason I decided to read the book: to see the outcome. It wasn't the most exciting book to read and I found myself confused during Trent and Jason's conversations, but overall it was okay. When I got to the ending, I have to say I hated it. I absolutely hated it. I won't say any more, but this book is not one I would read again. However, I do think it is a worthwhile read for people over 13 due to most of the context within the book.

I felt like the author had no doubt in her mind that ANYTHING in life was impossible, and since she was so confident, I had no choice but to believe her. The cover drew me in right away.\\"What is 'Lowilo'?\\" I thought, and what was it about the simple, somewhat blurry cover that allured me so much. The book itself, the words are very down to earth, witty, and matter-of-fact...but then there is also a very mystical feeling that surrounds it as well.

I decided to try them at the gym while working out on the elliptical machine. Again very disappointed... They would not stay put.

So, if you are looking for comfort with just regular stereo sound...then go for it. They are very comfortable and a reasonable price for just that feature.

When looking through Amazon for a solution to my problem, I found these marshmallow buds and decided to give it a chance. I love how you can squish them down and fit them in your ear just like ear plugs! They're actually extremely comfortable! They also are really good for shutting out other noises. When my brother was talking to me, I couldn't hear a thing he said with these on! They're sleek and have pretty good sound. These ear buds are pretty fashionable too. Such a cute shiny pink!

It is just as fun to watch as an adult - although there are many snickers that were probably deep moments for my pre-teen self.

This, in my opinion, is her finest. In the Twelfth Transforming she brings to life the remarkable political events of the last years of the reign of Amenhotep III through to the end of the dynasty. The period is particularly interesting because we have so much information and yet, the actual facts are shrouded in mystery. Relying heavily on the interpretation of Christianne Desroches-Noblecourt, Gedge has produced a logical and believable tale set in a period that fascinates Egyptologists, particularly since the discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamon.

I put the blame on the characters inhabiting the novel. Not one was worth worrying over, and if you don't care about a character, you don't care what's happening to the character.

I have studied Korean culture, history, politics, and business in Korea, and this book has helped me connect the dots as well as see cultural trends today, and understand where people have been. There are great examples to help you understand important aspects of the Korean people. Another thing I find amazing, is that the author expresses both bad things (even repulsive) and good things about Korea and is able to express emotional anecdotes in a way that illustrates real situations in Korea.

Even though he has lived in Korea for some time, his views and observations are not colored in any way. If anything, Breen provides readers with an up close and personal look at Korea, its people, culture, and politics that is just as much informative and insightful as it is entertaining. If you are going to spend anytime in Korea or if you are just curious about this Land of the Morning Calm, this is one book that should be at the top of your Korean reading list.Jeffrey Miller author ofWar Remains"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is hardly academic","review":"I was very excited to pick it up, and the abstract made it souind extremely promising. But reading through it, I thought there was a great amount of western chauvinism, and evey hypocrisy, when--as a reader knowledgable of British Industrial history--taking into account that there are far greater foibles in the economic history of England.As an PHD student in socio-anthropology, I am apalled that the author poses to publish this book as some sort of scholarly piece to explain the nature of a people.He is a dillitante savant on this people and culture, and a pseudo-scholar.

IF they do read it, I would advise them to realize that Michael Breen has a very shallow assessment of non western peoples and cultures. His writing, in it of itself, is solid and snappy, but his basic view of the Korean people is not that of a scholar or a true observant. I am not Korean and have only been to Japan, but as a student of Asian Studies, I found myself shaking my head on many pages, wondering how he can get away with such baseless insights. Were I to use the analogies or sweeping generalizations in a paper, or at a conference, I would get lambasted by anybody who had the gumption of what scholarly writing and argumentation is.

However, the readouts are always consistent, so the discrepancies, if any, should be no problem.We like our unit; it's small and inconspicuous.

Even if you hate politics there is some very good information to find in here.The authors know why certain buildings, streets and bridges are there because of political decisions, showing that it is so much more than just mentioning what building had what party etc.The book is in Dutch and very easy to carry around. It also has good maps and the tours are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Hardly a book - 30 page pamphlet really. It was very poorly written. 16 quick stories about the early discoveries of some of Arizona's mines. I did get a few interesting tidbits out of it, but that is about it. Most of these mines were owned by Phelps-Dodge, and apparently they commissioned this pamphlet to mark their 100 year anniversary in 1981.

It is a great mixture of history, true crime, ghost stories, vampires and humor. It is well written and easy to stay involved in. I sat down and read it straight through. I learned new details about familiar stories, gained insight into different religions and beliefs and even had a goose bump or two during some of the stories! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Carving This CD Into Onion Rings!","review":"I seem to have forgotten where the \\"Stop\\" button is on my CD player since I got this album from my mailbox yesterday.

As if her original work on the album isn't enough of an elixir for the gritty-blues-lover in all of us, her covers of \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" will leave you thinking \\"Wow...that song can do THAT??\\". I reviewed the other Reviews while trying to decide one way or the other to \\"commit\\" to this one. If you're reading this for the same purpose...DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER THIS ALBUM NOW!

The \\"Ghosts of Albion\\" are historical figures fromEngland's past returned such as Lord Nelson who aid and support the brother and sister duo. There was really nothing to dislike, the setting, story and characters have been seldom used in other works to make the whole fresh and fun to read. I think most people will find something to enjoy in this novel, besides the fact it was co-written by Amber Benson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much!","review":"This book is shockingly boring! Even worse is that I had to order it and wait for it. The setting is back when women wore very uncomfortable dresses, and marriages were arranged. The only bearable character in the book is the main one. She isn't a \\"typical\\" quiet girl, and their family has a secret history of a demon fighting order. Her brother and his fiancee are the most annoying and useless characters in the entire book. After reading the first Myth Hunters book, I noticed the authors tendency to use weak and spineless men as characters. Anyways, the story crawls along with old-fashioned drama that doesn't make sense and I never could stand to finish the book, although i did try. It drags on and on with no relief other than to close the cover. Mr. Golden should stick to modern settings that his writing excels in. I recommend the Buffy books instead. Maybe the Myth Hunters if you can ignore the old-fashioned tediousness and have an interest in gods,stories, and myths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst video ever","review":"This is the absolute worst video I have ever seen.

This is a one time collection of talent that engages the listener and takes them to places no other group has been able to lead us. No one I've introduced October Project to has thought differently than any other reviewer here. That's high praise. There is a tremendous void left by Sony's bail out.

Great listening for the thinker, poet, and dreamer. Mary's voice is wonderfully haunting and beautiful. I highly recommend this CD, and if you get it and don't like it at first, listen to it again.

It was recommended by amazon based on my prior history (Love Cocteau Twins, Natalie Merchant, Dead Can Dance etc...)After listening to the entire CD twice.. I must confess, I just don't get it. While many of the lyrics are beautiful.. the CD sounds like a weird cross between Christian Rock (music) and Grace Slick (singing style). I did not find the music very complex, atmospheric or interesting in the least. Sounded like one of those New Age CDs they sell in gift stores to me.Sounds like the music moved a lot of people deeply, that is fine..

This powerful collection of Romantic, literate, timeless songs is one to cherish, and will continue to be discovered by new listeners for years to come. How can anyone not respond to such swooning gorgeousness? This music will transport you to another, richer world ... and even after returning, you'll carry that world within you like a dark, throbbing, earthborn jewel.

Return to Me is unforgettable. I strongly encourage anyone to get this disc. It is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Manna From An Ethereal Heaven","review":"Very few muisicians and groups have captivated me in the manner Mary Fahl & October Project have. They are in a rarified symphonic air. This is music of a higher echelon; moving, mesmerizing while weaving a eloquent gem of meloncholic tapestry...their sound is at once timeless and incomparable. I was gloriously taken by them upon a chance exposure to \\"Take Me As I Am\\" while walking the boardwalk in the summer of 1994. That *voice* just resonated and ascended above and beyond the din of the crass and the commonplace and infused me with the ambition of uncovering just exactly who this unique musical entity was. After some diligent searching, I discovered the October Project and have been hooked ever since. Amazing and captivating; this is music that is ethereally breathtaking, poignant, and gorgeous beyond belief. A light amongst the darkness and drab that characterizes so much of the fodder that is passed off as music today. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest musical groups ever.","review":"Think of Evanescence with a much better singer and musicians, and their own material, which was as good as any pop music ever written, and you have October Project.It is tragic and mind boggling that such an incredible group could have broken up due to lack of sales. I still can't understand how it happened.They produced two marvelous albums. Get them both. Everything the others said up to this point, is absolutely true.

I now live in a different state, married with a family of my own. My foster sister and I still see each other a few times a year but their music is something we share together. Everytime we hear a song we think of the other and the great memories we shared growing up. My husband and my daughter love it to and so does my foster sister's son.

Others are not meant for a traditional wedding ceremony, such as parachuting. Also, the book only covers the ceremony, not the reception. The book is really quite ugly, and you wouldn't be losing anything to go with a used copy... it's paperback and spiral bound, so it's really not going to be a keepsake book. Worth it to spend under $4 on a used on, not over that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Condition","review":"I ordered this book as a gift.

Worse, I found that by reading the first sentence of each paragraph, I got the idea, rather than spending time going into each repetitive example. On the chance I was too negative about the text, I loaned it to an associate who is heavily involved with mentoring and he also found the book to be redundant with rather obvious recommendations.

The text is clearly written, helping me pull together all the other information I had read. Having a set of concise directions on using SysPrep was an excellent addition to the book. The information on Group Policy & the Group Policy Editor could be a godsend to locking down the customer computers and enhancing the user environment for my coworkers.Most of the technology books I have read have been forced - forcing myself to read and understand the text, either for a work or personal project.

However, the illustrations were unnecessary, and a little juevenile, the story jumped around a fair bit, and the characters lacked the depth one hopes for. In her defense, this is a prequel and one should not necessarily know the characters well, especially if they missed her first novel. Too, vignettes are not designed to give an entire story, just a short piece, or in her world, a small taste.The narrative threw me a bit, but it is simply a matter of stlye and taste. G. L.

(Dubbing/better packaging)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series but 1 star for not being dubbed","review":"Kannagi is one of my favorite series, but when they charge 50$ for a DVD box set to a \\"13 episode\\" series, and it isn't even dubbed, I call it criminal.Common Practice with Bandai, and Sentai Filmworks. They won't put series in 5.1, but instead 2.0. Over half the time they don't even dub. To top it all off, not only are their products not in 5.1 or dubbed, but they also charge PREMIUM prices for their Discs as well. 50-60$ it just unacceptable anymore for a DVD/Blu-Ray still in production.Basically they get a license, then they ship off the dvds.Sry for ranting, kannagi is a great anime series. It is cliche, but the way the series is presented compared to most animes of its genre is excellent.I do not recommend buying it, until they at least dub it. Hell I'd only buy it if they at least dropped the price to 20$ and dubbed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Porn","review":"The sex scenes in this movie are almost pornographic even though the female stars are well known actresses.

The best part is the cinematography and the great foreign locales. Just gorgeous scenery, great camera shots. Annie is wonderful and sexy, the other characters are all a bit weak - not the fault of the actors, just really out of place and boring dialog and dumb story lines at times. If only the writing was as good as the rest of it this would be a truly superb series. Annie/Auggie is cliche and inevitable, the stars are trying really hard and the fans want it to happen because it's a nice friendship, but probably they should have stuck with Ben or Simon or...Still worth buying to be able to feel like an international spy over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed with this episode","review":"I like Covert Affairs, but this episode was ruined by the ending.

It turned out that this episode is a prequel to the series and is only 19 minutes long, even though it still costs $1.89. It tells the story of Augie learning to cope with being a blind agent handler. It takes place in Barcelona and since I haven't been there in 45 years I found the travelogue aspect beautiful. The story is sort of weak, given that we already had one show about Augie getting blinded in Iraq. Annie the usual heroine is not in this at all. It is an OK sort of clip but not worth the price of a full episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"The show continues to be that \\"little bit different\\" of a spy show.","review":"Annie's character heals a bit too quickly, skipping some great opportunities for character development and character dynamics evolution.And the rouge agent theme (\\"off book\\" is becoming far too cliche in the genre, and isn't tolerated in the real world) is trodding excessively well worn ground.However, the series, and this episode, remain delightfully watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow great series.","review":"Man this episode left me on the edge of my seat.

Writers, come on, we the people like watching the CIA team we know in the office and out working together. I couldn't get into the Simon and Annie thing cause I thought she had lost her mind. I think there is much more heat when Eyal and Annie are together. I did get into the episodes after she was shot and went for Lena. Thought the Russia story was very good. Then Eyal saves her. This season with all happening, would have been a great opportunity for Annie and Joan to truly forge a relationship of respect. I really hope that Augie and Annie do not get together.

Piper's beautiful, but it would be better if she weren't quite so aware of it. The more I watch it, though, the less it bothers me because the script is so well-written and entertaining and I love all of the characters that make up the show.

I love the romance between Simon and Annie and how it helps make her seem a bit more human. The previous seasons had too much perfection in them. This is a good show that I really enjoy watching, especially because it does not go exactly where viewers would first anticipate it too. There are twists and turns that keep it alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good season","review":"Although Covert Affairs isn't the best show on television, I still appreciate it for the characters.

I'd have to like it that much to continue to \\"time shift\\" by buying the downloads rather than let my schedule keep me from watching.But this series is a refreshing twist on the old spy genre. It is unfortunate that the writers are taking the show down old, well troden, and overdone mole/rogue/double plot lines and \\"I'm doing this even though I've been told not to\\" character exploitations.With so many aspects of espionage still unadressed, one would hope that the show will find its way back to exploring the theme of Annie's integration into that world.That said, the show continues to be engaging. Pierabo remains lovable, Gorham engaging, and we are left wondering if the two of these will ever work out their relationship, and hoping that they do. And hoping that Annie survives, and that Lena gets what should be coming to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covert Affairs season 3 has been really disappointing","review":"Seasons 1 and 2 were great but season 3 has not come up to the first two seasons.

I truly envy Christopher Gorman for getting to be around her so much and I really like how it seems that they (Piper & Christopher) are finally starting to realize their truly deep feelings for each other.

If you're fitting a 15 / 14 inch screen in the bag, then don't expect space for much else. However I bought it knowing this, and it works great with an ultraportable / 12 inch laptop, with space for a few folders. Another quirk is the front compartment, which is zipped up, and when unzipped reveals many smaller pockets. The fact that the front pocket is only usable when unzipped pretty much render it \\"useless\\" for me.However overall I love the design, the \\"look\\" of the bag. It looks expensive, and the leather texture adds to the \\"classiness\\". For all the functional deficiency, this bag is a real \\"looker\\", and I definitely don't see anyone on the streets carrying the same bag in Singapore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of useless in a few respects","review":"There's room for a laptop, sure. But just try squeezing in a book or even your power brick. It looks nice, but it's too small. There's really just room for the laptop, maybe a folder of a half-inch or three-quarters inch, no more. But somehow the case itself, though not really so, manages to feel vast and unwieldy. The shoulder pad makes it easy for the strap to slip from your shoulder.

This book does not deserve even one star, it is so full of fallacies, half-truths, outright mistruths and highly sensationalized and fictionalized events. Supposedly an experienced journalist, the author, Lorena Hickok, was the controversial companion of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, and was herself often the victim of gossip, innuendo, and sensationalistic journalism. The sloppiness and carelessness apparent in this book -- so many dates, times, places, and events are misstated -- cause me to question Hickock's veracity as a journalist in her other writings. This book is only good for the trash (recycling) bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"This type of collar was new to me. These are also called greyhound or humane collars. We have a Sheltie, and her head is small in relation to her neck, so she can pull her head right out of anything but a choke collar or a halter.

This works like a charm, and would have also been great for my miniature pinscher (skinny neck, small head)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes staining to my dog's neck","review":"The collar looked nice when it was new, but after a couple of months the chrome finish started to flake off and the fur on my dog's neck was turning black from the chain rubbing on it -- even though the collar was not too tight.

How could he know that FOR SURE? Blazes on trees could have been put there by anyone, now or years ago. How could Waits know positivly they are Kaczynski's?

Also, did you pick up on the fact that the evidence Chris Waits claimed to have found in the \\"secret cabin\\" was not important enough to the FBI for them to collect it and save it for the trial? Only Waits thought it was important and that he was important to the investigation. After reading it, I have doubts about the authentisity of the supposed evidence.

When you have tired for the umpteenth time of how but for the author we may never have found \\"Ted's Secret Cabin\\" you will have to seek out other books to find out about the unabomber.Is it me but why have the last two books I bought from American authors (last one supposed to be about Tim McVeigh) all about themselves and not the subject matter?

The text reveals, among other things, the fascinating details of Kaczynski's encampments, secret cabin, and buried muinitions cashes on Waits' heavily-wooded land.Offering a glimpse into the mind of the Unabomber are excerpts from his journals. These meticulously kept (and often eloquently written) pages show the reader a man technologically paranoid and vengeful and, at the same time, in love with and in awe of his natural surroundings.I highly recommend this intelligent and exciting book to anyone in search of first-hand insight into the life and mind of Ted Kaczynski."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is this book about","review":"I have just read this book.

This book is full of conjectures, implications, but little proof for the things Waits claims. There are many instances where Waits says he found a campsite or an old mine Ted used on Waits property, but gives no proof any of them were actually Teds. Anybody, hunters or hikers, could have used them and not been seen if the area is as remote and dense as Waits claims. Waits certainly likes himself----I found----I reasoned----I thought----I did----espically statements or implications where he thought he was invaluable to the FBI----they couldn't have done the investigation without him. I can't believe he was that important to the FBI, therefore I have doubts about the most of the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The not so secret life of Chris Waits","review":"Although, in general, I enjoyed this book, I (also) got tired of (supposed) writer, Mr. Waits, lauding himself and how (now that he was armchair quarter backing) he knew more than Ted, the FBI and and town locals - combined. He paints himself as the smartest hero in this book - heck, any book. He plays classical piano, speaks several languages and is skilled in most earth sciences. Yet, Mr. Waits never puts two and two together - that when a new weirdo moves into town - construction equipment and cabins start being destroyed, animals begin turning up dead or tortured and at least one person is shot in the back (of this small mountain community) and that it just may be... the NEW LOCAL WEIRDO committing these crimes. Hello! Because the local area and topography itself is so interesting and the little glimpses of Ted are fascinating I was able to make it to the end of this short read. But, I also got tired or hearing Mr. Waits grandstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I picked this book up at the library and I am glad that I did not pruchase this book.

Plus, the author and his dogs struck me as odd as others have pointed out. If all these strange things were happening, why would you let your dogs out freely.

But I did love it--Darinda's storyline especially interested me, and I found myself wishing Linda had written a spin-off about Darinda and Captain Retford. The storyline with Rogan and Evy was refreshing to read...Evy's mistake in being dishonest with her husband is one we all make, though we hardly ever read about.

It's hard to tell from the picture, but the slots for utensils are very narrow, with large flanges meant to be trimmed to size surrounding them. But no one would need a tray with flanges THAT big, that wouldn't need a larger amount of storage space in the tray, too. There is over an inch and a half of flange per side, and more at the top/bottom. And it is very thick plastic, which is the nice part, until you start to trim it. You need a saw - scoring it with a blade won't be enough, unless you have the strength of Zeus, and it has no \\"pre-scored\\" grooves molded on the back to help.

The worst decision being to over-emphesize earier parts of his life while almost ignoring the events of 1942-43 which constituted his rise to fame.The cover of the DVD has a clean-shaven head looking out into the distance.

It has amazing extras and features, however there is one issue: The first disc is often broken.I kept returning my broken set, and in each one I opened the first disc was starting peel apart, causing minor skipping, but with potential to get worse in the future. The store went through all 12 copies they had, and they were all broken in the same way. According to them, many sets were returned to the distributors, and the set has been officially discontinued.Good News though, Funimation has picked it up, and will be re-releasing the series on DVD and Blue-ray later this year. You should probably wait for that to come out. Here's Funimation's official site for FLCL: [..]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we Pirate? Cost Cost Cost!","review":"OK. So FLCL is quite possibly the best all-around anime series ever. But let's face facts...these are outrageously overpriced. Yes, I know...the production values, etc.Can I clue you all into something?TV shows don't make money if they're not on TV. So the producers of TV shows make sure they make $$$ upon delivery. They aren't waitng for some pie-in-the-sky success to come along, a cult hit so they can sell DVDs for hundreds of dollars. That doesn't pay the bills.Gainax made their money off FLCL a long time ago. This is price gouging pure and simple. I will not participate. This is why people pirate.(Note: I will not be downloading this show. Gainax can go F themselves.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Definitely Need a Guide in Order to Understand This Series","review":"Another reviewer (\\"There IS a Plot\\") mentions a guide to the plot, characters, etc. I certainly couldn't make sense of this series, so I guess I need the guide.

Great animation. Imaginative and original. For grown-ups - By grown-ups, at long last!!! Made to be enjoyed over and over . . . and OVER! I can't think of ANYTHING to compare it to - \\"Yellow Submarine\\" has been mentioned, but, No. It's not \\"Yellow Submarine\\" - except in the sense that the music is by one band - the 'Pillows'- and is excellent. This collection is a masterpiece on every level, and is absolutely a \\"Must-Own\\". I wish it wasn't so pricey, tho it IS worth every penny!(I'll just hope that Santa brings it for Xmas! hint, hint)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended.","review":"This box set is just fantastic. The only thing worth noting on the downside is its lack of a clean closing extra. It was left out because they didn't want to 'punish' people who bought the separate DVDs when they were released. The art work on the box, the DVDs and the DVD case is just fantastic. While I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, I will admit its not to everyones liking. Also I haven't yet heard of anyone receiving their free t-shirt that you obtain with the included post card. As for the design of the shirt, its speculated to be the image on the post card with the robots.

Initially I was pleased with both: They were lighter and quieter than my Black and Decker and easier to handle. But in less than six months for both the battery life decreased significantly despite the full charge it received and the cleaning I did religiously to the blades. The 4\\" used to cover twice the area of my 3\\"; but now it covers less area than the 3\\" did in its prime. The 3\\" is a year old and no longer of any use in its sputterings; the 4\\" probably won't be alive to happily celebrate its first birthday, either.

The authors have a firm grasp on the topics, and present it to the reader very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of No Useful Help","review":"This book is merely a compilation of copied-and-pasted text from various web sites, as it seems. The authors do not focus on trying to help the reader understand how winsock works, but instead try to glean over a few details while at the same time straying from the topic at hand.The book is poorly written, with several typos abounding. As is often from a Microsoft Press book, this text does not strive to help the reader.If you are trying to find a book that will help you learn how to write code for programming network applications, this book is definitely not for you! If, on the other hand, you would like to read brief descriptions of winsock and not actually understand how it works, this book is written for you in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad source code","review":"You would think the authors know what they are talking about when they write a book. But the source code provided does not run if you don't meet very strict requirements. The authors work for Microsoft. And they are tester/devloper.

I thought it would make things easier. In reality, the base stays connected to the laptop which also connects to a power source so you have MORE wires to deal with and a base dangling off the back of the comp. Regardless, I really really do love the mouse. You have to look online for the manual from the Logitech site because they don't print them, for some reason. They also don't give you any clue that you'll need to do this. That may be because I bought a refurbished one, though. Also, remember that you'll need to buy rechargeable batteries. They are a little expensive but not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research this before you buy it.","review":"Mine would maintain a charge for only a few hours, where it is supposed to last for 10+ days. It also overheated in the charging cradle to the point where the batteries melted into the holder, and the battery cover deformed.

Early on I 'discovered' this the hard way with a 'dead mouse' in the recharger base the next time I tried to use it (it took ~a day to properly recharge.) MAKE SURE THE GREEN LIGHT ON THE MOUSE IS ON OR FLASHING AFTER YOU PLACE IT IN THE CHARGING BASE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO MANIPULATE THE MOUSE BACK-AND-FORTH AND UP-AND-DOWN IN THE BASE MANY TIMES UNTIL THIS HAPPENS.

This is a good example of his work. \\"A Grue of Ice\\" is another example.It is set partly in WW 2 and mainly in South Africa and Namibia circa 1959. As another reviewer said, there are some displays of racist attitudes which may upset people today. Remember that this is what you would expect from a South African of the 1960s, and treat the book on its own merits. A good read.

On my own I had been trying to come to grips with the ideas of extreme lawsuits, political correctness, and limits on authority. While I'm in favor of the basic ideas expressed in all these principles, I constantly get a feeling that many people don't understand the true meaning of their rights and simply abused their privileges.This book validated my beliefs, but more importantly, helped me to better understand how we have come to act this way. It also helped me express all my feelings about this subject in a simple way: Our over emphasis on our individual freedoms and (supposed) entitlements is putting in jeopardy our common good, and we are ultimately hurting ourselves.I think this book should be read by anyone who wants to be a true contributor to the common good."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"I read Howard's first book, \\"The Death of Common Sense\\", and enjoyed it immensely.

I started reading it, and it all sounded extremely familiar. After a few pages, I thought that this could not be just casual re-hashing of the same material. Then I discovered, in small print on the cover \\"(originally titled: The Lost Art of Drawing the LIne)\\"!

Just like in Barney when the lost kid blows her whistle to arise fortestrial conflict and friendly fighting amongst the purple dinosaur and young children.So just think, next time you wish to fill the empty spot in your bag with something besides wordless college texts, buy a small Shofar Ram Horn IE a Shofar friend finder."},{"rating":"2","title":"History for ESOL students and Emergent Readers!","review":"This type of book is very helpful to students learning English or who are learning to read.

The pictures help provide information and support the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as good as it could have been.","review":"This collection is not meant to be a greatest hits, but more of a \\"favorites\\" for the bandmembers themselves. This is both good and bad, but how can one really argue with the masters themselves? However, the ommission of any songs from their first two albums (Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny), with the exception of the live 'Victim of Changes', leads one to believe that these are favorites within a subset, which compromises the collection. I wonder if Judas Priest could have used Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny, whether they would have chosen some of those songs over the ones they actually used. But in the end the songs presented do show the history and diversity of the band, and the liner notes show how personal these songs really are to the bandmembers. If you even want to think you are a Judas Priest fan, you need to have this double CD set in your collection. All hail the Metal Gods!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor !","review":"Some bands of the 80's are still interesting to listen to, Judas Priest is not one of these. Sorry, but I'll give this one to somebody because for sure, I won't listen to it again until the rest of my life.The band sounds completely out dated and the musical structure is simple and boring. Get a couple cd's of Iron Maiden instead, they were and still are great musicians and their music is still actual."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome preist compilation","review":"I like \\"metal works\\" even better then the box set, it's two discs of scorching metal. i really liked the track selection here, there are the obvious preist classics as well as hidden gems and songs they are not usaully known for in this two pack. of course there are tracks that wern't included here that would of made this perfect, (riding on the wind, evening star, the ripper, rapid fire,ect) but what can you do? it comes pretty close to being perfect. i might suggest this to metal fans on a budget because it has almost every essential song from a kick@$$ heavymetal band, and what better metal band then judas preist? infact i can't think of a song selection from any band that is better then this. this 2 cd set came out in 1993, so this collection is almost a classic onto it self. \\"metalworks\\" has it all folk's, i just wish it had those few extra songs i mentioned insted of tracks from turbo, ram it down and painkiller."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will blow you away!","review":"What a great piece of work. Tracks such as Night Crawler, Painkiller, Touch of Evil, Metal Gods, Heading Out to the Highway, Screaming for Vengeance and Blood Red Skies pay the money. And the album doesnt stop there.

Just his voice alone is worthy the tip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow good film for the small budget","review":"When I got this movie I thought it has to be bad but i was surprised. I had heard that it was made for less then 1000. but wow what a well done film for the price. The Cole Brothers are so resourceful in this film. There are some very scary shots. and the lead actor (Stephen Twardokus) is very interesting to watch. for the budget this movie is good. It's worth to rent or even buy for 8 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad!!","review":"I don't even know where to begin, the packaging is horrible you cant get the product out with it dripping into the lid, it doesn't spread well at all, its sticky and oily and clogs your razor.You don't get a close shave at all with this. It causes body acne because its so oily. And everything greased up so you cant hold onto your razor well.

Mr. Hammond is a fine musician but too much of the film is wasted showing him performing Johnson's music. It was interesting watching Hammond and Mr. Johnny Shines 'cuttin' heads' on the street corners of a delta town. However, Hammond isn't a good interviewer and it seems like he just uses this as a platform to showcase his own considerable talent. I would advise anyone to stay away from this one and get 'Can't you hear the wind howl' instead. This is basically a rehash of all the same material.

Banner is a strong, courageous, fiesty female who earned her doctor's degree and deserved to practice. So what she is a female. It was time for a change and Banner was just the person to initiate the change.Banner came to town to help another doctor who was injured and meets Dr. Adam Corbin, the source of the other doctor's injury. Banner's and Adam's coming together is rocky at first, but as each put their differences aside and love enters, their situation gradually smooths out. Adam no longer sees Banner as a rival and a doctor, but as the woman he loves. In turn, Banner returns his feelings. Banner is indeed just what the doctor ordered!\\"Banner O'Brien\\" is the beggining of the Corbin legacy. A great series and great reading. I loved them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing by Rote","review":"Each time I begin reading a Lael-Miller novel I tell myself that its the last book by this author that I'll read. Yet, I am sometimes swayed by a particularly appealing story line outlined on the back cover. Banner O'Brien is no different. I did a lot of eye rolling throughout, from the first time the good doctor refers to the heroine as \\"Shamrock\\" (for the color of her eyes), to the stunted and unemotional ending. The main characters lacked a development that normally leads the reader to root for them. In fact, very early on they declared their love for one another. Boring! All the hero and heroine had in common was a somewhat delicious sex life and their choosen professions. The villians lacked development as well, and the end seemed to culminate in one page with a barely perceptible shrug. It seems as though this novel was written on auto pilot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Heartwarming Story from Linda Lael Miller","review":"I always enjoy this author's books.

I had to force myself to finish this book since I actually paid for it. The characters were not likeable. They were shallow, cold, and unfeeling not to mention not well-developed. I am officially on hiatus from LLM after reluctantly reading this book.

Yet claims are made about behavior that are not supported by data, or ideas are suggested which have been solidly refuted by good data.I went into this book very optimistically but left very disappointed. I did however enjoy some sharp insights the author made, such as a good education not only give one the facts but also teaches one how to argue against the facts.The book offers too many radial ideas, which are not supported and are very unlikely to be supported by data in the future.Overall read this book and decide for yourself.

This is a beautiful recording of some of Gabrieli's finest pieces. Listening to the music, you are able to hear the unique acoustics of San Marco - it's clear this was not recorded in a studio. The music doesn't sound distorted or warped: after the music has finished, you hear a faint but clear echo.

I went with the 1/4 and added some silicone to hold them in place and seal the holes. I was already starting to curse. When I tried to screw it down the screw heads stripped right away.

Not here. Most of the book is about how pathetic and woeful the ownership was before Mr. Kraft bought it. Very little of the book actually deals with on-field episodes. I did like some of his chapters on specific players, but even then most of the discussion was not about playing, but about their battles and problems with management and coaches. Overall, the book bored me and I love the Patriots.As an aside, Don Brocher, who Felger says was the trainer during a John Hannah tirade, was actually the assistant equipment manager. The stupid, little, easily checkable mistakes make me wonder if the author just didn't do the book in a hurry to capitalize on the team's recent success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fluff","review":"Do not waist your time buying this book. Even the most casual fan of the Patriots will know of or has heard every anecdote Felger draws upon. In fact, all the research needed for this book could have been extracted from the newspaper archieves from the Globe or Herald. No need to quote the likes of Pat Sullivan or Gino. Felger would have been better asking Art Donovan for old Colt stories and making them up as Pats stories. Rather than be cutting edge, by discussing problems such as drugs, alcohol, gambling, domestic violence or the real cut throat antics of professional football (something the Pats are famous for), Felger sold out to the team he covers daily.

This DVD is SOUND ONLY, but it will not play in your regular CD player, you must use a DVD player. The additional menu options that are navigated on screen are sparse and hardly worth the effort. This music is available on CD also, a much better deal! As for the music: Harnoncourt is not my favourite conductor, but I admire him for some of his work on baroque and early classical music. Strauss is definitely not his medium. While he is known for his quick pace in the baroque interpretations, he is pretty slow-footed on some of the waltzes and polkas. This makes them loose some of the lightness and typical viennese air, and that is regrettable. He does pick some pieces from the Strauss repertoire that are not heard so often, and in that regard this work is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These products","review":"These are by far the best, most versitile garden tools we have ever found.

The first gets a HUGE fat ZERO in my book - YUK- BORING- PRETENTIOUS - TOTALLY UNINSPIRING. The second is not actually not too bad, but sounds a wee bit laboured if you are in the wrong mood.

For example, he frequently asserts that this or that old military action \\"must have been\\" made out of high-grade steel without having done any actual analysis or even hardness testing of the material in question. But, his descriptions do convey at least as much information about the many designs covered as I would have gotten if I had the chance to disassemble and study them all myself. I don't have a hardness tester either.The book is generally well written and fun to read.If you're thinking about buying a modern sporting rifle, you might want to read this and compare the various designs before you lay down your money.

If so, just be aware that the film wasn't really written by Robert Towne. Towne's screenplay was COMPLETELY redone by Roman Polanski, over Towne's very strong objections. Polanski, to his credit, has been pretty quiet about the subject. Towne, to his shame, has also. He continues to receive and accept credit for a script he never wrote. It's much more Polanski's movie than Towne's.I'd love to see someone do an article on what went on between these two guys between the time Towne turned in his final draft and Polanski finished cutting the film.

The foam was very similar to one another \\"natural\\" product salon line. I used it sparingly; only one to one and a half pumps and it made my hair feel dry. I found nothing at all conditioning about this foam. It was ok, but it is not worth the price. The \\"Ojon\\" oil is just American Palm oil (Elaeis Oleifera) which is widely used in many food and beauty products. It is way too expensive for the poor results.

I cannot believe this...the basic concept of this book spawned from the movie The Matrix. I'm not anywhere near finishing (halfway), and I just don't think I'll pick the book back up. It's turning out to be good, but c'mon......Pike, you could do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing","review":"I don't know if its just me, but i didn't understand much of this book. I don't see how aliens, fire, MAZE, and advanced space stations connect. The story starts out with a teen who enjoys burning things to vent his feelings, but then it turns into aliens taking over the planet and space stations and killing all the people on the planet (?). I'm 13, and I didn't see any connection. The plot was confusing, and many aspects were left unexplained. What was with the MAZE at the end and that Mexican clinic and Mark's sister? What's with killing all of the people on the planet? The whole brains floating in tanks? It just wasn't a very clear book compared to Christopher Pike's other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Fire","review":"Magic Fire is one of my favorite Christopher Pike books.

Well, did I just answer my own question. I picked up this book yesterday and I'm already done. it was great!

I hope the more I read his books, the more I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad...","review":"This was a really interesting book, and I'll have to admit, better than I expected. Despite a typical, mediocre build-up, the ending was a surprise. i would actually just give this book 3.5 stars, but since amazon doesn't let us do half ratings, i had to round up. and i'll give the book the benefit of being aimed for pre-teens & such. it's not so great now that i'm 21 and loving books like The Lovely Bones (soooo amazingly good) but i know if i had read this book back when i was thirteen, i would have thought it was great.

There are so many kata's in Shotokan it's easy to forget a single step that will stop you cold. This series of books explains each kata in numbered steps, each step broken down by a series of pictures showing how they should be performed including where the kiai's are. At the end of the step by step instructions are a series of pictures showing the application of the kata moves.Nakayama founded the Japan Karate Association along with Gichin Funakoshi and was the head of JKA until his death in 1987.It is extremely important to note that you cannot learn karate from a book. There are so many aspects to correct karate training you can easily develop bad habits. A qualified instructor can help you overcome those mistakes. But you will find the best instructors have a set of these books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series of books on kata.","review":"I have been practicing Shotokan karate for 10 years now. Even though I attend regular classes and seminars, as well as working out with very qualified karate-ka, I still find myself coming back to Master Nakayma's work in this very fine series of books. Of all the books on kata I have these books are superior.The instruction is straight forward and to the point. Tips are given to avoid common mistakes. Under the many pictures illustrating the kata is a stance diagram and short concise sentences to describe each move.Extremely well done by one of the finest karate masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nakayama Sensei's book is essential for all karate-ka","review":"This book is by far the best value as far as picture explanations of basic kata. Nakayama Sensei uses many pictures, which can get a bit confusing at times, but are very helpful for understanding detailed movements. At the end of each kata he presents a special section on the hardest part of each kata. Highlights include Heian nidan, Heian Yondan, and, Tekki Shodan. The photographs are clear and the ext is easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"I was lucky enough to see this in the theatre!

We decided to do light pink walls and we pulled \\"Cupids Arrow\\" by BEHR paint out of the wallpaper sample.

While its adorable beyond belief, we realized you hang it kind of like a picture frame with two clasps up at the top to hang on wall tacks or nails. It is a little bit heavy because it is wood and acrylic so make sure to put another screw at the bottom to anchor it a little bit better to the wall. It hangs about 2 feet above the floor so we could just see our little girl pulling on it and having the thing falling and hitting her.

Taken from the Grammy winning album Breakaway, Kelly tells you to walk off her if you don't know what you want. Chosen as the fifth and final single from the album, it keeps climbing the charts. Remixes are always superb with the right touch. After seeing her live twice, this is the best beginning girl anthem of 2006! Be sure to preview remixes! If you like this single, I also recommend the import singles Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Because of You here at Amazon!

If you walk away from this one, you're missing a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Out","review":"There are sometimes where a artist is so overexposed, the feeling of the music isn't really appealing. That has been indefinitely the case with Kelly Clarkson. SInce her days with American Idol, she has been really too much of a good thing. It seems to me that her music isn't as appealing, and the feeling of the songs just doesn't click. That has shown with her single Walk Away, the fourth single from her 2004 album Breakaway. I honestly feel the appeal just doesn't seem to deliver. She honestly doesn't really deliver a convincing appeal as a driven singer, as the case with others who have delivered like Whitney Houston in song. This song like Kelly, should just go away.Song: F+"},{"rating":"2","title":"RECEIVED GIRL TIN!!!","review":"I purchased this tin online for my 6 year old son.

The tins (as usual) come with 5 booster packs: 1 each of Dark Beggining 1, Dark Revelation Volume 1, Soul of the Duelist, Rise of Destiny, & Flaming Eternity. The tins also come with 1 Limited edition monster: 1 out of these 6; Gilford the Lightning, Rocket Warrior, Panther Warrior, Dark Magician Girl, Exarion Universe, or Vorse Raider, all useful cards. This is a good product to buy if you just want some more cards for your collection. If you are searching for a certain card, it may be a better idea to trade with your friends, as buying many packs in search for 1 rare card can get expensive. This is a good value, since 5 packs of cards would cost $20.00. The tin also doubles as a stylish card holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"I bought the Rocket Warrior Tin. I was opening the packs and pulled two Holos. Out of the Rise of Destany pack I pulled a Ultimate Rare Machine Duplication, and out of soul of the duelist I got a Super rare Greed. I got YZ-Tank Dragon as a rare from Dark Revalation. I might buy the Dark Magician Girl tin next. I'm not a huge fan of Gilford because He would probably have to be put in his own deck.

Also, their harmonies are on point, which we really aren't finding in the industry right now. The production and song-writing is top notch. \\"Understanding\\" is so touching; I cried the first time I heard it. I love \\"Just Kickin' It,\\" the original and the remix. Their take on the Clark Sister's \\"Is My Living In Vain?\\" was also a highlight for me. Okay... I liked the whole album! I listen to it straight through.

So I remember seeing the marquee posting the long success of this movie. I finally got to see it on \\"late\\" TV one night.It is possible to buy the VHS on-line as part of the British Classics Collection. If you see this first version, you will understand why 'special' Academy awards were given to the two boys who played Harry and Davy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean family moive!","review":"This is a great family film. There is no violence, sex, or bad language. It is loosely based on a '50's movie of the same name. It tells the story of two young Scottish orphan boys who travel by themselves from the \\"Old country\\" to join their father's family in Nova Scotia. There they encounter their stern disciplinarian grandfather who has shut off himself from some of his neighbors. There is particularly no love lost between the grandfather and his Dutch neighbors. He blames the Dutch people for his son's death in the Boer War. A side plot is that this animosity is keeping apart the boy's aunt and her Dutch doctor suitor. The two boys change everything though when they find a young baby abandoned on the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Kidnappers","review":"The remake with Charlton Heston is completely lacking in the charm the original movie had. It ruined a beautiful warm movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bach, but not the best.","review":"Of course Glenn Gould has always been known for his Bach playing abilities. And if you buy this DVD you won't be dissapointed. His playing is superb. Technique is fantastic and his interpretation of the piece is first rate. It's always entertaining to watch because of how freaky old Glenn looks at the piano so low on his chair and his always disturbing \\"other hand conducting\\" thing he does. Anyway, the DVD picture quality is pretty good considering it was filmed almost 20 years ago. Sound is excellent. The only reason i thought this only deserved four stars: 1. A large attraction of DVD's are the extras. i would say this one has little to none. 2. Murray Perahia's recent recording of the work (available on cd) is preffered by me and most people. Murray is just as able as Glenn and his performance is authentic only his playing is much more charmingand he adds so many beautiful ornamentations on the second repeats. But this is worth the money to add to you collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Wonderful Document","review":"An incredible DVD. Watch this and you will believe in magic. Simply incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The joyful pain of playing piano","review":"In this magnificent recording, you can see how Glenn Gould, in a joyful and painful way, feels the sublime Bach's Goldberg Variations. If you like Bach, if you enjoy the genuine feeling of an interpreter, enjoy this video. It made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed reading There Are No Limits","review":"I expecially like the short chapter format that closes with a call to action. I believe this makes it an easier read for busy managers who are constantly traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"replacement stand","review":"This stand works just fine. Easy to install. The only difficulty was trying to tighten the screws for the vertical position. Tension is so tight you need four hands. Two to hold the monitor in position and two to get on the back and tighten the screws. I found the tension was enough that the monitor stayed in place so I didn't have to find a friend to help with the screws. If the monitor gets bumped though it will move but not a big issue easy to readjust."},{"rating":"2","title":"NeoFlex","review":"I purchased this for use with the Samsung SyncMaster 2253BW 22\\" monitor. Once received It was very simple and easy to install and I was able to start playing with the stand. It easily holds the monitor and the height and rotation adjustment are fairly easy. I have it locked down pretty tight so the adjustments do not slip as time goes on but they are easy enough for my kids to lower and me to raise back up during use.The twist action is nice and it does blend nice with the Sammy scheme. It does feel/look like the monitor will not be supported well since it is so small but it is very well balanced. The monitor I have is within the recommendations for weight but not size.Great price also. Just wish the monitor would have come with this type of stand standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific for the Price","review":"I just installed two of these stands on Samsung 226BW 22-inch lcd monitors. I bought these stands primarily because they were the least expensive ones I could find that had good reviews. I simply refused to pay $100 to $200 for anything that looked decent.Let me say that these stands are terrific! I can't really find any fault with them. Very careful setup took ten minutes each. The vertical tension setting was perfect (right out of the boxes), and I can now use the monitors in the portrait configuration.I also have two new Samsung 2253BW monitors on a video editing system, and I am certain that they will be mounted on these Neoflex stands in tne very near future.The monitors I own are used in a small business, and I don't have a lot of time to fool around with junk. Please take my word for it, you will not be disappointed if you buy this stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I have had this for years. I cannot remember exactly but it's been at least 4 years, more than likely, longer. I decided to post this review now because I have upgraded to a 27\\" LED monitor and this thing works like a charm. The base footprint is the exact same size as the stand that came with the monitor. The monitor is an Asus VE278q LED and the weight is listed at an estimated 6.5kg/14.33lbs which is within the specs of the stand but I think they rate it to a 24\\" LCD. I didn't have to adjust the spring at all. I can adjust the monitor in any direction with one finger. With the exception of tilting the display backwards. You can still rotate the display from landscape to portrait but you have to tilt the monitor all the way back as noted in the description and your ability to tilt the monitor forward after that will be limited. This thing is showing no signs of wearing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Height adjustment is non existant","review":"Only one height position, top of the stand. The height option is non existant, there is a tension screw adjustment that is so rigid that it is impossible to set and use the monitor at lower height levels. The tilt is also set with a tension screw that will allow for different settings if the tension setting is fully decreased."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A.","review":"I give products one chance. The screw on the bottom that tightens the up & down tension did not work. Turned it fully tight, and then fully loose, and back again, all with no change in resistance. This is a problem because the vertical adjustment is spring loaded, so my monitor would not lower without popping back to the top. Very good design if you get one that works. (refunded)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neoflex - Flexible, sturdy, easy","review":"After being shocked with overnight delivery on the product I was surprised at the ease of set-up. Stand is sturdy and easy to adjust. I particularly like the angle ability to put my Samsung 216BW on the same plane with my eye glasses. Editing photos has become much easier. Excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good Value. No more Neck pain! Yay!","review":"Out of the box it had very easy assembly and setup. Accessories for basically any monitor type and size. After setup, it was a little stiff to adjust and adjustment screws don't really change tension much, still a little hard to move. Oddly, it would probably be easier with a heavier monitor. Cheapest adjustable monitor stand that also rotates 90deg, which is great for word docs and web browsing! takes strain off your neck if your desk is either too high or too low. takes the monitor down to desk level if you want. 4/5 because I'm very pleased with most aspects of this product, except the tension issue. It may resolve over time with use, We shall see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit!","review":"This is exactly what I needed for my Acer P221W monitor. It even allows the 90-degree rotation for this wide-screen monitor (though I probably won't use that feature much, if at all).Very easy to assemble and use - works perfectly.Highly recommended. (I just wonder why, at such a low price, the monitor wouldn't have come with something like this straight out of the box.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand","review":"Easy to assemble, good quality. Easy to adjust. Firm base can hold big screen. I have two 19\\" and 22\\" screen with this stand. Totally satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"Well, what else can I say about it? It does everything it says, and it's a great price. Easy installation (with the support for quite a few different mounting fixtures), easy height, pivot, and tilt adjustment. Large (but not TOO large) and sturdy base and sturdy installation. If you want a quality monitor stand, this is the best you're getting for the price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have a samsung monitor and a viewsonic as a secondary monitor. The bases were different heights especially since the viewsonic has a speaker built in on the bottom. With these stands, I can easily adjust the height so that the viewable screens are lined up. They are very sturdy and adjusts with ease. You can even tilt the monitor so it views vertically if you want. Looks nice too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good product","review":"It doesn't give you that much low angle, besides that the base is perfect, easy to put together, materials are really good, be careful with the monitor AOC f22s it will give you a hard time when you are changing the orientation of the monitor from landscape to portrait."},{"rating":"2","title":"No DIY Can Beat This One!","review":"I evaluated every possible DIY means in making a good solid stand to rotate my 23.3\\" LCD monitor 90 degrees for viewing pictures. I gave up finally duo to the high cost of materials, let alone the time going to spend. Ergotron engineers really designed this with great thoughts and ergonomics. By contrast, the LCD monitor is not designed with the rotation in mind, such that the power cord is twisted every time the monitor is rotated.One thing can be improved by Ergotron: Provide a click-feeling/sound when exact 90 degrees is reached, such that I don't need to rely on other means to check if the monitor is leveled or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stand","review":"I was looking for a stand that would allow my stock Dell 20\\" monitor to turn to portrait orientation. This does the trick. Solid. Well-built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal Stand","review":"I was given a flat screen TV without a pedestal stand. I checked with the TV manufacturer and they do not sell pedestals alone for my particular model. I could not find a universal TV stand unless I wanted a wall mounted version which I did not. And I did not want to put a ton of money into a stand. This stand worked perfectly for my 19\\" TV. The TV has a DVD player so it's on the heavier side...approx. 23 lbs. This stand can handle it without issue. It's adjustable and easy to put together. Do not hesitate to use this for more than a computer screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet my needs.","review":"After looking at the information listed, I thought this would work for my 16 inch flatscreen TV to use in my trailer. However it did not tilt downward far enough. The company sent it in a huge box, wanted it returned in original packing and would not send a postage paid return label. Amazon had to help me out. If you do not need good downward tilt then this would be a good choice for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I purchased this stand before purchasing my monitor, and it sat in the box for a couple of weeks. When the perfect 23-inch monitor finally arrived, I discovered the stand wouldn't work properly with it. I could pivot, but as soon as I removed my hand, the monitor became lopsided. As far as height adjustment, I could find no way to lock it in place. As soon as I touch the monitor, it falls down to the bottom of the stand. After fiddling with it for a while, I removed this stand and went back to the one that came with the monitor, which has no height adjustment, tilt or pivot. At some point, I will purchase a 22-inch monitor and try it again, but without being able to lock it to the correct height, I can't see it as being very practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellet solution for older Samsung monitor","review":"I have a Samsung Synchmaster 910T monitor that had a stand which would no longer hold a tilt adjustment. This stand replaced that perfectly. Couldn't ask for a better soluion. The key is that the stand needs to be bolted on to the monitor on the back. If your monitor doesn't have the matching threaded holes, you will not be able to use this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Monitor Stand","review":"I purchased two of the Neoflex LCD stands for use in a public building. They are on monitors that have to be used by many different people. Everyone loves them. It is so easy to adjust the height for each person. The swivel mechanism was an additional plus. I may be buying more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh. My. Goodness!","review":"Oh. My. Goodness. This thing will change my life.It was incredibly easy to put together and mount my Samsung SyncMaster 2220WM 22\\" monitor.It glides up and down easily. It tilts backward and forward easily. I'm not sure if the base is supposed to swivel easily or not, but on my desk it does.And then when I rotate it... WOW!Reading the local news online is more like looking at an actual newspaper. While programming in Microsoft SQL Server I can see almost 100 lines of code at a time. Working with ProTools music editing software enables me to see more (and taller) tracks in the edit window, making editing easier. And when jamming with my band, I can display a full sheet chord chart at 150% zoom or better and you can clearly read the lyrics and chords from across the room.This is flippin' AMAZING and incredibly affordable for what it does. HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I purchased this monitor stand as a replacement for broken part on a Dell E193. I couldn't be happier. The stand fastens directly to the back of the monitor quickly with the 4 screws provided. The stand provides far more adjustability than the OEM part. Well done, Neoflex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The stand is fine for everything except mounting my Samsung 23\\" monitor in the vertical position, which unfortunately is the reason I bought the stand. The mounting holes on the back of the Samsung are not in the center, so the weight of the monitor causes the monitor to rotate on the swivel as there is no locking mechanism to hold the monitor upright. Otherwise, I like the stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't adjust well","review":"The height is spring-operated and adjusted by tightening or loosening a screw. Unfortunately, the adjustment doesn't work very well and it always keeps inching higher--hard on your neck if that is a problem for you.It rotates well enough, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stand","review":"I bought this for a small TV that sits on a corner shelf and can't be wall mounted.

I bought it for my 4 year old to take with us on long trips and it was an instant hit. She loves the basic games that come with it and is slowly starting to ask for the various software games that I bought for it.

I would not recommend this item to anybody. Don't even THINK about trying the digital camera you can buy as an accessory for $40. The pictures are terribly unclear and fuzzy. I say put your money into a Gameboy or Leap pad. This is a terribly outdated toy and not worth $5.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old. She has not put it down for two days. It is a fun toy to play with. However it is not very educational.

It still is a little advanced for my three year old, but I will probably get him one in a year or too. If your child loves to play on the computer, write, and draw. This toy is great for them.

This is music that motivates you to love life, and is very sensitive and ceremonial.'Hero's Wedding' should be played at real weddings everywhere!

It's hard to believe that there can be such a big difference between two products. The American Gardener (AG)sheer is twice as sharp and twice as fast as the B&D.; It will even cut through mondo grass and other tough stemmed plants. It is great for trimming spring growth from bushes, and even helped shape a tangelo tree and three privets.The battery life - considering the speed - a remarkable 45-50 minutes and if that isn't tghe kicker, the AG is comfortable, lighter and seemingly more ergonomic than the B&D.;Even though there is no way to lock these shears (or any others) in an \\"on\\" position, it still deserves five stars.

Yes, I have to bend over to use them, but they are sharp, fast and easy to use. And I have even used them to create a small trench between the yard and cool deck by cutting the grass down very low to allow water to run along there.The only thing that would be more helpful, is if a set of longer blades came with it to trim small bushes.Other than that, I would highly recommend them for trimming around the yard.

The two men had a real empathy for each other, and their playing is always inventive and sharp. SIMPLE WALTZ is a blues waltz that goes from medium to up tempo and is anything but simple when the two leaders start trading fours; the ending is a gas and \\"amen\\" to that. GREEN STAMPS is another up-tempo blues. Pianist Roger Kellaway is a magician at the keyboard: one minute he's swinging like Teddy Wilson, the next he lays down a Monkian run that would impress even Thelonious. Perhaps the best track is THE KING, a swing classic that everyone here just eats up.

Consider this product to be a disposable item, mine lasted for less than 6 months. The cheap potentiometer used for the volume control seems to be the culprit, and it's a shame that Klipsch does not own up to this problem and upgrade the part. Since other Klipsch speakers share what appear to be identical volume control knobs, this problem has turned me off to all Klipsch powered-speaker products.Save yourself a lot of aggravation and look elsewhere. The M-Audio AV30 is a nice alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage can fillers.","review":"They seemed pretty good in the beginning. Within a year they started with the crackling and rose to near-ear-piercing crackling when the TV went on or off. Not long after that, one speaker died.

The static was very noticeable. Now, one speaker has stopped working. Very poor quality. Ended up very disappointed. I will try the Creative T40 as a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded great at first, now they're pretty useless","review":"When I first got these, they sounded great. Shortly after the one year warranty, I noticed that only one speaker was playing sometimes. I thought it was my imagination at first, because it seemed to alternate as to which speaker wouldn't be working. Also noticed the crackling any time you touch the knobs. I don't really use the volume knob since computers can adjust the sound, but the volume knob now appears to cause sound to alternate between the two speakers as you adjust the volume. When you stop turning the volume knob, you sometimes end up with stereo sound, but mostly just sound from one speaker. These still sound great when they work right, but Klipsch should be ashamed to have their name on these. I have some $10 computer speakers that have worked for fine for 7 or 8 years, you would think Klipsch could make some pretty high quality speakers for $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knobs are faulty","review":"AS with some others mentioned, these speakers developed problems with the control knobs and have made the speakers unusable.

The Promedia speakers sounded as if someone had left a reverb control on, and Midrange lead vocals were almost non-existent. The cable connection between the speakers stayed loose despite best efforts and one speaker kept fading in and out. I plugged in my old static-ridden radio shack speakers to the same source, same song and they sounded ok. I plugged in the Klipsch Igroove and it sounded ok. (Ok being no reverb and with clear lead vocals.) Tried several songs, same result. So either these were defective or they are just a waste of money.

These sounded great when I first got them, but gradually a crackling developed when I adjusted the volume. The left speaker is almost completely useless now. I have to turn the volume knob very carefully to very specific points to even get it to play, and even then I get crackling and lousy sound.

But these computer speakers are junk.It was only a few months before these speakers started popping, cutting out, dropping one channel or the other, and crackling when the volume was adjusted. A few months of that, and the only way I could get any sound out of them at all was to turn the volume all the way up. A few months after that they stopped working completely. Sure, during the short time they worked, they sounded great, but that's not much consolation for me now.I suspect that most of the positive reviews written below are from people who just bought these speakers.

I will not buy Klipsch products again.For their size and price these speakers deliver impressive sound and are attractive as well. However, Klipsch puts a cheap volume control potentiometer in these units resulting in loud static and sound cut-out when the knob is turned. This started to be a minor nuisance about a year after purchase but has now become a major nuisance. Often no sound comes out of the left speaker until the volume knob is vigorously jiggled and then it is usually at only a low volume. (Also, a foot came off one of the speakers soon after purchase but was easily glued back on)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of These Speakers!!!","review":"I had a very similar experience to \\"W. Bailey\\" and \\"Phillip Crosby\\" below. There is a fundamental flaw in the design. The sound on the secondary speaker will get very shaky (i.e., play inconsistently). Minor fiddling with the on/volume knob will restore the sound temporarily, but slowly and surely, the connection to the secondary speaker will become gradually more and more tenuous until you are pretty much left with only one functioning speaker. Again, given the similar experiences of other reviewers, I strongly suspect this is a fundamental flaw in design. In sum, AVOID THESE SPEAKERS if you want them to last more than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for less than a year","review":"I've had these for less than a year. Very light use. I've never cranked them up real loud or had the bass up too high. Same probs as everyone else that has owned them for around a year. Sound is terrible now. Completely distorted.

When I first got this set of speakers, I was amazed at the sound quality and bass coming out of these two speakers. However, very soon after using them, the bass kept going in and out, leaving only the high frequency sound to come out. Only after fiddling with the bass knob would the bass come back, but even then the bass would frequently cut out. After much frustration, I sent the speakers back for a refund. I didn't want to deal with another set and possibly having another poorly constructed speaker set.Don't get me wrong, these speakers are AMAZING, as far as sound quality, however, the construction is very poor and needs much work. If you are able to get a hold of a quality constructed version of these speakers, then by all means, you should get these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up From Bose","review":"I've always been a Bose man; Until now!! Recently I purchased a pair of Bose Companion 2's and took them back the same day.

The variable base control is not a luxury, it's mandatory in accomodating various media environments encountered over the Internet. Crisp, clean highs and midrange delivery is far superior to their Bose Companion 2 counterpart. The bass, though not rumbling, is deep and bouncy.Overall, I would say that these speakers will satisfy most discernable listners who have a need for satisfactory production over a wide range of media.Sincerly,Robert K Walcott"},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept; poor execution.","review":"I had high hopes for these speakers, largely due to the Klipsch reputation.

I turned up the volume and both speakers were loud with static. The silent speaker worked again, but as you turn the speakers down to a level that allows for normal conversation, one speaker will again go silent. It's a chronic issue. I've put up with it for the past year and a half or so. I have not tried the fix as detailed by Kid Rage in an earlier review (thanks, Kid!).

Bottom line is they sound great out of the box, but aren't built to last. Like a lot of other reviewers, mine developed a problem with crackling and static in less than a year. It's not a problem if you don't mind leaving your speakers on 24/7 and never adjusting the volume/bass.

I thought they MIGHT sound pretty good, but Wow! They are every bit as good as the first reviewer says, with full, rich sound that fills an entire room and then some. I was also looking at the Bose iPod thing, but for $200 less(!), the sound from these Klipschs was every bit as good as the Bose Pod Dock. No remote, but I can deal with that.Note the sound is rich and full at all volume levels, not just cranked up. And cranked up -- whoa -- keep the windows closed! Bass adjustment is nice, too. Only adjustment I made was changing equalizer settings on certain iTunes albums, which is something I needed to do anyway. Klipsch has been making speakers since I believe the '40s, and their attention to HIGH-quality sound at an affordable price is evident here. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounded great until they died LOUDLY","review":"These sounded pretty good, and they lasted oh, about a week beyond the end of the warranty. Then they intermittently produced bursts of FULL VOLUME static and digital processor hash sound, seemingly whenever they wanted to.

The company was no help at all ... suggested we buy another pair to replace them.

The sound of these speakers is outstanding for the price, but the quality is abysmal. I, like so many others, found that these speakers inevitably go down hill over time. The volume and bass controls get noisy. The scratchiness gets progressively worse until the left channel quits working all together. You can fix the problem by taking the speaker apart and cleaning the control, but the problem soon returns. The connections on the back go bad as well. If you read the forums on the Klipsh website you see the same story over and over.Mine went in the trash. I feel like I wasted $100 and the land fill just got a little deeper. I hate the waste of it. I gladly would have paid $150 dollars for the same speaker built to last. When I replace my home theatre speakers, guess which brand I won't consider.People who write reviews about these speakers while new love them.

Before morons like Limp Biskit and Linkin Park ruined the rap/rock genre, this was probably the best all-around album of its kind, up there with the first couple Rage Against the Machine records. Standouts include what I consider Helmet's best song ever, \\"Just Another Victim,\\" which is really two songs cut in half, with House of Pain borrowing the riff to make the latter minutes into great old-school hip hop. Slayer and Ice-T, Cypress Hill with Pearl Jam (the latter whom I usually HATE), and a brilliantly disturbing teaming of Faith No More and Boo-Yaa Tribe for \\"Another Body Murdered\\" (the first FNM song recorded after they fired original guitarist Jim Martin) are among the tightest and most intense here.

Norton tries to make a connection with the Salem hysteria and wars with the Indian's in Maine.

It is not as thrilling and easy to read as some other histories of the event (such as the re-released Francis Hill book) but looking at the conflict on the frontiers of the territories with the Indians and its impact on pushing the witchcraft crisis to greater heights will interest those who have read other accounts. The fit is not always perfect but it does give one much to consider.

The cover emphasizes Maxwell's name but was mostly written by the co-author...so I found it somewhat misleading.

The Visitation for which the book is named is incidental in the book and goes nowhere. Characters come in and out of the protagonists' lives with no rhyme or reason and do not affect any change in the characters (in particular, the Virgin Mary has no immediate or apparent affect on the two main characters's lives). They serve no purpose. Characters who could be interesting are left behind with no further storyline. The story takes many directions only to not develop any and instead go on yet another direction. This could have been a coming of age story, it could have been comic, it could have been compelling, unfortunately, it is none of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, weak execution","review":"The book begins strongly, and there were some very Catholic moments.

Although Weldon and Reidy share a New Zealand heritage, their similarities stop there. The premise of the book is hilarious -- the Virgin Mary decends to Earth to spread the Good News of contraception and sexual tolerance -- but the execution is mildly amusing at best. The author spends far too much time in the third quarter of the book focusing NOT on the teenaged daughters' various forms of sexual awakening, but instead languishes over the family strife caused it. And although I love feminist/pagan literature (and was raised Catholic, to boot) the tree-hugging ending was just too implausible for belief. An enjoyable--yet strangely flawed--work that desperatley needs a stronger editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not novel material","review":"I was deceived by the comment on the cover from Fay Weldon, whose work I have enjoyed in the past.

Molly's life was gradually embellished into legend even in her own lifetime and through her own telling, so it is appropriate that the book takes her dramatic flair to extremes with the Mississippi River story, a yarn Ms. Blos invented. Now that the 1997 movie has renewed the interest in Titanic and endeared her character to a generation of teens, this book is a good version of her great American legacy, in-a-nutshell, for the younger kids.

It goes by the name of Ginger of Paris, and yes, she does have an adorable French accent, but don't let this mislead you. She's a spectacularly good dancer, and far more important for my purposes, a spectacularly good teacher. Everything is repeated at least five times--very slowly, then up to tempo. The teacher faces forward--just like in a real tap class--and you move up from the most basic shuffle to the wow-the-folks-at-home shim-sham. I learned this all in a couple of lessons, and now can I not only keep up with my classmates, but truth be told--I'm probably even better.SaraQueens, N.Y."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money or your time!","review":"Wow, is this an awful video-- the quality is poor, the dance INSTRUCTION is minimal. You are supposed to mimic and somehow magically \\"get\\" it. Not a chance for beginners! I am a former dancer and have never seen anything with so little instruction. Yes, Ginger tells you-- in a VERY thick accent that is difficult to understand sometimes-- about the steps. Yes, she demonstrates them. But she doesn't really give you tips on VERY important aspects of dancing-- such as balance, timing (other than counting out things-- we need tips here, lady), body position, arm position. And quite honestly, I was apalled at her own lack of grace and balance. Yuck. Do not waste your time or money. Check out Bonnie Franklin's \\"I Hate to Exercise, I Love to Tap\\" if you want clear, fun, fluid dance. Franklin knows how to make tap enjoyable and simple without making you look like it's amateur hour.

It introduces some basic essential steps as well as a version of the Shim Sham routine that is nearly identical to version taught by my tap instructor.The excercises are clear and easy to follow and are repeated several times for practice. Each is presented in a seperate chapter that is accessible from the main menu so you can easily select the parts you want, and create a workout of whatever length you desire.Most importantly, the video gets quickly to the menu with minimal introduction; likewise the chapters focus on the excercises without unecessary or lengthy explanations. This is important, because when you are using the DVD for continued practice over the course of weeks or months, you will not want to have to wait through long intro scenes or a lot of extra stuff that you already have learned - you just want to get to the excercise. That is what this video does."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst DVD ever","review":"My husband and I think this is so bad real bad....can'r beleive she's a teacher......Tap dance made easy is the best...I am new Ginger please explain the steps...what the heck is a shuffle to a beginner....Oh I see you want me to quess....save your money folks"},{"rating":"1","title":"20\\" drill press","review":"This 20\\" drill press will last for years.

It is one hunk of cast iron that was made in China.

After installing the chuck I loaded a drill bit and then placed piece of wood on the side of the chuck and tapped it with a hammer until the drill bit spun in perfect center. I hope this review helps...good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product and poor customer service","review":"The first drill press that I received from Grizzly was defective: the adjustment lever for the belts was stuck and the drill made terrible noises when turned on. Grizzly was very slow in responding to my many inquiries (with no 1-800 number for customer service)and, after repackaging and returning the defective drill press and more than a month from my initial order, I received another drill press. Upon opening the box, however, I found a dent on the housing surrounding the belts. What a mess! If I knew then what I know now, I would never have ordered this drill press. Think twice before ordering this item.Buy something local."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned of this from Little House books...","review":"One of the Little House books referred in passing that Ma would read to Pa from this book. It's a good read; there are themes of money/corruption, family ties, and reputation, but at the same time, it's really a lot like a soap opera in that characters will often maddeningly not see what is right in front of them, (but as we all know, that's precisely what keeps people hooked on a soap opera.) I'm not normally a fiction reader, and most times I pass fiction books on to the thrift store when I am done, but this one is on my shelf to re-read at some future time. A good snowy day book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, poor formatting","review":"It's a good story, but don't waste your money on the Kindle edition. It's full of formatting errors and whole chunks of the text are actually missing. You'll be in the middle of a scene between two characters, and the next line skips ahead to the following chapter. I gave it one extra star because the book itself is very good and has an entertaining plot, but until a better electronic copy is made, I would stick to the bound editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect yourself in the water","review":"Surfing is fun, but it is also dangerous.

This book contains a wide selection of his writings, clear-eyed, wsitty, biting, compassionate. Excerpts from his two meoirs have the quality of what Frank McCourt wrote 50 years later in Angela's Ashes. Allen, we see, was the father of contemporary comedy and his influence prevails today. Letterman, Carson, Bob & Ray, Keillor, Your Show of Shows, Sat. Night Live - all are arguably\\u0003 legatees of his original sparkling style. This is perhaps the most deeply funny book I've read in years and will bring joy to readers of all ages. And it's a perfect gift for young people to give to parents and in-laws who, if they remember, say, tyhe Dionne Quintupl;ets, will be thrilled to get to oknow the great wit Fred Allen again. If there were 10 stars, I would award them to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspirational Reading","review":"This is a good read. Well thought out and written.

I thought, you know, baby wash, you can use it for the body and for shampoo. For the body, it's fine. But seriously, it made my scalp dry and itchy. I think it was fine for my daughter's hair. I thought it would be like Johnson and Johnson baby wash, usable for both hair and body.Finally, I just CAN'T STAND the strong smell of the baby wash. I think that's what did it for me. I've grown to hate the strong smell. I bought it because I like lavender, but it's all Tea Tree. Tea tree is just TOO strong, I mean come on, they recommend that you put drops of Tea Tree essential oil in your own homemade cleaning supplies.Ok, that's it.

They are so much better now, plus, my whole skeleton just feels better. Now they're also saying this stuff helps with mood swings.

The first 2 seasons the Fresh Prince of Bel Air was finding its feet as a show and the characters were being defined. The third season the show was in the zone. When it aired it was regularly in the top 20 shows in the ratings. There are some hilarious episodes in this 24 episode box set.

Disc 1, 2 & 3 were scratched up so bad it looked like someone took a knife & slashed them up!

It has a great plot and is definitly worth the money. You always want to know what happends next. The main characters: The mysterious Rei Ayanami, The quiet Shinji Ikari, and Misato. The DVD is also good, because it is subtitled and you can compare what they say in japanese and English. I would definitly reccommend it to any anime fan. It is a mecha type anime and not so much in the way of love. Has alot of action and some disturbing images later on in the series. (Don't worry not as many as most anime) But overall good, but the ending is really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different.

First off, the previews are at the beggining of the DVD (just like Gasaraki). Plus, for all those who hate replacing the Kanji with subtitles, yours prayers have been answered. The original Kanji is back with subtitles. For some, this is good, but for me, its not. The only reason I gave this DVD 5 stars is because the subtitles are easier to read now. That, and the fact that I can still watch my favorite anime in Spanish and French. Bio include Rei, Gendo, Kaji, Auska, Angel 5 and Angel 6. This new DVD will make those familiar with the VHS version feel right at home. And the episodes? Seeing that little fashing moment on the ship in episode 8 was the most hilarious gag I have ever seen in Evangelion.

I replaced the v-belt and it is now working better although I'm still getting quite a bit of vibration. I also noticed the 5 step cone motor pulley was wobbling; probably the cause of most of the vibration. I'm going to live with what I have now and when I decide to change the motor out, I'm going to put in machined pulleys taboot. Although this DP is a piece of junk, it does have some potential if the right equipment and replacement parts are put in it. Seeing that the higher end Radial DP that Grizzly puts out is $545, I could get a new motor and some machined pulleys and I'll probably break even."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product, Poor Service","review":"Generally poorly made and inaccurate.

These units take a pair of AA batteries, which I think are too low power -- in the past I have seen similar units powered by twin \\"C\\" or \\"D\\" batteries. Perhaps this is why when we put these on our Christmas wreath and turned them on, the batteries were spent within 60 to 90 minutes.

I use this book as the first monograph assignment in my introduction to women's studies course. Although the book has a strong theoretical framework, the descriptive examples in the chapters help to facilitate discussion in the class, which really sets the tone for the rest of the semester.

It is now, itself, though, a dated book. Internet and media's impact on \\"Our Girls\\" have left this book in the dust. While it still may be read for Brumberg's personal perspective into the transformation out of the Victorian mentality, and through the sexual and feminism movements of the 1900's, the book is neither objective nor very relelvent to our country's diverse cultural makeup today. Unfortunately, from the time I read the title, through each chapter subtitle, I was left with unfulfilled expecations.

She does not claim to have all the answers, but rather asks all the right questions -- a necessary first step in a dialogue.

Is it a must read? yes. Take everything as gospel? Definitely not. Grasp the essential teachings? You should.It's clear that the author took a long time writing this book, and the levels of optimism throughout the writing show.In short? Yes, buy it, because the content that is worth grasping is worth much more than the price.

This book didn't really tell me much more than to be obnoxious in demanding what you want. While the squeaky wheel gets the oil, why be obnoxious to a low level representative of the company? If you don't like how you are being treated, take your business and money elsewhere. This book just taught how to be a whiny, obnoxious customer, until the company caves in and you get what you want. How about some constructive advice instead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a calling for consumers to fight back.","review":"This is a book that gives advice to consumers on how to take action against the bad service and lack of quality in our economy. It's a cry for consumers to stop being sheep and start being tigers. It is a how-to-guide for consumers to start to fight back.

It has given our daughter a book of her own that has the words \\"adopt\\" and \\"birth mother\\" in a context that is warm and entertaining. She loves the book and at least once every week she picks it out for story time.

I've read the book a mere two weeks before our own call came and read it again upon returning home with our new son. I found so many similarities between the book and our own experience it brought tears to my eyes. It's a book I would love to share with my son when he is a little older. Any adopted child who has ever wondered \\"How did I come to be with you?\\" will be enriched by the magic this book conveys.

The illustrations are great fun for the parents and will keep this book as one of your child's favorites as they grow older and can understand the humor. No adoption story is going to echo your exact experience, but it is important that your child understand that there are as many different adoption stories as there are people in the world. We adopted our daughter through domestic adoption, but I am sure to read my daughter stories about international adoptions, too. Only reading to her about domestic adoptions would be like telling her the only country that exists in the world in the United States.

This book would not be appropriate in a family where there are both natural and adopted siblings, since it doesn't deal with the common belief that adoption is \\"second best\\" to having a child of one's own. Ms. Curtis deserves credit for trying to write about this complex subject from a child's perspective, but by ignoring the negative aspects of adoption, she's missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise.. surprise.","review":"I was taken by surprise by the subject matter of the book. I was not aware the book was about an adopted child.I wanted to give it as part of a Christmas gift for my grandchild who lives out of state, but only read it when it arrived for shipment to her.

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on!","review":"This is so ridiculous. Do we think that children are idiots? Obviously the author has little or no insight into the experience of children. What did she write this while rehearsing her strip tease for TRUE LIES? Perhaps her nanny ghost wrote it. This book infantalizes infants and gives a \\"cutesy\\", nauseating response to questions that are really more complex.

My daughter loves when we read this one together. Curtis captures very well the magic of that first night and those first few days. She does it so well that any child can appreciate this book, regardless of how their family was put together. This book, naturally, had my daughter asking about the night she was born, over and over. Eventually, she asked me to make a story book for her about the night she was born. She was so inspired by this book! We put together her book with her favorites parts of her first few days, scrapbook style. Now, we read both books together. These magic moments are why we want to become parents to begin with!

This isn't just because of its frequent nudity or its interesting battles, it's also because it has colorful, likeable characters and a very creative premise. Honey, able to change from one female form to another at will, has near-limitless means of trouncing her opponents, but she's not indestructible and part of the fun comes from how she figures her way out of certain sticky messes.The DVD is low on extras but the picture and sound quality are excellent and it's great to have all the episodes in one package. The English dub isn't the best I've ever heard but since there is the option of watching it in Japanese with subtitles I'm not complaining. This is a good collection and it's a shame there were never more episodes released. Cutey Honey is a fun and funny series that leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it!","review":"I'm having a hard time even watching this Anime!

I admit it isn't the best, but it wasn't the poorest either. I have heard much worse. Well, it is at least better in sound and picture quality than the VHS version, which is what you really want anyway. Overall, the anime series is hilarous and provides plenty of fan service, if you like that sort of thing, and a lot of action, and I don't mean of the fan service kind. If you were dissapointed in the quality of the VHS version, pick up this one, it is definately a step up. For those of you who like to see women in skippy outfits in serious cat fights, sexual hijinks and a heartwarming love story, screw the mushy stuff, pick it up for the cat fights and sexual hijinks. Honey Flash! Sorry, I just couldn't resist the temptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime By Master Go Nagai","review":"Go Nagai is one of the best animator's alive, and Cutey Honey is one of his most fun series to watch. Honey is a beautiful android who is able to change into many forms. She reminds me of Naomi Armitage in that she feels very deeply for other humans. Her nemesis is Dolmeck, ruler of the dark world. He controls various demonic creatures that pose as normal humans, and Honey must battle these demons in pretty much every episode. Beautifully done, with a great sense of humor. If you enjoy Cutey Honey, then check out Kekko Kamen or Hanappe Bazooka. If you want more serious anime, then buy the Devilman DVD! He is also responsible for Mazinger and Getter Robo, for you fans of Robotech, Macross and Gundam. I would highly recommend getting as many of his videos and DVDs as possible. They are all very different and unique with great storytelling and animation!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey Flash!","review":"This collection is the better alternative to buying the more expensive single discs separately. I love Cutey Honey. I had the original VHS tapes years ago and was glad that a collection of the eight episodes had finally been released. The extras on the DVDs include cosplay performances and interviews with the voice actresses.Sadly the number of episodes belies an unfinished work. I have a feeling Go Nagai wanted a continuing series, but never got around to making it so.

Nokama, Toa-Metru of Water, was my first Toa-Metru and it remains my favorite. Unlike the first edition of Nokama, the wise villager, this Nokama is bigger, better and all around...COOLER! My favorite part is Nokama's mask. It, to me, looks like a giant bubble. There are (what look like) scales on her forhead and gills on each side.

To me, that's an indication of a great memoir--that by the end you feel you have taken the journey as well, and that the author is as familiar as a good friend. Lucky for me, I came to know Rita before I even knew her book existed. I have taken four classes with Rita as my teacher, and I'm about to start my fifth. I didn't learn how to write from Rita, but I learned what it meant to write while in her classes, and the improvement in my work after studying with her is obvious. All the attention to detail and care and insight that she poured into her story, she pours into her teaching, and I can't praise her writing or her teaching enough. I'm fortunate to have been exposed to both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and tedious... I couldn't wait to put it down!","review":"Ugh... another whiny memoir about a dysfunctional family. I would not have finished this book had it not been for my book club.The author, instead of understanding the hardship of taking on a child that is not yours, constantly blames her aunt for all the horrible things in her life. Perhaps she should have blamed her father who completely abandoned her? Or perhaps she should have look at her Aunt Daisy as someone who literally worked her fingers to the bone to put the author into the best schools she could.Is the reader really supposed to feel for the author when her Aunt Daisy has to take livestock and kill it for food? Or how about when she is able to take lessons at a private dance camp because she helps clean? I had to clean a hair salon every Saturday for four weeks to get a free haircut, should I write a memoir?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is amazing","review":"This book is phenomenal. I've been reading memoirs all spring (jeanette walls, ruth reichl, etc.), and this one is my favorite so far because it's not just a story about personal tragedy and triumph, but also a well-articulated look at a very complicated, conflicted time in American history. Her story is startling and heartbreaking, and I'm excited to talk to other people who have read it, because it's the kind of thing you can't not have an intense personal reaction to. This one will be AWESOME for book clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo to Rita!","review":"I have passed this book on to my 14 year old daughter. It is a \\"coming of age\\" book that she'll enjoy.

Even if the picture disappeared, this product is still very good. I have greased the door a couple more times and it's easier each time.

In came Mandy Meyer (who??), a respectable guitarrist with a lot of edge to his playing, but caught in the middle of Asia's worst album till date, when Weton and Downes struggled hard to write pop songs who could mantain their sales above the platinum status!! So, all spontainety was gone, and the result was an album with a handful of great songs (GO, VOICE OF AMERICA and the best, ROCK AND ROLL DREAM), but all of them going towards unashamed pop-glam-hair-American-AOR music (Ufa!!). The logical conclusion was that the band closed operations after this thud."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third is A Turd","review":"Asia mispelled the title of this album, omitting the second \\"s\\" in ASStra. That's what this album sounds like. After the first two records, this album should not have even reached the streets. Voice of America is an awful song, as is Rock n Roll Dream! Okay, John Wetton has never been one for imaginative lyrics, but the songs on this album bring him down further. I think that, had the band waited a year or two and really focused on this album, it would've been a lot better. \\"Hard On Me\\" is a great song. Pure pop, it should've been a big hit. But, I mean, what is Countdown to Zero, or Suspicion? Go was a lame attempt at mimicing Van Halen's Jump. Carl even says so in his book Applied Rhythms, released by Modern Drummer press.

The glaring absence of Steve Howe is virtually devastating to the effort as a whole. The overwrought, cheesy synth-driven tunes, as good as some of them are, could have been dramatically improved with the addition of Mr. Howe's guitar wizardry. I realize he was out of the group by this time, but you'd have thought they would have at least attempted to duplicate his sound here and there. That being said, there are some good songs here and overall it's worth a listen to. I'm pretty pumped to hear their new cd \\"Phoenix\\". The samples I've heard so far are promising. Here's hoping Steve Howe gets his due on the new album and returns Asia to the original sound that made them a household name in 1982!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOing mainstream!","review":"ASTRA is nothing more than ASIA going totally mainstream, losing all the force of their magical debut, ASIA.Of course, all the musicians involved here are highly talented and we have some few decent tunes.

It seems they were written by a pop metal band.Also, with the exit of Steve Howe, keyboards here are more predominant than ever, suffocating the guitar.It's not a great album, no way. But the tunes are so commercial that you can listen to it wihtou being \\"hurt\\" by it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspicion? No just a great album","review":"I have a suspicion,when they invitied Wetton back for the 3rd Asia album, Steve Howe was out of there fast. He should have stayed, this is the best writing of the first 3 records and Mandy Meyer (remember Krokus?) does a good job on the heavy metal rhythm guitars.Go - Voice Of America - Wishing - Countdown To Zero - Suspicion - Rock And Roll Dream - After The War ...are all among their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing , Hoping","review":"the first five years in the career of Asia were the best , Astra is their last classic release and Wishing is perhaps their best song and ironically one of the most overlooked in the bands discography , however Astra is a unique collection of tracks full of progression , orchestation, innovation and contemporary 80s pop.HM"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LAST GREAT ASIA ALBUM!","review":"I also bought ASTRA back in late 1985 when it came out and I too was happy with the results. I loved side one: GO, VOICE OF AMERICA, HARD ON ME, WISHING, ROCK AND ROLL DREAM. But I didn't love side two (tracks 6-10) as much. Though I liked TOO LATE, LOVE NOW TILL ETERNITY & AFTER THE WAR. The sound quality is a bit thin and washy, very eighties, but okay. I would also like to hear the first few albums remixed to sound better, updated. It is some of the finest music recorded in eighties, along with Yes and Deep Purple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see hear so move on","review":"If only you could judge a record by its cover. If that was the case this would be a good record, but unfortunately it isn't. The first thing that becomes apparent to the listener is the new guitar sound. I'm sorry but it just doesn't fit in. Steve Howe's guitar work was perfect for Asia. But the new guitarist (sorry, I can't remember his name and is it even important) just doesn't have the same warmth and feel in his playing like Howe. What's worse is the lyrics sound forced and the song writing is just plane lousy. All of the bombastic chords and calm interludes are present on the record but without any good melodies the songs just don't go anywhere. If you continue to listen to the entire cd without hitting the skip button once, besides performing a miracle, you will continue to sit on the edge of your seat hoping for Asia to redeem themselves yet they never do. If you are a big Asia fan I would say give it a try. You may like it. But don't let your hopes up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asia&#65533;s best album","review":"On the band's third album... and last \\"real\\" album if you ask me... the musicians really add something to their futuristic rock well-known from the first two albums.Take e.g. the gloomy arrangement of Countdown To Zero, or the nearly rhapsodic Voice Of America which is probably Asia's biggest hit ever. My personal favourite Asia song of all times is the closing track After The War in which the arrangement combining rock and orchestral instruments creates a true symbiosis with the theme of the song.This is the best album Asia has released and will ever release. Today, the line-up is almost completely changed, and believe me: not for the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Crisis review by master duelist Hunter R","review":"Dark Crisis is a great pack for experienced duelists (like me), Dark Crisis has some of the best cards in the game,(Judgement of Anubis,Blast held by a tribute,Reflect Bounder,Vampire Lord),and many more.

One of an endless string of interchangeable British action series, The Baron was the first live action UK show that premiered in color and starred a Texan who fought crime with his handsome assistant until American networks said \\"Give us a broad\\" and they dumped the guy in favor of a glamorous female sidekick.

The game is much like \\"Damacy\\", in that the aim of the game is to roll things up with your Katamari. However, the format is a bit different, in that, instead of rolling things up entirely for the King of All Cosmos, you are rolling things up for your \\"fans\\". The story is also about the life and childhood of the King of All Cosmos, as opposed to a random family.The game has much of the same charm and overall weirdness of \\"Damacy\\".

Let's just say, over the past month, since I got this game, it is the ONLY game I have played. That is very, very rare for me to only play one game.

Gameplay is nearly identical, which is good because that's not something that needed improvement. The levels are similar, with similar visuals, but it feels more expansive overall.

The pause is long enough to screw up any posed shots (someone thinks the picture was taken and moves) and forget action shots.If anyone moves, the picture gets a blur. Oh and let's not forget that sometimes parts of the picture seem blurry even without anyone having moved.I can't wait to find a better deal on a camera and get rid of this one.

After receiving it and reading it I realized its a bit strong. This book goes into detail about the actual act of intercourse and what happens. A more immature perspective on it rather than just the facts. It gives a poor description at that. I am not one that shys away from talking about this subject with my children, and this book gives a poor decription of it all. I would rather give my kids the facts and a more christian background and explanation on birds and the bees.

At ages 4 and 7, this is beyond their years for a need to know. I am glad I read it at the book store before buying it. I couldn't believe all the great reviews it had. Maybe for a 10 year old (or older) but not for young kids IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"Seriously? In my opinion, it's plain and simply just stupid.

I would rather have my kids understand the process in a respectful way and let them figure out what it feels like after they are married- it won't be difficult. I will never ever ever share this book with my kids. I couldn't even read it with a straight face- my husband and I just looked at each other and said, \\"what?!?! um, no.\\" I am not trying to make \\"the talk\\" fun and full of laughs with weird cartoon anatomy tacked on,...

After reading the science texts and much discussion about values I read this book to my students. The reaction varies. Some giggle, others are calm, others close their eyes. The book enables me to place the act of sex in a context they have some familiarity with while the textbooks put sex in a back closet of a doctor's office; both have their place in my course.Additionally, I used this book with my young sons and I also found my father reading it. I think it is very good.RES"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Did I Come From","review":"When my children (now 34 &32) were beginning to ask the \\"questions\\" I purchased many books on the subject. This was by far the best.

A must have for all parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back.","review":"As a mental health counselor I couldn't see sharing this book with the parents or young clients that I work with so I had to send it back. The writing style and pictures are geared towards young children, but the explicit details provided are more appropriate for the preteen years. For example the feelings of sexual intercourse and orgasm are describe as tickles and sneezing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I remember I first read the other book, \\"What's Happening to Me\\" by the same author when I was about 10 or11 years old, and though I already knew where I came from, I was curious about this book. I remember it hadgraphic descriptions about the physical sensations of sex and graphic, goofy-looking cartoons having intercourse.These things were creepy and made me uncomfortable. I think it is inappropriate to be telling andshowing little kids things like that. To be honest I am glad I was a bit older when I stumbled across itand not a little, little kid (like 4 yr old) because then I would be REALLY creeped out. Little kids onlywant to know the mechanics and biology of it, that is all they really need to know. I'm sure there areother books out there in this day and age that focus more on that. I wouldn't recommend this weird bookat all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is ridiculous","review":"The illustrations are silly which is fine for younger kids but the approach is even sillier and doesn't work for teens or young kids. Unless you really think describing sexual intercourse in its entirety as \\"wiggling around\\" is doing the subject justice.\\"What's The Big Secret? Talking About Sex\\" was much more informative and better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have the talk WITHOUT this book!","review":"I ordered this book to use for \\"the talk\\" with our 8-year old daughter. I did not like the content or the style it was written. It went way to far with describing what intercourse and orgasms feel like. The chubby, silly-looking, naked man and woman maybe be age appropriate (although somewhat disturbing), but the content is not suitable for children aged 4-8, as stated. My adult siblings read through the book and couldn't stop laughing. I wish I would have read through the reviews on amazon before I ordered the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a classic... not for the squeamish!","review":"Purchased this for our nine-year-old daughter.

What child in their right mind wouldn't want to go and test out all of the \\"feelings\\" that you describe. Are these feelings really necessary to the scope of the book? And the graphic description of the sex act...why don't you just write porn? However, my biggest complaint with this book is that it is not age specific. I found it in the K-6 section of my bookstore. I suggest you specify 12 and up and take out some of your references such as \\"tingly,\\" \\"in and out,\\" etc. What you as an author feel when you have sex is not scientifically necessary! If you want to write for children and expect parents to buy...CLEAN IT UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where did I come from?\\"","review":"\\"Too much information\\" is an understatement. I gave this book a one star because there was nothing lower. I consider this book very inappropriate for children. If you are trying to raise your children with morals and values and not to do what \\"feels good\\" skip this book and try another. Children emulate what they see. A cartoon picture of a man on top of woman having sex is something unexpected in a childrens book and better kept at the adult book store.Thanks for sharing, but no thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Did I Come from?","review":"I have a 7 year old who has been asking a lot of questions about how babies are made so after reading the reviews I thought this was a great age appropriate book. I was extremely disappointed. The book read more like a guide for pedophiles, not a book for young children at all. I might give this book to an older child in their teens, but the graphic descriptions of the actual sex act seemed to almost encourage sex. I feel that it left the reader feeling like, \\"I want to try that!\\" Not a message to give to small children just learning about sex or even older teens maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH 411","review":"I purchased this book to help explain the birds and bees to my 9 year old twin girls and prepare them for puberty. I also bought 2 other books. This book, in my opinion, is way too graphic. It goes so far as to expain an orgasm in detail. This is way more information than I wanted to give my young girls. I would say it would be better for older kids, but, it reads very sing songy like it was meant for kids even younger than mine. Try instead,Ready, Set, Grow!: A What's Happening to My Body?

Porn for kids?","review":"This book is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too detailed for kids. They don't need step by step instruction on how sex is done. I am sorry I bought this book. I will not be using it to talk to my daughter. I am unsure as to what I am going to do/use, but it won't be this book. Seriously, I was shocked. Not good, and I am not a prude. There just has to be a better way to explain it to kids without traumatizing them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too graphic","review":"This book is very graphic, the text and pictures. A young child does not need to know this much information. I really disagree when he describes having sex is like being tickled.

Just my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not age appropriate for anybody","review":"This book is definitely not for the ages of 4-8 as it states. Too much information.

I think the BASIC facts should be given to any child, but should NOT go into that \\"it's pleasurable and that the man goes up and down and up and down and gets friction and that they both wriggle and wriggle and it tickles until the man's penis squirts out a going substance called sperm.\\" Are you kidding? this is a highly recommended book? If \\"kids\\" are taught that is pleasurable and tickles etc. do you not think they will be starting sex at an early age? I let 4 of my other friends see this book who also have kids the same age as mine and they too were stunned. They could have left out a lot of stuff in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"This is an outstanding resource for introducing pre-teen children to the subject of sex. It's age appropriate for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best I've found for the subject.","review":"This book of \\"the birds and the bees\\" is lacking in many ways. The overview of anatomy is limited, and not very well explained. There is much discussion of the mechanics and energy expenditure of intercourse, but little attention is paid to fertilization, which is vastly more interesting to my young daughter. I would recommend \\"It's So Amazing\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"The light hearted nature of this book was appealing but it did not offer much factual content. The book could be used as an ice-breaker but certainly not for getting down to the facts of reproduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way!","review":"I am a very open minded (dare I say \\"progressive\\") parent and this book shook the breath out of me! I can't even imagine who would share this book with their child. \\"Where Did I Come From?\\" offers WAY TO MUCH DETAILED INFORMATION to even be considered for an adolescent child. The drawings are dated and grotesque, and will more than likely frighten anyone (child or adult). I ordered \\"What's the Big Secret\\" by Marc Brown at the same time and it is much more appropriate and gives the answers that children are looking for without sharing the \\"gory\\" details and imagry that Peter Mayle has deemed appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to teach the kids HOW to have sex, this is for you","review":"If found this book to be quite offensive in how graphically it approaches sex. It basically teaches a child how to have sex and I'm not interested in teaching my children how to have sex, I want to teach them about it. This books is garabage and is being returned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I bought this book for my children before having read it completely through - and discovered afterwards that I simply cannot bring myself to even let them look at it. The descriptions of body parts, functions, etc. are fine and humorously presented, but is it necessary to go into how \\"nice\\" sex is, with all the description? Especially when there's no accompanying discussion of the responsibilities of sex. This section of the book comes across as having been written by a \\"naughty boy\\" trying to shock. If I could rip out the pages about \\"making love\\" without wrecking the book, I'd like it a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plea From Adult Survivor of Sexual Abuse: Don't Buy Book!!","review":"I was given this book at age 9 by mom to help me understand sex. Here is the scary thing I was being sexually abused by my adult uncle from the age of 3 until I was 12. This book ended up normalize my abuse by relating every day experiences like jumping rope and being tickled to sex! If you think sexually abuse can't happen in your family I am sorry but it can happen to any family. My parents are both teachers and happily married. Our house was nicknamed the \\"Cleaver's\\" by my friends. We went to church on Sunday mornings and both my brother and I sang in the children choir at church. As an adult survivor of sexually abuse I am asking you to not buy this book for your children. Any book that compares sex to childhood activities is not book you should use to teach your children about sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Age Appropriate","review":"I bought this book for my four-year old. The age recommendation is four to eight. The text is entirely too graphic and detailed for children of this age. Parts of the book read like KISS lyrics or soft-porn.

Every year. Then, the show the movie version which has these sperms in top hats and ties. The egg is some sort of a ballerina. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that even when I was an innocent little seven year old, I knew the stuff they were teaching and so did everybody else in the school. Not to mention the pictures are very graphic. They have this naked lady and guy in the same bathtub. So they distract us with these shocking pictures while they try to explain boring stuff like semen? I mean, come on. Give it up. Then, they try to tell us what sex is. They show these two cats purring and and rubbing against each other while romantic accordian music plays. I dunno, if you think you're going to teach someone anything about where they came from, don't use this book. Telling them they came from a stork would sound more convincing than the way they tell it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave this book where it is accessible!","review":"I bought this book long after our children became interested in 'SEX.' Then I just left it lying around for them to read or look at whenever they wanted to. Even the grownups loved to read it. Big mystery brought out in the open. Now, I'm going to loan it to our married children so they will be able to read it to our grandchildren/There is no age limit when it comes to being reminded that love is a very important part of good sex. Be lighthearted and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good basic content but GRAPHIC!","review":"The book has good basics but is too graphic in my opinion to use as a sexual guide for children. I would think that explaining \\"the penis enters the vagina\\" would be adequate but going on to describe the \\"thrusting in and out\\" and orgasm detail to be just too much. What's with the \\"Tickling\\" description? It would seem very confusing to equate sexual feelings with tickling. As a parent, I have tickled my kids, as most of us have. Imagine if after this book your child thought this was sexual in nature!I will pick and choose what info I deem appropriate for my children and leave out the rest.Also- what's with the obesely overweight naked cartoon people in the book? Is this the image you want your children to strive for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"helped shape a healthy image of sex for me","review":"I grew up with this book, actually from very young, before 1 year old. I absolutely know that it was formative in helping shape a healthy image of sex for me. I am now looking forward to sharing it with my baby (under a year old).The negative reviews here about the book being somewhat dated are enlightening to me. Seems like maybe it's time for an updated version of the text and a few of the cartoons. However, I do think that it's still an excellent book for babies and young children as-is. Parents can fill in the blanks and talk about the woman's feelings about sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book to Introduce Sex to Kids.","review":"I got this book for my son when he was 6 or 7. Although his reaction was a \\"whatever\\" kind, I am proud to know that when he and his classmates began really talking about it, he would be able to say \\"I know the truth\\" and not beleive what the other kids say. In addition, he would feel comfortable coming to me, as the person who gave him the true knowledge, and ask any additional questions, if another kid said something really off the wall. Not only is the book appropriate, but it is important in the bonding relationship of parent and child for open communication and not closed offness. Please enjoy this or another similar book with your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular young-reader's sexuality education book - fun!","review":"Uses correct words, simple language, humor, fun and empathy. Cartoonish illustrations.This book is a little dated now - there are some language issues.Topics are covered _very_ briefly. Indeed, since so much is covered so quickly, the book can be a bit confusing. However, the book is extremely good, popular, recommended, easily readable by young readers by themselves, and can provide a good oportunity for education between parents and children. But I'd suggest you also buy another sexuality education book for your child to provide different presentations of this important subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless","review":"I ordered this book to share with my 7-year-old son as it was highly rated on this site. I regret my purchase. For me, right now, I want my child to be more familiar with \\"the plumbing\\" than the emotional side to the act of having a child, and I feel this book went a little too much into that (\\"wriggling so hard you think they're both going to pop\\"). While humor is good, I felt there was a little too much, making the whole act seem silly, as did the illustrations. Everyone needs to go about teaching the topic to their children in their own way.

The definitions are set up outline notes style which I found helpful for crossing back to my notes and putting my own reminders in.The print is very large, which is nice when you have a textbook open along with an aide like this.

There is a section where the author steps through how transactions flow from one financial statement to the next, and it is mostly illegible.

There is much discussion of a powerful new doomsday weapon and many vignettes featuring characters that we have never seen before, do not see again (at least not in this book), and which amount to nothing at all. The ridiculous ending reveals that this is the first installment of a continuing story, but author Diane Duane has not even provided a provocative cliff-hanger to interest us in reading the next installment. Rest assured, if I ever decide to read any further (doubtful), it will be a used edition so that the publisher doesn't see any profit from this sorry excuse for a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a just little disappointing","review":"Hard to believe it's been sixteen years since Duane started this series!

I won't spoil the plot, although there aren't many surprises to speak of. The best news is that there'll be more, and based on the ending of HONOR BLADE I can only hope fore a bit more excitement as things pick up.Duane fans won't be sorry they bought these.

It was winter time when I tried to use it, so I couldn't put it out in the sun like the other reviewer suggests to un-curl it. I thought about using a heat gun on it, but ended up just putting a weight on one end.With this siphon bulb you need to put a finger over the end of the tube when you squeeze the bulb. You need to fill the bulb and tubing with fluid before you take your finger off the end to get it to siphon.In the end I ended up throwing this away and buying a piece of tubing from the hardware store to do it the old fashion way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money for Something Better.","review":"Don't waste your hard earned money on this worthless piece of future recyclable.

Might be a good siphoning concept in this form, but the materials used are better served recycled into something else. I suppose if you make and market a shoddy product and only about half get returned, you still made a tidy bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money look else where.","review":"I purchased this exact product \\" Custom Accessories 36668 TUBE SIPHON PUMP - 6' \\" from a local dealer.Number one issue for me was that the product is not usable in cold weather.The bulb is a plastic material not a softer rubber so on the day I needed to use it when the air temp was about 44F.the siphon bulb was hard as a rock! I have big hands and I could not squeeze it at all.When I did use it on a warmer day the hose barb fittings on the bulb are not air tight and it leaked air.I did get it to work on the second attempt but delivery was very slow and a stream of bubbles indicateda air leak at the fittings at the bulb.Won't use it again.Try the jiggler type siphon, they seam to work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would look for another product","review":"I read the reviews and thought I could deal with this item. So when I received it, I set the curled up tube in a system that would straighted the tubes. However, when released a few day later, it curled right back up. I went to use it today to transfer gas between my truck and a generator. The connection around the pump leaked and I got gas all over myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Tried to prime the siphon for a few minutes without success. Hose stays curled up. If one person held one end of the hose in a liquid and another person held their finger over the other end with squeezing the bulb, one should get the bulb/hose to prime. With the hose size, I'm estimating it would take 2 minutes to siphon one gallon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even the low price!","review":"Even at $4.00 this item is just not worth buying! The clear plastic tubing was pinched from the packaging in so many places that the suction was next to impossible. The pump ball kept detaching from the hose on both ends as well, so this is just not worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"squeeze theapy","review":"I bought this product to drain theoil from the lawnmower grank case. After squeezing the ball nunerous times I got just a little bit of air and no oil. I tried again and again and failed miserably. I think it would be easier sucking feathers out of a pillow. I give this product a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzy","review":"My son purchased this product and was very disappointed with it when he opened up the package. Everywhere the plastic tube was folded in the package, it was kinked and split open. Luckily he found another one at a near by store close to our home. We would not recommend this for anyone to buy. We found out it would cost us more to send it back than what he purchased it for. I think this is one of the first items we have purchased that we were highly disappointed in the quality of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"cheap POS made from China.

Big mistake. Both had the tubing so badly kinked when they arrived that they were unusable, even after trying to soften and fix using warm water.Simply does not work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow flow, tube too rigid","review":"I had this item for about six months before the bulb cracked and leaked. Before that it worked out for my needs in a pinch. That being said, it wasn't convenient or very well designed. The flow from my gas tank (appropriately placed above my target) was limited by the very narrow tubing. The biggest complaint that I have is that the tubing is very rigid and maintains its curl from the packaging. Since it stays curled, you have to hold it in place while the liquid is transferring or else it will pull out of one of the containers. That, combined with the low flow, means that you have to stand there for 15 minutes to empty a 5 gallon container. Annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, crap, crap.....","review":"Do not buy this. Thin hose, plastic!! pump bladder, not rubber. Go to Habor freight tools. I bought 2 from there and they are at least decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Like others said, the curled hose is a problem. The other is the stiffness of the bulb. It's hard rubber so it's very hard to squeeze the bulb to start siphoning. If the air temp is 65 degrees fahrenheit or colder, good luck trying to squeeze the bulb. I would've given this no stars if it was possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money, cheap quality","review":"I kept it for overall uses from garage to other but soon found out it is a cheap quality. The hose is stiff so it kept curling on me (splashing fluid everywhere). The screw-type connectors at the hose ends are cheapy plastic so even if it was really hand tightened, fluid would still leak or at best seep through those weak spots. I guess the only bright spot would be the siphon bulb but even that is stretching it. At this point, I think it got tossed in the trash while cleaning out the garage. Don't say I or the others didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for short term use, but wont last the long hual","review":"We got one of these from Big Lots, it wasn't bad for the price but we didn't get it thinking it'd be long term. With in 6 months the bars on the front to keep the mattress in place started to bend. You can bend them back, but their weakened and will only snap off in a matter of time. Once they break off they leave behind a sharp piece that can damage your mattress, so just leave it bent down or cover the area with some tape to avoid ripping. Sadly once those are gone your mattress wont stay in place very well, I'd suggest getting one of those grip pads to help it stay put.It's not great, but it'll work for a first apartment or dorm. Ours was like $70 for the frame, so when it fully dies in 3 or 4 years it's no huge waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read...","review":"Being a native, I was able to compare the recipes to what I was raised to expect from Neapolitan food, and I was pleased to find the recipes accurate. I would like to see a wider coverage of the food of the region and not just Naples, and as a previous reviewer noted, there are a few mistakes (there always seem to be little flubs in Bugialli's books), but I think it covers the feel of the region much better than Schwartz's book. His handling of such sacred topics as the sfogliatella make for good reading.

There are highs and lows, but you can hear the hard rock of the 60s seguing into the heavy metal of the 70s, with elements of grunge and thrash. At first listen, there's not much range, but it grows on you.This band was understandably compared to Cream; the bass player not only produced most Cream recordings but played on them and co-wrote several of the songs. However, this is more like Grand Funk Railroad or the early Black Sabbath in its straight-ahead approach. There's nothing pretty about West's singing, but he gets the job done.If you like hard rock without too much fuss and feathers, you may enjoy this set, although the one-disc \\"Best of Mountain\\" is a safer bet for those unfamiliar with the group's sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction","review":"This double CD is an excellent introduction to Mountain and the roots of hard rock. Guitarist Leslie West is up there with Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Tony Iommi as one of the founding fathers of HR/HM, and still going strong in 2007. Mountain took the template created by Hendrix and Cream and turned the volume up to 11! Standout tracks include Mississippi Queen and anything from the classic 1971 Nantucket Sleighride album (present in its entirety bar one track on tracks 1-8 Disc 2). Treat yourself to a bit of rock history. Later imitators may have done it louder and faster, but rarely better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"So far it has met my needs.

Deloria proves that although white America has traditionally considered itself as an original and true nation, white Americans have proved less secure about their national identity.

It's pleasant as background music, but for me the recording doesn't hold any surprises, any thrill, or even any particularly memorable moment.

She and Zach travel from Wyoming to Texas to find him. He had promised to marry Carrie. They meet some good and some bad folks along the way. I guess that this is what life was about back then but it sure was tough. I did not like the ending. McCarthy has a way of making you feel for the people he writes about. You almost think you are there with them. A fast moving book, not a shoot out kind, just about family life and how two people and their parents handled it.

The techniques are clearly described and are applied to a number of simple but attractive projects such as single pamphlet books. pillows or cards. The photographs are clear and helpful. I particularly liked the fact that Gwen Diehn went through the clean up process, which is often not covered in much detail, and that she used vegetable oil rather than the more noxious kerosene. Throughout the book are a number of inspiring examples by past and present printmakers which help to extend the processes described. Whilst this book is aimed primarily at beginners, it offers stimulus and information of use to the more experienced printmakers too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your feet wet!","review":"Never took a printmaking class in college...I've been carving erasers and wondering about this new world of relief printing.

The singer tells the listener that he really wants to be there for the listener - even if he doesn't always pay close enough attention. The song can be played as an intro to an apology anytime we goof up and fail to notice something important is happening around us and we are too distracted to notice.

The other reviews have summed up the plot, so I will only say that I found myself touched more than once by the insights of the author (In fact, I found myself choking up on occasion, and I'm not all that easy a pushover). It's a common idea that our actions have effects far beyond what we perceive, but Mel Foster has found a way to make this concept come alive. It may be redundant to say that it's a metaphysical mystery, and not everyone (especially mystery fans) may be satisfied with the ending.

After 11 summers of great service it was time to retire it and get a new one. I found it on Amazon and ordered. Wow was I surprised. The sturdy chair that I had purchased is no more. This is a flimsy cousin at best of my trusty friend. Very disappointed in the design changes. I guess the old ones were lasting too long and that want us to re-buy every year. I will be looking for a new beach chair company. Wish I had kept the box so I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Narrow.

Very heavy compared to other chairs. I would shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camo Backpack Chair A Disappointment","review":"This is my third Rio Backpack Beach Chair. My first one lasted over 4 years of pretty constant use during beach season. Eventually the fabric began to get stressed and the pocket got holes in it.I replaced it with a lace-up ultralight chair. This one was really well made but the ground squirrels tore it up getting to my lunch. It only lasted a few months. Not the fault of the chair.This last one, the camo chair is the lowest quality of the three. Threads are already coming loose. The fabric slips along the metal tubing all the time and does not stay in place. The drink holder is not as deep as the other two and is attached less securely to the chair. And, finally, the strap clasps are not as well made and come undone causing the chair to open at inopportune times.I thought I could save some bucks by buying this model but I should have bought another lace-up chair. That's the best one made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair!","review":"I spent quite a bit of time scouring the internet looking for a lightweight chair that would be easy to transport and have a back.

It has straps for wearing as backpack, four adjustable positions, a back (which was most important for me), an adjustable headrest, a cup holder, and a storage compartment with a flap as an added bonus. The chair isn't too heavy. The material seems like it would be easy to wipe off if you spill something or it gets dirty. The woodgrain armrests also give it a \\"classier\\" look.

He misses the whole concept that nature has been working at the nanoscale for years with biological mechanisms that don't resemble his devices even though they peform many of the same functions . Also he appears to ignore quantum forces which are much more significant at the nanoscale where materials behave diffently.The book is fine as a introduction to a whole new arena, although it is out of date.

Like all methodologies, you can very quickly lose sight of where you're going because there's so much involved in working your way through the 7 principles.

The authors present a remarkably well planned overview of the steps needed to come to creative solutions to problems.Many readers are likely to find hints of De Bono, Senge and even some NLP in the reading.

They do have some audition footage that consists of actresses acting like cavegirls. The ability to grunt and shove a fake spear around shouldn't have been a criteria for casting. It took far too long to get to the cavewomen mentioned in the title, and the nudity was far too brief to classify it as a T&A flick.

In this one, a man travels back in time to meet dinos and naked cave women. He also has to fight off the cave men as well as dinos. It is done rather campy. The dinos are not of Jurassic Park quality, but are authentic enough to watch. Followers of hitech dinosaur recreations might want to pass on this one. Followers of camp movies and half clad women will want to view this most likely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"I'm not a scholar of Mandarin although I have completed the Pimsleur Mandarin course level 1. My experience as a relative novice was that this book was extremely useful.Every Chinese person that I showed it to, when trying to communicate, also thought it was very good and several asked where they could buy it. I looked in Beijing and couldn't find it.Chinese pronunciation is fairly difficult although grammar is straightforward. I've got by in Vietnam in the past with the Lonely Planet's Viet phrasebook without any previous tuition. If you can retain phrases and remember to transliterate words down quickly before you forget then even this book on its own would be very handy. Pinyin is frequently not pronounced how a Westerner would expect from its spelling. For example the word \\"wo\\" for \\"I\\" is pronounced like \\"war\\" and not \\"woe\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without pinyin, this book is close to worthless","review":"I have to admit great disappointment when I picked up the latest edition of the Mandarin Phrasebook. I've studied Chinese for about 2 years, but enjoyed the quick, portable convenience of LP's previous phrasebook editions. The removal of pinyin in this one, however, was idiotic. Pinyin is used on a great many things (signs, ads, street names, etc) in China, and can be decently understood by the time one's plane touches down. Only a few letters differ significantly from standard English speech. For me, and anyone else who is used to pinyin, it's a pointless hassle trying to decipher this book's non-standard pronounciation system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big info - Small print","review":"This is an excellent little pocket phrase book. Well designed and thought out. The only complaint is that the print for the Chinese characters is pretty small for older eyes to make out clearly on occasion. Some of the characters are pretty complex and the small print makes it very difficult to make out exactly what they look like. But, Hey! It is a pocket phrasebook, I shouldn't expect large print versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel companion","review":"This book is a great travel companion if you go to China and speak little mandarin. It saved me on numerous occasion (train station, shopping, restaurant); I like it so much that i bought the Italian and French one for other trips.I like the topics covered and having the characters, pinyin and english translation side by side is very convenient. I often pointed at a sign or a sentence to get some help.

He invites you to check out the facts for yourself, which I did not do, but I accept the accuracy of his presentation. However, when he arrived at his thesis that the only possible explanation for the moon's existence is that humans from the far future traveled back in time into our far past to build the moon, he lost me.

Then how did life come into being, and eventually allow humans to evolve, that would one day send machines back to build it? If the moon was required for life to happen, then there would be no man if there was no moon, since there would be no man to create the moon, since there was no moon?I know..

I'd be surprised if the 2 pieces of moulded plastic cost the manufacturer more than 30 to 40 cents when purchased in quantity. If it had been made with better materials than the thin plastic molded material it's made of, it could easily work a lot better.It's also far too small.

It was one of four texts yet it was assigned without the forewarning as to how it may inform the instructors pedagogical choices. It is written by a graduate of Jerry Falwell's 'Liberty University.' The book unabashedly defies the American Psychiatric Associate and every other respectable accrediting institution in many approaches. The theology is 'literalist' so it perpetrates a rather unacademic approach to the Bible. Yes you may have to counsel those who see the Bible as the literal word of God, but do know it is at it's best controversial, and at its worse offensive.And then there is the issue of lining the authors pockets - and I as a Christian may pray for right wing extremists, but and certainly not prepared to pay for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Reading","review":"The book came in good condition and swift shipping.

The majority of her information is completely inaccurate. I would have expected a little more coming from a dietician. The only thing I can say about this book on a positive note, is a few of the recipes are okay and she supports breastfeeding. I felt like this book was/is right with our culture...focused on how mom looks after having a baby. New mom's have enough on their plate worrying about how to adjust to this little person who's taken over their life. They don't need another book emphasizing how their body should look or perform. Every mom is different, I know. I just think mothers should be focused on breastfeeding successfully and loving their sweet baby, not trying to fit into prepregnancy pants 2 weeks postpartum.

Nehamas's own \\"creative\\" interpretation of Nietzsche is utterly irresponsible. Interpreting Nietzsche analytical only makes Nietzsche's moral properties run amok. Nehamas interprets Nietzsche like most Christians interpret the Bible: He takes away a few things he can use, dirties and confounds the remainder and reviles the whole. Nietzsche asserts, rather than believes, that \\"untruth\\" is indeed a condition of life. But he does not assert any kind of \\"theory of truth,\\" as Nehamas would have us to believe. Nietzsche's moral philosophy is Descartian - doubting to believe to discover one's own perspective of truth - not a dogmatic religious truth! His intent is rather, to give us his perspective to help us discover truth in ourselves, not in Nietzsche, himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most timely achievement.","review":"Nehamas' book is, in its elegance and fluidity, an exemplary misrepresentation of Nietzsche's principal concerns and ultimate positions. It is an exceptionally digestible manifestation of what Nietzsche characterizes as \\"intellectual uncleanliness,\\" and is thus a book of evidentiary value for diagnosticians of the \\"postmodernist\\" Zeitgeist which continues to foster a peculiarly resonant form of intellectual obscurantism as well as much mischief in the intercourse of actual ideas.For a work of standard-bearing excellence in Nietzsche scholarship, read Maudemarie Clark's \\"Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation and lies","review":"The DVD has sections called 1 Code Unbroken 2 Secrets Unveiled and 3 Cheating Death.

The whole premise was horrible.The best part of the whole movie was getting to see the various [characters] get killed off.When I die, if I find I wasn't as good as I needed to be, I'll be spending eternity watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy Headache","review":"This is a pretty stinky (...), even if you're someone like me who generally appreciates homegrown horror films on zero budgets. The concept of a Headless Horsemen masked slasher stalking kids at Sleepy Hollow High had promise and certainly interested me enough to purchase the DVD. Sadly, this film seems to wallow in its ineptitude. Since I could tell the crew only had one good light to use, I was terrified that the plot was leading up to night scenes for the climax. My fears came to life as everything became too dark to see and actors spent whole scenes standing in the only available light without being able to move. The documentary and commentary didn't do much to improve my respect for the director, who spends most of the documentary wearing a woman's dress and acting silly. He seems to be trying to imitate either Trey Parker or Ed Wood (or both), but manages to make both look like incredible artists by comparison. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told on the screen time and again, and in many different forms, but I must say that this is a first. In the era of \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and \\"Felicity\\", independent film makers have taken the truely scary concept of the hesdless horseman and turned it into a 90-minute teen soap, complete with bad acting and choppy plot. To stay well within the boundaries of teen soap-ville, USA, all of the important storyline factors apply: who is sleeping with who? who is pregnant? a teen, commit suicide because he boyfriend dumped her? It's like the film makers are addicted the the \\"Creek\\", because every plot twist is torn straight from the television series. To make things worse, a little bit of \\"Scream\\" and a whole lot of \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" is thrown in as well. Add in the cheap look of the film, and cheesy soundtrack, and you're in B-movie heaven. 2 stars, and that's being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I can't believe $17,000.00 was spent on this piece of tripe. Where did the money go? This movie had bad acting, bad lighting, bad sound, bad camera work, bad editing with the same establishing shots shown over and over and over again in nothing more than a lame attempt to get the running time to feature length.I have seen movies made with less money that are extremely high quality and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse acting than a Mentos commercial.","review":"If you've read any of my other reviews, you know I love low budget horror. Unfortunately, this train wreck of a movie is so bad that it isn't even funny. The camera shots are often so dark that you can't tell what is going on. There is one decent killing where big streams of blood squirts from a body like a Monty Python movie, but otherwise there is nothing here to even keep your attention. Negligible gore, no nudity, horrible acting, awful camera work, no originality...... I could go on. I honestly can say that I haven't fast forwarded through very many movies, but after 45 minutes of this stuff I did and you will too! Stay away from this steamer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, and... oh yeh... BAD!","review":"This movie was really BAD! \\"Bad\\" is the only adjective to describe it.

BAD The Direction... umm was there any direction? ...or was it just anyone the cast found that could hold a camcorder and press RECORD. As I watched the movie I thought that it might make up for it's horrible plot by having some cool death scenes and gore. NOTHING! This movie had like.. NO BLOOD! The only Slasher movie that I have ever seen that had no gore and still scared the hell out of you.. was John Carpenter's Halloween! This movie was silly, chessy, and BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Horrible","review":"If I could I would give this movie negative stars. The costumes: They look like they were made by a middle school drama class.

Don't try to copy \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Dawson's Creek\\". And for the love of God, Do not try to decapitate the blonde using your sister's wig!! And what is with the fat black guy? This was comedy where it was supposed to be terror. I will give one star for the murder weapon: A huge \\"Excalibur\\" style sword.That was cool.

So if you're looking for the stereotype stuff, look elsewhere. Try \\"Time of The Vampires\\" by P.N. Elrod. You can read my review there. Brite's book is interesting and strange, so for that matter it is a decent read. I'd have to agree once again with S. Fackler regarding the stories I liked and disliked. Read this one with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best dark erotica collections","review":"This collection will appeal to those who enjoy vampire stories and erotica -- if you're looking for straight erotica, be warned that this stuff can get pretty violent and weird.

Overall, it was an enjoyable and erotic read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first one was infinitely better","review":"After reading \\"Love in Vein\\", I was very pumped for the next set of stories but was very disappointed.

Overall, the sound quality is good and clear, and the orchestra does a fine job. The problem though lies with the pianist, Sergei Uruvayev. His tempo is far too slow at points, and some of his lead-ins to the orchestral parts are noticeable and clunky sounding. For me, I prefer the recordings done by Svetlana Stanceva, whose hands you would absolutely wish to have for playing the piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveler's Bible","review":"My husband and I read and re-read this book in the early 1990's before strapping on our backpacks and taking a 14-month trek around the planet.

We have always referred to it as our traveler's bible.... as Fred covers all areas - when to go (now!), where to go (anywhere, just go), what to take (less than you think), working, transportation, health, re-entry, and so on. What has become almost a mantra for us is Fred's reference to overcoming inertia. Now, having accepted our first overseas employment, we have dusted off this book to help us get out of our current rut.

It is not as creative or pretty as Mario but it is close on both accounts. The controls handle very well. And they have even thrown in a bit of old school pac-man emulation. There are over 14 levels in this game, most of which will engage you. If you loved the last pac man world game. You will love this one.

They are an assistant DA and a psychologist, who hardly ever have to show up at their respective offices. They are elitist and snobbish to those who are not left liberals. I wouldn't want to consult with Alan Gregory, the psychologist. The plot is better than the characters, the cop-friend, Sam Purdy, is the most realistic character in the book.

I hoped I'd discovered another author to add to my collection, but I really struggled to finish this one. Thought frequently of just giving up on it. Too slow moving, too far fetched, too often sliding into unreal and impossible scenarios. And most of all to be a good mystery writer I have a helpful suggestion. Leave out the left-wing liberal politics. That kind of tripe is a real turnoff. (You know not of whom you speak.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really Love a good mystery!","review":"My normal reading pattern is one nonfiction, then one mystery to clear my head for the next nonfiction. Mysteries entertain me more than any other type of book and this is the first Stephan White I have encountered -- I will search for more. I even bought a copy for my wife (I listened to mine on a road trip) as she loves mysteries, too. The story will keep you gled to the book until you think you have it figured out, then it will hit you with the truth. Great book! Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precision mysteries, well above most of the market.","review":"Despite being quite a ways into the series, _Cold Case_ is not lacking the inventiveness and incisiveness that has made the Alan Gregory novels a cut above the rest (no pun intended).The idea of the Vidocq society is a good one, and gives Gregory a new way of getting involved with interesting crimes. I found the depiction of the motivation behind the case particularly well done. If there's any complaint to be made at all it's that the clarity White always uses perhaps shifted sideways into actually being too chilly-- there's a certain coldness in the writing that there hasn't been in some of my favorite other books in the series. But tastes shall certainly differ about whether you like that or not, so don't let that dissuade you from giving this fine mystery a go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Case: a hot read","review":"Exciting, interesting, and suspenseful describe the plot of this new novel. White's readers will not be disappointed in the eighth in this series. A conniving politician, an estranged husband, and a woman with a secret contribute to a complicated plot involving the murder of two teenage girls. The case has gone unsolved for years, until a group of experts that solve old or \\"cold\\" cases as a hobby decide to take on the case. Alan and Lauren are asked to be consultants for this group of criminologists and get more involved than they expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written and dreadfully dull","review":"I appreciate good writing, I really do. This novel delivers that; White brings the characters alive quite well and weaves a good narrative that ties them all together naturally with very believable encounters. The trouble is, there's nothing interesting about them. It's a dull story, and that's really disappointing. I don't think I'm going to give up on White as an author, maybe I just chose the book to get acquainted with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably boring","review":"I bought this book (the Kindle version) on the strength of the first chapter which I read as a sample. The first chapter was promising. Unfortunately, after that it gets boring, more boring, most boring.Essentially, it's 'talking heads'. A long boring meeting with boring characters making boring presentations and giving longwinded explanations is followed by another boring meeting with people explaining stuff, followed by yet more meetings... I'm sure you get the picture.I like Stephen White's other novels; indeed, I consider some of them to be masterpieces. 'Cold Case' is not among them.Compared with his other novels, this one is dull.I'm giving it two stars because the style is polished the grammar is correct.No stars for plot, pacing, action or conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had read one other book by White, Harm's Way, which was adequate for airline travel but Cold Case was really a disappointment.The plot could have been enthralling but it was ruined by thinly developed characters that were presented either as good or bad people. The writing was incredibly simple and most of the book became very predictable.This was not much of a read, and I wondered whether or not the title was selected to confuse potential buyers that it might be \\" A Cold Case\\" which is a book worth reading. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly too long","review":"This book has too many pages that doesn't say anything at all. Each chapter has an introduction of how is the weather that is just boring.

Definitely are much better books than this one because this one is not even a thriller, is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's Kellerman","review":"Sterotypical charachters, average plotting, nowhere near the talent of Jonathan Kellerman.

The tension and the plot build towards a most unexpected conclusion. Lucky for Alan, everyone wants to tell their story to a shrink before they kill him.Enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses The Mark","review":"An interesting beginning. A little action toward the end. The rest of the story is filled with mind numbing details. Do we really need to know how Satoshi eats her yogurt? Sometimes these little details add color to a story, but when they constitute a large portion of the tale, they slow the pace and are very annoying. There is a big mistake on page 81. White refers to crime scene tape setting up a second perimeter and denying access to the body. There is no body. The character is missing. I have enjoyed all of White's previous novels, but he misses the mark with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner","review":"Stephen White, where have you been all my life? I don't know how I've missed him, since I'm a more than avid reader, but I was very pleased with \\"Cold Case.\\" I read it in record time because I just couldn't stop turning the pages. I really like Alan Gregory's character. He reminds me a bit of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware, and I liked Lauren Crowder much better than Delaware's live-in, Robin.

Or buy a Kong and shove some doggie snacks in it, or smear a dab of natural peanut butter in it... it will keep your dog busy and is good brain stimulation.If you absolutely must buy these Smokehouse treats, be sure to CHECK THE CONTAINER FOR BUGS.

Then, they smelled worse than any other dog treats I have ever given my dogs but since its dog food and not human food, I still gave some treats to my dogs which resulted in a couple of days of the worst diarrhea and gas they have ever had.

I've never seen that before. Hmm. The things inside the container looked like some kind of circus side-show of the treat world. They smell strange, and look like butcher-store offal.I understand that dog treats come from the discarded parts of animals, but this product makes it very clear that these are nowhere near what we normally think of as \\"food.\\" There were some bits (unidentifiable) that the dog would not eat, though she would eat most of them. She doesn't seem to be any more enthusiastic about these than any other kind of treat, though.And I don't like carrying a few in my pocket on walks, because some are great big tube-like things and some are tiny stick pieces.

I bought it specifically for holding small boxes together while the glue dried. I had previously used my Accuset 18 Guage Brad nailer, and found I was spending more time filling the nail holes than was reasonable. Bought the Bostich after reading many reviews of available 23 guage pin nailers. It has met all expectations, and cost less than the Porter-Cable or Senco, which were the only others in my price range. I've shot several hundred pins, all of which set well below the surface, and had no jams. No surace marring on Alder, and placement of the pins is quite accurate, thanks to the small nose on the nailer. A shellac finish on the boxes renders the pin holes invisible to all but the most critical eye.

I tried this...NONE of the employees at the businesses could/would/knew how to do so.I called and complained. They told me they would get back to me. I received an email a few days later with a store about 35 miles away who should carry the nails.

Jonkers basically said it all, so read that review :)I just thought that I'd add my ruminations here for good measure. My only other experience with the Rach 3 is the composer's own recording on the RCA label, and I find it hard to listen to because of the tinny acoustics, which to me makes the playing sound distant and somewhat cold. There is indeed a \\"natural warmth\\" to Leif Ove's performance and he plays with both honesty and clarity. Together with Berglund and the orchestra, they bring out nuances that I had not heard before.The etude-tableaux are a nice bonus. I am always impressed by Leif Ove's articulation of the notes and ability to exercise control over what seem like frenzied compositions.

The premise is more amsuing than the play turns out to be. I suppose witnessing a performance might be more interesting, but upon reading it, it is mildly amusing at best. Leaving aside the spiritual negatives of actually partaking in a seance and trying to communicate with the dead, the story rather bogs down with some sexual innuendo and some crude humor. There really isn't much of a storyline, and the supposed comedy is microscopic.

And concerning the review a few past \\"yelling\\" is more of the idea than \\"screaming.\\" I enjoy screamo music.

Hardcore is Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Sick of It All, etc. and while Comeback Kid isn't that good yet, they certainly can be one day and this album is a good step in that direction.

I had heard they got on victory, a label that has all screamo bands on it. I really didn't have too much of a problem with it because they were all about true hardcore music. However, listening to wake the dead, had certainly changed my thoughts on Comeback Kid. The music sounds overproduced, and his voice is completely different from TIA. I've played it at work before and kids were asking, \\"Is this the new Sum41 CD!?!\\" I also admired the songwriting on the first cd, but I noticed that the words have weakened. I guess all you can say is 'oh well'. Bottom line, you can definitely see the influence of victory records on this new album.

I thought that this was the end of them. The label would change them, because that has been the trend of the bands being signed to Victory. But after hearing this, all of my worries were blown away.

Mind you, this album replaces breakdowns for old school beatdowns and still manages to have a melody here and there.

As they say, 'Cheap Talk is OLD!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore? (age: 19, I can't be bothered registering)","review":"There's nothing hardcore about this apparent hxc release. I can see where the guy comparing Comeback Kid to Sum 41 is coming from. This band is just as weak and pathetic as the crap Sum 41 churns out. The singer sounds like a 13 year old trying to sound tough and there is even a certain similarity between the tone of his voice and that of the lame singer from Sum 41. Do not be misled - this is not hardcore. Maybe Sum 41 trying to do hardcore? Actually I reckon even those losers could pull off a better pseudo-hardcore album than this. It wouldn't be hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont see how these guys are so good!","review":"some people say these guys rock and they are totally hardcore. Whoever says that is wrong. These guys dont even sound like As I Lay Dying or Underoath, and I cant believe people relate Comeback Kid to them. Comeback Kid is just a wanna bee screaming hardcore band. They think they are cool but they really arent. There music is full of yelling. Its like this guy wants to scream, but he cant. What kind of a band substitutes screaming for yelling?

When is this madness going to end?!?! When I first heard Comeback Kid, I was abhorred. What a pathetic excuse for a Sum 41 rip off band. Even Kids Like Us has a little bit of originality and they dont try to sound exactly like ol' 41. 'Falling Apart' sounds almost identical to Sum 41's ode to sleeping in, \\"Never Wake Up\\". Why waste your time listening to a rip off when you can hear the real deal? Dont waste your money on this fecal matter. Go buy Sum 41's masterpiece, 'All Killer, No Filler'....trust me, you wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking awesome...","review":"I haven't been this excited about an album in years.

However as is the case with so many classical collections this CD has terrible recordings and bad performances. Then again I guess you get what you pay for, seeing as how this CD was 4.27 when I published this review, I guess in a way that makes this CD an okay deal since it does give you a good taste of what Strauss' style was like.

This last category is where we find this St. Petersburg Radio and TV Symphony Orchestra recording. To borrow the popular blue collar phrase, this recording was made with the \\"get 'er done\\" approach. Everything that could be spared was spared - including recording quality and musical talent. That's not to say it can't be enjoyed - I think I will be able to enjoy it as background music - but for those who enjoy listening closely to excellent work this will disappoint. Music like this nontheless serves a great purpose - giving access to those who can't or would rather not spend much over $5 on music they're not familiar with.

Takes some getting used to. Eyeglass wearers may find it difficult to use, i.e., finding a good spot where both left & right images come completely together. Image becomes darker as zoom in. Not suitable for use in low light conditions (dawn or dusk) at middle to full zoom. I predominantly use them to spot arrows when shooting target archery. It's light weight, size and limited view field are ideally suited for this purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good binoculars for viewing theater events","review":"Light weight, clear image, easy to focus. Works well in a theater or outdoors when hiking. Gets the most details and best image at 8x, works well up to 12x, then the image loses details and gets more difficult to keep stable. Still, it's nice to have the capability to shift to the higher range if and when wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all-around binocs.","review":"Having had binoculars in the past be either way too expensive or too cheap, I wanted a new pair that would replace a pair that was loaned out, then lost. The opportunity presented itself in the form of a trip to Canada this past September, which required something that would be able to capture the Canadian Rocky vistas, but also not be so heavy that I would feel like needing a cart to stow them in. The Nikon Eagleview Binoculars seem to fill the bill (not too expensive, but also not too heavy). They have a great zoom feature that is easily changed as well as being able to easily focus with one hand. My only complaint is that while zooming in on a subject, the light level is reduced, which occurs naturally due to the nature of optics. You can't have everything, but these were just right, allowing my wife and I to use them time and time again while observing nature. In summary, a good pair for all-around use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not hold focus while zooming","review":"These binoculars seemed like a great idea that was well designed, but upon opening the box today, I noticed there was a visible flaw in the objective lens, prompting its quick return to seller. It was brand new and should not, at ~$140, come with defects. The seller ([...[) was very quick at getting the unit returned at no cost to me. Very reasonable, no hassle.While on the phone setting up the return, I decided to dump this design. Reason: the Eagleview was unable to hold its focus while zooming, a fatal flaw in my book. Instead I reordered the Nikon Travelite V, 8-24/25, which was barely different in price. I have an old pair of the Travelite IIIs which still works great, and I am hoping the zoom engineering on the TL-V is better than on their Eagleviews.Might have given it three stars if it wasn't for the flaw in the lens, which colored my expectation of the overall quality of all others in this line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"These are high quality Nikon grade general viewing binoculars. The 8-24 zoom takes some getting used to but for this price, you just can't go wrong. They are compact and efficient. A perfect add-on for camping expeditions and such. Just a reminder to all binocular and camera owners, most important thing is to get in the habit of using the strap or wrist cord AT ALL TIMES. Most of the mechanical breakage to fine optics happens when someone drops them. Even a small distance can dislodge or jar one of the lens causing them to be useless.

It was succesful in encouraging her to use the big toilet she disliked it so much. Next time, for a girl I would purchase one with a more comfortable seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of all these kinds of potty seats","review":"I say that because if your child becomes \\"addicted\\" to using it, be prepared to drag it with you everywhere, because they won't use a regular potty without it.

He said that he was afraid of the toilet (he thought he would fall in). His doctor recommended an insert and this was the one I chose. The Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer worked wonders! It was easy to put on and take off and made him feel secure. Once he became comfortable, he was able to use any toilet without the toilet trainer. It is an excellent product and REALLY helped. I highly recommend it. It may seem expensive but it was definitely worth every penny. Have patience--some kids just do things in their own time. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOK NO FURTHER...","review":"THIS IS THE ONE!!! This is a SIMPLE and perfect product. I'm not surprised at the high, high quality of this product. I AM, however, surprised at how this product manages to remain so superior to the rest on the market. For some reason, most of the other manufacturer's of potty seats haven't and still don't come ANYWHERE close to this quality of design. This one fits and adjusts well to most (if not all) toilet seats and is so dependable and easy to clean and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"i love this toilet seat! REALLY easy to clean. We transitioned from the BabyBjorn potty chair/seat to this Toilet Trainer. I love how this is so much more sanitary than the chair.

I bring this seat (clean & sterile, of course). to grandma and grandpa's, ...it's very convenient! I recommend this toilet trainer/seat to every family!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for training & beyond","review":"After buying a Wal-Mart mistake, we forked out the dough for this potty seat. Boy was it worth it! We were just introducing our petite 2-year-old to the potty when we purchased it. She is now almost three and completely trained. We never even bought a separate potty chair. We have enlongated bowls, and it still fits very securely. With a small step stool, she has had no problems using it. We have a kid-height hook in her bathroom (originally for a towel) that she hangs the seat on when she is done ... useful for multi-people toilets! Except for an occasional adjustment and cleaning, the seat is 'no maintainance.' I love that I've never had to clean a separate potty bowl, and she loves that she uses a big potty just like mommy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing \\"after-work\\" read, nothing spectacular","review":"Jeffrey Archer has done better, but still this oeuvre is a thrilling good read.Compared to \\"Not a penny more, not a penny less\\" this piece lacks the brillianceof the final plot, compared to his short-stories this one's a more \\"conventional\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeffrey Archer Hits Gold","review":"Jeffrey Archer hits gold on this book.

What makes me mad is that I have heard so much good press I was excited about this book. There are a number of reviews here that sum up the story so I will not go down that road again. I find the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. I only made it about half way into the book. Maybe I just have a mental block with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor among thieves","review":"It was fascinating all along I just could not put it down to take a breath nor sleep a minute.thank you mr Archer"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good yarn... though feels dated now","review":"OK, so you don't pick up a Jeffery Archer looking for the best literature can offer. You pick up one of his books for the beach (which is where this was read), for an easy page-turner that entertains, tells a good yarn but isn't demanding. To that extent this book works a treat. Of course it's all daft and with Bill Clinton and Sadaam Hussein taking pivotal roles a bit out of date now but I still enjoyed it even if I'll never think of it again. To criticise the dialogue - wooden - or characterisation - one-dimensional - is to miss the point. One thing I didn't like, however, was the repetition of the title. Once would have been enough, though I guess that scarcely matters either to Archer... or most of us readers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Twist","review":"I've read this book several times and will read it many more times. Even though I know the story, and the characters, I never cease to be amazed at the twists and turns this tale leads me on. A great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but stunning novel nonetheless.","review":"Archer spins a harrowing tale of suspense that is both preposterous and frightening at the same time. Another storyteller would botch the improbable plot Archer has chosen, but his meticulous detail, his pace, and his realistic spin on an insane situation add up for one of the more satisfying and enjoyable novels in recent memory. Character development is one crucial part of this memorable read, and all the players are developed brilliantly, from the lead participants to the men behind the scenes. The only flaw: a truly preposterous plot, combined with moments of sheer idiocy, combine to water down the suspense a little. However, the superb ending and quick pace make this an excellent suspense novel, written in fine Archer form"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a perfect example of word processed trash.","review":"Honour Amoung Thieves is such a poorly written piece of word processed trash I was driven to finish it with the same impetus that drives one to pick a painful scab or tounge a sore tooth. The plot is as ridiculous, contrived and full of holes as a 1930's movie serial yet completely lacking in charm, humour or grace. The characters are simple racial stereotypes strung together like cheap plastic beads on the frayed dental floss of the storyline. There are crafty, evil Arabs, an Irish drunk, gravel voiced Mafia dons, and resourceful, dedicated Israelis. The book is so poorly thought out it gives the impression of being poured out onto a computer screen with one take and barely enough time for a spell check. Archer must have had a past due child support payment and where was the editor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-filled","review":"This is another typical non-stop action book that Archer has written, very much like A Matter of Honor. The only difference is that, in this one, the plot involves more characters and the danger is much bigger and greater. It has moved from a fate of a man to a fate of a nation. It has moved from \\"excellent\\" to a word that hasn't existed in the dictionary. Highly recommended for Archer's first-time reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooo","review":"i thought that it was a bad book because i could not follow the beginning so i never go into the book.

His style of writing is really uninteresting. The dialogue is really cheesy - there's nothing new or witty here. You don't feel for any of the characters since there is no character development . The plot is silly - I never got the point of stealing the Declaration of Independence. I mean Saddam's got better (or should I say worse) things to do. And there's no suspense at all - you know how the book's going to end from the start since this is intended for American readers.Overall, two words: boring and trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to think about","review":"This isn't a feel good movie.

The family visits KFC for dinners and meetings.The movie is unique in that it is an emotional story about four men from the same family, from four different generations-great grandpa, grandpa, pa, and his son. The entire family history comes out little by little. The troubles and troubled times are not avoided in conversations. After great grandpa's death, the grandpa, pa, and his son travel together to fulfill the wishes of great grandpa. This becomes an opportunity for them to get in touch with each other and the past. The pa and his son bond with the grandpa. Grandpa then disappears, which has been his pattern.Touching moments, old memories, hidden truths and facts, and pain and guilt abound. It is a strong, emotionally loaded, powerful story for the serious audience. Not exactly light entertainment.Good writing, direction and acting. Rare movie revealing the feelings of men, but only for selected audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing story line, but what I understood was okay","review":"The problem here is the script, or perhaps the directing or the editing. Wherever the blame lies, the story of the movie just isn't clearly enough delineated to keep you involved the whole time. There are some touching scenes, some good acting, some moments that make you think and feel, but overall it just doesn't stack up. Too bad, too, because there's some good performances here. The only thing they did well is promote Kentucky Fried Chicken. Makes you wonder if the whole film was thought up by KFC advertising execs as a way to promote their restaurants...Guess that failed as hardly anybody's ever heard of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Here But Walken!","review":"Christopher Walken is a pleasure to see in just about any movie he is in, and this one is no exception. As for the rest of the movie, there is nothing there.It tried very hard to be an uplifting story about the re-connection of four generations of a family, that was never a cogent, connected family to begin with. There are hints of mystery, without much of an explanation, and lots of secrets.But hard as it may have tried, it just didn't work. The movie sets a mood, a very depressing mood at that, and there is nothing else, aside from Walken."},{"rating":"2","title":"volver a empezar","review":"I try to learn Spanish and purchased this item for that reason.i really enjoyed watching it.i do recommand this product to everyone to watch. it is one of the best soup opera that i ever watched.if you speak spanish than great, you will love the show.Lovely singer Shayanne is one of the best performer in this soup opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"!! .EL ORGULLO DE MI TIERRA .!!

I bought my first pack today because I had read an article about it recently. The texture is good and I don't have an issue with it sticking to any dental work but the flavor [tangerine] was gone in 5 minutes. I chew gum to freshen my breath and give me a low cal sweet treat. Glee gum just doesn't meet my needs. If they could make the flavor last longer, it would be great. Until then, this is probably the one and only box of Glee gum that I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes - very sticky on dental work.","review":"Like at least one of the other reviewers, I also had severe problems with the gum sticking to my dental work. I found this gum to be impossible to chew because I have ONE crown on a molar. The entire piece of gum stayed solidly stuck to the crown the whole time I was trying to chew it, forming a gum-coating on that one tooth. I am sure that I can find someone to take this pack off my hands, but unfortunately, this one piece has been enough for me. Other than that one issue, the gum seemed good and I think it would have been ok if I didnt have a crown. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Attempt to Bring Back Classic Gum","review":"For most of my life I loved chewing gum until the all the major companies started using artificial and unhealthy ingredients like artificial high-intensity sweeteners and sugar alcohols. I was always on the hunt for a company that used natural flavorings and sweeteners. When I recently found Glee Gum, the joy of chewing gum returned. It's not perfect, but it's the best alternative on the market for people concerned about what they put in their bodies. It's a good start, but hopefully the company will focus on producing a product whose flavor lasts longer and which stays soft longer. As pointed out by another reviewer, if you're having problems with the gum sticking to teeth, try chewing 2 or 3 pieces at a time. Half my mouth are caps, crowns, and bridges and I don't have a problem chewing this gum."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice chewing","review":"I read all the reviews about it sticking to dental work, but that hasn't been a problem for me.

If you want your child to be a Jeopardy contestant, read this book immediately. If you want your child to be a thinker, don't waste your time and money.

If you want to learn self defense from a book, this book is gonna help you. keep in mind that the use of some techniques could bring you to jail but can also save your life.

The techniques and tactics are simple to learn because real life combat and self-defense is NEVER complex. It shows and explains the basic strikes, kicks, and escape techniques that are easy to learn, apply and retain. It is true some of the information may be dated; however, this is still an excellent book for anyone interested in learning self-defense without spending years inside a dojo.I do have one criticism of this fine book. There is little emphasis on how much practice it takes to master these techniques so that they become an automatic reaction under real circumstances. Nevertheless, this is a classic that will benefit anyone interested in true combatives.Rating 5 Stars. Joseph J.

Sometimes I will add one or two of the workouts to my cardio workout, or sometimes I will do all four in a row. The exercises work and I love the format because there is no irritating chatter. You have eight minutes and the instructor gets straight to business and works you straight through those eight minutes. There is an optional eight minute stratch that you can do on each of the DVD's if you need it.

My friends thought that I shelled out some serious money on a personal trainer when they saw me in a bikini. So for those of you who are already in shape somewhat, you will definitely see results in about 4 weeks. As for arms and legs, I supplement the work out to this dvd to also running and working out at the gym so i can't give this dvd all the credit for my arms and legs, but I can with my abs, because I have dropped everthing else I do for abs since I bought this dvd.

The fourteen-year-old girl decideds to take her father's old job as a schoolteacher for the children of Broken Bow, Nebraska because nobody has been found to replace her father.

It is in fact poorly written fiction. Neither the style of writing nor the actions and thoughts of the main character, or the other characters, are remotely authentic. There are a few historical details thrown in which give it an air of historical authenticity - enough to make a child believe it was an accurate account, but ascribing 21st century motivations and attitudes to a 19th century character."},{"rating":"2","title":"another dear america book...great!","review":"Love all dear america books!

This book is especially useful, not only to those who are new to the \\"old religions\\", but also to those who are looking for a more solitary approach.

The music as expected was sensational, but the nuances - the control of dynamics unmatched since Bill Evans, the transitions from overpowering block chords and technically demanding runs to quiet intimate moments of extraordinary beauty - were what stood out. This album catches all of that. The trio is extraordinary, working together like a single entity, and the tunes are challenging and reward repeat listening. In particular, pay close attention to 'Otello' - it will stick in your brain (all for the good) for a long long time. This album challenges, swings and emotes - one of the best live piano trios I have heard in a long time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Color me unimpressed","review":"Though there are some redeemable concepts covered, this book does very little to help the reader become a better sketch comedy writer. Far too much time and energy is spent explaining the process of how the Brave New Workshop Comedy Theatre creates a review, while ignoring the nuts and bolts of what it takes to write sketch comedy. Outside of a few helpful insights toward structuring an idea, there is virtually no instruction on comedic tools, what goes into developing a satiric point of view, or how to create a strong comedic premise. In my opinoin, truth is the foundation to all great comedy, so truthfully, if you are trying to learn how to write sketch, you won't find any answers in this book. Outside of hyping his own theatre company, the author's focus seems to be that improvisation is the best way toward finding the funny, so instead of buying this book, I'd suggest you take a class in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is a great book for court reporters, scopists, proofreaders, anyone who needs help with grammar or punctuation.

Unfortunately, this one wasn't worth the effort. I found Kate, Max, Lucy and Chip to be thoroughly unlikable, self-absorbed, immature people. Maybe I'm naive, but I'd like to think that the majority of us married people out there don't have continual fantasies about members of the opposite sex! Lucy and Kate leave their two small children with a babysitter so that they can go bar hopping and dance with grungy strange men. They both get drunk, Kate goes off with the stranger she picks up and sleeps with him, and Lucy drives home drunk and makes the babysitter walk home. What am I missing!!! I don't know anybody who acts this way! It's hard to like a book when you find all of the characters so thoroughly reprehensible.

The reason is because these people did not follow the instructions~fill the balloon, but not overfill it. Most people stated they overfilled the item and it popped. The instructions provide a method for reducing air in case of overfillings. I have had my hoverdisc for over a month and experienced no problems. My 3 kids (youngest 3) all play with this item. They toss it in the air, catch it, bounce off walls, and do crazy tricks. Never has it gotten a whole or bent. The wire inside the balloon is plastic, and only becomes damaged to overinflation.

We filled ours with helium - the metal ring gives it enough weight that it will not float away. However, it is not good on windy/breezy days as once it catches the wind, it will float on forever. Despite that, my 2 year old son thinks it is the best thing. He is happy for hours running around outside throwing it in the air. Despite being stuck in trees, and blowing over to the next block, the toy has held up better than I had expected. It lasted all summer with only 1 helium fill. And even better - it's refillable.

We couldn't wait to get home and inflate it. We didn't have helium, so we blew into it with the straw. It was just ok when we took it outside, but she didn't like it cause it didn't look like the one on tv. So of course the next day I filled it with helium to make it fly like the tv...Big mistake, I over inflated it too. The plastic circle inside bent and wouldn't straighten even after we deflated it some. Then voila, my son poked it with his remote control car antenna and put a hole in it. I duck taped the hole to keep it goin longer, but then the circle inside broke in half and we couldn't use it at all any more. This toy is not durable in the least, just picture a regular old helium balloon with a plastic cirle inside. I thought it was junk and wish we got something else instead.

She loved it and I thought it well worth the $12 price tag. I left it on the living room floor to see what my cats would do - cats love the mylar *crinkle*. Well the older cat gets under it and walks it around the room and the kitten attacks her or gets under it with her. They've been doing this game for over a month now (and the rips are getting big), but they looooove it. When they're tired, they flop down and sleep on it. I wonder if the PANIC mouse folks could incorporate this mylar disk into their toy... I know it's fragile (for holding air), but cats love the crinkle noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I bought this toy, against my better judgement, for my 8 year old son, and paid to have it inflated with helium.

Within 20 minutes it had two holes in it and the frame was poking out through the mylar. This toy is a rip off and a piece of junk. I would NOT recommend this toy to anyone!

It is a shame because the girls were having alot of fun for the hour it held up."},{"rating":"2","title":"hover disc 101","review":"I've written this because I read a couple of reviews that says the kids managed to rip/wreck it in less than an hour. I have two very active boys, 6 & 8, and they've had them for months and haven't ripped either one yet. If however you do get a puncture or tear, packing tape should do the trick for repairs. We haven't done it ourselves, but I think a little helium would make the tricks a little easier, especially if you bought the one with the wristbrand. We lost the first one we had: it went over the fence and by the time we could go looking for it, it was gone.... So playing with it in a large open space would be better than an enclosed back yard.

Professor Holmes, who never saw a battlefield except from a safe distance, does NOT interview anyone to defend the actions of either General Clark or General John Lucas.In the chapter on \\"Bomber\\", Professor Holmes presents only the story of British aircraft bombing Germany and completely excludes any mention of the US Air Force. In the chapter on \\"Alamein\\", there is no mention of the 400 tanks President Roosevelt and General Marshall sent the British Army. After listening to Holmes, you would think the British won WWII by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I will be honest, I bought this book because of the cover, that and because I'm a scatter brain who reads in almost every genre.This book might have been better except one thing; I am so NOT turned on by a girl getting her head stuffed into a soiled toilet bowl full of urine and toilet paper and the likes. If she would have left that out the book might have received more stars, or if she wouldn't have used that device so many times.

You can spend all kinds of time just watching the characters talk back and forth, or go directly to the fighting. This game allows you to customize your Scoobie (Mech) many different ways, which can be fun all by itself. I found the controls to be quite easy to get used to for a third person game. If you're used to the control setup from \\"Halo\\", you'll already have this one down. Its a fun, kind of goofy game, and worth ($$$)...so its a great buy at ($$$)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the Past","review":"Phantom Crash is one heck of a cool game. The controls are almost identical to halo save for the shoulder guns on the B and Y buttons and the emergency dodges with the white and black ones.

Having presented some of these questions to my sister (who is a mormon living in Arizona) I came to realize that this book is just plain full of garbage meant to throw off those who either have not the capability to think for themselves, or are just plain stupid.

I do believe that the only people who will find this book even a little interesting are those who already dislike The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Any Latter-day Saint such as myself will be able to answer these questions (and any others) with ease.

If a Catholic accepts a Baptist as a Christian, must the Baptist accept the Catholic as a Baptist? This, of course, is a silly nonsensical question, yet it is the exact type of question the authors of this book refer to as \\"effective\\".The questions in this book are not so much \\"effective\\" as \\"affective\\", and if you like arguing with your Mormon friends then you should purchase the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame attempt","review":"If these are the best questions you can come up with to ask your mormon \\"friends\\" I suggest you go back to the drawing board.

In fact I would love it if someone asked me one of them, I think it could spark an interesting discussion. I could tell them the simple truths this book seems to overlook.

All I found in each book about any topic was code/syntax with no explination as to what any of this was used for. Dynamic Dreamweaver MX was the first book that showed me the whole picture starting with less advanced topics like HTML and CSS and then moving on to server side scripting with VBScript and ASP and databases.

OK, you don't need this if you're making a 'look at my holiday pictures' site. But if you want to get a competitive edge for your company or design agency, you need to understand these concepts. What I particularly like is the fact that the authors do same job as me. They understand real concerns.

There's a fair selection of different tactics, so you're sure to find something to work against your enemy. Just be sure to make the punishment fit the crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hated this book","review":"I really hated this book.

Her self-published comics under the name \\"Deep Girl\\" are some of my favorities. Needless to say, when this book came out I was very excited.\\"No Love Lost\\" follows the break-up a girl with her boyfriend and an almost break-up with her best friend because of it. Ariel captures the hopes, fears and doubts of the twenty-somethings well. The characters seem real and story is well-written and presented.The subject topic is nothing new, but if you liked \\"Deep Girl\\" or want to check out another good comic effort from one of the ladies I'd definitely suggest this little book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be mislead by the cover, great book","review":"I bought this book with the thought of possibly getting an ex back, but instead this book showed me and gave me the direction to love me first and to help over come the loss of an ex. Was really surprised how it understood how I felt and ways in how to over come the hurdle of being \\"stuck\\" in the rut. It gives insight on how to go about the right ways and wrong of maybe getting an ex back, but also makes you think of should you get back with an ex. Loved it and even gave it to my dad to read after his divorce."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I learned helped","review":"I found this book helpful when I was reeling from a breakup last year. I didn't get my lover back, but I was able to share some mutually nice moments with him; originally there was not a lot to the relationship. What this book did do was to gently teach me how to actually love someone and in the process I have also learned why it didn't work out that time. His \\"packaging\\" through the somewhat vague anecdotes worked for me as a way to distinguish my own neediness from the actual love that I was feeling--they were not the same, but both were present. His ideas about looking at literature and film in order to understand common relationship processes were fruitful for me; I could read/view his suggestions and make my own analysis. The tone of his writing was very supportive and his ability to empathize with the perspective of the spurned lover helped me to believe what he was saying--and thus to take some of his medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are parts that (hopefully unintentionally) advocate *stalking*","review":"I read this book years ago. Over time I realized that there were portions that (hopefully unintentionally) advocated stalking. Things like know where he/she is and make sure you are there. Are you kidding?? This is exactly what a stalker does. Send flowers daily? Doesn't seem much different. At this time I hope I'm submitting a review for a whole different book, but honestly this part scared the hell out of me.Do not look to a book to solve this problem. Look to yourself. The person wasn't the hole in your life, it can only be filled by you. Relying on somebody else to solve your problems is a fantasy.Please take great care when reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good ideas","review":"Some of this book I disagreed with , for example \\"loving 100%\\" this is great for a man to get a woman back, but most men want space and are also naturally drawn back in if you show you are ok without them. I think it is dangerous to reassure them that any communication is fine (ex friends, etc.) LET THEM MISS YOU!! Do not call or talk to them and they will come around on their on time.For men this is a womnderful book!!For women- get \\"Dont call that man\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Very nice reading, easy and makes you want to change your own actions... i got my lover back with this book :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read even if your not trying to win a lover back","review":"good read on how to love people, but not over love and how to get them to love you, and helps to understand why people in love do the things they do, and helpfull in dealing with impaired lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved My Marriage","review":"A close friend recommended this book to me when I was going through the worst period of a 20 year relationship. I don't think I would have been as cool and collected as I was during all that turmoil without this book's advice. Not that I was all that cool and collected but I was much more so than I would have been had I not read this book several times over. What can I say? Great advice that came to me at the perfect time. I managed to save my 20 year relationship and that was a year ago almost to the day.

Keep your opinions to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my money.","review":"I purchased this book right after my husband ran off. First of all, I must add that this book is geared towards women. It is an extremely boring read and does nothing to help one get their absent mate back. I regret ever spending the money on this book. I believe the man talks about how he was divorced at one time in this book (not sure, but I believe so). How can one be qualified to write a book on saving a marriage or bringing a long lost love back when they have already been divorced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not care about stories","review":"If you are looking for techniques to use to get your lover back this is a horrible book to learn from. It is my opinion that there are only about five pages worth mentioning in this book. The rest of it seems to be filler pages and stories about other couples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving 100%","review":"Dr. Harris really hits the nail on the head when it comes to LOVING your way back!! This book is for those who truly want the love of their life back...What the book teaches indirectly is what is the big picture, winning the battle or having Love in your life, his techniqes make sense and use love/logic not fear. The book only falls short in one category...The lover who is not talking to you. How to re-establish contact and rebuild the bond. If I used this book prior to my relationship ending, I'd still be with my ex. This book has definetly helped me grow and I recommend it..If your reading Dr. Harris...You need to write a book on skills for the LOVER who has relaced you and will not talk to you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and helpful","review":"Doesn't have all of the answers, but is very helpful, especially for people who are told that they must get on with their lives and forget their ex. Blase encourages people to try to get their ex back if they truly love them. Not a quick fix, but for people who are in it for the long haul and are patient, the book gives real hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poems that call me back","review":"HAYWIRE was waiting for me when I returned for the GR Dodge Poetry Festival last weekend, and in spite my having just bought books and falling way behind at my to-read stacks, I read HAYWIRE first. Wonderful poems. So touching and well-crafted. I keep re-reading them and asking myself why they are so good-- the shock/startle/aha of the endings, the understatement, the juxtaposition of elements, echoes, great details. All the things teachers tell you to do, AND done so well. When I read \\"Casablanca,\\" I had a moment of confusion. Then realized, This is a fantasy! NONE of these things happened, which deepened the poignancy of the endings. I loved \\"Anniversary\\" and \\"The Table\\" and \\"What Would Jesus Do.\\" And I flagged them to hand-copy to study some more.Bravo!

I will be returning it on Saturday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Element Ruined Bags and Leaks Air","review":"This unit worked great for the first two times I used it. Then, the heating element developed a \\"bump\\" where it would just melt through the bags and leave a hole - of course any vacuum was immediately lost. I tried to fix it and also to call customer service and they said that I had obviously damaged it by rough handling (not true). They were insulting and pretty much said that it was all my fault. They were just downright mean and said there was nothing I could do about it since I had obviously mishandled it. In order to create this bump I would have had to take a hammer to the element, I think. Really poor quality and very bad customer service. Not worth the price.Very expensive to only use it twice. Now... it goes into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it.","review":"I have been using Foodsavers since they were only \\"as seen on TV\\" and had to be ordered that way. I use it on a daily basis. Food keeps without freezer burn and can be boiled in hot water or microwaved for heating single-serving portions.This particular model had to be exchanged. The first one would not vacuum anything. I tried both canisters and bags and there was no suction although the motor ran extensively. I called Amazon and, as usual, the response was immediate. The sent me a new one which works flawlessly.I highly recommend Foodsavers and Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This is the third foodsaver I have had. I originally received a different model for a present. I had to return that due to it being broken. The one I got in return worked for a few times and then would not vacuum. They don't even make that anymore. When I was told how to return it, I had to pay shipping. The replacement I received was this one. Which is not comparable as the other model had a roll holder and cutter. Now this one vacuums almost all of the way, but does not switch over to seal, no matter how long I wait. This will probably be going back also."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like it used to be","review":"Had the original food saver for 10 years. no problem. it gave way (-actually i didn't know it, but it just needed new gaskets-) and i got a replacement machine. that didn't vacuum bottles or canisters. they sent me a new one. this one vacuums canisters and bottles but not the bags. they sent new gaskets. still didn't work. now they are sending a new machine, yet again.so, A+ for customer service and D- for product integrity. Guess when Food Saver sold to Jarden Consumer Solutions the quality went down. I won' buy another Food Service vacuum sealer.

We opened the box and prepared to vacuum and seal our first food item, and the machine just vacuumed and vacuumed and nothing ever happened. We followed all of the directions, tried everything we could, but it did not work. It was defective. Since it was a wedding gift, we had no receipt so we called FoodSaver and to their credit, they agreed to send us a new one. When that one was recieved, it worked, but it never worked well. It it very tempermental, decides when and how much it wants to vacuum, whether it wants to seal. I guess its a good product--when it works. After using it maybe a few times a month after a year, it is now completley broken, again.This is a cheaply made product--seems like a good idea, but doesn't actually work well at all. I would never repurchase this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Product, Watch Out for \\"Bad Bags\\"","review":"I got this as a wedding gift last fall. I used up all the bags that came with it and it worked great. I went out and bought the expensive three-roll pack of bags (about $30 on sale), and then the vacuum didn't work anymore! I called on a Monday, the guy at customer service was courteous and had me wash and flip the gasket. After it was dry, it still didn't work. I called again on a Saturday, and the lady on the phone was also very nice, and after trouble-shooting a few things said it might be the bags. I happened to still have a small piece of bag left over from the original batch, so I tried that and it worked just fine. So--she said it was a bad batch of bags, and the company is now sending me another set of bags rolls and a new gasket to keep handy just in case, at no charge. I'm quite impressed with customer service, but not bag quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I should've read these reviews prior to purchase. I bought this from Target beginning of Oct 2009 and have had 2 sessions of vacuum packing...no more than 10 packages. It worked fine until yesterday. It no longer seals properly. Seal is irregular, therefore does not hold a vacuum. Called customer service. They are willing to replace my unit, but I had to send it back on my dime. It cost me $17 priority mail. I did not bother calling Target as I have had this for ~ 2 months now. I wish I did. I actually wish I purchased from Amazon instead. I think they would've taken it back postpaid.

I thought we would save money by purchasing meat,chicken,and fish in large quantities and \\"FOODSAVING\\" it. Well this appliance does not do as advertised. It doesn't pull the air (foods worst enemy) out of the bags all the time. It seems to have a mind of it's own, works when it feels like it. Yes we read the instructions several times to make sure we are doing it correctly, and yes we use only FOODSAVR bags. Horrible machine. $80.00 for an appliance that is only good for re-sealing snack bags and bags that do not need the air pulled out to freeze. Worst product we have purchased in a long time.

It will usually seal the bags just fine but when it does vacuum, it will almost immediately release the vacuum. I've tried all the different size bags which are on the expensive side and end up wasting them. All I can say about this product is it doesn't vacuum but, it does suck. It is a piece of excrement and I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"We bought the v2040 model as well as their bags.

People, don't waste your money on buying a piece of junk that isn't even worth the disc it was formatted onto.

I picked this up due to the title alone, having never heard of this book before. In my opinion the narration was too restrictive; the story was told in the same fashion it would be told verbally to a casual acquaintance, only scratching the surface of the main characters' personal motives, doubts, fears, and many of the aspects that make a character compelling. Too much text was used describing what happened, as opposed to why and how.

The characters are lacking in all places.Reading the back of the book would make you think that its -at least- a halfway decent novel, but its TERRIBLE. It took me nearly a month to finish reading this it was so bad. Don't buy it. It had me wretching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping but Ultimately Vaguely Disappointing","review":"I would give this 2.5 stars. It starts out engagingly enough but the protagonist's descent into dereliction and vagrancy comes on really fast. Maybe that's the way that it happens in the real world-I don't know. Anyhoo, the author clearly can tell a fine story. It's just that the ending is a disappointment and a bit too clean. I can't see how he would choose to stay with Angela.Ultimately this is a entertaining if not very memorable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally bad.","review":"As another reader notes, this takes a rather tumultuous time and place in NYC -- the Lower East side circa 1985 -- and makes it boring. If you're at all interested in the topic, you should try to get a hold of the long out-of-print anthology, \\"Between C&D: New Writing from the Lower East Side\\" or \\"Love is Strange,\\" both edited by Joel Rose and Catherine Texier. This was a cutting edge magazine, printed on a dot-matrix and distributed in a poly-bag, it published the early works of David Foster Wallace, Tama Jamowitz, Gary Indiana, Patrick McGrath, the late Kathy Acker, Dennis Cooper, Lynne Tillman, Barry Gifford, William Vollman, and many many more. Nersesian can't hold a match to this stuff. There's simply nothing inventive or compelling about his [weak] tale. A waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most pretentiously contrived, pseudo-poetic BS I've ever read","review":"Having read numerous reviews about how this is a \\"darkly hilarious\\" look at one New York City man's odyssey through varying levels of rags and riches, I decided to give it a try. Maybe it's my own fault for expecting more than just a bunch of forced metaphors, shallow characters, and selfish, arrogant bulls***tery, but I kept pushing on hoping maybe it would get better. It didn't. And while I won't give away the ending, I will say that after closing the book, I couldn't help but wonder if most of the laughably strained prose was simply the result of Nersesian trying to make it just long enough to be considered a novel, then finally kicking back and thinking, \\"Cool, I can stop now.\\" I'm not going to be all dramatic and tell you not to waste your time -- as you've probably noticed, I'm kind of in the minority on this one -- but honestly, this is nowhere near the \\"underground literary treasure\\" it thinks it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Nersesian's first novel is still his best. This book is a raw, madcap, sometimes goofy -- but always fun -- story of a perpetual screw-up who can't catch a break to save his life. Sound familiar? This novel also offers the best tour of downtown New York City since Richard Perez's The Losers' Club. Of all of Nersesian's books, I prefer this one the best. It's a hilarious diamond in the rough.

Anyway, it is very amusing and he has a very keen eye on details of human nature. Although you can't quite relate if you're not an American or have lived in Manhattan, he makes it easy to keep up and dive into the metropolis. The character is so innocent and guilty at the same time, the way he distances himself from his surroundings and yet, the way he implicates himself in everything.

Everything about his life is a disaster, and apparently that's supposed to be what makes this book funny.

There is a girlfriend here, a love interest there, apathy towards work... looks to be a good New York pop-culture read.But the book just goes deeper and deeper into the unbelievable, uninteresting story of this guy whom you don't really care too much about.It's the worst type of book because it's not bad enough to throw away... just interesting enough where you think it'll turn around.Actually, the story is not so bad. It's kind of cool to see him sink lower and lower, and when you think he can't sink any lower, he does. What's really bad is the writing. It just lacks the quality of writing that you see in the better modern writers of our time (Nick Hornby is as pop culture as you can get, but his writing doesn't drive you mad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting book...","review":"It made me laugh, and it shocked, disappointed, and also amazed me.

Anyone familiar with Josephus or Pliny the Elder's writings would find this silly and unresearched. The author has started his own \\"School of Light\\" church around 1991,and this book is an expression of his philosophy- not a history of the Essenes. If you are looking for words like \\"Cosmic Intelligence\\" and \\"Universal Brotherhood\\", and like to sit in the Lotus position in a tai-chi uniform chanting and burning incense, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, the author would have you believe that Jesus was an Essene based on his underwear (p.2,3& John 19:23).

He was with the group for almost five years. Didn't he sing on some of their greatest hits of the early to mid seventies? Songs such as \\" Superstar \\", \\"Papa was a rolling stone\\" ( which won a grammy ), \\"Masterpiece\\", \\"Heavenly\\", and \\" A song for you \\" , among others? Being from Baltimore, Maryland , I take great pride in the fact that Damon was from my home town, and more importantly, in the fact that he sounded the most like Eddie,so much so, that most people who don't know when Eddie left the group, can't tell the difference.He sounded far more like Eddie than any other first tenor who has been in the group since. I do like Ron Tyson, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of a GROUP with class told by a MAN with class!","review":"Otis Williams is a class act as author of this book. I don't care what anyone says, the Temptations were men of style, class, and talent. At least their lyrics are appropriate descriptions of women's beauty and brains ('You've got a smile so bright, you know you could've been a candle,...'), which is much better than the degrading things women are called in today's songs. These men could sing circles around today's R&B groups.Williams is honest about the faults of his fellow Temptations (including himself), yet touchingly respectful of their legacy. I admire his work ethic, loyalty to the group, and refusal to continue taking garbage from Berry Gordy and demanding respect for the group. The Temptations have survived as a group mainly because of his and the late Melvin Franklin's tenacity and perseverance. As one of their famous songs says, may they 'keep on walking, and don't look back'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Regardless of what some narrow minded patriot may think, the facts cannot be denied. And, yes, Columbus was a very bad man. America was not discovered, it was stolen. I am still amazed at the apathy displayed in America when a correct history is published.I think the question that has troubled me for the past years is,\\"Since when has supporting America become the right thing to do?\\" We all know that is was stolen, and that it has been kept up in just as dishonorable a fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zinn's Opus","review":"I believe this should be a compulsory text in high schools, so students could get another point of view of \\"history\\", and people like George Bush, John Howard, and Tony Blair should be made to do a test to prove they have at least read it.Zinn provides a masterful analysis of 20th century world events from the point of view of the left, the downtrodden, people of colour and writes in an easy to read fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe In Him Anymore","review":"After reading that Howard Zinn does not think it is important to investigate 9/11, I will have nothing more to do with him.

I suppose that all histories have a point of view, and that a non-traditional point of view would be refreshing. But an America-sucks diatribe isn't refreshing at all. This history is made up almost entirely of quotations from primary sources. That's not an objection in itself, but it is clear that the sources were carefully selected only to present labor-movement and socialist orthodoxy. The admitted bias of the author, a \\"radical historian\\" whose opinions are featured on the Pacifica network among other places, leads to egregious oversimplifications, outright historical errors and laughable internal contradictions. This is not a \\"people's history\\" but a labor-organizer's history.

Further, the positive review of Zinn by the New York Times tells you more about the Times than it does about Zinn's book.Howard Zinn is the featured historian for thr Revolutionary Worker, Voice of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. The book is very much written from the Communist point of view and is required reading in many college history classes. Students, though, are not really aware of this writers background when they read the book.

Many details are revealed about Vasily Filatov, and it's presented over, and over, and over again. A good fifty to seventy pages could have been cut from this book, and still told the basic story. Do I believe these allegations that Alexei and Vasily Filatov are one person? No . . . but it's still nice to think that someone escaped the massacre. But no . . . I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Well Spent...Doing Something Else","review":"This book is absolute rubbish! Don't even waste your money on it.

With proper mastering, it's actually rather stunning just how much additional fidelity emerges from these decades-old recordings.From a material standpoint, Anthology has 16 tracks which do not appear on Collected, so if you already own that set, it's worth holding on to.The sixty remastered tracks on Collected only represent approximately one-third of Cale's recorded studio output.

You don't get this stuff by sticking a microphone in somebody's face - you get it by learning to think outside the box, by befriending the people behind the scenes who keep the studios, hotels, resorts, clubs, casinos and hospitals running, and by having the courage to stick your neck out and risk embarrassment, a beating or even arrest. Sternig is the rare breed of reporter who has the moxie to get the kinds of scoops the Enquirer wanted. If you want the real untold story of how they really get those stories, read Secrets of a Tabloid Reporter. My only complaint is that her book wasn't twice as long, because it was so much fun to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Know How They Do It","review":"I recently met Barbara Sternig on a cruise and in the course of our conversation she mentioned her previous occupation and that she had written a book about it.

It was written in a very easy style and kept your interest from page to page.The people she talks about in the book are easily recognizable and this makes the book even more exciting to read.Anyone who has ever seen or read these tabloid papers will find this book very interesting and I recommend it to anyone who has an 'inquiring mind and wants to know'......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible don't waste money","review":"I bought this to do porting.

For simply plotted well-paced space opera, this is it. If you are looking for anything more than pure escapist romp, look at Simmons or something else with a bit more sophistication. Well, honestly almost anything else would be more sophisticated. It has the funny deja-vu like feeling that all good pulp has--but this is a real doorstop of a book which frankly put me off. It's a bit of an investment in time for stuff that is really pure fluff. On the other hand, as people have pointed out, Gear can and does deliver the goods and it IS reasonably entertaining sf fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a teen age male you'll love it.","review":"Gear really knows how to target his audience. If you're a young male (majority of SF readers), i.e. you've got raging hormones corsing through your body and think mostly about sex, you're going to love this series.Every female character Gear describes is extremely beautiful with a great body. Every male is a buffed, take no prisoners warrior. There's even an avenging lesbian babe in it. What more could a young kid want?!I found the story line weak and the plot resolution a let down. Gear bounces the from battle to bed to battle to bed, which will grow very tiresome for serious SF readers.If you're into military SF and sex, buy it. Otherwise, this one is a leaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with the subtlety of a sledgehammer","review":"This space opera is so over-the-top it hurts to read it. The protagonists and antagonists are way larger than life, yet they do some rather bone-headed things at times.

This novel is a fictionalization of the life of Anthony Blunt, the esteemed art historian revealed late in life to have been a spy for the Soviet Union. Like other members of his spy circle, Blunt was raised in the heart of the British establishment just as many of its key institutions were losing their power to compel loyalty. Banville writes extremely well and does a wonderful job of conveying the ambivalent motivations and ambiguous actions of Blunt and his cohorts. Banville's portrait of his protagonist is hardly sympathetic and might be described as clinical but is compelling and richly detailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb novel","review":"Wonderful fictional rendering of a very famous (and real) spy story. At first, one is constantly tempted to ask oneself: \\"Did that really happen? Who was this character in real life?...\\" But soon the fake Anthony Blunt created by Banville comes to life so forcefully, with all his weaknesses, preciosity and, yes, grandeur that the factual story of the Cambridge four (or five) becomes somewhat irrelevant. You're there, at Cambridge in the 1930s, in London under German bombs, and so taken by the superb writing that you start wondering what you would have done in similar circumstances. Because it doe not claim to be a journalistic account, the book can go into all the nuances of a complex man's psyche. A wonderful read!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing reader","review":"You need plenty of patience to read this book. Slow and non-exciting to say the least. Very disapointed. I'll never buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Did Not Like It.","review":"If you want to read about a self-centered main character with no redeeming qualities, this is your book. If you want to read something that inspires you or teaches you something of value, this is not your book. To make matters worse, the author is one of those who insists on using overly complex sentence structures and words that are outside the normal vocabulary. I kept hoping that the book would yield something of value, but it didn't happen. Now I have to get rid of some nasty images that added nothing to the story except vulgarity. I am sorry that I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"A literary thriller that is too literary to be thrilling, this is a turgid, torpid and really boring novel about a very unintersting man. He finds his life story fascinating but you won't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and clichid","review":"I think Mr. Banville backed himself into a corner by making his narrator a total bore. His supposed insights are virtually all clichis. Though maybe I'm crazy, since the professional reviewers all seem to believe it's the best thing since the invention of the wheel. Anyway, I gave the book two stars because a large vocabulary should count for something in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovery of a new author and a great read!","review":"What a treat! Discovering a new author and enjoying the first book you read of theirs and then the awaited eagerness of reading their earlier books. The Untouchable is a wonderful, engrossing read with John Banville displaying a great gift for language and plot line. It was like the first Graham Greene or John LeCarre that I read, well-written, engrossing, a true protoypical page turner...I am curious now to see whether this is Banville's style, the exquisite use of language and biting and ironic humor or is it the \\"style\\" of Victor Maskell, the protagonist and narrator of this wonderfully written book..I highly recommend it to all espionage fans, anglophiles and anyone who is as fascinated as I am with the Cambridge/Cold War/Double agent phase of recent British history"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book, especially the depictions of London","review":"I thought that this book is sort of a London version of Bonfire of the Vanities (The Untouchable is also about the downfall of a somewhat sympathetic but befuddled elite gentleman). I'm living in London now and enjoyed the depictions of the city during the 20s, 30s, and the blitz. To me the sexuality and alcoholism seemed to be portrayed in a somewhat heavy handed and unsympathetic way. Funny, although I enjoyed the book, I would not recommend The Untouchable to friends to read. I guess it's too depressing. I agree with the reviewer who said it made me want to read more about the Cambridge spies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going downhill real fast","review":"When I reviewed The Dark Wing I gave it 4 stars but said it was a bit too mystical for me. I also thought you needed a glossary to keep track of all the alien mystic terms. By the time we get to The Dark Ascent, that glossary need to be an interactive dictionary run off a cray supercomputer. While some mysticism is certainly part of the storyline, this much is like The Dark Destroyer come to annihilate the storyline. I tried reading the health care bill and it was a very similar read. Since I purchased all 4 books in the series at the same time I will read the fourth one, but this is a really good storyline line which is well told but has been made into agony trying to keep track of the very many mystical heroes and terminology.

For all the tasks descibed, which is basically what this book is, there is little explanation about how to do it, how to do it better, or what is the reason to do it.

Even the fatal gunshot was always in the same chest spot. I guess the props people must have used the same red paint blood seeping vest over and over again. That's the whole movie.Dialogue was bizarre in that it sounded more like some one from Hollywood trying to imagine how people talked back then. Always amusing when they use some contemporary phrasing.Acting was mostly a crew with little experience or maybe a few TV spots and a few well known titles such as \\"Terror at Blood Fart Lake\\", \\"Stiffed\\", \\"The Stink of Flesh\\", \\"Rotgut\\".Directing and cinematography gave us a lot of scenery of sage brush desert.

This six foot folding rule is more durable than the old one as it is made of fiberglass instead of wood. It is the same length as my old six foot rule, so that is good. Works for carpenters also as they thoughtfully made the multiples of sixteen inches red. Sixteen, for you non-carpenters, is the common centers for 2X4 spacing in construction. Handy that sixteen is a factor of forty-eight so that you can put three supports evenly spaced on a four foot sheet of drywall or plywood sheeting/decking. If you ever use a rule that has the numbers starting on the inside of the rule instead of the outside, you will wonder why anyone uses a rule printed the other way. This item is well made and tight.

Open the 6\\" end, it is 12\\" end to end.Opening each fold starting with the 6\\" produces 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66 and 72\\".With the 8\\" produces 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 56, 62, 68 and 72\\".Not so with this new rule. Either way you open you get 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67 and 72\\".Not the useful measurement dimensions of the different endpieces.Maybe this is made where the metric system rules and it makes no difference on metric rules, but it matters to me, hence my disappointment.The other disappointment is the tightness of the joints.

It is very strong as I have steped on it a few times. I've used similar style wooden rulers for 40 years but this one beats them all. I learned about this style of ruler from an \\"old finish\\" carpenter who build my parent's housed om the early 50s. I now have 4 friends who would not use any other style.

Mr.Gaellano brings all of these complexities to the forefront. He has a fine sense for the game as well as the immediate world surrounding it. A superb book for those interested in the universal appeal football.

Don't get me wrong, it's worth playing at least once, but not worth buying in the long run Save yourself some money, rent the game and buy a good crime game like the Getaway or something. If you're looking for a game that offers nothing but rather mindless bloodshed then this game is perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One fun game that will keep you busy for weeks","review":"This game seriously is the cream of the crop. GTA3/4 in one pack.....for $50. How much better can it get? This game is extremely fun and will provide much entertainment. Many of you may think this game is too violent but go to any arcade and they have shooting cop games where you shoot up aliens. This is no different, its a video game so get over it. There are some flaws however:1. Sometimes a cop runs into you and then immediatly arrest you even though you were just sitting in your car.2. The physics are better than GTA3 in vice city but they still need some work. You can still knock down poles even though you really didn't hit them, you were just close.Despite these minor flaws the game still rocks and will have you laughing your head off. Going for as long as you can evading the cops with 6 stars is quite fun. Have contests with your friends and see who can shoot up the most cops and cause the most damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game - sketchy port","review":"GTA3 and GTA:VC are old news these days, and you've probably heard everything you need to hear about the gameplay and the overall idea of the game. I just want to add that - as a gamer who has beaten both the PS2 and xbox versions of both games - the quality of the port to xbox is a little off. You can walk through some walls or get 'stuck' in places here and there. Not what I'd expect from Rockstar, especially since the PS2 versions of both games are relatively free of those kinds of issues.Otherwise, a great game for adults that's only just now beginning to show its age. Though I'll bet that once Halo2 arrives it will look positively archaic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great games at one price.","review":"This is like buying two great games at one price .Even better i bought the game pack used and it is in excellent condition.The graphics are great.The freedom to move around the enviroment is the best.The missions are challenging as well as interesting without being seemingly impossible.Leave it to Amazon.com to offer used products in excellent condition.Trust me you'll love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome on almost every aspect","review":"This game will have you hooked. Not having a PS2 or a $1000+ gaming PC, i waited for this title to hit Xbox. and the wait was well worth it. everyone mentions the better graphics than PS2, but fails to mention that the draw-area has been expanded... meaning if your driving down the wrong side of the road at top speed, a truck won't suddenly pop up in front of you (like i noticed happen on a friend's PS2), it'll be drawn a long way down the road.The Graphics are excellent considering it's on a console and you have these huge cities sitting in memory.

(and I did not own it)For the XBox, I give this game two stars because the controls are not easy to use. (aka not set up like the play station) For instance to target a person you have to cycle to the right until you get to the person on the left. Looking and shooting is also a problem because of predefined controls.There are game glitches. Such as getting stuck on cardboard boxes. If you hit card board box while driving 80 mph it brings you to a dead stop. You cannot save certain cars in the garage, such as the police car. Your character gets stuck in walls way to easy. The Police also seem a little less effective.These are just a few and I only played for 2 hours. I know there are going to be more error. I just did not feel like wasting my time.

Sure it's fantasy, but I hated the character, and wanted to play as someone else, namely a cop, so I could give the main character the beat down he deserves. Basically, I wanted to lose. Plus, the graphics are horrible, and stink of the game's PS2 heritage. The guy's legs look like sausages, and the other citizens look like circus freaks. Some textures on buildings are so blurry and low res it looks like an N64 game. The only good thing I have to say is the soundtrack is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"promotion to abuse","review":"The excellent graphics are great but why waist those on promoting abuse and destruction?This product is adding to the numbness our youth already has toward care and concern for others.Yes, we hope 17 and up are the only ones who can access this.

Heitger's trumpet playing really knocks me out, but too often in the past he was buried in the surroundings of the performance. Then I listened and felt dissapontment again. Here Jimmy Mazzy's vocals get top priority; it's a rather restrained set because of that. Mazzy sings well enough with his gravelly, quavering voice, but I gladly would have sacrificed some of those vocals for more Heitger. Duke is especially terrific when he puts a mute in the horn, which he does frequently, usually for his solo choruses in the middle of a tune. Butch is as competent as ever, though also restrained. Not a bad CD, but it didn't match my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"great razors, best deal i found","review":"I've been using these razors for years and love that I can buy them on amazon for a fraction of the price. i always do a search and choose the lowest priced ones that are in factory packaging. i guess there are fakes out there, but i don't know if i've ever bought any. these seem great to me and a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"There is some good information, but it is buried amougst stuff you can get for free in the help files."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must !","review":"This is the real bible for MS Project !

It sounds like it has a short or something. When it is working, my husband found the loops annoying, but it didn't bother me or the children. The other major complaint I have is that if the power blinks off in a thunderstorm or wind storm, this machine, which we normally have set to the waterfall (white noise), comes back to life in the rainforest setting, and we are awakened to the hellish cacaphony of bird calls. That is really a dealbreaker for us! We're trying something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound for the price","review":"The only reason this product didn't receive 5 stars is because the ocean waves don't really sound like ocean waves once you turn the sound up.

I use the rain setting overnight to help me sleep/stay asleep and that works for me. No issues with the buttons or the sound dial. No issues with the speaker. This is set up across the room from where I sleep and so I turn it up fairly loud and it doesn't distort on the other settings that I use it on.If you're a mother of an infant, the heart beat setting is perfect for your newborn.

I need to buy a new one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We've had probably 5 Homedics noise-makers and/or noise-maker / alarm clocks and my wife and I have joked that only one of those products still works without issues. We've probably taken 3 other clocks / noise makers back due to issues over the years. Unfortunately, there aren't many other manufacturers in this price range with these types of products. One thing is consistent with 90% of the Homedics prodcuts we've owned: they break down quickly. So, be prepared to deal with product issues and be prepared there will be a good chance you'll have to replace what you buy sooner than you thought you would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This item is a piece of gooey, brown stuff.

Now I cannot get the volume adjusted correctly without a lot of static.Maybe I just got a lemon, becuase I own several other HoMedics products, and haven't had a problem with then.

And while it is cute, it only sings a single song and does very little except wobble across the floor. It doesn't lend itself to imaginative play and so is pretty much a one-hit wonder. And that one hit isn't much of a hit. My daughter is a major Dora fan, loves to read (look at) Dora books and watch the show a LOT.

It is still a great reference, but I advise traditional Catholics to find the original text published by the same author under the title \\"We and Our Children\\". The traditional Latin Mass was explained in beautiful detail in the original version, but in this edition, most of the descriptions were eliminated to make it \\"modern\\" and match the new Mass from the 1970s.

It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advice, based on experience","review":"We are using this book in our book club and have found it inspiring as mothers. It brings up some good points with practical ways to implement them. For example, we all know we need to teach our kids to see Christ in others, but that can be hard to explain when there is someone that is really mean to them. Page 50 gives a great way to explain that when someone wrongs you they are hurting Christ even more than they hurt you; we need to use that opportunity to pray for that person. The author of this book had 7 children of her own and uses her own experiences for the basis of the book. I highly recommend it---good for couples to read together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good perspective","review":"We enjoyed this book cover to cover.

I can't wait to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every Catholic parent with one caution.","review":"The author has many terrific ideas on how to incorporate a love of God and our faith in the routine of every day life. It's probably best to pick a few ideas one likes and not try and follow absolutely everything the author advises. Because I couldn't help wondering half jokingly if her children aren't in mental wards now as a result of such an upbringing. In my humble opinion, I think she goes a touch overboard. God bless! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Occasionally a grouping of great musicians creates a transcendent force of communicative music - and all of the Joe Pass and Ella Fitgerald albums manifest that. The way each of them swing together is perfectly complementary. Joe Pass is ever the complimentary musician to Ella, and Ella puts her heart into every song. Some may say that her prime was when she was younger, singing with the big band and her duets with Louis Armstrong. Bear in mind that I find these sessions stunning. But I believe this simpler, more revealing is one of the greatest display of her musicianship, and the perfect display of all of Joe Pass's skills. His ability to play in such small settings such as this set him apart from almost every other jazz guitarist, and the balance between him and Ella is perfect. In short, I would highly recommend any of the Ella and Joe duet albums to anyone. I doubt any would regret purchasing this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aquaman...SHOULD BE A SHOW!","review":"Ok, If you love smallville like i do then you will love this!

Its about Bradley, a kid who's trying to stop the teachers' evil plan of operation misteach, which is very very dangerous to adults because teachers don't like adults and the kids (after operation misteach) will do whatever the teacher tells them to do. First the teachers take them for a bus ride. Then they take them on a blimp ride to Apple Island and Bradley escapes and after many hardships and making many new friends he finally rescues his class.I recommend this book to any number of action adventure good joke loving readers who want a good book.

Perhaps I'm missing some beautiful subtlety in Krishnamurti's words, but I felt that he did an amazing job of speaking endlessly without really saying much of anything. How many words does one really need to teach his central point, that one should think for oneself? He mentions repeatedly in his book that the reader shouldn't even be listening to him, so I eventually took his sage advice and put the book down! I'm an avid reader and I have to say that I can't think of another book that frustrated me as much as this one. I just kept reading, hoping for some worthwhile insights, but I never found much hidden in his resolute verbosity.

The problem there is that they also copied over the same errors they had in the full texts. In addition, at least in the Active Directory section, the Case Studies they copied were out-of-context and didn't include all the data that had been in previous chapters in the full book.It WAS educational to track down the mistakes, though.Overall, I would call this effort a combination of knowledge gaps on the part of the authors and a very poor job of editing and proofreading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special about it...","review":"I got this book last March 2001 and read it all, it lacks a lot of useful information needed for real life and/or Exam pass; the labs and exercises are available on the companion CD only.

It also has other capabilities which make this a real find, especially at this price. The dimensionality of the stereophonic sound was really quite startling when I first gave it a run-through. Aside from the standard playback capabilities (DVD and CD) this set also plays MP3's and Kodak photodiscs. On the downside, I found that a few of the functions (including scan) are accessable only through the credit card-sized remote.

Using the included S-Video adapter and S-Video input on the unit, I ended up with a first rate home DVD player.In the last year, the player has gone on three road trips and two more flights, without a major problem. .The bottom line is, I have been more than satisfied with this player.

This book (Business Buyer's Kit) does appear to have some seemingly original value in the \\"Checklist\\" appendices at the book's end.

In other words, it is very broad and does not give specifics. You might say the reason for this is because the author does not concentrate on buying a business from a specific industry, yet when giving examples he always uses a product based business. Even then the examples are very broad based. And there is little if no mention of a service oriented business.The only reason I give this book a 2 is because of the worksheets at the end. A person looking to buy a business will probably find the worksheets useful, but that is the extent of value this book provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one belongs in my personal library","review":"I like the manner Mr Smorenburg approached this complicated subject of business acquisition - simple, clear and complete.

However the other parts of this unit were not so great (on the one I got). The dual head tire chuck (probably not made by Milton) was defective and leaked constantly out of one head. I purchased a look-a-like dual chuck at a local hardware store but when I tried to replace the defective one, I discovered the threads on the fitting at the end of the hose had been cross threaded. No go for that one too. So I finally just cut off the end fitting and put on a hose barb and a quick disconnect so I can use multiple types of chucks. Now it works fine and as I said, valve unit is the best I have ever seen. I bought the MIL version; the problems make me wonder what the difference is between this one and the standard S506."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using brings back memories of the past","review":"I am almost 73 years of age and remember the time when gasoline was to be bought for 0.20 to 0.25 cents a gallon in service stations found on almost every corner of the major intersections in a city or town. In those days every station provided \\"FREE\\" air for your car tires and the tire inflator with built in gauge looked and operated just like this Milton dual chuck Tire Inflator with Gauge. The new gauge I received was easy to install on my air hose and easy to use as I checked the pressure in all of my tires and add the required air or release any extra air pressure that existed all in one operation. So much better than checking with a gauge, removing gauge, adding air, rechecking, often having to add more air (or release any extra air I inadvertently added), then rechecking with gauge until I finally get the proper reading of PSI on the one tire. The material this gauge is made from looks to be top quality and very sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's some tech info...","review":"This model (S506) is a well built gauge with great features such as the dual chuck head and swivel connection. Missing information on the amazon site caused me to find the Milton catalog online: [...]This gauge reads in 2psi increments from 10-160psi (see page 18 of the catalog) making it more capable than most home air compressors. The other thing I was curious about was the \\"S\\" prefix - it simply means the product is skinned (packaged for display - see FAQ's in back of catalog). I gave the tool a 4 because it is a bit difficult to read and the accuracy is slightly off - it tends to read 2-4psi high compared to other gauges. However, I feel the benefits outweigh these two minor issues as compared to the shortcomings of other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I check tire inflation regularly using a standard tire pressure guage and it's fill/check, fill/check until I get the correct pressure.

It was so vivid and colorful... very interesting to watch. I found myself following the storyline without having to focus solely on the subtitles. As a result, I could appreciate the landscapes, the costumes, the hidden innuendos... all the first time around. This movie is definitely for those that can truly appreciate the pure essence and beauty of female friendship. There is a scene near the end when the uppity, seemingly prudish Momoko staunchly defends and protects her rough-around-the-edges biker friend, Ichigo that made us want to cheer.

The screen is constantly alive, filled with lush details & comic asides you'll need several viewings to appreciate fully.

The soundtrack is excellent and was composed primarily by Yoko Kanno. While it is primarily a comedy it is also a story of friendship between two girls who in some ways are very different but in other ways are very much the same. It is a very colorful film, and of course the lolita clothes are very cute. The rewatchability of this movie is high. I have watched it several times and enjoy it every time! The main characters live in a town called Shimotsuma. The Japanese title of this film is Shimotsuma Monogatari (Shimotsuma Story). I have the HK DVD which is pretty nice, but I will buy this US version too when released. I hope it includes some bonus features. This movie is highly recommended!

THe taped voice is difficult to understand, and even I have trouble understanding the clues Dora gives you. I also don't like the way the pants covered the battery compartment- they could spare a little more fabric. Also, since Dora is known for carrying her backpack around, why wasn't this doll diven a backpack to hold all the objects. It's just a matter of time before we lose a piece.An additional note to parents of Dora fans- if you get enough of the Dora talking toys, you find that they all say about the same thing.

We have even taken out the toys and she still goes on and on about them instead of saying goodbye. And poor Dora sings the same song over and over and her head must hurt because it and her hand clicks while she is singing.Yes, my daughter has no idea of Dora's flaws but I feel that for $30 you should get a good product.

My husband suggested that maybe there is a Spanish mode, but there is no \\"Spanish\\" button to be found.

When using this tripod it gives you a stable platform for a good price. Just be gentle and you'll be OK.In my case, the handle clamps failed on the first time in the field and spider on the third time in the field. The problem with this tripod is that critical parts are either made of soft metal or brittle plastic. However, the tripod comes with a good warranty. I sent it back to Tiffen for a warranty repair. In the meantime, I used an old Vanguard tripod I've owned for 15 years without a problem and I've slugged it all over the world. However, at 6.5lbs, it doesn't have the weight for windy conditions. That's important with video because you want a stable platform.If you're a pro, dig deep for a pro brand like Gitzo or Manfrotto and pass this by. These sticks are prosumer quality -- not pro. Best advise. Take your camera to a local store and get hands on with these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera Plate (sled) doesn't fit","review":"The tripod is a bit heavy, but I knew that going in. Dual handles is cool. Movement of the fluid head is great for this price range. Just one problem. The camera plate (often referred to as the sled) is almost impossible to lock with a camera on it because the metal bracket that the screw on the side tightens (to lock the plate into place) malfunctions. Strangely enough, it's harder to explain than it should be. Lets just say, short of filing the edge of the cameraplate or cutting a new sled tightening screw size, securing the camera in place on the tripod is almost impossible. I have tripods at several ranges above and below this one, but this is the first that fails to function on the most basic level. A pity too, because as I said before the fluid head has great motion and spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye rolling corny/plot went nowhere","review":"What little plot there was came to no conclusions.
