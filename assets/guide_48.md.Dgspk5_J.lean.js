I quit halfway through.The cinematography of this series is the only redeeming quality. However, this does not make up for the complete lack of a plot.Whereas Band of Brothers used graphic violence only as a means to provide some understanding of the anguish the soldiers went through. This series uses graphic violence as a novelty. Then there are the episodes where absolutely NOTHING happens.Once again, Band of Brothers was amazing. Furthermore, my grandfather fought in the Pacific, so I also had personal reasons to anticipate this series. I was let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as \\"Band of Brothers","review":"Seems like someone said \\"let's see if we can squeak even more revenue out of the Band of Brothers success\\". The acting fell far short of the original, although the filming was decent. The story line was disjunct and you never quite got to know any of the characters. I'm not a prude but I didn't appreciate the unnecessary nudity (somewhat of an HBO trademark I guess). Finally, as a music lover, the score just never hit home for me. I'll probably donate this to the library. I won't want to watch it repeatedly as I do with Band of Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starting really slow","review":"OK, maybe I need to wait until I've watched the whole thing, but I've gotten through the first three discs and this is sloooooooow!Well, I made it through the whole set of discs and have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. The pace of the story did pick up and the Marine Corps never looked better. But, I think they could have done a better job. Doesn't compare to Band of Brothers, and I'm a former Marine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad and pathetic attempt.","review":"I couldn't wait for this series to come out being a huge fan of band of brothers, unfortunately in the end it was rather disappointing. In band of brother you got to learn about the characters and you started to feel as if you knew them personally but with the pacific you have a random group if guys you doing ever really connect with. The series was 95% dialog, 1% sex, and 4% battle wich in my opinion made it rather slow and uninteresting. All in all it, to me, was a disappointment and nothing I would ever buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up!","review":"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas because he really liked Band of Brothers. He loved it. Neither of us experienced WWII in person, but the series was realistic and gritty. I think I read reviews by people who said they were there and it wasn't real. My father and uncle felt it was pretty acurate. They also liked Band of Brothers. Bottom line, if you liked Band of Brothers, you will probably like this, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richardson review","review":"This series is excellently done. It's moving and gives those of us who knew very little about most of the Pacific battles an understanding of what went really on. Without any gratuitous sex, blood and gore, it depicts the horrendous level of all that stuff realistically and helps the viewer understand why those who went through it can't talk about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"After having enjoyed Band of Brothers, I was looking forward to gifting my 16 year old son, a history buff, with this sequel series. We watched the first 2 episodes and, thankfully, I checked the rest of the series ahead of my son. This material should be X-rated for the prolonged and graphic scenes of sex and the extreme and unnecessary gore. What happened to the film producers??? This is perverse and polluting. Nothing in common with the appropriate reality (even harsh) of Band of Brothers. I only wish I had thought of checking IMDb before removing the clear plastic cover of the metal box, so I could get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pacific","review":"Great DVD pack, comes in a nice tin case just like band of brothers did.

What was HBO thinking? I know this isn't Band of Brothers, but with the same people in charge you would expect somethingcomparable. Not even close. This is pure rubbish with graphic sex scenes that add no value to the series. The series protrays the marines in a veryvery negative manner and it is an insult to those who fought and died in the Pacific campaigns. The acting isn't good so it is hard to connect to thecharacters, plus it jumps around to much. I purchased Band of Brothers to watch whenever I want to, but this mess is something I won't buy or watch ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT HOT!","review":"I know Tom Hanks worked on this, and that Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece, but this was just not that good. I know that there are time constraints when it comes to film making, but the way they glossed overthe battle for Guadalcanal was disservice not only to all who fought there, but also to the true telling of the story. The US Marines started the battle on August 7th 1942, and the Japanese didn't finally leave untilFebruary 7th of 1943. To watch the battle in the HBO special, you might think it was over in few days and not all that bad. And Tarawa was even worse. The Pacific Theater was a horrible dirty war. If we want to try to never have war again, maybe our \\"specials\\" on WWII should be more accurate. They should show just how bad it really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best war series I have ever watched!!!","review":"All around great 10 part series by HBO. Just as good as Band of Brothers. War scenes are great. Characters are all good! Must have if you are into war movies/series. I think people who are not will still enjoy this. Sounds great on the home theater also!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"In a word: Disappointing. I was a big fan of BoB, but do not subscribe to HBO so I waited until the DVD set came out to watch the series. I couldn't even get to the end. By the 5th episode I had given up on the series, which seemed to have dedicated inordinate amounts of time swapping back and forth between the drudgery of training to the indiscretions of Marines on leave (all of which you can see elsewhere with better detail). Further, the almost perpetual state of physical and mental decay amongst the Marines was unrealistic and even absurd at times. Oh, and where was the Navy in this series?The series became disinteresting very early, the characters were not likable and the plot devolved into something out of a daytime soap. Nothing about this series was memorable, with the exception of the memories of the money I won't get back after having bought it.Save your time and money. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLS do not buy this...............","review":"I rated this series one star, because if you invest more than 200 million dollars in a story, you can't place main characters like the ones in \\"The Pacific\\". This is much less than I expected from Spielberg and also Hanks, after \\"Band of Brothers\\", unfortunately, the writhers failed to provide action and flow to the series you can't ever connect with the characters and their roles as in \\"Band of Brothers\\", the quality of The Pacific as a story is poor and really disappointing. \\"Band of Brothers\\" was the best war/action series ever made, but \\"The Pacific\\" was more than a huge mistake is just a piece of crap, it didn't deserve a place in my over 1500 DVD & Blu-Ray collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Writing, not nearly as good as Band of Brothers","review":"Really disappointing.

A lot of research went into this production and its clear it was done by professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Band of Brothers, then you should probably watch it again.","review":"If you're into the actual history behind the miniseries the books are much, much better. Many liberties have been taken with the stories to make it into a Hollywood production. If you actually care about what happened and the men who fought the war read the books. If you want to see a \\"based on a true story\\" Hollywood movie, you might enjoy it. It doesn't come close to Band of Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Band of Brothers","review":"Formulaic and full of cliches.... this is not band of brothers. It's saving grace is that it accurately outlines the timing of important battles in the pacific during the war and makes it feel more intimately tied to the people in combat rather than the generals pushing markers around a hexagonal grid."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing historical presentation of Pacific War","review":"This takes the Band of Brothers sort of WWII series to new level. The Blu Ray is amazing for both visuals and sound. Forget all the blathering by right wingers, this shows the horrible conditions faced by Marines in the Pacific, honors their bravery and courage, and makes it plain that fighting the Japanese could be a lot more brutal than fighting the \\"civilized\\" Germans. One thing I miss with this is a lack of coverage of Navy and naval battles. You only get a sense of what is going on in the water on a few occasions. While this is not completely historically accurate--it is a composite based on several classic WWII memoirs--it does a good job with its source material. It does an especially decent treatment of Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\" (which is a must read for anyone interested in WWII combat from a Marine's perspective.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Didn't think Band of Brothers could be topped or equaled in any way but they deffinetly did it. Very intense"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the writing? A complete dud.","review":"1. I had high hopes for this HBO series like many folks based on the Band of Brothers etc... But unfortunately, this mini-series was a complete dud. It makes me wonder... a lot of things, but the chief among them is the buring question: who in the world wrote this tangential mini-series. As with many things in life, it all comes down to the fundamentals and in films that means solid writing and solid acting. The acting was ok, but with the completely terrible writing, it just made the mini-series barely watchable.2. It's something that could have been great, but unfortunately was marred back the lack of a coherent story and solid writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you thought this would be like \\"Band of Brothers\\", you were wrong.

Like many other reviews I too was disappointed only because I was expecting something more along the lines of BoB. With that aside, The Pacific was a very good series. It tells of the hard times the Marines had, the suffering they went through, the sleepless nights for fear of the Japs might sneak into camp and cut your throat. If you are expecting another Band of Brothers, it isn't here. If you want to watch a good series about the War in the Pacific, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was purchased for someone else","review":"My husband grew weary of trying to purchase the DVD set at our local Walmart, it was only available in \\"blueray\\".

I think it captures the change that soldiers went through and the inhumanity that WWII brought with its truly horrific and unimaginable battles, and gives us a glimpse into the lives of the US Marine Corps. The acting is great, and they do a wonderful job of connecting the audience to the characters, though the focus is more on the war than \\"Band of Brothers\\" I think, but I feel that Hanks and Spielberg have created another war epic that will preserve the truth, history, and stories of what happened in the Pacific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"After seeing Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, I'd wished Spielberg and Hanks would also put their talents to work on a story about the Pacific theater during WWII. The Pacific was great but not as good as the first two. I'm still glad I purchased it and will watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by 12 year olds","review":"No focus of story and dialog that sounds like it was written by a 12 year old kid playing with his plastic army men.

At best.","review":"I knew before I sat down to watch this that I wouldn't like it as much as Band of Brothers. I'm a former paratrooper, not a former Marine. But I still thought I would at least enjoy it on some level. After 4 episodes I realized that I really don't care at all for this miniseries. I didn't care for the plot. I didn't care for the relationships being built (or not built) between the characters. I didn't even care for the characters. I'm sure my love for Band of Brothers set my expectations pretty high for The Pacific but I didn't realize that I'd be so disappointed that I wouldn't bother watching any episodes after the fourth one. I'm so glad I rented this before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Spielberg and Hanks","review":"I was disgusted with the leftist bent in this series.

The residue of marks caused the DVD so stop, skip and stutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male Porno","review":"This movie was not even close to the same caliber as Band of Brothers. It is poorly written, boring, hard to keep track of what's going on. There is no lack of male nudity which definitely takes away from the movie. To be fair, I stopped watching the series half way through on account of not wanting to see any more full frontal nude body shots of men. Tom Hanks, is there something you want to share with us?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story was good, but no Band of Brothers","review":"I mirror the same comments of those who found it hard to connect with the characters portrayed in The Pacific. But, at the end of the series, unlike Band of Brothers, I think the mission of the mini-series was to portray the misery of the war in the Pacific as the main \\"character\\". For that, I think the work hit the mark. But personally speaking, what made Band of Brothers one of my all time favorites was the sense of connection with all of the characters while portraying the good and bad of war. I do look forward for the release of the BD as I cannot wait to hear it in a more lossless format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While this series had incredibly high production values, and was visually stunning, it was quite a disappointment.Decent acting. Poor character development. Sluggish pace. No memorable dialog. All it has going for it is looks. Shallow.Even with the barrage of masterfully done battle scenes, I struggled to make it through the entire series.Stick with Band of Brothers. If you want Pacific Theater drama, go with The Thin Red Line, and the Letters from Iwo Jima / Flags of our Fathers combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy","review":"Tom Hanks and HBO both boast that they're honoring our Pacific Theatre vets. The film proves otherwise. I've read both E.B. Sledge and Robert Leckie's books about the Marines in Pacific. The books With the Old Breed and Strong Men Armed do not once go into the pornographic depictions delivered by Tom Hanks and HBO. HBO totally missed the mark. The film could have better honored the men by leaving out the raw sex scenes. It could have also focused more on the goodness of the men inherent in this Greatest Generation instead of embellishing and exaggerating the minority few poor traits that may have existed. This series will make you come away with less admiration for our vets than they deserve. The licentiousness was completely inappropriate and took away from any good the film boasted that it delivered. I recommend instead to read the books and stay away from this lackluster production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic,BUT...","review":"A truly great series, my ONLY complaint is the back and forth shooting being very difficult to follow.If only there was a better way to portray such action for viewers. Also, difficult to tell who's being shot as everyone seems the same, being a 50+ viewer, it is difficult to follow such scenes. Very enjoyable otherwise and would highly recommend.

The battle scenes shot at night are very difficult to follow. Most of the battle scenes shot during the day resemble a mob running blindly into gun fire. Watching this made me think that the Marines of WWII were the most poorly trained soldiers on the planet who could be psychologically broken en masse and were guilty of absolutely brutal mob behavior. This was basically a Hollywood Vietnam War interpretation of the WWII Pacific theater of WWII. It was a completely inaccurate portrayal of some of the finest soldiers in the world and not entertaining at all. There was little character development, weak story telling and continuous foul language. This series is an absolute waste of time and money.

Nothing I saw in TP compared to excellent portrayal of Major Winters by Damian Lewis from BoB. I just couldn't latch on to any of the characters.

The metal box is made of tin-foil thin metal that does less to protect the DVDs than cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"I already owned Band of Brothers, and since this was produced by Tom hanks and Steven Spielberg, I thought I was in for a real treat. Don't let the directors or the packaging fool you into this being anything like Band of Brothers. I felt everything from the plot, acting, and combat scenes were subpar. Don't get me wrong, the scenes of the marines invading the islands are pretty impressive, but thats were anything impressive stops. Yes, this series does focus closely on a few marines. The only problem is there is only two that the story keeps focusing on. Some of the actors you think are main characters either die or mysteriously disappear. I bought this to focus on the war, on the action, and see the MAIN CHARACTERS develop a bond along with assisting the story to develop. None of this happened so I am awarding this series 1-Star. Seriously, just buy a paper weight that is the same shape and size as this collection because you will get more joy out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pacific","review":"It was a wonderful series since my father was in World War 2, Also Korea and Viet Nam. He was to proud to serve in the US Marine Corps. He retired in 1970 and my husband retired from the Marine Corps. He served in Viet Nam.

That said, I do recommend The Pacific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As real as it gets for movies","review":"As a former Marine this is about as real as it can get on movies. It is riveting lacking only the true fear of yourself actually being the target. Many that were in actual combat contributed to and were in such emotional circumstances that that they couldn't talk about their experiences but kept them locked inside their souls. Some times when these experiences were released they exploded. Pacific has captured this emotion although it will be disturbing for some to watch.I think Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are to congratulated for showing that in a period of history common men and women never felt \\"they deserved\\" from their country but were willing to give all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pacific is what it isn't","review":"I would rate this 5 stars, but I don't think everyone will like this as much as it is worthy. The comparison to band of brothers is unavoidable, but probably not the best way to judge this. Band of brothers was amazing. I was a huge fan of that series. The thing about band of brothers is it is a war movie in the fact that you watch it and think wow what an experience. Even with all the death and suffering in Band of Brothers I wonder how many young kids watch it and want to enlist or wish they could have fought the Nazis is WWII. The pacific does not glorify the war. It gives a brutally honest portrayal of the hell these soldiers went through. It makes us all appreciate what those men did for their country in its time of need. If band of brothers left you're teenager wanting to join up and explore the world make him or her watch the pacific to get the full picture.

Now this on the other hand really shows what the marines went through, it was a totally different enemy, setting, weather, combat missions, objectives and everything else that has to do with war.

It was well-received by all, but the one reservation my husband reported having was that he missed one of the plot threads integral to the book. Obviously a miniseries or movie based on a text will have differences--glaring or otherwise, and it's the prerogative of the filmmakers to change elements of the written version in the interest of visual effect. Not a new concept. Anyway, I would recommend viewing before buying, if possible (?), especially if you are a fan of the book. My husband, father, and father-in-law (the recipients of this gift) are all American history teachers, and they did like this miniseries, though they agree that nothing holds a candle to \\"Band of Brothers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad But True","review":"Hi: EveryoneWell we all know that War is tragic! In this movie it is no different! The American Solders of the Pacific Fight asked to have their story told. This is an epic to be in an attempt to do just that. Did they succeed, well only the men and women that were there can tell us! I know this, my heart bleeds for these men and women in this movie in the same way my heart ways heavy on Veterans Day! I have family who served our country and maybe you do too. The picture quality and sound quality is awesome! The format a little hard to follow, I had to watch twice before I realized there is two chapters on each disc. I highly recommend this film to anyone.

The depths to which the left will sink (Hanks/Spielberg) are on full display in their denegration of our cherished and revered troops and veterans. You may recall Hanks making the rounds all over TV during the release of this series, attempting to convince us the war in the pacific was a \\"war of racism\\". What a shallow, silly, stupid man Hanks appears to now be. Oh, and it's completely historically inaccurate...such as the embelished version of Basilone's demise. Basilone, a recipient of the Medal of Honor, certainly deserves at the least to be portrayed accurately, or not at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Profanity and Sex","review":"I am very disappointed with this mini series. It is garbage compared to Band of Brothers.There is no actual testimonies of veterans fighting in the pacific as there was in Band of Brothers. This lack of testimonies makes it feel like this is a realistic fiction TV show instead of the real life anecdotes of American Heroes. There is no clear relation between the different characters, the use of profanity is excessive and mostly unnecessary and the sex scenes are way too many and irrelevant to the plot. Men in full frontal nudity, sex in every disc!

It is No Band of Brothers!! Horribly executed, poor character depictions, ridiculous story lines. It really was disappointing. There was too much emphasis placed on how horrible war is, how terrible the killing is (as if anyone needs to be reminded of this), and not enough emphasis on the extraordinary accomplishments of the military in the Pacific.

And I feel cheated. I was expecting highly detailed maps, showing spawn areas, NPCs, etc. I would have also expected a series of maps for dungeons/instances. Instead, I've got a book of maps that, like others have said, are nothing more than blown-up versions of the maps from in-game. And there are some major errors; from mislabeled flight routes for the Alliance, to NO DUNGEON MAPS!! My advice for others looking to buy this. DON'T!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Like other reviewers here, I expected a lot more from this book.The front half is just blown up maps from the game with grid overlays on and the locations of vendors and griff points. (I should note it's accurate only up to patch 1.7 - it still has the old Silithus map, not the new one).The second half is basically hand-drawn maps of the towns, which are fairly nice. However, there are no maps of instances in here (which I fully expected).At the back are lists of minerals, skins, and other stuff. Some of this is useful - the list of Rare Mobs is particularly interesting - but it's nowhere near enough to make getting this book worthwhile. I'm feeling like I rather wasted my money on this one, even if I did get it cheaper than the listed price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ATLAS !","review":"Sigh. What a rip-off. World Maps are just copies of the completed in-game WoW maps with little or no additional information on them. Town maps are hand-drawn and sorta nice, but since towns in WoW are very small, they are also pretty useless. In fact the maps and info in the original guide are far, far superior to this, so buy that guide instead. And the final insult, my hard-bound copy of this guide was bound upside down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from Brady Games","review":"While the printing is acceptable and the binder seems sturdy enough, the maps feel hastily done like they were just screen shots from the game and enlarged without any sharpening. Most of the pertinent information is at the back of the book, not kept with the maps. Rare spawns are not marked on the maps making them a pain to find. There are also no instance maps in this book at all. If you insist on having everything WoW related then you might like this book, otherwise you will be disappointed at the quality and content."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it says","review":"Atlas definition= A collection of maps of different regions of the world.I just picked this up 2 weeks ago and have to say it's a true Atlas plus.Apparently these other reviewers have never actually seen a real Atlas, I doubt it shows the location of the guy that will take you down the river and back on your family trip. They block out the maps so you can exp playing the game, not be handfed ...try exploring.It has easily readable text and the graphical detail is good. It gives locations on Flight Paths,Dungeon Instances,Vendors,Flight Masters,Trainers,City Officials,(Quick Referance) to connecting regions,Towns and Camps. List of all creatures in game where to find them and rare mobs. I would recommend this for people just starting out in the game. It was well worth my $30. ( doubles as a good mouse pad, haha )I agree, it could be better though."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"The illustrations are nice, but over-all the book feels unprofessional. The first thing that alludes to this is the mistaken flight paths (poor quality control on Brady's behalf). The other thing that bother's me is the lack of a North Arrow typically found on maps, on the smaller city-town maps - some of the maps for these are orientated upside down or sideways from how you are used to looking at them from the in game map. For instance, the map for Feathermoon has the pier jutting out to the water on the left making you realize the map is upside down from how you think about it in the game. Oh, there are no Instance\\\\Dungeon maps either, so dont buy this book expecting those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"A complete waste of money.

Charlton Heston, one of the great actors of his time... his resume includes great films such as the 10 Commandments, Julius Caesar, and Ben Hurr (The greatest movie ever made in my opinion). But he fell off the deep end with this one, folks.Low budget, poor quality dvd... The camera shots were anything but professional. I've taken better shots of ships with my handheld. There are some movies out there that you can just tell were made for TV and this is one of them.This may be personal oppinion, but Charlton Heston was 65 when this movie was made, if I'm not mistaken. He seemed a little on the old side for this movie as, except for a few rare cases, that was the maximum age anyone usually expected to live.I'm not going into a ton of detail, just wanted to voice my oppinion. If you're looking for a good adaptation, go with the 1934 (half decent) or the 1950 (really good) adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fools Gold!!!","review":"I have to be honest about this DVD. This movie blows,....HARD. The acting is almostlike watching a low budget soap opera or home movie. I thought that, after reading someof the reviews posted here, I was possibly getting a hidden gem. Not so. While the starsin this are good, the acting, script, and directing are terrible. I tried to watch this with my twokids (11 year old boy, 14 year old girl) and we couldn't get through the first hour. I would givethis movie away without feeling bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cropped!","review":"I'm so glad to finally have this film on DVD, a feeling that is somewhat tempered by the inexplicable decision to crop it from it's original 4:3 aspect ratio. It mostly doesn't look too bad, but there are a few scenes where bits of people's heads are cut off. Given that DVD players and HDTVs generally have zoom functions, I can't understand why someone thought it was a good idea. I also agree with previous reviewers that the video is a bit dark. Another minor quibble is the lack of a scene selection menu. I suppose we should grateful to have gotten this movie at all, but whoever mastered this needs to take a little more care with future DVD releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Island","review":"Like a lot of fans of this movie, I've waited 21 years for it to be released on DVD. I still have the old VHS copy of it I bought in 1990 and have just about worn it out from watching it so often. This is the quintessential pirate movie, not to mention one of the great classical novels. I was happy to see when they did make this movie, they used a director who had actually read the book first. From start to last, it followed Robert Louis Stevenson's masterpiece which made it even better. Something I noticed is the detail they put into it, from the authentic clothing to the weapons to even the food (salt pork stew was a staple aboard a ship). As a bonus, who knew that Christian Bale could act ? He was 16 when this movie was first made and he easily held his own against screen legends like Heston and Reed. If you like pirates and adventure on the high seas, this movie is a must have. There's never been a better one made. Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I am overjoyed this version of Treasure Island has finally come out on DVD. My 4 sons grew up with an old VHS tape of this movie.

If anything Fraser Heston's picture enhances Robert Louise Stevenson's prose. One of the most celebrated and inspired cast of any picture ever. Christian Bale as Jim Hawkins! No one else could ever be Long John Silver after Charlton Heston's portrayal. Oliver Reed! Christopher Lee! And a supporting cast of character actors that should not be missed. Treasure Island is one of my top five favorite movies of all time. After receiving my DVD ( I waited years for the DVD release) I watched it back to back once the original version, then with Fraser Heston's ( Charlton Heston's son) commentary. The end of this movie is as iconoclastic as the end of Planet of the Apes. And to think this started out as a TNT made for TV production.

The author, Ajahn Brahm, was a student of the great Thai teacher Ajahn Chah and he brings to life the essence of Buddhist thought. The stories are easy to relate to, even if you've never spent a day in a monastery. The chapter on Creating Happiness alone is worth the price of this book. As Westerners, it can be difficult to reconcile the realities of day to day living with our overwhelming desires for control and happiness. We strive so hard to change our external world that we fail to recognize that no change is possible without inner change. This book will tell you how to look at life in a way that allows you happiness under the most difficult of situations. It is written in a humourous style and can be read straight through, or opened at random whenever you need a pick me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Practical Teachings","review":"I'm fortunate enough to have attended many talks by Ajahn Brahm and heard these various teachings stories elaborated on in person.

I also bought quite a few books as gifts for friends and family.The stories are collected under a range of practical topics for challenges often faced in daily life, and use traditional, personal, and contemporary stories to illustrate the application of wisdom to overcome difficulties and suffering.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who values wisdom and a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor and stress reduction one short story at a time.","review":"I was a bit unsure about the title at first, but the book is very good.

In her books and tapes, she offers real hope to people, many of whom (as she acknowledges) might not have the energy to hope - yet. In these days of pop psychologyand trendy motivational products, Dr. Weekes goes right to the heart of the matter: that people suffering from panic attacks don't do so because of defects in their personalities, but because they've been sensitized to certain situations. Dr. Weekes helps us learn techniques to get past that sensitivity.Her genius was in understanding exactly what her audience was going through emotionally. I've never heard any other doctor speak with such empathy. And by her example, she teaches us to be patient with ourselves while we're getting better.I usually HATE self-help materials, but I love Dr. Weekes' work.

This last turn involved driving - I have panic attacks while driving in the car alone, convinced that I will 'lose it' and harm someone or myself; anyone who has had panic attacks knows that this will not happen, but that is my fear. Listening to Doctor Claire has been an extremely calming influence, and I can drive almost without any anxiety. When I start to feel panicky, I put her on and she talks about how adrenaline always works in the same ways and describes the symptoms exactly as I am feeling them, and I can relax knowing that I am 'normal' for a panic attack sufferer.

I have tried just about everything to stop the panic attacks from occuring, including medication and therapy. Both of those things help some in the short term, but they certainly don't help me to rid myself of panic attacks permanently. Dr. Weekes has given me hope by showing me that with time and practice, panic can no longer control me. She explains how panic works in a way that you can understand. And once you understand how panic works, it takes away a lot of the power that it once had. Then as you learn how to deal with panic and anxiety, you get stronger and stronger. I listen to this CD several times a week and it calms me, knowing that I am not alone and that as long as I can control my thoughts, I can control my reactions and emotions.

At the store, I tried one, but it only worked in the \\"battery\\" mode, not the \\"shake to light\\" mode. So I tried another. This one worked so I bought it. On the way back home, while I was playing with it, the switch broke and I could get it to turn on. So back to the store I went to exchange for another one.

The second lamp sent had exactly the same problem. I gave up and just fixed it.

Of course, it has the old standbys - Danny Boy and When Irish Eyes are Smiling. But Ronan Tynan's version of \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\" is so beautiful you'd swear angels were singing. I'm sure Phil Coulter wrote it to sound this way! And the renditions of \\"Grace\\", \\"Only Your Rivers Run Free,\\" and \\"The Old Man\\" are amazing. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves beautiful music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent CD - time for a Josef Locke revival!","review":"This magnificent CD and the impression that it appears to have made on so many people gives me motivation to shamelessly shill the late tenor Josef Locke.Josef Locke was the greatest Irish tenor of the 40s and 50s. His recording and concert career was halted during his prime by income tax problems in the early 60s - his last public performance was sometime in the 70s. However, he has never ceased to be less than popular in his homeland - he passed away in October, 1999, aged 82.He left a number of popular recordings - samples are available on Amazon and other sites. Simply search on \\"Josef Locke\\".Also see the movie \\"Hear My Song\\", available on video, which encapsulates Josef Locke's career in a really neat story. Ned Beatty is superb as Josef Locke, along with Evan Dunbar and Tara Fitzgerald.If you love this music, please turn your ear to Josef Locke as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They are wonderful!!!!!!","review":"I first saw them on PBS and watched every minute of it each time it was on. Then I discovered they were touring and I went to see them at Nassau Col. on Long Island. The very next day I brought the CD and have been listening to it ever since. John McDermott is great. \\"Danny Boy\\" gets me every time. Ronan Tiernan is absolutly beautiful and I love when he sings \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\". I LOVE Anthony Kearns and anything he sings blows me away (although I guess I can say that about the other two as well). What I like the most about them is their obvious enjoyment of what they are singing and the emotion they put into it. They seem to fit so well together and have a wonderful stage relationship. There are not enough stars in the universe to rate these guys!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A first-class performance by excellent soloists.","review":"This is an excellent recording. The voices are beautiful and very distinctive. It is unfortunate that John McDermott has left the group, so this is your only chance to hear him with the others. Most of the songs are not your standard Irish fare, so it makes the recording so much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album My Teenager Loves","review":"Obviously, I loved the Irish Tenors as soon as I heard it. What surprised me though, was the enthusiasm my teenage daughter felt for the music. It's gratifying to see a young person listen to these moving lyrics with some of the other \\"noise\\" they're used to hearing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This CD is amazing! John McDermott, Anthony Kearns, and Ronan Tynan are wonderful apart, but together they blow me away. I especially LOVE Anthony Kearns, and I'd like to know if there's a website address for him. But anyway, I would recommend this CD to anyone, even if you're not Irish, or if you don't like tenor music, this album will stir your soul! I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crying Jag Lovefest","review":"I love this CD. I saw them in person and it was an awesome experienc. I was never so happy to be crying in my life. When I listen to this CD I feel that I have my dear departed Irish Catholic grandmother on one shoulder and my darling late mother on the other. The music tugs at your heart. Each tenor has his own unique style. You feel like you should be in a pub, drinking a beer when listening to the homey sound of John McDermott. Anthony Kearns breaks your heart when he sings Grace. Ronan Tynan makes you think of your first love when he sings When You Were Sweet Sixteen and he makes you yearn to go back home when he sings The Town I Loved So Well. Only the Rivers Run Free makes you realize the pain the Irish feel. I love, love, love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"just jumping on 3T bandwagon","review":"A couple of decades ago, the great John McCormick made these songs much more than they were. His passion and gorgeous voice infused them with new life. That was then...Now we have three-for-one- men clearly ripping off the Three Tenors' image. They don't have the originals' voices or claim to fame. They sing in glossy, sappy, plastic, and uninspired fashion. Do yourself a favor and look for John McCormick's records. One that's still available on K-Tel is entitled \\"Ireland's Greatest Tenor\\". THAT was Irish singing at its best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, stirring music and song","review":"the album is terrific - very disappointed that they cancelled their Las Vegas concert without any reason - don't know if I'll support their next album or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"when irish eyes are not exactly smiling","review":"This is like RIVERDANCE. take a fine old folk art form and tweak it to make it somehow LESS than it ever was, slick, smooth, and minus the truth, roughness, passion with which it was originally endowed.Aye,'tis a sad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great harmony, presentation and entertainment.","review":"It's unusual to totally enjoy every song on a cd. This is one cd that we can listen to over and over again. For us, songs like \\"The Old Man\\" and \\"Will you go, Lassie, Go\\", plus others, introduced us to wonderful songs that we hadn't heard before. Each singer has a different style and character to his voice, and all three have great voices. This is a must for anyone who is even half alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular CD","review":"I play this CD every day and do not tire of it. It is one of the best I have ever heard and you can enjoy it even if you have no particular feel for this genre of music. FYI - The Irish Tenors begin a Western US tour in September - I have my tickets to see them at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on September 24. Can't wait! They will also be in San Diego, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and a couple of other cities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Irish Singers","review":"The singers on this CD sing with such feeling, it's as if they lived some of the stories told in the songs, and the songs are wonderful. Anyone who has a love for music will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"I discovered the Irish Tenors about a month ago, and can't get enough of this cd, it is by far the best I have heard in a long time. The voices blend together so well, and their Irish Lulaby and Danny Boy brought tears to my eyes. I hope to see more of their music available in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling, emotional concert","review":"I am not Irish but this album would make me proud to be so. The rendition by Mr. Tynan of \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\" and the finale, \\"Danny Boy\\", is worth the price of the album alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTRAORDINARY","review":"We saw this performed last night on TV & so loved them!

This CD will definitely touch your soul and your heart. All three tenors sing with such emotion. I must admit that John Mcdermott is my favorite even though I love Kearns and Tynan also. McDermotts rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"The Old Man\\" will definitely bring tears to your eyes. The three of them singing \\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\\" will have you smiling the entire song.If you have never heard the song \\"The Town I've Loved So Well\\" you won't forget it after you hear Tynan sing it deep from his heart. I have bought several Cd's for gifts and think this CD will be topping the Charts. If you haven't seen the TV rendition of this concert do so it makes the CD even more special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of songs","review":"I was entranced with the Irish Tenors when I saw them on PBS several months ago. By chance I came across the CD and ordered it and now listen to it almost every day. One of my favorites is \\"Only Our Rivers Run Free\\". You can't go wrong with this CD. I am now a fan of McDermott, Kearns and Tynan and will try to find more of their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have loved John McDermott's music for a few years now and was thrilled when he was paired with Ronan Tynan and Anthony Kearns. Their renditions of traditional Irish tunes are superb! I had the privilege of seeing the Irish Tenors in Boston and Hartford this month, and also meeting them after the Boston debut. If you have a chance to see them in person, don't miss it! Not only are they talented musicians, they are sweet and warm people too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older album, new review","review":"Every home has a record, tape or CD that defines the family. This album is that recording for the hundreds of people who have already reviewed it here.This is what my grandmother's John McCormack albums would sound like if they were recorded today. The fact that this music can connect generations, living and dead, speaks to its power. The fact that these singers, especially Anthony Kearns, can pull it off without even breaking a sweat, speaks to their talent.When I was a young girl, I tried in vain to get good recordings of good Irish tenor music from our local library. Usually, I found albums with the words \\"Emerald Isle\\" somewhere in the title performed by folks who sounded like they'd had a few before the recording started. It is a joy to finally hear these songs sung, and recorded, as they were meant to be. If you don't own this, buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"additional praises","review":"I HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT ALL AVAILABLE TAPES ( AUDIO & VIDEO & CDS) THAT I CAN FIND. THEY ARE ALL GREAT.

This has the ONLY recording ever of \\"Concierto como un divertimento for Cello and Orchestra\\". (If you don't believe me, go do a search on the internet, and just try to find one anywhere!) And what makes it unbelievable, it's one of his best concertos! How could that have happened? And there's even more reasons to get this CD - it's the most generous of all of the nine Naxos volumes, at 77+ minutes - the performances are top notch - and the recording is as good as you would ever hope for.

The selections are very poor in light of the wide variety of holiday music that is available from the Duke Ellington Orchestra. The CD itself has no liner notes and no credits, so there is no way of knowing where the music is drawn from. I assumed that any Duke Ellington collection would be worthwhile, but I was wrong on this one. Particularly disturbing is the lack of credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is pretty cool","review":"This CD isn't quite as good as \\"Evildoers Beware,\\" but it deserves more credit than it deserves. There are many cool songs on it, like \\"Send You Back\\" and \\"Everything Girl.\\" Also, the versions of \\"Lolita\\" and \\"We're Gonna Take on the World\\" are a lot better than when they were on \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You, Too.\\" The only big problem with this CD was that it didn't have \\"The Freshman\\" on it. You can only get it on the internet. Oh well, that's what burners are for, but it would have been better on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lotta fun","review":"I heard of Mustard Plug from a friend of mine who digs reel Big Fish. He has the same music tastes as me, so when he reccomended I buy this Cd, I took his advice. It;s great! The first song is not that great though. I love songs 2-7, and 12. The others are pretty good, but not great. I sing alongwith \\"Throw A Bomb\\" and \\"Lolita\\". They're horribly catchy. The instruments and vocals all compliment and support one another. Take a listen, I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"slower and more mellow","review":"this new album isn't as good as the older 3. they are more mellow in Pray For Mojo, but it is still a pretty good cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD was a big letdown","review":"After having heard Big Daddy Multitude and Evildoers Beware I was extremely disappointed by this album. Mustard Plug wrote too many mediocre love songs for this album. Even their non-love songs like \\"Throw a Bomb\\" and \\"We're gunna take on the world\\" are nowhere nearly as good as any songs on Evildoers Beware. Unless you are total fanatic of Mustard Plug this album is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ska album","review":"Mustard Plug is one of those little known ska bands. Well, little known to the Pop music world. They are not like the big Ska bands like Less Then Jake, reel Big Fish and Mighty Mighty Bosstones. But they should be. Pray For Mojo is just a good Ska album. It has catchy music and words, and is solid all the way through. Although this is the only album by them I have bought, I really like what I have heard from them (ahem..off napster..ok, I admit it, I download their songs.) But buying their stuff is so much better then downloading it.

I gave it a shot to save some money but, probably now would end up spending more on all the reprinting needed! Not one page printed correctly. At least a third of each page was smeared or missing. With every page it would start fine, then would stop and the pop up message read, \\"open and replace black ink cartridge and try again\\".

I had to do a book report on a book and chose this one. The story of Joe Talbot getting wrongly accused and the entire story of him, with the help of his dog, presuming his innocence, is very captivating. It reminds me of the story \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" but for kids. I rated it 4 stars out of 5, only because of the little side story between Wishbone and his lady dog friend. That part of the story to me had nothing to do with the plot in the book and to me was just a waste of time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Incomplete in so many ways","review":"This has some information that should have been printed in the user's manual packaged with the game. It is missing, so as not to be redundant, information included in that manual. Both printed items are effectively incomplete. The game evolves, now has continents, equipment, spells, etc. that are not in this manual. In creating some characters, new players will be disappointed in the results, since the information is inaccurate or incomplete to the realities of how the players need to play. Save your money. Or even better, donate the purchase price of the book to the websites use use to obtain the same types of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New...","review":"There's nothing in the book that you can't get in 15 minutes from various sites on the internet. Better maps are easily found on eqmaps.com or eqatlas.com. The spell listings are found on many, MANY sites. Same for items and where they drop.. I wouldn't spend any cash on this book. Like someone said before, there's no information that you wouldn't know after playing 1 week.. And if you are a total newbie, just read some infromative articles on starting up a character on various websites. Just as much good information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A newbie bought, a newbie read","review":"Well, actually other people might have said this book is good for newbies. Sure, it has all the charts neatly laid out and everything. But if you don't own the game yet, you should buy the game and the book together. That way you can have the best starting character. The reason why I bought the book was not for the data tables, but to try to learn more about the land I was at. How to earn experience faster, and how to navigate Norrath as best as I could. Unfortunately, the book does not tell you much about earning experience (just that there are four ways, and what they are), and maps seriously need some help. This is the improved and revised edition?! Wow, this is pretty bad, I wonder what the original strategy guide looked like."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Good Book","review":"Okay, so maybe you can get all this information on the web. But can you get it so neatly and precisely laid out and accessible? Unless you're into printing dozens of pages or have two PCs side-by-side this book is the best resource for getting started in the game.The layout is well done. There are some great starting tips for each character class and each race. The spells section is well done with detailed information only for the lower level spells. At first, I was angered by that but then I realized that there is some fun to be had in the mystery of what your next set of spells will bring.All in all, this book is a great read for the starting player and also an excellent reference for anyone (even a veteran player) starting a new character in a class that he or she is unfamiliar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneers of Jazz Guitar 27-38","review":"These tracks represent some of the earliest and most influential recordings of jazz and jazz related guitar performances.

Focusing especially upon the salons and those who attended them, Jewish High Society In Old Regime Berlin draws upon statistics, anecdotes, historical references and biographies, and is illustrates with occasional black-and-white diagrams or photographs. Evenhandedly examining the lives of both men and women, Jewish High Society In Old Regime Berlin is smoothly written and highly readable to historians and lay people alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game if you stick with it","review":"This game does what it says in the sense that the physics are fairly similar to real world driving, and that's what makes it so tough! You can execute pendulum and hand brake turns, but you've really got to practice to get them right. If you're looking to blast around a track full throttle within 10 minutes of plugging it in, forget it! This isn't Mario Kart. However if you want a good racing sim which takes lots of practice, then this one is great.Pros: Realistic car handling, 2 player is fun,Cons: No analog setting for gas and brakes (to my knowledge), more car setup options would be nice, instruction manual seems to be written by someone with English as a second language.Overall, a decent game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is too simple and has poor graphics!","review":"Stay away from this racer!

Defense lawyers will tremble at the sound of your name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Science","review":"This book is not about science. It is religion masking itself as science. A more honest title would have been \\"The religion before science\\". I just heard him being interviewed on the Catholic religious channel EWTN and he explained how when human sperm and egg cells join a soul is created/affixed to them. Science doesn't have much to say about religion, Dr. Rizzi should try not saying much about science. I found his description of Koko (the signing gorilla) embarrassing, he kept referring to her as a \\"he\\". Dr. Rizzi would have been more believable if he had at least researched the topic enough to learn the gender of the animal that he was describing.I'm not meaning to attack any religion or philosophy but simply make clear that this book is religious/philosophical and is in no way a history of science as the title alludes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking Outside the Box","review":"If you ever wondered how philosophy, religion, and science are interwoven in the quest for truth, knowledge, and our very existence this will definitely shed new light for you. For the layperson, some terms and concepts may be difficult to grasp initially, but Rizzi provides a glossary of terms and definitions used throughout the book. This book provides the framework for thinking outside the box required for further advances to be made in modern science. The critical reviews written about this book show that some people do not understand what Rizzi addresses in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ...

Before buying take mine I will mail it to you before I hurl it through the wall. EGM said this was a good game and usually they are right. Well they blew it this time. Don't get me wrong it might be fun. Good concept, interesting story, Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss fights. I never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until I died 50 times in a row.

The plot is completely unique and has some very good graphics. The only 2 minor reasons why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 are simple. This game uses CG backgrounds and bitmap characters (commonly found in Final Fantasy 7) but backgrounds are triggered by events or are just on a constant loop. The transitions between action and auto-control sequences are beutiful, but the looping of background changes are very choppy and you can tell. Plus, the game is just to short. I was thinking about buying this game but I was discouraged when I beat the game in one 4-day rental period."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING!!!","review":"This game BAD! In fact, it's the worst game I have ever played! I totally wasted \\"My money\\"! The ending is bad and two main charachters are killed because of the ordinary and dumb storyline. Every enemy is annoying and stupid. I definitly do not recommend this game to gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good at all","review":"This was my first playstation game, and I ended up returning it to the store 30 minutes after playing it. The control is horrendous, the puzzles irritating, the difficulty frustrating, and the game just not really satisfying at all. You might say that the control takes time to get used to, and I've played games with similiar control like Silent Hill, but it's such a flaw that I couldn't get past it. If you are interested in this game, rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy The Screen Grabs","review":"I recently rented this game and am wondering why everyone says this game is so great. Admitedly I never got far into the game, but I can consider myself a rather open-minded gamer and have a large fustration berth, but this game REALLY taxed it. The most obvious complaint being that this game just isn't fun. It tries way to hard to emulate RE, but doesn't capture the intensity, or fun factor. In fact the action stinks in this game. It's very easy to die here, and the battles are less skill based than having a better weapon. Maybe you should just rent the game and see if you like it, seeing as so many people disagree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Effect","review":"I just got this game for Christmas along with a PSone. I really think that the game is great. However I have found it quite frustrating also. The game is alot of fun and has a realistic feel, but somethings about the game are just plain frustrating. I found this site on accident looking for codes but I decided to review this game anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING","review":"The game is ok, gameplay wise. The controls are a little awkward, and it may be annoying to switch through inventory while fighting compared to pausing, then switching a weapon. The controls are like those of many other action games, such as Resident Evil III and Galerians. They can be really awkward when solving the first puzzle in-game of the game. You always end up dying before you master the controls. It is really easy to die, and it is annoying that the Fear Meter gets worse if you are closer to an enemy, making it even easier to die than before. The first boss is nearly impossible to defeat if you dont have fully loaded mach pistols, and even then he is nearly impossible because he can kill you in two, sometimes one hit.It is MUCH MORE frustrating than challenging. Another flaw: this game can be beaten in less than five hours. i beat it the first day i rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best action/adventure game I've played","review":"Having waited quite a while for this game to come out, it would have been easy to be disappointed. That is why I am so excited that it was worth the wait. The gameplay is fantastic, with the controls being difficult to get used to, but once you do, the game is fantastic. The graphics are unreal, and the story is great! One great innovation is the health meter. They have changed it a bit so that you have a fear factor. The more afraid your character is, the less it will take for you to die. But on the flipside, the better you react to adverse situations, the more confident you become, and the less likely it is that your fear factor will increase. If you are looking for a game that has action, a great story, and some of the best graphics around, buy Fear Effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PSX GAME OF THE YEAR","review":"When I saw pictures of this game, I knew I had to have it. Although I beat it on a rental, that almost made it more worthwile. You get alot for the time you spent on the game. It was a perfect blend of many things I enjoy(Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Blade Runner, and John Woo's direction). The game played like a super-sleek movie and the characters were gritty. Hats off to the directors of this game for using perfect camera angles in the cutscenes and for not being afraid to use mature content in healthy doses. I don't advocate violence, but some games suffer from being afraid to push the envelope (the new RE installment Code Veronica suffered from toning down the violence of the other two RE games). My only problem is the dissapointing ending. Definetly worth a rent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the true gamer","review":"I played this game years ago on the playstation console and absolutely loved it. Now i have a ps2 and bought Fear Effect after all this time; I have no regrets. The storyline is well plotted and the game play is challenging, smooth, entertaining and makes you think therefore this game is not for the weak minded, impatient gamer. The fear meter is a much welcomed attribute which adds a bit of reality and challenge as opposed to the traditional health bar and the ability to play with 3 different characters throughout the plot makes it a fascinating journey.I label Fear effect as a game only a true gamer can appreciate, so if you are all about quick play, easy gaming and have little ability or desire to use a bit of brain power then this game is not for you but if you're up for challenges, are patient and possess appreciation for this type of experience then its definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Effect rulz!!!","review":"I have had Fear Effect ever since it came out, and I still think it is one of the greatest games. Though it can be extremely challenging at times, it is also loads of great fun, expecially with it's cartoon-like graphics. The storyline is brilliant fallowed by a host of awsome characters. If your looking for a challenge, than I point to Fear Effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that, contrary to what I'm reading, violence, nudity, and bad language do not make a game \\"mature.\\"Fear Effect PROS: Good graphics, fluid animation.Fear Effects CONS: crappy voice acting, juvenille dialogue (yeah, real mature people), dull gameplay. Sorry, but I just couldn't get into this one. It was neat to see the cartoon-like graphics but the novelty was short-lived. I really wanted to like this game (after reading all the hype) but was sorely disappointed. It's just no fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's hard, but it's fun!!","review":"Don't let those negative reviews fool you, this is a good, addicting game, worthy of the stars I gave it. It's difficult, but gets easier when you realize it can't be played as a straight action game, but more as a strategy game, stick to it past the beginning and you will enjoy the game I think. Learn to use the way the figures move, learn to always keep loading your guns, and man, save your game as much as possible, even if it means backtracking. People complain about having to learn how approach this game by dying too much, but personally it just added to the challenge. I can tell you from experience that when you get through a tough fight using your wits, not just fast thumbs, it feels pretty good. Can you keep your heart rate green? Who knows.....but it's fun trying. This game is not for kids under 16 years old in my opinion, so if you're a parent, get it for yourself, not your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"Don't buy these, they're too small to grip most filters.

Progress captures the essence of a small town and pulls you into the mystery that the natives encounter. Twice a year I visit a beach that is similar to Playa Bonita and found this story believable and thought provoking. The author creates credible characters that speak for themselves. The story is filled with mystery, suspense, romance, and humor. There is something for everyone in this suspensful page turner. I couldn't put it down. The auther creates a world that is rich and dramatic with a plot that never stops developing. It is a book that makes you want to skip ahead to see how it ends, but the author's writing forces you to slow down and savor the storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective handle and no replacement for it.","review":"I have been using this saw for over two years and it does a good job only just the other day the power switch would not stop when I let go. I unpluged it and took the handle apart and found that the handle was breaking inside and a piece of plastic fell into the swith and keep it on all the time. (safety hazard) Then I went online and tried to order a new handle and guess what, they obsoleted the part and their is NO replacement part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Scale","review":"It is light but sturdy. I use it everyday and it holds up really well. I would recommend it. The price is very good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I found this book ridiculous. First of all, the author speaks to the reader with a sence of urgency. You feel desperate and pressured. She suggests running yourself ragged trying to meet the love of your life, which only leaves you feeling empty and frustrated. She also advises you to throw away your old photographs of past lovers to make room for the new. This was when I stopped reading. There are better books out there on this subject. I would recommed How to Meet the Right Man which was alot more straight forward and less silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with product as I ordered a book and got CD set. greatnorthern94 has not responded.","review":"Not happy with product as I ordered a book and received a Cd set.

In fact, I have several of her books. I read them every day; thus my life is richer because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"This something I have read every day and have for over 4 years i love it and have given many as gifts"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really worked for me","review":"I am not an addict or recovering addict, but this book changed my life for the better. It is simply that I respond well to the way this author puts things, you might say. I would have given this book 5 stars, but the orginal Language of Letting Go (this is *More* Language of Letting Go) is better. However, I certainly recommend having them both and using them both on a daily basis.The author does get a little bogged down with framing things through her experience of jumping out of airplanes and learning to be a pilot, and that got a little old. But you can read ahead or go backwards if you don't like one day's meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes it's hard to improve on a first edition.","review":"Hello All,Ok, so I said I would review this title upon reading it so, here it is. First impression is these daily readings, have a different feel than those in \\"The language of letting go\\". I'm not saying that they are bad, just that the seem more polished(for lack of a better word). I think that if I was just starting a 12 step program, I would much prefer the former title (The language of letting go)over this edition.You can see in these new readings how Melody has progressed in her own recovery, an inspiration no doubt. What I find is lacking is the frustration that she felt in her first book. I think it's important that new comers feel that frustration as well to know that they aren't alone.So, would I recommend this title.......INDEED!! I just think that you should *PROGRESS* to this edition only after spending time with the original.Ciao!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone going through a tough time in their lives. It is a daily reminder to keep you going in the right direction. I do not like that it is so religious, but otherwise enjoy the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the best!","review":"Without Melody and The Language of Letting Go, I would be lost. I read my book until I had to replace it because it was so worn out. It is so nice to have another addition of daily devotions or thoughts to read, it makes us dig deeper and review our progress. Also, the activities help us reflect on postivie actions, instead of dweling on the negatives we all encounter every day. Again, without her wonderful experiences and honesty, I can say I probaly would not be a great mother or have maintained an excellent marriage for 7 years. Keep writing because we love you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE Language of letting go","review":"This was a self-serving JOURNAL of the flying and sky-diving accomplishments of the author. If I wanted to know about her personal life and adventures - I would become a pen-pal. The two books, \\"MORE...\\" and \\"Language...\\", are like night and day! The two could not be more different! Never have I regretted buying a book more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"The original \\"Language of Letting Go\\" is absolutely my favorite daily meditation book! So, I purchased \\"More Language of Letting Go\\" with great anticipation. I have never been so disappointed in a book in my life! It was more like reading someone's diary of personal adventures. It was full of egocentric comparisons between skydiving and daily struggles. I didn't find it inspirational at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure of a book","review":"These short daily writings are insightful and profound. It is amazing how on many days, what is written for that day is exactly what I need to hear. I recommend this very highly. I have both books and jump between them. They both compliment each other completely. Good whether you have a lot of time in your day, or if you are rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprised by the content","review":"I was really surprised to find out that 366 new meditations were just stories taken from the author's life because I expected to find in there a closed eye guided meditations."},{"rating":"1","title":"caused me anxiety","review":"working long days takes away my energy for later in the evening, so i thought this would help. definitely gives you an energy boost but gave me a lot of anxiety. and i'm not sure if the ingredients are really getting absorbed either. may work for others though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time and the spouse will notice.","review":"I would give this product a 5star if this supplement was water soulable .

It is a compilation of short devotions, two or three pages each, journaling the author's illness and faith walk. It can be read from beginning to end in one sitting, or used as a devotional, a story at a time. It is a lovely book, containing the author's own artwork. I will give it often to someone going through a difficult time, but I enjoyed reading it myself. It will have a prominent place on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"One cracked after a practice session","review":"These have cloth handles and bamboo blades. After a short practice session, one edge of the blade broke pretty quickly. Disappointing that it is not very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"If you are interested in Kendo, looking to train and save a little money. Don't buy these. You get what you pay for. These shinai are decorative pieces. Not meant for practice at all. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE","review":"So I was a bit short on money when I killed my last shinai, so I decided to cheap out and buy these. I pulled them apart to prep them for normal wear and found that they had no sakigomu. Because of this, They are not tournament legal and my old dojo would not even allow you to practice with them. Serious bummer.On top of all that, when I actually measured them, they were only 40\\" (102ish cm) in length. most certainly not what I thought that I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"47\\" Kendo Shinai","review":"We didn't have these swords long, but one of them already broke. The string came undone on the other one as well. I didn't think that these were going to be fragile items, and should be able to take some punishment, but I was wrong. If you buy, don't hit too hard with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"Out of all the shinai I have seen, these are pretty good. The leather at the tip could be a bit tighter I think. Thats its only downfall. It still holds together pretty well none the less. Also, for the price I would suggest getting these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor shinai.","review":"I bought these as a quick, cheap replacement for my last shinai, thinking that even if they were not excellent at least I'd have a spare. The parts that are traditionally leather (sakigawa, tsuka, and nakayuki) are made of a cheap, dry foam that disintegrates on contact (literally - my shirt was covered in foam particles when I unwrapped them). The bamboo is of the lowest quality, and looks like it will splinter at the lightest suggestion of contact; one reviewer has experienced quick breakage already. If the bamboo takes oil well I may rewrap them and use them as long as I can, but there is nothing to recommend these shinai."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is a set of two \\"bamboo\\" swords, for a rather decent price. However, the wood is some sort of composite, and after less than a day, during a light practice session, one of the swords broke clean through at the hilt. All four pieces of wood broke in an almost straight line. Now, this may be atypical, because one sword was noticeably lighter than the other (that's the one that broke) so be sure to read other reviews as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for Kendo","review":"I purchased this set of shinai based on price, and that was my first mistake. They are made in China, with all the poor craftsmanship that this normally entails. During my first kendo practice using one of these shinai, one of the take (bamboo slats) broke within the first hour of use. They are not strong enough for kendo and may cause injury due to their weakness. Possibly useful for LARP or cosplay, but not martial arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"thieves in the night!","review":"picture shows 2 swords, only recieved 1, clever use of \\"SET\\". purchased 4 total and was charged for shipping twice, have yet to recieve 3 others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for about 3 minutes with a 10 year old","review":"Right out of the box my daughter and I started playing around with these in the living room, not really going at it very hard and about 3 minutes into our light playing my daughter came at me with a swipe that broke the Shinai I was using clean in half. We just stared at each other for about 10 seconds. All I could do was assure her that she hadn't done anything wrong. Amazon was Excellent on the UPS pickup and return credit.I have used bamboo fighting sticks for years and I didn't think it could break like that. I have to assume these are made of some kind of bamboo substitute. Obviously, I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty crappy","review":"Bought these cheap for a sparring match, first good practice swing (not connecting to anything) and the thing breaks right at the handle ><. didnt even get one match outa it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is misleading","review":"The picture is misleading, they do not have a guard, so there is nothing to protect your hand.

Very sturdy and fun to use. Great Product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great use for five minutes....","review":"Great use for five minutes then one broke.

Not only does it does it not give you tsubas (hand guards), it also falsely advertises them as being 47\\". What you get are two cheaply made 42\\" ones. When these things break, and I'm sure it will be soon, I'm definitely not buying these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plautus duly appreciated","review":"This is one of the most important contributions in Plautine studies since Erich Segal's \\"Roman Laughter\\". A close reading of six \\"plays about play-making\\" (Epidicus, Persa, Asinaria, Casina, Bacchides, Pseudolus), the book closes down on the cardinal Plautine figure of the servus callidus as the conductor and master-puppeteer of the playworld. This is a book with a thesis: that Plautine theatre is non-mimetic, non-illusory, non-realistic; that, inasmuch as it imitates not life but previous text, it is metatheatrical and intertextual at the outmost. Disadvantages? Slater sometimes overstates his case: for instance, the thesis that in the \\"Persa\\" the pimp Dordalus represents the \\"world of tragedy\\" (p.53) is one example of such overdrawn conclusions. But not many of those are to be found. Throughout the book, Slater offers specimens of sophisticated performance analysis. The book should perhaps be read in juxtaposition with Slater's newly published volume on Aristophanes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio is OK, but this it NOT a CDG!","review":"I purchased this Karaoke CD solely for the Rick Astley song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". What can I say, I love Rick Rolling, and it's a hilarious song. I just got a Karaoke player, and I wanted to start a collection of CDGs.The problem is, this is not a CDG (CD + Graphics). It's just a regular audio CD. This means you won't be able to display the lyrics on-screen with your karaoke player. It comes with a small booklet with lyrics, but who's going to read from a tiny booklet while singing karaoke?Not what I thought it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True \\"Treasury\\" of Desserts","review":"This is, by far, the very best dessert cookbook that I had the joy of using. I have tried many recipes from this book and they are all WONDERFUL!! There are many \\"old fashioned\\" recipes for goodies that I haven't eaten since I was a child. The instructions are explicit, yet easy; and best of all, most recipes don't require that you purchase special items, they usually require ingredients that are a normal part of your cabinet inventory. The book is loaded with useful baking tips. You can get rid of all other dessert cookbooks. I Love It!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my first choice","review":"The CD does not work with Windows 2000. I tried it several times.

When I go around a corner, the carrier tips over. The base doesn't sit right in my car regardless of how I strap it in. I have had to just use the seat belt to strap the car seat in the car without the base. This is an aweful product and for eddie bauer, I am completely shocked that they marketed such a thing. If you need a good car seat with a satisfactory base, go with the flatter bases. This one is aweful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"I had the Eddie Bauer Mercer Intergrated Travel System, which uses this base. This base is awful, and does not secure well at all!! We attempted to install the car seat in 2 different cars, we tried the latch belt and the seat belt but nothing helped.

I received this travel system as a gift from my office,and I am beside myself with frustration. With a name like \\"Eddie Bauer\\" you'd assume that the infant seat would not tip over going around corners. And guess what? I haven't even given birth yet. I just got off the phone with the customer service rep, and you know what, I did not even get an instruction manual in the back of the infant seat like I was supposed to.

I have complained to the manufactuer in person two weeks ago at the Lifesavers Conference, Austin, TX and expressed to them how poorly designed this base is. It will not stay tight no matter what.

The author was also our instructor and he forced all his students to purchase this book. He even made the mid-term exam an open-book exam in order to make sure that all his students did buy this book. Writing this book and the stunt he pulled in trying to sell it, Mr, T.S Rathore only re-affirmed his reputation of being a crap-weasel. He is a horrible teacher and even worse writer. This book is filled with typos and there are errors of horrendous magnitude. Most of figures/circuits are partially or completely wrong. At the end of each chapter Mr. T.S Rathore lists plenty of references. Well, there is nothing wrong with that, except that most of the references are unpublished papers by Mr. T.S Rathore.

So apparently, if Superman was a Union soldier in the civil war, the Union would have won. Pretty mind-blowing, huh? Read this title and you will believe that a man can fly (and then decide to ride a horse into the sky for some odd reason...perhaps a perverse enjoyment of animal cruelty). This comes across like the WWII era propaganda comics, only for a war that's been finished for over a century, so I'm not quite sure what the point is. The art is nice, but the incredibly lame story more than makes up for that. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll get Batman: Runnymede featuring King Bruce Wayne signing the Magna Carta.

Hey, if you are a real fan, or just real period, dont spend your hard earned cash on this crap, spend it on the real cds of both artists, especially if you dont have all of Pac's old rides, check them out and Ms Shakur a little of the profit and not these bootleg flea circus fools."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new David Almond fan...","review":"This story was most engaging as I was brought back to my youth in a flood of memories. The author also succeeded in re-awakening the same feelings of joy and anxiety that I remembered from this time in history. My 13 year old son had recommended this book to me and I must be developing an interest in young adult fiction. Another book in this genre that captured my attention was Mark McNulty's \`The Sea Shack'. Each book involved tales of young boys and their experiences in seacoast communities. I could identify with these times and circumstances and the authors remarkable talent for developing young characters. These books are terrific offerings for true \`summer escape' reading. And, they are to be enjoyed by young and old alike as I have learned. Now, I must read the other David Almond books. I have become a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth My Time","review":"This book had horribly scattered ideas and no plot. We read this in my book club and no one was very impressed.

It takes work. Ad astra per aspera! (Go ahead, look that up).Don't let easy-looking books on the subject fool you. What is wonderful about this book is that the authors honestly tackle the difficulties involved. They give clear exact information that will help a serious newcomer (like me) find what they seek. If at first it still seems rather challenging, that's because it is. A telescope shows thousands of stars that are invisible to the naked eye. Familiar patterns are obscured. The new patterns you see can be found in the pages of this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent directions","review":"Turn Left at Orion is a great buy, especially for the beginning sky gazer.

In spite of the fact that it was written as a textbook, it is an excellent read for short stories. Luckily, I happen to like the science fiction genre, and found almost all of the chapters (stories?) very well written. I can't remember discussing this book in class, although I'm sure it must have been included. There are entries about Skinner Boxes, telepathic animals, walking dream worlds, homicidal maniacs, and many other themes in which psychology is so rich. The good part about this book is that, while it introduces these themes to one who might be unfamiliar, it also unfolds them in a manner that does not broadcast that theme from the start. Thus, they are a good read for the psychologist as well. I came to Amazon to get another copy, as mine disappeared several years ago and I want it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical Thinking","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone.

I was hoping it would help me in thinking deeper, reasoning, debate, and decision making in each subject I student in Human Resource Management.

There is no Dual Shock capabilities, and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors. It really looks like it could be a cell phone game. The story is: there is no story. You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time, obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients. This game isn't very creative, or well designed, but it is classic. In the end, and as a fan of the Alien series, I must say DO NOT play this game.

Sure, by today's graphics standards it's not so great but it has great game play. The best thing about this game is the ambiance - dark, great music, it is a little scarry. The game is simple to play and control. Yes, the Doom/Unreal crowd won't like it - not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction. No, this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too.

This game is only fun if you cheat. Mainly because it is too boring to spend countless times replaying the same level over and over again to finally advance to the next one and have the exact same objective. Find batteries or some item, then find the mission end door. This wasn't poorly made, by any means. It is a good early FPS, maybe I played it just too late. A definite buy if your an Alien fan though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!","review":"This game is definitely a very good choice for those of you who are into the fantasy genre. It's kind of like an RPG but in a different way. The goal is to build tracks of rail to different cities and deliver goods to them. You get money from doing this and can use it to keep building more track and upgrade your train. There are different terrain types and different characters who have advantages in the terrains. Dwarves for example can build through mountains for only 1 gold.The game takes very long to play, about 4-5 hours and possibly up to 6 on your first time playing, but I don't mind it that much. It's very mentally challenging and you need to plan ahead a great deal in order to be successful. Lot's of skill involved, lot's of fun.

Bottom line is it is just to small. When you start taking woodworking more seriously, you will shop for a larger model, like I am now. The infeed/outfeed tables are too small, and unless you know you will never be jointing anything longer than 2 feet, I would spend a little more...and you can get a decent sized model. Other than the size, I don't have any specific complaints except that the dust collection hook up is not included, hard to find, and a bit expensive, but that is another story."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tool for limited size shops","review":"I bought this tool about 4 years ago. I have used it for both jointing and plaining less that 6\\" widths. I am just getting to the point of changing blades now. I use this tool twice a month in the winter and twice a week in the summer. I have run huge pieces of wood through this machine eventhough this is bench top and have come up with a good result every time. The only thing keeping it from its fifth star is lenght of bed but that can be a positive too for a small shop area like mine when it comes to storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and get a floor model","review":"I would not recommend buying this unit. I didn't get around to using it until after the return date had expired, otherwise I would have returned it in a heartbeat. It's not a great tool if you plan on becoming a serious woodworker. It took me forever to get the fence square to the table. Also, the fence is very flimsy. It can easily be deflected over an 1/8\\" no matter how hard you tighten it down. Once I got the fence as square as possible I was able to edge glue some 12\\" boards with an almost imperceptible glue line. If you plan on gluing up boards much longer than 12 to 18 inches you will definitely not be happy with this unit. I tested the Jet 6\\" at my local Woodcraft store, what a difference. I hope I can sell the Delta and get the Jet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 6\\" Wood Chipper","review":"If you're in the market for a wood chipper the 37-070 is a great addtion to your shop.

Ended up having to purchase a new cutter head, knives, screwes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This machine is too small to be useful. You can't really joint anything longer than about three and a half feet long, unless you find some way to provide additional infeed and outfeed support. Because it is a lightweight, you need to bolt it down before using it--or risk pushing it onto the floor. The tables are not flat. The fence is a lightweight aluminum. The knives are almost as difficult to set as those on a full-sized unit. Don't waste your money on the dust adaptor--a generic jointer adaptor and a jig saw will save you that expense. I bought this unit a while ago, and I find myself using a hand jointer plane more often (with better results and little more effort). I'm getting ready to sell it and buy a \\"real\\" jointer.

Save your money a little longer and get a REAL tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a floor model instead.","review":"The unit is too small for doing the types of projects that make you want to buy a jointer in the first place.I ran four-quarter cherry through the jointer and the cut was clean, but my 4ft. long boards ended up slightly concave - with the middle offset by 1/16\\" from the ends. Not much, but enough to be frustrating when you're trying to square up boards to glue-up. I made sure I started with the bowed side down. I went on a mission and researched every online woodworking article to make sure I was using proper technique, compensation, etc. and still couldn't manage any better than the 1/16\\" offset.The positive: It sets up fast and easy with clear instructions. It's small and can be tucked away when not in use.I bought this unit as a companion for my 12 1/2\\" planer, but ended up returning it.My recommendation is that if you're looking at this unit because of cost, then look for a used floor model instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little machine","review":"I purchased this machine to do double-duty: joining and surface planing. It's been a great machine and I'm real glad I have it. I especially like the variable speed it has. Operationally, I haven't had any problem doing joining; I usually keep the depth of cut at 1/32nd inch - this makes for lots of cuts, but I'd rather do multiple cuts lightly, rather than 2 or 3 deep cuts. Using it as a surface planer, it leaves a very thin ridge on the board, but I think that is due to a small nick in one of the knives; I can sand or use a block plane to take the ridge out. I've used this tool on ash, maple, and pine, and haven't had any problems. On start-up, it takes a few extra seconds to get it up to speed, but it's not a problem for me. It is loud, so using ear protection is a good idea, as well as some sort of dust collection. OVerall, I'm very pleased with this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"I bought the underwater case and the first time I took it with me for snorkeling I noticed some tiny cracks in the case afterwards.

An awkward white-boy funk that falls somewhere between the Dead Milkmen and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The keyboards add an especially unique sound. If this were an all-instrumental band, I'd enjoy it quite a bit.The problem is, the lead singer sounds like a strangled cat. His idea of getting his emotions out is by squealing and screaming at piercing levels. He has no soul...not in the musical sense, anyway. I laughed when I read the reviews comparing him to Prince and James Brown. Puh-leeze. I can appreciate lo-fi garage, but this is ridiculous.Two stars for the music, negative stars for the vocals.

For the Finzi concerto, I honestly prefer the Margaret Donaghue recording - a little more lyrical treatment. Another reviewer was quite correct - the middle movement is stunningly beautiful, and the rondo sends me into thrills every time!

I was very dissapointed with it and there was lots of unneccessary hype on it. I believe the acting could have been much better. The women coming up the stairs was the best actress, and she only had a 5 second clipping. What I do appreciate is the fact that there is a director who is brave, concious, and powerful enough to make a movie on lesbians of color. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it, but would recommend donating to the director in any way you can. If a entire movie came out, I guess would buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Ms Postwoman","review":"The Post woman is a pretty rudimentary short film, which unfolds like a student or experimental flick.

It's a bit more flimsy than I thought it might be, but does the job if I'm careful spinning the machine (Dell XPS M1530). If I'm not careful, the machine gets knocked off the pad. This happens frequently, although I'm getting better at being more consistently careful to avoid that.

Each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end. This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another. So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites. When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD, we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music. For now though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times.

However, living in an apartment complex with neighbors that go to bed early, I couldnt use these things at night. I saw this CD and figured it would be the answer to my prayers. The sounds, though, are not the same. When I play the CD the only reaction I get from my baby, if I even get one,is he looks at me funny and screams even louder. The hairdryer is ear piercing and the vacuum is just wrong. I have even tried to adjust the volume from low to louder than my vacuum. Nothing works.

How could I resist? How could any of us?The novel begins with a bang but ends with a whimper. What I found most interesting was how the author sketched the characters' reactions to this proof after they've read the document. The president of France, for example, dissolves into a state of gentle radiance (that others judge as insanity) and leaves his post to tend to his beloved wife and roses. Most of the characters are male and represent Church and State...and, sure enough, they end up suppressing the evidence.

Worse the filter is a tiny cloth thing that will let many small particles pass through. I used the vac to suck up some debris from a piece of plastic I was sawing and many of the particles (much larger than your average piece of dust mind you) went right through the filter and into the motor housing.

When you read the author, you are mostly reading his notes and understanding of basic documents he has read; not someone else's translation of these ancient documents.

This is the first one I have owned that not only does not work properly but which with Sony customer service has been most unhelpful. I ordered one in November 2001 and when it arrived it had paint chipped off the case and did not play properly. It was replaced with a new unit in December (I had to wait for the credit to be applied to my card and then re-order. Sony would not ship me a new model once they had received my damaged one). It lasted less than a month before it developed a dragging sound when playing tapes. It was sent for service, had a motor, clutch and belt replaced. The evening it was returned to me it kept switching back and forth between play and auto rev and then ate a tape.While the small size and the rechargable battery would be a definite plus if the machine functioned, at this price I consider the WMFX671 not only to be a bad buy, but the worse Sony product I have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mission really is impossible","review":"Wow, when I bought this game I thought it would be cool to be a secret agent in a video game.

Not because it's self-serious (it's actually extremely funny), but because it's so rich. If it's messy and even flawed at times, it's because life is messy and flawed. Don't pass it up just because it doesn't always go down smoothly.London Fields reminds me somewhat of Dickens - rough London setting, hilarious but quite believable characterizations, wry humor, ambitious scale. I couldn't help but picture actor Bob Hoskins as Keith - this made the book even funnier and richer to me.You don't write off a talent as great as Amis just because he takes an occasional misstep - this would be like writing off Dylan because he made Renaldo and Clara. Flawed or not, reading this book will greatly enrich your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrivance","review":"Martin Amis is following a tendency by some writers to write a story where complexity seems to be more important than the story itself. He is weaving in and out of several stories within the story to a point where it all becomes contrived and boring. The quest for complexity is also reflected in the vocabulary where Mr. Amis seems to have made a point of reaping the benefits from his investment in a thesaurus. What could have been a well-written story with fine portraits of characters from the more sordid sides of London life is lost in the intricacies of words for words sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept reading hoping it'd get better...It didn't","review":"The premise for London Fields was absolutely fascinating, I'd never read anything by Martin Amis, and I settled into the book not knowing what to expect, but being very excited to experience something new.What a complete waste of time. I think the problem is that I'm simply not sure how to enjoy this thing. The characters are certainly not meant to be realistic in any sense - but at the same time, they're all complete jackasses, so even as metaphors it's hard to care. There is ZERO plot - not a necessity but the book feels like it moves an inch over the 300+ pages. And absolutely no driving force.I've always had this theory that if you publish something, someone somewhere, somehow will enjoy it, and if you're a big enough name, that number will be exponentially bigger. I'll trust that London Fields is the one to fit the rule and that Money and Time's Arrow are much more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glib, vulgar book from an alienated writer","review":"Martin Amis, too talented for his own good, has created a London of over-the-top too uninteresting to be either repellent or satirical. Amis misses the mark (by a long way) of earlier novels such as the highly accomplised Money, probably because as we read we know he has written the words but he, as narrator, seems miles away. The result is, for all its mellifluous prose, a glib, vulgar treatise on class. A surprising misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Martin Amis' long (perhaps long-winded) novel about a femme fatale-psychic who is predisposed to being murdered as she entraps Keith Talent, a brutish dart player, and Guy Clinch, a struggling writer into her web of seduction and deceit. Amis pads this thin story with typically entertaining and satisfying scenarios that he seems to have a knack for, but the novel just isn't nearly as interesting as his Information or Money. At some point during the project, Amis lost touch with the original force of his conception, and you can tell that the rest of the material is simply a weak attempt to complete the aborted project. Not a bad read, but probably too much of a commitment for the quality, even among fans of Amis' usually interesting prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I've never rated a book on Amazon before, but I can't be quiet about this one. I saw the author's name mentioned favorably in an article and decided to read one of his books. A waste of my precious time. Frequently debated whether to continue to the end, and I'm sorry I did.

I've heard and read some harsh critiques, but in fact, I enjoyed the hell out of 'London Fields.' The last reviewer called it 'elitist' (after claiming to have read at a college level in the seventh grade-- now that's elitist!) (Smile) Yes, this book is at times obscure and repetitive, but overall, it's a great ride. Amis threw caution to the wind, which should be lauded, shouldn't it?

Hmmmmmm........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-reflexive metafiction of the best kind.","review":"\\"elking\\" hit the nail on the head. All the characters are authors, and Amis seems to be playing with the ideas that he (and his idol, Nabokov) stress so vehemently, that is, \\"look at what the author is doing.\\" Unlike the self-reflexive metafiction of Nabokov's Pale Fire, which gets a bit baroque at times (although it should be read by everyone, despite its difficulty level) or the rococco of John Barth (see LETTERS), Amis makes the form accessible while still letting those who have more scholarly or deeply engaged interests plenty to work with. A damn fun book on so many levels. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason why publishers employ editors...","review":"...and, unfortunately, it is quite clear that Mr. Amis never availed himself of the service. I remember coming to the end, feeling the narrative beginning to wind down to a conclusion, FINALLY.What a relief, I thought to myself. I made it through one of the longest books I've ever read.Then I looked, and I was only a third of the way through the book. I felt no emotion for Keith, nothing but derision for Guy, our \\"murderee\\" was nothing but a gorgeous whore, and as for the narrator? The only character for whom I felt any empathy was Kath, whose under-inclusion in the book seemed only to serve the purpose of giving the other characters something off of which to aimlessly bounce.The worst books are those about which, somewhere in the pages, I find myself asking, \\"Why should I care?\\" Not a page went by that I didn't ask that question.

Keith Talent (London Fields' most compelling character - now a modern icon) is an embodiment of Martin's talent - and his \\"darting\\" is an analogue to Martin A's writing. That's pretty obvious. I play darts - I once scored 180 in three darts in a pub match, the max. To play well, you need both pinpoint precision and total relaxation. You need to find a groove, not twitch, be true - or, as Keith put it, you need to throw \\"sincere darts\\". It can help to be drunk. The mind must be immersed - but thought is fatal. And that is what is so brilliant about this book (and \\"Money\\") - the instinctive quality of the writing. Any old Uni professor can THINK - and very boring it usually is.

The author continually misrepresented the true positions of calvinism and quoted many sources that were inferior. He never fully delt with the arguments brought out in Jonathan Edwards' \\"Freedom of the Will\\" and many times quoted an author for just a sentence or two and completely took the quote out of context. Also, he would quote a bible verse and not even discuss the calvinist's interpetation. He seems to have a problem with God being soverign even though he states that he believes in the soverignty of God. He also attributes some things to mere \\"chance\\".

Gets hot fast, but retains it's power through the cleaning process. It took me about 25 minutes to blow out and vacuum the dust in my pc, and it worked great. The attachments are outstanding! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good vac/blower for their system. Not recommended for anything else. If you want more power, buy another product.

The only good part about it is that it's small, lite and handy when working with electronics. On the bad side it's very underpowered, with the small tips there's just not enough air movement to suck out all the dust. We found it much easier to use regular Dyson vacuum with a small attachment and if you need to blow the dust out it definitely doesn't even compare to a can of compressed air. Also like others have mentioned the metal body of the vacuum heats up very quickly, you're probably not gonna get burned or anything but it's very strange that it heats up that quick. It's also loud as hell but then again most vacuums are.If you need a vacuum for electronics I would seriously suggest buying a regular vacuum with a set of small attachments for it.I hope this helps. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"I do a lot of electronics work on computers and audio equipment. This is much easier to use than compressed air.

Why I hate this product:1) Canister gets very hot very quickly; not hot enough to burn (I don't think), but certainly hot enough to make holding it uncomfortable, which leads me to . . .2) Unwieldy. Granted, my manual dexterity leaves something to be desired, but I found it near impossible to hold the canister, manipulate the nozzle, *and* still see inside my machine;3) Cheap attachments. They broke on the first try.4) And, finally . . . even if all of those issues were taken care of and perfect, the darn thing just won't pick up any dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I had been looking far and wide for a good small vacuum/blower to clean my computers out and boy does this one fit the bill. The only drawback on this machine is that it heats up pretty quickly. I believe that this was due mostly because of the attachment I used. When you use the smallest/narrowest blower end, it makes it harder on the motor. I have yet to test the suction part of it, but I'd say that if your using it under normal circumstances (without the extreemly narrow ends), that it most likely would not get so hot so fast. I would recomment this product to anyone especially for anyone looking for a good way to clean their computers out. You can't beat the price either, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"My experience with this product was bad","review":"My experience with this product was bad.

Of course, many powers-that-be would be adverse to this subversive idea, since it would in effect, instruct people on how to take control of their own lives out of the hands of malfeasant, greedy politicians and instead empower democracy through democracy, rather than the current American vogue of democracy at the point of a gun. The book describes several of the well-known non-violent movements as well as lesser known ones, such as the German women who embarrassed the Nazis into returning their arrested Jewish husbands from certain death. The associated documentary is also outstanding.

The most significant track, \\"(...)Tha Police\\", was never as honored as \\"The Message\\", but was just as poignant. I only wish they had included more bona-fide hits, but otherwise a good buy. \\"California Love\\" is a good add, as is \\"Steady Mobbin\\", but where's \\"EZ Duz It\\"?

A remarkable execution of an ephemeral idea, with each full color plate presenting a slightly different stylistic interpretation of the subject.

Call it whatever you want, its still just scare tactics. The author has been in collections for several decades and it shows. The author is definitely out of touch with today's society and acceptable business practices. He actively encourages letter writing and litigation, known to be the two worst approaches to collecting debt. Scare tactics, Scare tactics, Scare tactics. The example letters were so poorly written that I would be embarrassed to use them. The lack of a qualified proofreader is readily apparent.

No carry case but hey, a small zip lock works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta say no on this one","review":"I'm pretty much pure Nikon, but I wouldn't buy this again. Poor atomizer. Shoots out heavy blobs of cleaner, over a foot out before it turns into a mist.

I was never happy with this product. It just spreads the dust or fingerprints all over the lens and I still need to use more cleaning maneuvers to get rid of the dirt or dust. My best luck with cleaning my lenses was with a combination of the Air Blower and the pen brush-lens restoration pin. The lens manual always advises none contact cleaning as any scrubbing against your lens can damage it and this always start with good quality air blower.

It does not even come with a plastic bag to keep it in. The box is thin cardboard that will soon be useless. The result will be that the cleaning cloth will soon pick up grit and lint. It comes with nice one-use premoistened lens cleaning cloths, but there are only three of them! They will be great for emergency field use, but 3 will not last very long. The spray cleaner works well, but it has a large apray pattern. The result is that you end up spraying your camera in addition to the lens. All in all, a disappointment.

I bought the 4th season separately. Season 4 is packaged differently and the on-screen menu looks different which may indicate a different manufacturer.

Becker the show, 10 stars out of 5. Who ever put this dvd release together 1 star. Personal note: if Becker was a real doctor and lived near me, I would search him out to be my doctor. I did love the Sizzle reel, the cast interviews, the audience warm up reel, and the gag reel. Sure I could have said extras or special features but this gives more information, Those I give 5 stars. I have not watched all the set yet but if it is as good as what I have watched it will not be a downer for me, except the black rectangular box.

The terror one feels in The Traitor as the reliable Bolo succumbs to damage is a shade away from compelling, but still a darn good read.

The screen has those infamous trinitron lines (even though it's not a trinitron), one at about 20% from the bottom, and another at 20% from the top. I have a friend who bought the exact same model, same with his. The dot pitch claims to be a variable .25-.27, although judging by the clarity of picture, I'm scepticle to believe it, it's not the sharpest picture. It makes an excellent gaming monitor, but if you're into imaging or reading lines of text all day long, you might want to spend a little more dough.Bottom line: If you're on a budget and you want a decent, good quality flat screen, it's a great choice.

No inspiration and certainly no idea how Italian people live.Not that I do not know how Italian people live, as I spent years in Italy and visited every region from the Piedmont to Sicily and was invited in palazzi and masserie belonging to owners of every income and creative level.This books paints a picture of Italy's interiors of being all antique and rustique. Italian designers are about the most modern and leading ones in the world and most Italians I met integrate these modern designs in their homes. Even if the house is a thousand years old you will usually find some very modern furniture, lamps or decorations in it.I have seen more interesting rooms, houses, exteriors in the cities and villages I visited than the ones shown in this book. And there is no major city and no region in Italy I have not visited. This book was a huge disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What You need to know about God in 12 Lessons","review":"As I have used this book in the past for a teaching preaching series it has always been a very good source of material for helping new believers come into a full knowledge of the graces of God. It is a simple reading but very theolgical in nature. I don't know but i would have a good guess that it will be a classic book of the study of the goodness og God and how the new and older beleiver can grasp a hold of who God really is and what He has done for each one that will accept Him as their Saviour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of information","review":"Wow!

It is an amazing way to learn the time tables and how all parts of the bible fit in and correlate with each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"important topic","review":"Urban sprawl in American cities is an important topic, but this book doesn't cover it fairly or accurately. Broad assumptions and causalities are asserted and \\"proved\\" with anecdotal evidence. Facts are also wrong (p. 28 about densities of cities), or cited without the actual data. The underlying theme appears to be that all American cities function (or disfunction) in the same way and can all be fixed by imposing regional planning and equity redistribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"SELECT GOOD REFERENCES","review":"IN MY MIND AND ALSO BY CONSIDERATION MY THESIS SUBJECT I CHOOSE THIS BOOK AND BOUGHT IT.

YOU WILL NOT SORRY I AM SURE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I totally concur with the previous reviewer that this is a very disappointing book. The main reason I write another negative review is because apart from loving Borges' books, I also love crime and mystery novels. I always have a Borges book on the go; reading and rereading his fictions, poems and essays. Despite that I was extremely bored by this book. As a matter of fact I had great difficulty reading more than a few pages at a time as it was sending me to sleep every time. This is parody as it is signaled by the title, which for some reason is not given fully by amazon; the full title is Six Problems for Don Isidro Parodi. Perhaps the parody can be appreciated by those who know Argentine events and culture in the 40s but if so, such in-jokes were lost to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lightweight","review":"as Much as I Respect the Old Elton John the Mid-80's to Now John is pretty run of the mill.and this disc is a Snooze fest of the first order.the Material is really flat.very boring stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer Trash Polished","review":"i've come to the conclusion that this record is for the kids or the masses of white trash around the globe.P.S.

The best are the Spice Girls' Motown pastiche \\"My Strongest Suit,\\" Tina Turner's soulful \\"East As Life\\" and Kelly Price's passionate \\"The Gods Love Nubia.\\" But most of the rest of it is forgettable and dull at best or crass at worst.

Bravo to Tim Rice and Elton John for another sensational broadway musical. Keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woth waiting for!","review":"I can't say that the CD is bad. I listened to a few samples and like what they did with the music. But if its Broadway you are looking for, I suggest that you wait for the cast recording. I saw the play on Broadway yesterday, opening day, and it was everything I could have asked for and more! The voices of the cast are phenomenal and while this CD has its own special flair it lacks that certain broadway style. Anyone in the New York area can get the cast recording at the Nederlander theatre... the rest of you... I promise its worth waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlanta was better!","review":"I love Elton John. I love Sting, I love Tina Turner, I love Leann Rimes. I love most of the artists on this album! But Atlanta (where Aida premiered) was better. Well, of course, you say. The live version is always better. It is. But I wished they had not butchered this amazing and beautiful and fun musical by turning it into stuff that sounds like everyone else's stuff. This was an amazing performance in Atlanta. I got chills every time I heard Heather Headley's voice. This CD was not amazing; it actually made me sad. The only good tracks were the ones with Heather Headley on them. I feel like the world has been cheated out of a good version of these songs. Oh, and Heather Headley is a goddess."},{"rating":"2","title":"For What It's Worth","review":"I've seen Aida in its try-out period in Chicago, twice. I love the show and had to have the music. However, this concept CD is nothing like the music heard in the show. I enjoy the CD because it is the only way I can hear the music, but I can't wait for the cast soundtrack to come out. If I hadn't seen the show I probably would like the CD better than I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL","review":"This cd is great, Elton John and Tim Rice gave total control to the artists to make original fresh versions of the songs. These songs are not suppose to be like the musical, they are suppose to be more in the direction of modern pop music; which they are. On the plus side of this recording are john/rimes duet \\"written in the stars\\" Tina Turner's dramatic version of \\"easy as life\\", Turner's voice is in perfect form on this track, very soothing vocals and a soothing song. This is definetly an album to own, for it has a star studded line up ranging from Sting to Janet Jackson...a future classic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, the potential!","review":"Based on the lyrics and the melodies, this album had such a potential for greatness. Unfortunately, this potential was only partially fufilled. I knew full well when I bought it that it was not the original cast recording, or even close to it. I was disappointed, however, to find just how bad some of the matchups between artist and song could be. Take as an example, \\"Amneris's Letter\\". I love Shania Twain as a singer, and I love the song itself. Together, however, I wince whenever I hear it. Her voice was simply NOT meant to go that high. There were some high points on the album, such as Sting's \\"Another Pyramid\\" and the haunting trio \\"A Step too Far\\", but there were also low points. I have a feeling that the original cast recording, when it comes out, will be better than this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic show butchered","review":"After seeing the show and then listening to this album, I have to agree with what appears to be the majority of reviews on this site.

Wait for the cast album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this version","review":"and get the original Broadway cast recording!!!

They usually have chopped up versions of the songs and include unnecessary dialouge.I'd love to see every musical (broadway or movie) done this way!I appreciate the b'way versions, but I don't want to listen to them in my car..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton John Lost his Harmony in the Empty Sky","review":"It is evident that Elton's creative streak has come to a halt with the destruction of his vocal chords. Excess ingestion of seeds and substance caused the deterioration of the vocal chords, as well as track content. The other tracks are an upbeat compilation of 90's tunes. Digital technology sampling should be applied to bring Elton's younger vocal range back to his current works and leave Leann Rhymes out of the BIG PICTURE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I bought this CD primarily for the duet \\"Written in the Stars\\" with Elton & LeAnn, but in playing it over and over, I'm hard-pressed to state my favorite - it's one of my favorite CD's and is presently playing on my CD ROM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous (as life :)","review":"I have got this tremendous CD and I am delighted!...

I just knew the show was going to be great. When I finally did get to the see the show in Chicago, I fell in love with the music all over again. For those who are considering buying this CD, however, I suggest you wait until the cast recording comes out...not that this is a bad CD...it's just that the music for the actual show is EVEN BETTER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After seeing all the 5 star reviews, I'm going to have to go back and listen to this album again. I've been an EJ fan since 1970, but thought that this was about the worst product I'd ever heard him release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacking compared to the cast performance","review":"This soundtrack for AIDA was good, but I would have preferred it if Elton John and the Disney crew released a cast recording of the songs. For those of you whom haven't seen the stage production, it is VERY good; if you think the songs performed by the famous artists featured on this CD are good, you will be blown away by the cast performances. Perhaps when AIDA makes it to Broadway (my fingers are crossed), Elton will release the cast recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD !","review":"I really like most of the songs in the Album, espacially the two songs by Tina Turner and Kelly Price !"},{"rating":"2","title":"good variety and feeling","review":"This is a very good CD. \\"Written in the Stars\\" is an extremely emotional song, and it is my favorite on the album. I would like to see the show on Broadway, but I have to say I don't think it can be too much better than this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"HEATHER HEADLEY WILL TAKE AIDA TO NEW HEIGHTS!!","review":"After hearing the \\"Lion King\\" soundtrack and listening to Heather Headley sing \\"Shadowland\\" as Nala, I cannot begin to say enough about this dynamic newcomer. \\"Elaborate Lives\\" is such a touching song that is just magnified by Headley's angelic voice. Some songs on the cd are a bit chessy (Spice Girls) but for the most part it is a very entertaining album. I was impressed by Rymes and Turner also.....the other standout was Kelly price with her gospel rendition of \\"God's love Numbia)....what a voice!I would recommend this to anyone, and John/Rice should be commended for another fine piece of theater. Cant wait to see Headley in the title role of AIDA when it hits broadway next spring. The cast recording has to be a bestseller with Headley leading the cast!!!!A DIVA IS BORN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best of other people doing Elton's music!","review":"Elton did a great job with the songs...I was also able to obtain the Demo CD from England that was all Elton and once I heard that, and could understand the words (from Elton), then going back to the other CD, I could better appreciate the other artist's interpretations. Elton, we're ready for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor concept with few bright spots","review":"I bought this CD on the basis of Tina Turner's stunning performance of \\"Easy as Life,\\" which I sampled in the store. I should have sampled the entire CD before spending my money. Turner's song is perfectly delivered, and James Taylor does a lovely job with \\"How I Know You.\\" \\"Elaborate Lives\\" is also quite excellent. The rest of the CD is pure drivel; it's hard to justify John and Rice's score or musical concept. Yes, \\"Rent\\" is a derivative of \\"La Boheme,\\" but it uses modern musical idioms and contemporary situations to bring something new to the story. Larson repeats with a difference, thus making something new of the material. John and Rice simply rehash old ground without adding anything new or interesting. And it was such good ground to start with, one wonders why they bothered. Buy Verdi, his version is the only AIDA worth spending your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Cast Recording","review":"I saw Aida on Broadway this weekend. I would definitely wait for the cast recording (due out June 6, I believe). I have listened to it about 15 times in the last two days...I cannot get enough of Adam Pascal (whose presence is not on the Concept album), what a voice! And the combination of Heather Headley, Sherie Rene Scott, and Adam are amazing. You won't regret waiting for the cast recording, believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock \\"AIDA\\" Rock!","review":"This album combines a rock/ modern twist to the songs but the people who sing them are not singing the song/songs with passion that it deserves. The song Not Me should be sung by another person and not the group BoyzIIMen (not that I have anything against them) it's just the song needs a more higher range so that people will get the feel for the song. I have seen the Stage production of \\"AIDA\\" in Chicago,IL on 12/11/99 and I think the album just dosent live up to the stage version. I know it isn't supposed to live up to the stage version but the songs just dont have enough heart to them. The only songs that do live up to the stage version are Another Pyramid, A Step Too Far, Elaborate Lives, and How I Know you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought this book","review":"While being an informative introduction to goat packing, this book is also fun to read and funny.

You don't have to go to the trouble of incorporating each property to keep the fear of having personal assets taken through a liability claim; that's why you carry insurance, and a lot. A big policy is more than sufficient, and most courts will not allow lawsuits from taking your primary home.Time being money, it's much faster and easier to sign a policy than to do the tedious and never-ending paperwork to incorporate a property.

My complaint about the book is the broad generalization it makes about the \\"bad entities\\" ('general partnerships' being one of them). The author tells you that a general partnership is a bad entity because you are personally liable for debt. Later on, as he describes corporations and LLCs, he mentions that small start-up are usually required by lenders to provide a personal guarantee that debt will be paid. Thus, even in those types of structures, the owner is still personally liable and their assets are at risk. He fails to mention that liability insurance can protect an business owner from some of the personal liability. It would have been nice if he could have provided more details in this area in order to distinguish between the two structures since the liabilty is the same. Maybe I just missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book expected to get some insight on how the rich use company ownership to grow their wealth.

Instead, I took a seminar and I accomplished a lot more and got more than enough information to set one up. Of course, it costs a lot more to do so. However, it is the best alternative.

That Michael largely succeeds is a testimony to his great gifts as a novelist. The main flaw of the book is that Michael has perhaps too many main characters, and this dilutes the thrust of the novel, the momentum, and the reader's ability to respond to the plight of the characters. But on the upside, Michael is able to create a great deal of tension in this novel. He moves fluidly from the Israeli Jewish world, the world of Israeli Arabs, Palestinian Arabs, and every identity in between, and is completely at home in each. He tackles the thorny subject of sexual relations between Israeli Jews and Arabs, making it the fulcrum for his examination of Arab-Jewish relations. Violence, sex, and identity become entwined in interesting and novel ways in Refuge, surprising and even shocking the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onyx Sink","review":"The sink was shipped very quickly, however upon unpacking it we found that there were several chips on the rim.

Just amazing how simple meaning of life can be if one dares to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book that has alot of nuggets on efficiency improvement. Recommending reading once to learn the concepts, then going back through the implementation chapters when you set up the system. Highly recommended. I bought a couple other efficiency/time management books and none came even close to this for tips I actually use on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Getting Things Done has been an incredible help to my work life, and I look forward to implementation at home. It is a comprehensive system which enables you to handle all your tasks, your goals and dreams, without a burdensome recaculation every day on your calendar. I highly recommend this read, but only if your willing to implement the changes and systems that are advised. If you do, you will not regret it, and it will save you 1-2 hours a day, and increase your professionalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in the filing!","review":"This book is full of great ideas for setting up a filing system that you trust so that you can get your To Do list out of your head (which is where I used to keep it). I have started using some of the things he suggests like having a Someday/Maybe file. I keep this in a binder and am able to put things like books I'd like to read or trips I'd like to take with my family in there. I used to write these all on slips of paper or in a notebook where they would be hard to find. Now I can just open the binder to see what the title of that book I wanted to read was. I am currently working on reorganizing my whole filing system based on the recommendations in this book but I must say it is taking a long time. I am excited to have it all organized though. I have recommended this book to many and a couple have said they are going to buy their own copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This System Will Revolutionize Your Life -- Personal + Work","review":"Wow!!! I just heard David Allen lecture at a conference I attended. Amazing stuff! If you want to truly reduce your stress by having a practical way to \\"organize\\" your life and work there is no better way to do it than David's system. It is unique--I've never heard anything like it before. As a result I'm going to buy this book and recommend it to everyone. This is a MUST read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"My problem isn't so much organization as it is procrastination, but David's method and overall plan are elegant and powerful. At work, I've been using his do it, defer it, delegate it, trash it approach with pretty good success.The book is just about the right length and I didn't find myself skimming all that often. The headings and pullquotes are descriptive and break up the monotony pretty well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great method for those with OCD","review":"For the others, this book presents quite a few valuable elements that can be borrowed to increase efficiency, so overall I consider it a very worthwhile read. However messy and impulsive you are, this book will definitely make you rethink some of your methods and improve quite a bit - I think 20% to 30% of time saved (while getting the same things done) is a reasonable expectation for most readers.But I do think that no sane person will follow this system as-is with no shortcuts - it is simply too formal. The trick is not to try and see if it works, but to borrow the right elements to make your work more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, I'm Using it.","review":"I have read both books first from the library and only bought the paperback of Allens second book, Ready for Anything.I am now buying the hardcover edition for this book because I plan to use it over and over. I have been a student of effective work flow for 15 years and this is one of the best methods I have found to clear your work surfaces and your mind to get down to creative, fun productive activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"a system worth considering","review":"Not quite finished with the book yet but appreciate the over-all system and am working to implement it. It's a good read for anyone interested in taking a look at his or her personal system of organization (or lack thereof) and at least making a few improvements or even whole-hearted change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A lot of simple, useful tips. I've read this book many times and always get a little more depth out of it. Even if you don't use the prescribed system from the book it offers a great deal of insight into organizational challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This has been a great resource to get organized both at home and at work. This is definitely the best book I have read on this subject and would recommend it to anyone who is \\"stuck\\" and overwhelmed wtih paperwork and piles. With 4 kids and a small business it has worked wonders for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This system is great","review":"It takes a while to adapt the \\"bad\\" practices that I had to his system. I really did not have to change myself - just change some behaviors that I had - and suddenly it works. No longer do I forget what I should be doing. My Boss was so impressed that I gave him the book. I have never felt more productive, - but the biggest gain is the ability to do the higher thinking again because the brain is no longer using itself to remember details.It is not EASY though. Make the investment. I have had to read this book three times through to get the whole system down - but it was SO worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficiency encapsulated!","review":"I'm guessing that David Allen doesn't think screwing around on Amazon writing reviews does much to increase productivity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow, easy to stick with.","review":"David's flowchart is easy to follow and easy to stick with. Since I read this book 5 months ago, I am still using the techniques recommended by this book. My email \\"in-box\\" has gone from regularly holding over 200 messages to now filling up less than 1 screen in Lotus Notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, Useable and Insightful","review":"David Allen's approach to productivity is the most useable I have come across. I find many books on organisation and time management to be dry, boring, predictable and too rigid - that is not the case with this book. This has allowed me to continue with my usual style of having many projects happening at once and still have the paperwork under control.I use the tips from this book EVERYDAY and have recommended it to numerous clients. I also recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Ideas - Tedious Delivery","review":"This is the most overrated book I've ever read. The problem is not the model, nor the concepts, it's that the book essentially 280 pages of common sense.All of the core concepts in the book could have been easily compressed into a 2 page flyer with a picture of the model and some basic \`Getting-Things-Done' tips.I must be missing something, but I got to page 210 and couldn't keep going - it was just dry, repetitive and repetitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"My \\"to-do\\" piles are gone!","review":"Sometimes we just need a kick in the pants to remember the things that work, and this book is a perfect kick. Easy to read and - more importantly - easy to put into action! I've been living in the GTD world for four weeks now and the piles on my desk aren't growing back. The method is easy and sustainable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, if you dont know what a list is","review":"Seriously? The advise here appear to be - in my opinion, \\"make a list, review the list, do whats on the list.\\" Um, yeah, I got that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"The concepts in this book are excellent for people with little or no organization in their life. I've always made efforts to stay on top of everything I had to do, and was hoping this book would teach me something new to put squeeze a bit more productivity and efficiency into my daily grind.Unfortunately, nothing in this book should be new to anyone who has put the slightest bit of effort into attempting to improve their productivity.Then, to make matters worse, the book rambles and repeats (and rambles and repeats, and...). Additionally, although I'm usually a pretty quick reader, but the inordinate amount of sidebar notes in this book slowed my reading, are extremely distracting, and provide zero added benefit.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the material would be beneficial for some people despite the poor presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system and flow chart, and repetitive","review":"The flow chart in this book helped me to visualize how I can de-stress my life, and Allen's two minute rule is saving me a ton of time. The book could get the message across in fewer words. Recommended highly with this book is Optimal Thinking by Rosalene Glickman to maximize thinking and situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book, indeed","review":"This is a very detailed, serious and logical system to get things done. You may or may not buy the whole system (lists and lists), but implementing some of his advice brings quick results. The alphabetical filing worked very well for me. Dating documents and information was also very valuable. This is simple but it works. I bought it at a time when I took a new job, and it helped me to be more organized and to process the backlog of work. What I discovered is that you still need to find your own organizing style. This guide is quite specific in its advice but you do not have to use the whole system. Just use the \\"organizing\\" blocks that suit your style. In the end, I am less frustrated with my organizing skills than before and I am going to re-read the book to improve my skills further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"How can the Kindle version possibly cost more than the paper version. You have all of the same costs minus printing, shipping, and storage. This is a glaring ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top ot the tops","review":"This is the most interesting useful book i ever needed, this book helped get through a very messed up time. i started running an online business couple of years ago with no idea about management, the business went well so also out of my limited management knowledge .in this book i learned some very useful strategies in dealing with everyday stress and making sure thing are organized and quite done stress free.i love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing organization","review":"I searched for this book because I was in a situation of stress and low productivity. Before knowing about GTD, I started to write down little to-do's lists to help me focus and organize my life (basically related to day job and my master dissertation). It created a kind of \\"light-at the-end-of-the-tunnel-feeling\\", but I still couldn't decide what to do first, and I still didn't have a full grasp of everything. Reading David Allen's formula for productivity changed my way of thinking and handling all life activities.The book is very descriptive, a true step-by-step guide that we can immediately apply. It's detailed, with examples and great discussions.Highly recommended for anyone who wish to have a upgrade of life organization and productivity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the audio version","review":"If you think the printed version is bad just wait until you have to listen to the audio version. Total bore fest and too much info for an audio. The ideas mentioned are super basic. I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews read a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Just like probably everyone else, I have used and use a variety of productivity management tools. After I started using PocketInformant on my iPhone as my calendar and to-do list application I decided I needed better background on the GTD system. I found this book very helpful in explaining the GTD system and how to implement it in my life. Easy to read and thoughtfully organized, I give this book the highest possible rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"De-clutter your office and your mind!","review":"David Allen gives you specific tasks to organize and streamline your life and business. Do it or drop it - words to live by if you want to eliminate clutter in your office and in your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"10x longer than it should be","review":"It seems a lot of people have benefited from this book, but for me, I didn't find the book very appealing. I'm still trying to make sense of the program, though I admit I did skim the last 100 pages. It was much, MUCH longer than it needed to be, imo, and it was scattered and fragmented in so many different sections and topics, my head was spinning. The core program could have been described in a few pages, but then again, that wouldn't be a very marketable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too abstract and too long","review":"Since I'm into organizing things and also maintain an online organizer (bookmark-manager.com) I thought I give this book a shot. Unfortunately I found this book too abstract and long. Many of the tips seem to be just common sense like David Allen admitted himself at the end of the book. The quotes left and right all the time are more distracting than helpful. One at the beginning of each chapter might have been enough. Enough though this review could be viewed as negative I admit that I haven't read it completely and English is not my first language, which might partly the reason the book wasn't useful for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book works!","review":"This is a most helpful and uncomplicated book which takes personal/business organising to a new level. The philosophy is explained well before embarking on the step by step journey through the process. Various quotes and overviews help to reinforce particular points along the way. I have suggested to all of my team members that they should purchase a copy as in the future it will form the basis for managing our various projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"GTD as advertised","review":"My view of these type of books is simple: if you pick up one helpful hint or habit it is worth it. This is worth it. If nothing else use the way to handle the avalanche of email I/you get is worth the cost of the book. Buy it kiddies...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book of unique ideas for organization as promised","review":"The book is a series of warmed-over ideas from a multitude of sources. I saw nothing unique in the 100 or so pages I read about organizing my life, particularly since it was directed at corporate. I didn't even get the book done. It's on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should this book cost the same for KINDLE as for the physical media?","review":"Explain to me why I should pay the same amount for a digital edition of a book that doesn't need to be warehoused printed or shipped as I do for the physical book which requires all of the same???Sorry Amazon...no kindle for me (and I'll tell all of my friends why) until you stop with the greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Useless Drivel","review":"I am appalled that this book is getting so much attention. My company even distributes the book to every employee (bumping out the equally unimpressive \\"Seven Habits\\").I couldn't even sit through the whole book at once; I had to drag myself almost paragraph by paragraph just to finish it. A combination of corporate drivel and mindless observation, the \\"tips\\" he offers are useless at best, and counterproductive at worst.It is amazing that so many people are screwing their lives up so badly that this book is actually helpful to them.If you want a truly helpful self-help program, try Dale Carnegie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"This book really doesn't tell you anything new, nothing that you didn't already know, unless you've never worked in an office before. There is lots of repetition, and the author has a penchant for stating the obvious and making it seem as if he is giving you some great secret or principle. He never gets down to the nitty-gritty; he never gives you a step-by-step procedure for processing your documents quickly and getting the data entered into the computer quickly and then getting the papers into the files quickly. That's what we want to know, not some abstract flow chart. He never shows exactly how to multitask with constant interruptions. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Bored. Hopefully I can get things done in my sleep","review":"The hardest thing is finishing this book. I will not be able to get this thing done!Are people getting paid to write 5 star reviews?As we speak, I am listening to the audiobook of \\"Getting Things Done\\" and falling asleep. To stay awake, I am writing this review. There must be an art to getting through this book.To save some time and money, go to Office Depot and buy organization supplies and skip this audiobook"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't wasted my money","review":"I just finished listening to the audio book, \\"The 4 Hour Work Week,\\" which was an amazing book. Maybe that's why when I began listening to this book, I had a hard time staying awake. I kept asking myself, when is this guy going to get to the point? Why doesn't he just come out and say it? Stop worring about sounding educated and teach me something.To be honest, I could not listen to the entire book. Maybe there are some good things in there, but I had heard enough to know I wasn't going to waste any more of my time. I am currently listening to \\"The 4 hour work week\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Lector","review":"I got the audio version out from the library. I listened to a couple hours of it. It seemed like it would be useful. Then, I made the mistake of Wikipedia-ing the author. Oy. He is an ordained minister with the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness (google it), has been married four times, and claims to have 35 professions before the age of 35. Sorry, but I have a bad habit of judging a book by its author. Next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best quality printing!","review":"I'm early in the book, yet it's easy to see it will be at least 4 stars. I must warn readers, however, that this is a poor quality printing. The pages are thin and the print contrast is poor. I'm surprised Penguin's standards have slipped this low. The text deserves a better vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very original","review":"Most of his ideas in his system are modified version of other authors. Nothing really original about this book. It's almost a survey class in time management. A lot of it was taken from Robert Covey's First things First. All he did was change the wording but the idea is still Robert Covey's. And there is an excessive amount of motivational fluff. Anyone whose read Tony Robbins know that motivational fluff only works till you put the book down. Read Seven habits of highly effective people, first things first, and unleashing the warrior within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every one should read this book","review":"Just like the title states; Getting things done. If you need a little extra help in this area you should read this book. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revolutionary Bottom-Up Approach to Productivity: The Best There Is","review":"This is a revolutionary system that manages time and life from the bottom-up, rather than the top-down that most other productivity system uses. Allen uses a filtering method that deals with work as they come in, organizing them in various contexts and category systems for easy retrieval. David believes that we can achieve stress-free productivity by using a reliable system that can store everything we need.This book was the breakthrough I needed to take my life to the next level. With a top-down peak performance strategy (Unlimited Power), a productivity system (4-Hour Work Week), technology tools (Lifehacker), my 7-Hour School Week, and this book, there is nothing in the world that you can't do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is in good condition","review":"Although it's a book of 10 year, it's in good condition. No missing pages, no scratches, no tears. A good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spends too much time discussing what people do","review":"This book is full of filler content instead of actual useful content. It spends a lot of time talking about how people usually handle a situation or how someone normally plans out a project. I would rather the book spend more time talking about the right way to plan a project and give examples, or include more examples on how to organize a list of things.I could also do without the first chapter which just discusses why the author wrote the book. I'd rather the author just get down to the facts, I don't have time to read through all the frivolous content, I want just the facts when I read a book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great services","review":"Great service. During shipping 1st cd was broken. They turn around and send me new 1st CD. Within schedule time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good delivering time","review":"Although I live in China, the delivering time was very short. I got my book far before scheduled by Amazon. Good service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful","review":"this book was recommended by a friend. i found it to be very helpful indeed great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"View from Mars","review":"I bought this book becasue there were so many five star reviews. Mr Allen provides a broad, general and lose archicture for getting things dome. Making lists, using folders you can buy at the office supply store, setting and organizing priorieties are true but are presented a very general general manner. Anyone might tell you this. Allen uses the 50,000 ft metaphore for describing his approach. At that altitude, it is hard to determine anything yet alone get things done. There is nothing new here, and the presentation is not not very usefullI have decided to pay more attention to the negative reviews before buying a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Things Done","review":"The book puts forth some decent ideas for getting a handle on your to do list - but is way too granular. For example, at one point the author gets into a discussion of whether you are better off using hanging folders or not. It appears to me that much of the content was developed to justify being published as a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good System I Actually Use (part of)","review":"I really liked this book for time management. He presents some really good ideas like being able to rely on a system to remember ideas that you put into the system. This clears up your mental energy for focusing on the task(s) at-hand. I think his system goes a little overboard and is a bit outdated (come on now, physical files?). But, this is definitely a key piece of education for mastering your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the businessman...","review":"I feel weird raving about a business book. In fact, the business-ese (e.g. \\"deliverables\\") and business context of most of the examples deters me from giving it five stars.That said, I think David Allen completely nailed the psychology of how I deal with \\"stuff\\" in my life. While I probably will use his principles/processes/systems (See what I mean about \\"business-ese\\"?), I'm really looking forward to how I imagine it will help me deal with all the literal and metaphorical clutter in my life. I've starting implementing it and do feel the greater ease of being less preoccupied by all the things I feel are \\"un-done.\\"Check back in with me in six months. That's when it'll be really clear whether the book is one to rave about..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am getting things done!","review":"Love this book. Helping me keep my insane work schedule in check. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with many responsibilities who needs to learn to keep his or her life in balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very helpful","review":"Very helpful book and it forces you into thinking about your priorities for projects. It describes an excellent way to clearly organize tasks and projects into different \\"buckets\\". The philosophy behind it, the idea of storing as much information about a task in one place and making it easy to reference anything related to that task is a simple idea but it is hardly done!My only complaint is that the later parts, about the larger view of things, is weak. It's a great help for organizing the next day, week or month, but after that, you'll need to look outside the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ideas","review":"The book had some good ideas, some of which are immediately available to try. Although I may not be able to do everything, it does make you focus on what is important, and try to prioritize and chunk items into doable bits. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting your act together","review":"This is a well written book that sets out the mechanics of and the philosophy behind a system for organizing all of the stuff that one has on the lists to do. The concepts themselves are interesting and useful individually. GTD (Getting Things Don) is a popular topic on the blogs these days, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful if you are a homemaker or work from home...","review":"This book might live up to the hype for what it can do for managers of teams, busy executives and supervisors but if you work at home, particularly by yourself, there is not much here. There is a helpful chart early on in the book which can help one decide how to handle paper and the suggestions for setting up filing system are universal but I was not looking for tips on productive brainstorming sessions with a group of people. Many times he mentions homemakers and soccer schedules but application of his methods is lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sage !","review":"The system he proposes is incredibly practical. Even though most of it is common sense, it would be tough to come up with all the pieces on your own. Really great, blows Covey and all the others out of the water. I never take the time to post reviews, but I feel I owe it to the author - he deserves to be very rich. A very wise man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Email monster is finally under control","review":"Until I read this book and followed its recommendations, email was a nightmare. Allen gives good advice on how to manage email and where to begin to get all projects and tasks into one place to more easily manage them. I still follow Allen's advice on not using your email in-box as a To-Do list, and completing a task immediately if it takes two minutes or less.To get a handle on how to address focus and priorities, and finding ways to do less instead of more, all resulting in less stress, I would recommend Leo Babauta's book \\"The Power of Less\\" and his blog \\"Zen Habits\\". I think he has synthesized material from many time management sources and added a touch of his spiritual practice into his recommendations. They are simple and work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well - this is a surprise!!","review":"So I ordered GTD from Amazon after reading several websites and blogs and going to the David Allen site as well. I got the book, opened the cover and saw that the book began on page 15 -- pages 1-14 and all the front matter were missing. Still the bulk of the information was there, so I began reading it, after contacting Amazon to report the defective book and order a replacement.Amazon, lickety split, sent me a new copy of GTD. This copy was ALSO missing pages before page 15, but also had pages out of order...what?????So here I am getting things done, and reminding myself (a la Fly Lady) that it's progress, not perfection. Meanwhile I'll send this new copy back and try yet again. It gets 4 stars (because the content is transformative), not five because the quality control problem is so surprising in a book on productivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well written book","review":"I did not find this book very useful. The same information is repeated over and over which makes it boring. I personally did not like the writing style of the author. Not an easy book to read. Reading the book only increased my stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do I keep falling for these things?","review":"It's true, I haven't finished this book yet, but already I feel duped by the delusion that reading a book will solve my procrastination issue. This just feels like another diversion from really doing things.So far it feels very redundant and obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"reminder\\" of some old tools","review":"That's my thought when I took a first look at the book. The author writes in an easy-reading way, which helps you turn things real, or \\"get the thing done\\". No break-through methodology, but useful hints."},{"rating":"2","title":"My inbox is EMPTY!","review":"For the first time ever, my inbox is empty and I feel like I've got things \\"under control\\". My anxiety level is down and I can truly focus on current projects and actions without an open loop of stuff turning through my head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STAY Organized","review":"Most of what is in this book is easily implemented. I put the basics learned to use and it certainly helped me keep track of the mundane AND important daily, weekly, yearly tasks. The file organization was a wonderful help. Even though the book may be a bit wordy (probably publisher requested) this book is one of the best I've seen on the subject and his plan is easy to keep up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"If you want a modern version of this text, check out anything that Lifehacker has written. This book is very dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many systems - this was exciting and fun","review":"There are so many systems - GTD is just one. But no matter what system you use, you will benefit from getting to know David Allen. When he's through, you will understand how, but more importantly why you would enjoy getting your act together. It's all hard work, anyway. Getting a grip on things is actually less work.But, most important: He is really good on the audio, great guy. Much fun. Gave me the goosebumps, realized so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book useful","review":"Very good book, useful tips and a good explanation about the productivity. The workflow was very helpful and friendly, a reference for most of us. I strongly recommend it. Hence, an obligatory reading for people this days, we have a lot information to deal and get moving on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was my OCD!","review":"Heard about this book listening to Howard Stern so I ordered a copy. As suspected it reinforced methods I have developed for myself over the last 40 years that use to seem like just a case of OCD. Also, interesting is how the martial arts aspect fits into this equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for great productivity","review":"This is a great book to anyone who feels overwhelmed due to the amount of work they many currently have. It keeps one focused and it is a great tool to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Resource","review":"Other reviews have sung the praises of this book, so I'll just add that the key for me in accessing the material was actually throwing away the half that I didn't need. Allen's designed his system to have interlocking parts, but the basic ideas work well separately as well. His folder structure and the way he configures his lists is super helpful. His 10K, 20K etc. review plan and such, not so much. Great book, though, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leverage the paradigm to create opportunities of buzzwords","review":"This book creates a comfortable zone of sophistication with an abundant and abounding proliferation of buzzwords and jargon, designed to facilitate the reader's engagement with the material.Stripped of the jargon, the book says \\"figure out what stuff you want to solve, make lists of how to solve them, prioritize those lists, and write things down to free up your brain space.\\" There is the entire work, deprived of jargon and endorsements, in 28 words.For some crazy reason, the Kindle version costs more than the paperback. For sake of not empowering such modalities of information transference pricing strategies, I procured a cover-deprived volume at a purveyor of previously owned printed works."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting things done","review":"Environmental Cleanup Coalition and The Gyre Cleanup Project would like to thank David for his amazing insight and concise way of expressing in print. This will dove tail nicely into our philosophy of getting the oceans cleaned up and restored back to optimal health. [...]Our deepest gratitude,Aloha Richard Sundance Owen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Anyone Have The Time To Do This System?","review":"Anyone who has the time to do Allen's system does not have a time management problem. This approach would be attractive to productivity experts, but is simply unworkable to the average over-worked Sally or Joe. It takes three hours a week just to feed this system and keep it going! I laid awake at night trying to figure out if an e-mail goes in @computer or @work? I could never find anything after I followed his system. Maybe it's me, but I believe there is better time management advice out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another audio CD..","review":"I found this CD set to be somewhat of a dry, lengthy production with little information we don't know already. He talks about how to arrange your workstation for optimal productivity- which is a process we all go through to get things done efficiently. If you are new to the workplace with no experience at all on how to get things done and optimize your workspace, then this book is for you. If you already are a professional, don't expect to find any new ideas here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased!","review":"I was pleased with this purchased. Reasons why?

Viola - \\"stress free productivity.\\"Practically speaking, though, it was a flop. Without priorities, I had no idea what was important and what was ephemera.

I think it is well written and very useful. Basically the system uses lists and simple filing to organize all of your incoming \\"stuff\\". The most interesting aspect was the psychological relief you get from knowing all your thoughts and incoming data are captured and filed away for action later on.

Just using some of Allen's tips and tricks can prove very useful. I've recommended this book to many clients, most of which are time-deprived owners of emerging enterprises.The only challenge I see with implementing GTD in full, is having 1-2 days to properly setup the system in the first place.

The plan is sound and I'm starting by jumping in with one foot.... (I haven't fully digested everything to the point that I can jump in with both feet).

I have found some great information at the author's web site, including some technology suggestions and some docs on how to use GTD with Blackberry, Lotus Notes and other systems. Much information is free, but the aforementioned \\"tech guides\\" are $10 and include some high-level basics about GTD before the detailed \\"set-up\\". I agree with one of the other reviewers that the book has a lot of examples, maybe too many, but they were much like my situation and they actually encouraged me to proceed with the system.

The many ideas and systems described by Allen sound great but, in the end, do not generate a coherent system. Of the dozens I could cite, I give just two examples.1. On page 170 he admonishes the reader to not use a categorization of \\"Hold and Review\\". One paragraph later he says that anything that one would have put in \\"Hold/Review\\" should actually go in \\"Read/Review\\"....with no substantive differentiation.2. The book is replete with instances where Allen creates a proper noun such as \\"Someday/Maybe\\" and then overlays it with another word \\"Incubate\\"...which sounds an awful lot like \\"Hold (incubate?) and Review\\".While I did not attempt to do so, my overwhelming impression is that a systematic reconsideration of the system and a rewriting of the book in which every component fits in a coherent way with the next, could turn this into a useful system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much common sense","review":"This whole book really could have been summarized in ten pages. The rest is just fluff, mindless personal commentary on how to organize stuff without any reason on why Allen's way is better than other ways he criticizes in the opening.

But a convent is no place for the boundless energy that Jeanne has. So when she is invited to go to New France (Qubec) to be a wife to a man there, she hastly agrees, her sense of adventure rousing inside of her, and after 8 years living in a dull convent she was ready for some excitment. So she leaves France. When she arrives she expects to find a gallant military man but instead a hunter/architect comes to pick her up. The story of Jeanne's courage and bravery in New France and with the new family she comes to love and care for is truely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great historical novel","review":"\\"The King's Daughter\\" was a great book, and very interesting! It told about Jeanne, a French orphan in the 1600s, who goes to New France (Canada) as a \\"king's daughter\\". That is what the French girls who went to marry the men in New France were called, and they were very important in history.Jeanne hopes to marry a kind military man, but instead marries a poor, rough hunter, and she fears that he loves his dead wife more than she. Times are hard in New France, but she continues to try to find happiness in her new home and life.This book was very exciting and interesting, and I'd recommend it for ages 10 - 14. The text is somewhat simple sometimes, however, because it was translated from French, but other than that I loved it! I would also recommend \\"Calico Bush\\", about a French girl in young America, and \\"A Coal Miner's Bride\\", a \\"Dear America\\" novel about an immigrant in an arranged marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!","review":"This is a great story about life in New France.

The case fits snugly around the Zune. The port holes for the buttons and earphone jack are a little sunken because of the thick silicone. This isn't a problem as long as you can poke your nails through to the buttons which isn't to hard to do. The case doesn't have any screen protection but overall, the protection offered is nice. It also gives the Zune a better aesthetic with the textured padding sides and front. The case only seems to come in black. more colors would have been appreciated. The Case also comes with a arm band strap for runners. The elastic armband is surprisingly high quality and is easily attached to the case if desired.I personally bought this item to make my Zune 30 (1st gen) look and feel better. This product does the job fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price","review":"Great case for the price.

I'm not so sure I trust the armband it came with however as the velcro has no snap or lock in place to prevent it from being opened from the weight of the player.I'm fairly certain it was my fault and I simply did it wrong, but I could not get the screen protector it comes with to go on without creating a tiny air bubble, fortunately it was clear enough that it wasn't an issue and I just left it like that since it's in a bottom corner.Overall a worthwhile purchase though I bought it when it was a few bucks cheaper I would still pay up to three to five dollars for it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good skin case for the price","review":"This is a good skin case for the price. Would have given it 5 stars except the headphone jack opening is too small for larger connectors. I have an FM modulator in my older car which allows me to plug the Zune directly into the radio.

For about six bucks, including shipping, it's not worth sending back.The product itself is probably just fine on the appropriate model - but the very insufficient description gets it a one star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memories of childhood","review":"I can't possibly top what others have written about this fabulous show, but all I know is I'm SO glad to find out that it's finally coming to DVD. I was just 10 years old when I watched The Patty Duke Show, and it has always been a favorite. The theme song was unforgettable, but the most remarkable thing about the show was its star. Patty Duke was simply AMAZING in this show, playing two very distinctive characters. She is totally believable, and you really do feel as if you're watching two different people. Her performances are quite remarkable. It's no wonder that on the cover art of this DVD set it states \\"The Patty Duke Show\\" Starring Patty Duke. She deserves two mentions for the two characters she plays. Great fun and what a talented girl. \\"The Patty Duke Show\\" is that rare breed of sitcom; genuinely funny and absolutely charming; a classic show that will delight the young and the young at heart.

I hope that the other two seasons come out soon. There has been much said that the missing pilot is on this set, but it is not. The show is great as it was in its original form. There is a \\"card\\" like shuffling sound on the menu that brings up the episodes so I don't know if this is minor defect in the processing, but it is minor and doesn't detract from the enjoyment. It was good to see interviews with the surviving cast. Great classic show and great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different!","review":"First off im just gonna say that this game is very weird, one of the most unique games ever. You will probably never play any game like this unless there is a sequel. This is because of the way you learn new spells, you date women! This is very funny because of what they ask and their different reactions, and it is in dialogouge and interactive anime! My complaints are in the battle system factor, it is just kinda dumb. Your three characters are lined up in a row and when on dies the other comes in, so you only fight with one character at a time. This game is very fun, and it can help all those desperate guys out there who aren't gettin' any action. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Started good, BUT...","review":"This game started out very interesting, but as it wore on, i got bored and just stopped playing.

On one hand it has so many original idea's in terms of both plot and gameplay (And has the closest thing to a sim dating game we'll probably ever see), but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words. It's not that the battle system makes no sense, or is bad even, it's the leveling up that confuses me. You don't get stronger when you level up. Your defense gets weaker when you level up. You get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too. I'm am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good idea's and make them so poor because they can't figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling up.If you want an RPG that's original get this...just don't exspect to get anywhere with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a cool game","review":"I know this wont help much, but I thought this was such a fun game, that I would let everyone know!

I had to pull the battery, replace the batter, reboot the unit and go into reformat mode. Then copy the BaseMap back into the unit and life was good for about a week.

What 'JACK & JILL PARTY' lacked, 'Rocket' more than makes up for. Thumping beats, excellent choice of songs and many different production styles.

The gaps are filled with speculation presented as fact - and those gaps started with the openning words. I guess starting with 1983 during the Reagan years was easier for his agenda than starting in 1978-79, with Carter's own agenda for a highly trained group of assassins in violation of Pres.

For example, in the movie Marty is given detention, but we are never shown him in detention. The book shows Marty getting out of detention in a very ingenious way.Admittedly, these novelizations were more fun-and more necessary-before the advent of VCRs and DVDs. These books allowed you to replay the movies in your head, being shepherded and prompted by the book.There is a charm to the \\"Back To The Future\\" franchise.

I still remember taking it from the shelf, reading a bit, and immediately knowing that I was at a turning point in my life, that I was ready for a breakthrough. After years of searching for the truth, this book not only helped me understand what enlightenment is, it helped me getting closer to it, it helped me understand and appreciate life, be grateful for everything I experience. Each time I wake up during a day (that is, I realize that I am alive, I am aware of what is happening, I am present, awake, alive!) I owe the experience to my teachers. Osho is by far the clearest in his explanations of what works and what does not work on the spiritual path. Reading this book helped me understand other great spiritual works as well (and the divine hilarious confusion about them).

The Rolls-Royce Guru died in January 1990 (search the web ; you will not be disappointed). Do not misunderstand me, I think this book or books (a collection of 5 volumes originally)is fantastic and I have practiced the meditations but the reader has a right to know to what end any technique can be used.

It's one of those books that you might receive or buy, let it sit around for months or years w/out even looking at it, and one day pick it up and finally realize how amazing it truly is. Most books philosophize and intellectualize about spirituality; this book (and Tantra as a whole) shows you HOW to get there. Moreover, this book is filled with amazing psychological insight.

The third disc is very interesting from a songwriters / arrangers' perspective, with early demo versions that, in some cases, bear little resemblance to the versions which were eventually released on vinyl/disc. RLJ is a remarkably gifted songwriter and performer -- if you are unfamiliar with her recordings, this is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"MInor disappointment","review":"This anthology lacks continuity and some tunes are not well produced. I got it for a bargain price and really like Ms. Jones' music, but would be quite unhappy if I'd paid full retail for this one. There are many good tunes for your money if you can get it for the right price. I believe I'll study it and do a remix, using the other couple rlj albums I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"denlan","review":"It's a shame, I wonder sometimes how some no talented singers like Rickie Lee Jones managed to even sing somewhere and have a record company sign them. She's awful, no voice at all. I rated 1 star only because 0 star is not available on the scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Album!","review":"I admit my own fault here: Based on one or two of Jones' radio singles, I never took her seriously as a singer/songwriter. My bad. Purchased on a lark, this compilation has turned me into a real RLJ fan. The scope and variety of her performances here is amazing. At times, I was moved nearly to tears from some cuts on this CD. As a bonus, Rino has done a stellar job of mastering this set, with sonics that really bring out the brilliance of RLJ's incredible voice, as well as the marvelous instrumentation backing her up. The sound is up front, clear and smooth, with all the tiny details abundantly clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good!","review":"i loved a few RLJ songs over the years and loved POP POP.....but this anthology reminds me of her artistry in a new way...POET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful collection of RLJ's work. It has all of my favorites on it. It is worth every penny I paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS GORGEOUS!!!","review":"Thank you RHINO!!! THANK YOU Rickie!!! I have just started enjoying this amazing compilation. I am enjoying every unexpected surprise. I recommend this collection highly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Collection from RLJ","review":"Over the years, I've learned that most people either love Rickie Lee Jones or they hate her. There really aren't that many people on the fence. I happen to love her. And this collection, while not perfect, is essential for any RLJ fan. The demos are great. The packaging, like most Rhino anthologies, is top-notch. Put \\"Duchess of Coolsville\\" in your CD player, grab your favorite beverage, kick back, and relax. Rickie Lee will take you on an unforgettable journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of shorter version of \\"The Horses\\"","review":"This is an awesome collection of Rickie Lee Jones' work. Of course there are some glaring omissions as other reviewers have pointed out. Still, I would have given this collection a full 5 stars if it had included the full version of \\"The Horses.\\" Did anybody else notice that the version included on this anthology has been shortened? They have completely taken out the part of the song where Rickie sings \\"When I Was Young, I was a Wild, Wild One.\\" It's true that she sings this line in the song \\"Flying Cowboys\\" as well and the full version of that song is included here. But, I always found it incredibly charming and cool that she sang the same line in \\"The Horses\\" and it is a shame that it has been edited out for this release. So, we still have to go back to our unremastered \\"Flying Cowboys\\" CD to hear \\"The Horses\\" as it was originally recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful anthology.","review":"I expect I'm only repeating what other people have already written, but this collection is lovely. The remastering process has made a stunning improvement to the sound quality (which was already good!), and the \\"goodies\\" on the third disc are a welcome addition to the catalogue (\\"Easter Parade\\" with Blue Nile is a gem!!). Rickie Lee Jones is a remarkable musician, a fantastic singer, a great arranger, and a genius with words. A very special lady indeed. I often wonder why she isn't as popular as the quality of her work really demands. I suppose I don't understand the commercial music market.Rickie Lee Jones Rules, O.K.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it even if you own most of her oeuvre","review":"I own a lot of Rickie Lee Jones. I love her work. I disagree with the reviewer who thought the alphabetical order of her songs was pointless. Since so many of her albums were--wonderfully--\\"set pieces,\\" it's been great to hear familiar songs in unfamiliar contexts. It's as if I'm hearing some of these songs for the first time.Her music had a huge influence on a lot of the breathy girl singers since, who've served up her phrasing but in a watered down fashion. But she's really important, like Louis Armstrong, in terms of innovating, changing our conception of what a voice can do. Not to mention she wrote all this music too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's written in the stars","review":"For people who want to know tomorrow, today. This is a great book if you are interested in an oracle that doesn't have a negative bend. Unlike tarot, which can give you the heebie jeebies, Cartouch is a cool tool to use for meditation and more. The book can help you improve your \\"reading\\" skills. You should have the cards or it won't make sense or be needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This system works very well for me.","review":"I really enjoy using Cartouche. This Egyptian- based system is much easier to use than that of traditonal tarot. It works very well for me and I am able to do insightful readings for myself and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for Beginners, Many uses throughout life!","review":"I actually inherited my book and card set from my mother when I was in my early teens. I've used them on and off, especially during times when things seemed so bleak. I've always found the readings accurate and helpful. I've done readings for friends in the past and was told that the advice actually helped them solve whatever issue they were dealing with. It's a shame to hear they're out of print but if you can get your hands on a set I would definitely recommend it! I hope that I will never lose mine. I cherish it very much and you will too if you have a chance to own it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I thought this item came with the cards as well but when received it was only the book.

I had used for a month and used around 3 min per day and within a month battery dead. So before buying one has to remember about the battery life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good start","review":"this falls neatly and admittedly a bit predictably into the dystopic-\\"our world is the only world\\" genre. Characterization and world-creation is somewhat sparse, but detracts very little from what is an enjoyable quick read and one well-suited to young adult The story moves along at a good pace and if you see some of the events coming from a while away, DuPrau throws in enough nice small touches so you don't really mind. Nor do you mind the obvious opportunity for a sequel--if the characters are not deeply drawn, they are likable and interesting enough that it would be nice to see them develop further. The book would also work for teachers as a nice companion piece to similar works, such as the Giver or Anthem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The city of ember.","review":"Wow!Cityof Ember is a really good book because people that are actually in the book talt about their lives. Italso talks what they usually do during their days. What I liked must about the book was that they talk about what they would have to do with out electricity.What Ireally didn't like about the book was it had no pictures. I like the books that have many pictures and extra information because it keeps me on the topic of the book.My favorite part of the book was when this girl was rescued by a boy ,but they don't even say their names.They were my favorite characters because it showed that they care about each other.The part that meant the most to me was when they said that they had no electricity.I really thought about that because I wonder what they do with out electricity. I would say that htis book ROCK! After reading this book my question is, what would happen if they had electricity?Would their lives Chaged? I really recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, nice and quick","review":"Read this book over the course of about three days. An easy read with just enough interesting happenings to keep you wanting to read. It seemed to me the end was a bit hurried (but that did seem to enhance the hectic few chapters of the book). I can see how this easily leads into a sequel, and I hope it does, will let us explore this world a bit more. A good read, but I would not say it is a must read as some have.My daughter is almost 9 and she has shown no interest in this book, and I think it's themes are a little beyond her yet, but I would recommend it for children a bit older with an interest in sci-fi themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glowing story, lacks the final spark","review":"Unique setting, intricate plot, fascinating premise, fast-paced narrative, suspense--these and more set The City of Ember apart as sci f worth reading. Details abound. Characterization, however, is this book's weakest link. Lina and Doon, while spunky and individual, didn't drawn me in as much as they could have. I found myself wanting more, wanting to feel their emotions and see things from their perspectives much more clearly and immediately. I knew too much from being told, rather than inferring it from their actions, dialogue, or emotion. That said, Jeanne DuPrau is definitely an author to watch--no doubt she will only get better. I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"bravo!","review":"Twelve year olds Lina and Doon live in the underground city of Ember. The people of Ember were supposed to leave after 200 years. Now during year 241, the city is running out of light bulbs, and the giant generator is on the fritz.

Keep in mind, the audience this book is aimed towards is kids though. The pictures were great, since I never watched any trailers for the movie, to fill my mind with images of the characters acting out the scenes before my very eyes. This is a great book to read with your children. Jeanne Duprau writes in such a way that allows any aged reader escape into this fictional broken down town. The immediate twist reminds me of Harry Potter when I was only a little one. Since Harry Potter came out when I was in 1st grade, I had a similar experience with that book that i did with this one. Now with this, 13 years of experience and troubles allowed me to relax more to enjoy this wonderful book. I cant wait to read the next few."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not particulary like this book","review":"I thought the book The City of Ember was a dull and slow moving book. I would not recommend this book at times i almost fell asleep. The plot of the story doesnt't even really make sense, I think the author could have done a better job at introducing the setting of the story.

I recommend this book to you because it is an amazing book about a girl named Lina and a boy named Doon. They live in a very poor city where there isn't much food or life anymore. They are surrounded by darkness, and Lina and Doon want to find a new land where there is more light. In my opinion it is a great book for any kid of the ages of 9-15.

It was well written, and it really leaves you hanging for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkably clever book","review":"City of Ember is, while putatively a book for young readers, also a clever book unafraid to be bleak.

You will want to buy the entire series at once -- it is consistently good (for kids and adults alike)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book that has a Matrix quality about it.","review":"City of Ember is one of those books that you here a lot about before you read it. It's one of the fad books that made the rounds of Junior Highs across America in the last 10 years, and for the most part the book does not disappoint.The story is great, and the characters are deep and rich. I wish that the author had spent more time telling me about the main characters(maybe added another 25-50 pages). I loved the maps in the book, and especially how she details the escape.I have only read the first book, but I look forward to reading the sequals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This was a very imaginative look at a dystopian future, and a warning call to all of us about the possibility of annihilation of most life. I enjoy reading children's literature and feel this is a good addition to that genre. However, I did not like the follow-up prequel, \\"The Prophet of Yonwood,\\" as much and felt that the inclusion of pictures in that book was distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"I saw the movie, and enjoyed the book even more.

There is a boy named Doon and he is curious but does not care for his family. I liked the book because it has action and has alot of mysteries.

Jeanne DuPrau is a great writer. Her book kept me up all night reading which is very rare for me. I hate reading. One thing I loved about Duprau's writing was the foreshadowing in her book. The City of Ember kept me on my toes. You knew something was happening but you could never figure out what until it happened. The book was just a big giant puzzle. The characters would remind you of yourself at times. Unlike other books, this one was totally unpredictable.

The movie did differ some from the book, but both were good.Ember is a city were it is always night and nothing seems to be beyond it. The two main characters make a discovery that leads them to find a way out of the city to the outside world. Along the way, readers learn a lot about people living under difficult circumstances - Ember's electric power is about to totally fail, and they are running out of everything.Why are these people there?

The power from the generator is starting to fail with the outages becoming more and more frequent.

I am not a real bookworm - reading is a chore for me - but I read this book in 5 DAYS. I can relate to Lina. I know if I were in her place, I would dream about another world or insist on decoding the Instructions. When you read this book, you either relate to Lina or Doon. These best friends are complete opposite, yet exactly the same. My favorite part is when they arrive on real ground (our world) and see the sun rise for the first time.

And it looked spectacular. And so, next day, I went and purchased it. I am glad I did. It is billed as a children's book, but so is the Harry Potter series, and we all know it is well loved by adults and children alike. I did like this book, although I found it a bit short, at less than 400 pages.

Any middle-school student or adult would enjoy this novel. It had a lot of similarities to the book The Giver. Both books have main characters that are twelve and both get jobs or assignments. The main characters also both find ways out of their cities. City of Ember also didn't have as many religious undertones as The Giver. I preferred this novel over The Giver.

They also believe there must be a way out of Ember and they believe they can find it. Over all, I liked this story, but while it has a few twists and turns it is pretty simplistic.

The beginning of the book made me really curious about what the book was and made me really want to read the book. After reading to the middle of the book I really knew this was one of the best books I had ever read. The book is really addictive and good for a couple of good reasons. The first reason is that the storyline is really good and it brings tons of imagination to your minds while reading the smooth sentences and exciting events. The second reason is that Jeanne DuPrau writes in a style that reminds me of J.K Rowling's style and the I think the writing style of J.K Rowling is one of the best on earth. My conclusion is that I recommend the book to everyone who is considering to buy the book and it reading the book was a great experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A world of difference","review":"In a world where the sun does not exist, only light bulbs, things are starting to become scarce. The whole town is running out of food and light and no one is doing anything about it. Enter two teens, Lina and Doon, who are doing their best to try to find a way to better their world. In this first book, Jeanne DuPrau flat out tells us what we are taking for granted. What if the sun wasn't there tomorrow? What would we do? Not only is the story great, but the characters are astounding. It's not everyday that a children's book captures an adult audience as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so thrilled...","review":"I found DuPrau's prose to be dry, and it felt as though she spoke down to her readers, instead of treating them as equals. However, I give the plot five stars. The idea of the story, the characters, and the setting were all fantastic. However, I was constantly annoyed by the author's choice of words and style of writing. She seems to be trying a little too hard. Duprau's writing is more suited for an instructional arts and crafts book than a novel. However, I can see why this book has risen in popularity and why so many people love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzz�� (fort stewart GA)","review":"This book was so boring, I fell asleep.And when I woke up i deleted it. I should have spent my money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get yourself a slightly BETTER book. (for your own sake)","review":"Well, if you've heard this is a great book, think again! This is ANOTHER futuristic dystopia book. What a bore. To start out, you get the feeling of boringness right off the bat, as Lina gets herself a terrible job and is depressed. And then, like a dream, Doon (vomit... what a name) somehow wants to trade and Lina is all happy again. Where have you seen that kind turnaround before? EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!! In any case, once it even gets to the meat of the story, you find out that some mayor hid the key to the outside world. Exciting yet? Probably not. And then you see they miraculously get to the outside world and see all these strange people and then you have to read the next book and NOTHING'S HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!! Imagine reading the ENTIRE SERIES!!!!!!!!!! Why would you read this book? Seriously! SAVE YOURSELF!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The City of Ember is the perfect book!","review":"This book is absolutely stunning! I just finished reading it and now I can't sleep because I'm so impatient to read the sequel! It's a truely original plotline, a fantasy-adventure, but very, very believable. The city of Ember is underground, and is lit by electric lights, but the electricity is beginning to flicker, and though most people deny the danger, they know that the lights will soon go out, and stay off forever. As far as the people of Ember know, their's is the only light in the whole dark world. The adults are too set in their ways to think of finding a way out, so it is up to two 12-year-olds to do this. It's a thrilling story, frightening in some places, and really makes you think about human nature and what we're doing to our planet. This book is perfect for both kids and adults. If you're looking for a present for someone, and they like books such as Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, Inkheart, or Eragon, they'll love The City of Ember!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the book City of Ember","review":"This was an excellent book. It shows you what could happen to the world someday. We all may have to live in a city that is lit by lightbulbs because we may have destroyed our true world.In this book Lina is a 12 year old girl who happens to come uppon an very old piece of paper which seemed to have instructions on it. But to bad for her her little sister Poppy found the paper first and chewed big chuks out of it. Lina and her friend Doon must find out what the instructions say so they can save there city. Or maybe even find a way out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was about a dark city whose citizens seem to be unaware that the city is running out of supplies. The people have to get out of the city at a certain year, but the instructions on how to leave got misplaced, and no one knew they existed.The book was very good, it was interesting to hear about a society that does not have alot of stuff that we do today. Sometimes the book would go a little bit to fast. If the auther had slowed down and described it more that would have helped people understand the city and the story. But it was a fun adventure and i can't wait untill the sequel comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cornwall newyork sixth grader","review":"I dislike the book City Of Ember because it was a boring book and was too much like a mystery book. Also the kid's were kind of stupid because they didn't know were they were. Also the book didn't interest me very much there wasn't any love or sad parts in the story. When I first started reading it I thought it was going to be very good but I stopped reading because it was not interesting at all and I'm sorry to the one's who thought it was great but this is my opinion and I thought it stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pullman","review":"My general view of this book is that its author is trying to be the next Philip Pullman. Just as Eragon is trying to be the new Tolkien and Ardagh's books are trying to be the new Series of Unfortunate Events. However, the His Dark Materials trilogy is amazing. Expertly written with excellent flow and character development. The same cannot be said for this. I have to say that I'm disappointed not to have liked it. The original idea seemed engaging. The actual book however, was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROAN and eyeroll -el stinko","review":"As I was reading this book to my kids I rolled my eyes and groaned so many times. I had to force myself to finish the story it was so implausible. I found it hard to believe that Doon is the first person in 240 years to have enough curiousity to search through the pipeworks. It seems that in 240 years no one has even tried to do any innovation, to figure out the generator, to make new things out of trash. I found it hard to believe that they all just lived for 240 years with no curiousity. The fact that there were no books seems to have only been thrown in to make the story work not because it made any sense. Didn't they bring batteries? Flashlights? Just dumb people existing for 240 years. I only give it 2 stars because it was well written and my kids liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review","review":"The City of Ember was an exciting fun adventure. The description of the book was really good. That's one of the reasons I liked the book. The City of Ember is about a boy and a girl that live in this city that is starting to have a lot of power outages. So the boy and the girl must find a way to get the electricity back. But the ending was very dissapointing because I was expecting a big suprise but it was very big. That is how I rate the city of ember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I thought this book was really good. COmpared to other books i've read its not superb but i am comparing it to some really good books. I think if you like books like The Thief Lord and The bartimeus Triligy: The Amulet of Samarkand then you will enjoy this book. It's a good book to take on Vacation and have a quick read. I'd truly recommend this book to people who enjoy that short and sweet read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Fabulously Worth It","review":"A book I have read as a class has been the City of Ember. This was a great book. I could read it a lot and never get bored of it. It is about a city that has no electricity and supplies are running out and some people are trying to get out of Ember, but they run into some problems and it becomes very tough for them to get out. I think you should read this because it is very exciting and it makes you want to keep reading it. After every chapter it makes you want to keep reading and not stop. So if you try to read this book I think you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The City of Ember","review":"I think that the book, \\"The City of Ember,\\" is a good book. I liked it a lot because it is mysterioous, interesting, original, adventurous, and wierd. At first i thought that the people who lived in Ember was just like us, ate the same food as and did the same things we do. Oh man was I wrong! i found it strange that they had so many squares that were named after places by them. So, if you like books that are mysterious and have mischief i them then I recommend this book to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read about Ember","review":"This is a terrific quick read, for 5th to 8th graders, with a surprise ending. The two main characters are Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, two 12 year olds who live in the city of Ember. Ember is a small city in an entirely lightless land. According to legend, it was constructed and stocked with supplies and foodstuffs many years ago by \\"the builders.\\" It is a city that cannot sustain itself. At this time, food supplies are rumored to be running low, light bulbs are reported to be gone, and power black outs are becoming daily events. The generator is the heart of life in Ember, pumping light and electricity throughout the city, but for how much longer? Lina and Doon become partners in an effort to save the city, unexpectedly uncovering political deceit and discovering Ember's true history. Their resourcefulness will delight you. Ember sounds like a city in science fiction world, but is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Bad Writing","review":"This is a fun book, don't get me wrong, but it's crushed underneath some of the worst, most neophytical writing I've ever seen! Plot inconsistancies, terrible dialogue, idiotic characters, it would be a flunk-out in the writing realm if it wasn't for the incredibly cool concept of the City of Ember. I recommend reading it at the library, but not worth my money to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for adult fans of YA fantasy","review":"I loved the premise of City of Ember - and bought this read since I had recently finished the Hunger Games series and this seemed to be in the same realm. Plot-wise - yes. But years behind in character development and story-telling. There was a good chunk of the book where I couldn't put it down, but after staying up late last night to finish it up, I was like \\"this is it????\\". I had no desire to get the second book in the series. The writing is just too weak and even at the end, I really didn't care if the characters succeeded or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story - great concept -written like the intended audience was 11 years old","review":"I loved the concept behind this book! The characters were pretty good too. It just was written as if the intended audience were 4th graders and although overall I enjoyed reading it - this story could have been AMAZING if the author had fleshed out the plot, setting and characters a bit more and it just kills me!! I felt kind of ripped off for the price (6.99) and because of that I chose not to trust the author enough to buy any additional books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"City of ember","review":"This was a great book.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windsor Jr/Sr High-JL","review":"I thought this book was intresting but not intresting enough. The book was not suspenseful. One reason I did not like the book is because it was assigned to me to read for english. There are alot of questions that were not answered in the book which I did not think was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Lois Lowry instead","review":"If you like this type of alternate society book, read The Giver or Gathering Blue instead. In The Giver, kids are given their job assignment based on their skills and temperament. They don't just pick them out of a bag! No wonder the society is failing! Also, some things were just goofy. Why do they need messengers to carry verbal messages? They have paper and pencils, (which are at times scarce and at other times used freely). What's with the library, where things are haphazardly organized? How do Lina and Doon even know what a riverbank is? This book was boring and totally predictable, and the characters such as Lizzie and Looper were annoying distractions rather than being the means by which the plot is moved along. I made myself read this book since it's nominated for the Rebecca Caudill award. Otherwise I would have dropped it after the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke? Right?","review":"This book was not the greatest one in the world. Its predictability was a big let down in the book and what is with the, 'Box will open when its ready' thing? I know, the builders were like the change of the nation, but how could a box like that correspond to the Generator and when it isnt fully dark, but when it flickers? It doesnt make sense. Jeanne DuPrau should have put more effort into this book and I have no plan on reading the sequel. They already confirmed that they get into a city and come above ground at the little, 'Sneak Peek' at the end and that they take them in! Bad bad bad bad bad book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly exciting","review":"When I picked up this book, I knew what it was about before looking it up but I had no idea it would be as exciting as it was. The entire time you're wondering whether or not the people of Ember will escape from their quickly dying city or if they'll all get caught in an eternal black out before our two protagonists figure out a way to get them out of there.What I found to be particularly interesting to read was all the moments where so many characters (especially the main two) kept being astonished by things we all naturally take for granted. Pineapple, for example, and light that doesn't come from a street lamp. I think this book re-energized my appreciation for the things we often take for granted.I look forward to reading the sequel, I'll be getting it as soon as I get a chance, and I'll be recommending it to people no matter what age they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"City of Ember","review":"City of EmberCity of Ember was a great book! This book is about a city that was built by two men and they built the city so that in 200 years all the lights will go out in the city, they left instructions for the people that are living during the time the lights go out, on how to escape. Lina, the cities messenger was left the instructions in her closet, unfortunately her sister chewed up the letter so now its up to Lina and Doon (works in pipeworks) to decode the instructions and go down in the pipeworks and figure out if there is actually a way out. This book is an on going adventure and anyone that loves the feeling of thrill will love to read this book. I really enjoyed this book, I never wanted to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I read thru this book pretty fast, couldn't put it down. It was a great little story.

Brought out my imagination as I read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read-aloud","review":"I chose this book as the first read-aloud of the year for my 6th grade students. It had a bit of a slow beginning, but they were begging for more read-aloud time by the end. It is a very suspenseful book with an original twist on the idea of a utopian society. I also like that it has a strong (but human) heroine in Lina Mayfleet."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a really good book!","review":"It's a story of betrayal, discovery and evil. The ending is bittersweet. My favorite part was when the hero gets caught by the guards and outwits them and escapes.

We are also, using the book as a theme for our end of the year party."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could write like this!!","review":"This book was so gripping, I barely put it down the whole day. I was finished by 4:30, and then I started writing this review. To me, this book is a delightful breath of fresh air and a nice change from the books I usually read. I had seen it in bookstores but I don't like being dissapointed in books, so I did not read it. Then we got it at my school library, and one of my classmates recomended it to me. My usual reading materials are what I call Hardcore Fantasy Fiction, which this definitely isn't, books like the Inheritance Trilogy (Eragon) and the Bartimaeus Trilogy (The Amulet of Samarkand.)I have never encountered a book that is anything like this one, and I don't expect to. All in all a great book that has given me a lot to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"No logic","review":"As I was reading this novel it bothered me that the author did not explain why there were no books on Physics or Electricity and Magnetism to explain how the world works. How could a society build an underground city yet fail to provide the future citizens with any means to educate themselves. This book reminds me of \\"Orphans of the Sky\\" By Robert A. Heinlein. A much better book with a great explanation why all the knowledge was lost. A true science fiction book that respects its audience gives plausible well thought out scenarios that can be believed. This book fails to do that. Come on, the workings of a direct current electrical generator can be understood by a grade school child. I cant believe a society that relies on one for their survival could \\"forget\\" how they work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The City of Ember book review by a boy in 3rd grade","review":"The City of Ember is about two 12 year old kids named Doon and Lina living in a world unlike any other. The problem is that there has been too many blackouts because their city is falling apart. What I liked about the book is that there are some adventurous parts and some not adventurous parts also.I think everyone should read it because it is a book with lots of feelings and because it teaches you to be glad you're in this world instead of their world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teachers, Consider This One!","review":"Teachers, if you ever had trouble organizing effective cooperative groups in your classroom, this book has the \\"blueprints\\" for success complete with lesson plans and blackline masters.

I'd say we can all learn something from him. He spoke to a keen group of university students here on a recent visit and had a great time involving them in taking a different path toward solving life's challenges. His enthusiasm for life and for all people comes through in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a trip to take","review":"Bowen White takes you to the ultimate place, your inner self.

The teen boy humor isn't funny to a 15 year old if you aren't familiar with the terms \\"shag\\" or \\"fag\\" (not the homosexual type. Perhaps, there's an off chance that they've watched the original \\"The Office\\" or \\"The Spy who Shagged Me\\" with Austin Powers but otherwise, it's just all lost on them.

Although the story line is centered a round two different groups of friends the main character is Dino, who considers himself IT, in other words the ONE and ONLY important male body at his school. Even as the story revolves around the sex affairs of the male group it does not lack in the universal themes of love, lust and betrayal. Nor does this story lack in the ever present comedy of life. Even if a bit of adultery is involved between a student and a teacher is involved this novel should not be passed over because of its title. Oh and as a PS I somehow seemed to have messed up with the stars, I give it a five star 'tho it shows only one cant seem to fix it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Contrast, Small Footprint, Poor Color","review":"I ordered this monitor because it was a NEC and fit nicely into my new wall desk.

It tells exactly how the soy industry plays \\"consumer helper\\" and encourages soy consumption with the use of \\"health claims\\" that have been carefully created through the power of public relations, the corruption of scientific inquiry, and the collusion of the FDA. More than 60 years of studies link soy protein and soy oil to malnutrition, digestive distress, immune system breakdown, thyroid disorders, infertility, reproductive system problems, and even cancer growth. Yet soy is now widely perceived as a \\"health food\\" for men, women and children. This book tells why and how. It's a five star book for marketers that gets one star because its authors fail to acknowledge the industry's shabby and slippery ethics and its shameless putting of profits before people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike & Lynne's Berlin","review":"Another fine album from the Palters, this time dedicated to the music of Irving Berlin. Once again they manage to combine great American songs into seamless medleys. Fans of Berlin and cabaret will be pleased. The Palters are truly a unique duo and deserve a much larger audience.

If you have heard them before, you won't be disappointed with this wonderfully musical album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice action figure, but face looks like young captain Picard","review":"I bought this action figure to complete my collection of Bespin action figures. Lobot in the movie has a gray vest and the toy has a very slightly greenish color. But it does not bother me at all. In general terms it is very movie accurate, except for the face that looks a bit like a young captain Picard from USS Enterprise as Lobot face was bit wider and this action figure has a bit of a skinny face. It is the only weird detail that looks heavily not movie accurate.It does not have lots of articulations. It is more or less articulated like the old vintage of the 1980s, except for the elboys that move sideways. It is not a bother as in the movie he did not move too much, and his role was mostly to be there standing up.It comes with some kind of hand held device, a laptop and a stand, which was unexpected to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"The land-based adventuring is awkward and really simple. The sea-based adventuring is unbelievably difficult.It's very cool that it's almost a sailing simulator, but the game throws you against tough opponents right away without enough time to get the hang of just normal, non-combat sailing, much less the hang of cannon-ball flying nautical mayhem. If you manage to defeat or evade an opponent, you're almost immediately thrown into another fight. Getting sunk a dozen times in a row is really tedious, and waiting for the long re-load time to take another try just killed the game for me.I was really looking forward to the sea battling, but it was so frustrating I returned it to the store for credit towards something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs work","review":"the game is clearly unfinished.

They needed another six months in testing on this one. The big problem is how choppy and headache-inducing the camera is. It is simply way to big a problem to be overlooked. Walking through a town and talking to people will make you cross your eyes in frustration. There is a two-second delay to the buttons you push trying to interact with people, so they walk away while you are attempting to engage them. Going into and out of doors is a real hassle and there are long load times everywhere you turn.Don't these game designers realize that we have all played Halo?Popping out of the game experience to a 30 second load screen everytime you take ten steps just WILL NOT FLY.The animations are bad, the sword-fighting is a lot of bad things but mostly it's just not fun.In fact, that sums up the whole game-- NOT FUN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I gave this game 2 stars based purely on the graphics. Visually, this game is striking. However, the controls are anti-intuitive and overly complex. The sailing aspect is insane. First, I couldn't find where I was going, then I ended up in some random cove and sank for no apparent reason. I had not hit anything, there was no one else there. Basically, the game is too complicated and confusing to be any fun.

Jerky character movement, glitches & nonexistent panning aside, the menus are so difficult even a phd such as yours truly cannot understand them, and the ship is both too complicated and cumbersome to move. The game begins with little or no narrative....in short, let me just say that 'rushed into production' is the kindest thing I can say. And, I loved Morrowind, so I speak as a diehard rpg fan.

While playing this game after hours and hours; I noticed that there are a lot bugs in the game. Sometimes while playing, the game would freeze, so I recommend that you save often. But once you get past the gliches and bugs in the game, it's a lot of fun.You begin as a pirate named Nathaniel who's reputation can vary. Depending on your deeds, your reputation can become spoiled or neutral. Your reputation will determine how people will do business with you. So you can become a ruthless threat to the high seas or a transporter of goods, or you can go along with the story as an English spy.

I have had no crashes on the XBOX version and only found 2 little bugs so far. The graphics of this game are AWESOME and the main quest has pulled me into the game. It took me less than 30 minutes to get used to the controls and I can easily move around. There are lots of ways to earn money in this game (1 way is to deposit money with a loan shark for a 3% interest per month). Every town is not laid out the same and some are really big. This game does take some time to build up your characters, so saving often is must! Exploring is also the other key to this game, because thats where I found better swords and guns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice graphics.","review":"(PC Version)I've played a lot of video games in my lifetime and I can assure you that this is by far one of the worst games I have ever played. This RPG/adventure game has unbelievably complicated controls and no way to switch to a gamepad. Learning to walk is hard enough, much less learning to fight and sail too. Add to that actually having to interact with townspeople and manage your ship's cargo and condition...it's not worth my time. These games are supposed to fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"Like so many, I thoroughly enjoyed the pace and excitement of the movie and was therefore very disappointed to find a game with the same name but nothing in common. Sure, there are pirates, swordfights and sea battles, but I expected something following or and extension of the theatrical release. This game doesn't have any of the characters and is hard to manipulate. Not only do you need to collect a tremendous amount of objects to move from level to level, but there is so much you must master for simple tasks. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhh, the suckiness...","review":"The ride was awesome, the movie was awesome, this game is honestly the worst Xbox game I've ever played. It doesn't even have anything to do with the movie or the ride, they just took an old russian computer game that nobody knew about and renamed it. A cheap attempt to earn an extra buck by fooling people with the movie's success. Some people seem to have liked it, but I have no idea why. You do whatever you want though, just don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk the plank bug pushers!","review":"As of the writing of this review, I've been playing this game for the last two months...and it is simply awesome. The graphics are great, there are tons of quests or your own agendas to go on. As an example my pirate is fairly 'lucky' and makes a habit of gambling in taverns. One time while gambling the loser of the game offered a woman for gambling, and my pirate won her!I don't know why everyone's complaining about bugs...I've yet to see one.If you've ever enjoyed the NES or PC version of \\"Pirates!\\", this game is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry I got the Xbox version","review":"Found number of problems. Won't mention some already discussed in other reviews. But had problems where character all of a sudden put his sword away and would not take it out unless I could make it to a new scene that seem to reset and let me use the sword again. Also had problems with mate in first town Oxbay. Took mate into underwater cave, but when I tried to leave he would ont follow. Had to go back into the city and the mate reappeared. This game needs to fixed and re-released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"detailed\\" Pirates game","review":"Very detailed game that should provide a more hard-core and detail oriented person some time-alone fun for many, many hours. Visually exciting with a steep learning curve, this game offers the opposite of the \\"Sid Meier's Pirates\\" gaming work load. Very hands on and all the small details are on you, the gamer. Avoid the easy-to-aquire cheats: Will ruin the gaming experience. I purchased the game for a low price, so overall good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is simply a fantastic game-incredible complexity, I don't know hao they crammed it all in-the se-battles , the Duals-you can play this game for months and still discover new things-one of the most complex detailed games ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical movie game","review":"this game falls into the stereotype of a movie game, it's not that good. the gameplay is very confusing, which distracts from the quality of the characters and the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"pirates of the caribbean","review":"I had a problem with this video game.

So even if the wax bubbles had floated correctly (which they did not) I wouldn't have been able to see anything other than dark shadows moving through the liquid. I contacted the seller and they sent a replacement for free and said they would inspect it before shipping it to me...when the replacement arrived it had the same problem as the first one. The seller then refunded my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is so much better than Lava Lite","review":"I got eight0 Lava lite motion lamps and this one. This one is the most fun to watch. It might be because the glass cylinder is more like a tube or it may be the wax. This one works really like the ones from the 70's that I remember as a kid. It arrived a bit foggy but it cleared up completely after just one cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service!!","review":"My cousin bought this lava lamp for my daughter for Chrismas. When we received it, it was broken. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent us a new one, no questions asked. And we got it in time for Christmas! Can't beat that! I would diffinitely buy from here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Destructs","review":"Don't buy this lava lamp... it is nothing like you are expecting.First, I'd like to say that the seller send me the wrong color... we got blue instead of green. We decided to keep the lamp. Taking it out of the box, it is much smaller than you think. The entire lamp top to bottom is 16 inches, not the glass portion. The wax inside first has the appearance of metallic glitter inside. After the lamp is on for a little while, the oil becomes cloudy and the wax looks as if it is covered in ick, like fish get in fish tanks. It looks awful. I'll never purchase another one of these again. Sad too because it was a Christmas present to my son, and his favorite gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"No glow","review":"I bought this for my nephews for xmas and it never worked.

Recently, my son got his finger stuck in the square hole for the optional cup holder. The holder does not stay in the slot provided. It fell off and my 8mos old son had placed his finger in the hole. He did not begin crying until I tried to remove him from his seat only to discover his finger was lodged in the hole. It took the skin off of his finger and it took four of us, one of which was an emt, to get his finger from the hole. His finger had swollen to atleast double the size. I was just grateful that the finger wasn't broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd Alpha Omega","review":"I just recently purchased this seat for my 2nd daughter. My oldest daughter is still in her Alpha Omega and she is just over 2 years old. One of the things I like the best about this new seat I just bought is the buckle is so much easier. My oldest daughter's seat has the type of buckle you have to lay one side on top of the other and fit it together like a puzzle. It took me forever to teach my mother-in-law how to do it! LOL! This new one doesn't have that and it's so much easier. I love this seat because it's big and it's comfortable for the babies and it grows with them. I would definately recommend this seat to anyone. They are a little hard to install in my explorer because of the angle of the seats, but I just rolled a towel up and stuffed it in there and finally got it secure. Great product with great versatility!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I purchased this car seat after talking with a member of the Babies r us staff. He had me convinced that this was one of the best ones and people really liked it because it went up to 80 lbs. After some serious grunt work of installing, I was excited to try it out. I was not impressed with this seat at all. It was very hard to get tightened in the rear facing position. It seemed maybe every 1 out of 5 times it felt secure enough. One day while I was driving home I looked in the rear view mirror only to see that my baby had fallen all the way forward and the shoulder straps had slid off. If you are looking for a safe ride for your baby in the car, I don't recommend this car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAR SEAT!!","review":"WE love this car seat!! We purchased the britax marathon for our main car and wanted something else for our secondary car, something inexpensive, high safety rating, and comfortable for our daughter.This Has it all and it comes with a cup holder. So far its great, we have had it for about 1 month now, our daughter is 7 months old and fits great in it. no trouble with the buckle though, yet at least. And I love the fact that its virtually the only car seat you need to buy because of the weight compacity. OVER ALL I LOVE THE CAR SEAT AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. the only reason I rated it a four was because of the color, I wish it was Pink instead of blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter hates this seat","review":"My seven month old daughter quickly outgrew her Graco Snugride seat and so we purchased this seat for her. She is a big girl for her age. Weighing 25 lbs, and chunky legs. With that said, the harness clips pinch her legs if not carefully placing her in...if your in a rush (what mother isn't) you can cause a bruise. Asides from that once placed in the clip at her crotch area digs into her legs. So for any big baby...this is not the seat! Thats the first issue. Second is being that she is only 7 months we installed rear facing. The box and salesman said we would be able to use the latch system...not so. We need to use the seatbelt and very difficult to install correctly. All in all once installed and baby placed she just didn't seem to be safe in the seat. I would give up comfort for safety, but this seat just didn't accomplish either. Maybe because of her size, so now we have purchased the Britax Marathon, hopefully this seat will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"monkeymers","review":"This is the third Alpha Omega seat we have purchased. After shopping for carseats a lot over the last 5 years, Alpha Omega always out purforms the best in safety and comfort. Our seven month old is now over 20lbs, so we had to move into a large seat. The seat is very soft, yet the padding supports her well. When she falls asleep during car trips, her head doesn't flop to one side or another, the sholder belt pads keep her head steady. It is easy to get her in and out, so easy she usually sleeps through it!My one complaint I have is when trying to use the LATCH system. The instructions weren't very clear on how to thread the LATCH belt in and around the seat for use in rear facing. When I went to install it in our '05 Sienna, it took me about 45 minutes to get it tight. The belts just didn't seem to want to tighten all the way. But this is the rear facing way, maybe it will be easier once I flip it arround and use it forward facing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the 1 star reviews of this book.

Sorry to burst the author's bubble, but I didn't like this story. I couldn't read on becuase it just got dull and frankly I didn't care what would happen. I will tell you what drew me in the story though -- the first couple of pages. The idea of a gargoyle taunting and controling you or me was cool. Then the main character suddenly was thrown into the real world again, and is witnessing (later on) all kinds of bizarre things that were going on, like rats that could chew through walls (?). I tried to like this book, I really did, but I couldn't. A typical fantasy book? I hope not, since I don't read books often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"\\"Frostwing\\" was published in russian few weeks ago in \\"Dark City\\" series where excellent novels about Anita Blake (by Laurell Hamilton) are now published as well. I was very impressed by Hamilton' books so I have bought \\"Frostwing\\" which title is changed to \\"Master Of Rats\\" for some reasons. But I simply couldn't finish the book. It was too boring, the plot is quite thrilling, but it's written in such unimpressive way, that I threw it away by the middle of novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"This product does an excellent job getting grease and leaves a streak free shine. The pull out tubs dry out, so individually wrapped wipes are better, and they are convenient to put in a computer bag or backpack. I didn't give it 5 stars because there is some lint left on my screen, and I will probably try a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I messed up again","review":"These individual pocket-packs are not worth the purchase. I gave them 1 star just for this critique. The wet-ish wipes must have been a bit old since they were all but dried out. The type of packaging is the problem. Small, pocket-types (like facial wipes) don't last very long. So I feel as if I've wasted 2/3rds of my money already. I will use a better product next time - one that is an Electronic name brand, wet for sure, and won't go dry after purchase. You may get lucky and get some Fresh ones. I hope, considering the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The are small and dont clean","review":"Dont buy! They are so small you can hardly get ahold of them to clean your screen.

I was even more disappointed there.In a \\"pocket reference\\" such as this I want and need nothing more or less than an alphabetical listing of the JavaScript universe. However, this book is divided into numerous chapters that require you to already know what category the thing you seek belongs to. Since there's no index in these little books, it is useless to me as someone who's still learning this stuff. I've set my copy aside and use the \\"Definitive Guide\\" exclusively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks a good index","review":"I bought this book because of all the good reviews posted. Unfortunately, I cannot agree. As a good reference tool, I expect it to have at least a good index. So that when I am coding and forget the exact syntax, I can quickly find it.

Her 17 years of observation of one species in one location makes her research particularly compelling. Some readers will be better served, or at least more satisfied, with Wiki and YouTube, or books specifically written for younger audiences. But for non-entomologist adults, this is a delightful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Work and No Play....","review":"A book that reads like a thesis is never any fun. Ants at Work takes an interesting premise(Ant colonies are not run with any central organization but on a series of interactions within the society) and then proceeds to suck all the life out of it! Filled with graphs and the mind-numbing detail about how the experiments were laid out, Gordon describes a process that was as painful to read as it was to perform. The science seems valid and for that I commend the author, but where's the wit to lighten the burden of all this research. With few illustrations to break up the monotony, this book will be a bore for all but the most studious of entomologists."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of promise, but ultimately dull","review":"The subject matter is fascinating, but I found this (rather slim) book very dry and dull. As another reviewer noted, it's not really a book about ants or ant society in general; it's the story of Prof. Gordon's research into one particular *kind* of ant, told in the first person.A brief web search turned up more interesting information in a minute or two than I found in the whole of the book; Sorry, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with Tetris!","review":"I got this game a few weeks ago and believe me when I tell you that it ROCKS!

As was stated in previous reviews, I bought this collection of songs for holloween mood music, as well as for my personal collection, as I am a big horror fan.

Although the original artist are given credit for the music on the back cover, the actual recordings are from some hack in a garage with a synthesiser. This collection is in no way acurate to the original movie themes. In other words, this cd sucks.One good use might be at a public hautned house or trails and played at high volume.

Also, the music was an improvement over the other Tae Bo I have. The bad news is that one of the people in his video overshadows the music & Billy Blanks. She looked good (Shelly) but screamed/screeched loudly throughout the video. Not only was it extremely irritating, she was given a MICROPHONE! Sometimes music can help take the edge off exercising which would've been of course preferred along w/Billy Blanks instruction. But, since they gave the woman a microphone the irritating screaming and screeching overshadowed the music and Billy Blanks. The video is hard enough but to have the screaming screech irritation made it impossible for me to keep the sound on. And, that makes it tough because Billy Blanks instruction is needed. It's weird how one screeching negative can adversely affect the positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"RELEASE 2010","review":"I mean REALLY!!!!!

It is a much better deal too! You get the original four DVD's - basic training, ultimate, cardio-live, ab and then they throw in the lower body work out.

I'd much rather have Joss tell me the story than some guy I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre novelization of disappointing movie","review":"My name is YT and I'm a Firefly fan. Most of what disappointed me about the movie was audio-visual so, I expected to like the novelization better. I did not. The best part about the story (indeed, the best part about most of the stories in the original series) is the characters. And apparently, the best part about the characters is the way the actors bring them alive, make them real, make us care.Movie tie-in novelizations tend to be written in a hurry, to a hard deadline, so it is perhaps not reasonable to expect great language. But the addition of narration and visual description only served to slow down this story, without enrichening it in the slightest.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic companion","review":"Joss Whedon has called 'Serenity' Mal's story as told by River. In the novelization of the fantastic movie, DeCandido manages to capture that idea perfectly. As we, the readers, are presented with events almost exactly as they occur on screen, we are also given the opportunity to look inside the heads of the characters we love so much. DeCandido does a stunning job of showing us not only what is happening, but also how the characters react. This is specifically well done in the case of River who not only has her own thoughts, but knows those of the others even when they aren't so sure.I bought the book so that I would have the story even on trips when I didn't have the movie or a TV available. It's everything I wanted and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible translation from screen to page","review":"How does one go about taking a fast-paced, character-driven story and turning it into a barely readable work that almost requires a mental four-wheel-drive setting to slog through?I'm not exactly sure, either, but it seems that Keith R.A. DeCandido has mastered the technique. This novelization of Joss Whedon's Serenity falls far, far short of expectations. The characterization is poorly done, and becomes lost in DeCandido's attempts to cram every possible reference to Firefly around Whedon's brilliant script. It's like he obtained a copy of the script and spent an afternoon writing actions around the dialogue, all the while trying to emulate the tone of Whedon's script and get in the occasional \\"Look! I know Firefly!\\" or \\"See? I can be as clever as Whedon, too!\\" A good novelization should balance out the script with appropriate actions, not compete with it every step of the way.I also recommend the Visual Companion instead of the novelization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre adaptation","review":"There's some good parts in here - I grew rather fond of the \\"verse-ish\\" language the author used here and there. On the whole though you're not getting you won't find the deleted scenes of the DVDs of the either the series or the movie. A couple paragraphs of backstory on Mr. Universe, maybe a line here or there... some of which was likely cut from the screenplay for a darn good reason.The author's treatment of River was poor, as already noticed.. a very flat \\"bored schoolgirl\\" indeed. The blatant rip off from the old Trek movie's \\"created her own language without 'To be' which worked great until she translated 'Hamlet'\\" was just agonizing.Putting the Operative on Haven was worse.All in all.. if you must have \\"everything firefly\\" to get another glimpse it's okay.. but the suggestion of \\"just get the Visual Companion\\" is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful...","review":"The second star is only for the effort made with respect to backstory on some of the characters. Additionally, this adaptation includes many of the scenes cut from the movie. Nice, but it's not enough to make the time spent reading this book worth it.Efforts aside, the result is awful. The battle of the crew holding the line against the Reavers was cringe-worthy to the level in which it misses the point, and it evokes no urgency or emotion whatsoever. Some characterization is so bad as to be insulting, Zoe's and Jayne's particularly. I've read better character analysis in fanfic.I'm a huge fan of the series, the movie and Wheadon, and I feel this book does a disservice to them all. Get the Official Visual Companion instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Simply, a book that does not feel any need to provide any visual description of the characters or their setting is not worth reading. This one doesn't - it's simply a mechanical fleshing out of the screenplay. I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"First of all, I'm a huge fan of all of Joss Whedon's work; especially the TV series \\"Firefly\\" and its motion picture finale \\"Serenity\\". I saw \\"Serenity\\" three times at the theater; and have watched it multiple times on DVD. So, I was really looking forward to reading the novelization of the movie.I was hugely disappointed. Keith DeCandido's writing is so bad that I wasn't able to get very far into the book before I gave up in disgust and tossed it aside.Trust me, you're better off just sticking with the \\"Serenity\\" DVD. Or, if you want to READ \\"Serenity\\", then you should get \\"Serenity: The Official Visual Companion\\" which contains the entire shooting script for the movie.Don't waste your money on this second-rate novelization."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth a read","review":"i wasn't sure about getting this book, seeing as it hasn't gotten great reviews, and i was very nicely surprised when i read it.it's, in my opinion, far more than just a novelization of the movie.it adds more. it refers back to the tv shows and deleted scenes of the movie.it explores thoughts,feeling and motivations of the characters.it clarifies some small loose-ends from the movie.i liked remembeting the bits of the tv shows and how the book had a definitely shipper tone to some scenes.it's definitely worth a read, it's clear the author is a browncoat and loves the 'verse as well as joss."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible adaptation of a very good movie.","review":"This is one of the worst movie novelizations I have ever read.

I love the show. This book is an adaptation of the film. With that said, I thought that the book added a lot that the film did not cover. Keith Candido obviously loved the show and the characters, because I felt like the characters were true to who they were in the show. I especially enjoyed the inner dialogue that is not present in the film and would have been akward if it had. The book adaptation goes into some of the background of the characters that is not present in the film. If you enjoyed Firefly the series, the book is a must. If you enjoyed Serenity the movie and want to know more about the characters, the book is a must. I was lucky enough to meet Keith Candido and he truly loves the characters and the did a fine job with the adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...","review":"If you are interested in the movie Serenity, or a fan of the show Firefly (or both!) don't bother reading this adaptation- it will insult your intelligence. Try the Official Visual Companion instead.This book is a close adaptation of the original shooting script by Joss Whedon- and it is Whedon's clever writing that saves the book from complete ridiculousness. The rest of the book is a mess of over-explanative silliness and just plain bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"It's hard to say exactly where this novelization goes wrong, as a feeling of 'wrongness' permeates the bulk of the novel. There are good parts that stand out, but only because the rest of the writing feels sub-standard.Ironically, part of this is due to what could arguably be one of the novel's pros. DeCandido obviously did his research, as the book is filled with an impressive ammount of references to the TV series. However, this also serves to intensify the problem that there's little inovation in the story. The characters feel two-dimensional, the narrative feels like a copy and paste effort of the movie. Granted, there are events that we don't see on the big screen, but there's a noticable lack of innovation. It was as if guidelines were applied from the start that couldn't be deviated from.The book can be read without seeing the movie and vice-versa. But given the similarity between the two, they don't really complement each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"To say that this book reads like fan-fiction would be insulting to the better fan-fiction authors. The frequent inserts of TV episode references serve little purpose beyond showing that the author has watched the series as well as the movie.Save your money, buy the movie when it is released on DVD, and until then just read the screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unreadable","review":"It was written in an afternoon by someone with no writing talent. Then it was edited by someone with no editing talent. With all the great TV sci-fi novel writers out there, why the publisher hired this one is a mystery. The dialogue's the same as the movie, which is a much better experience. I'm a Firefly junkie, but I still couldn't read this whole novel. I hope someone writes novelizations of the TV series, but they should be longer and of better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"This was a novilization of the movie Serenity - even so the book was well writen and entertaining to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this was published","review":"I want to know who gave the greenlight to publish this adaption as it currently is. Was it the same people that canceled the series? Must be.I love the Firefly & Serenity movie, but this adaption of the movie is just plain bad. It will not motivate anyone to see the movie...and that is a hangin' offense to Browncoats.The dialog is pulled almost word-for-word from the script, but the stuff between is stiff and awkward to read. I haven't knowingly read any other adaptions by DeCandido. If I have, they *must* be better than this.How does one break into this adaption-writin' industry? I know I could do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not bad for a novelization written in two weeks.","review":"On one hand, it's an okay rendition of the movie as a novel; the author wasn't given a whole lot of time to write it. On the other hand, DeCandido wrote much of the text using the verbalisms common of the characters, i.e., western-style syntax and generally bad English. While that's fine for dialogue, the rest of the book comes off as amateurish and somewhat forced. If you're a die-hard browncoat you'll probably want to purchase this, but if you're not a fan of _Firefly_ you might want to pass on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Adaptation of Great Material","review":"DeCandido tries to write his narrative in the same folksy style Whedon wrote his dialog in -- and fails miserably. The author's style seems almost schizophrenic at times, ranging from bland, sterile writing to nails-on-chalkboard failed attempts at capturing the same western/folk style Whedon hit so well. The author did a fair job of trying to wrap up the various historical tidbits of the crew's story, but overall the book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhanced my movie experience","review":"This is a must read for any Serenity / Firefly fan.

Just one thing... Lately, the books have been going from Christina to Melanie and back again. But they each completely ignore the other character. Like when it's Melanie's book, Christina is barely mentioned. It doesn't even say if Star really got better after being in Montana. I just wish the books could be on both girls at once. I really like Image, though. It's nice to read about a horse who's not completely perfect! Oh, and at the end of Racing Image, it jumps from after Thanksgiving to New Years. That means that Christmas passed, making Christina now 17. Hmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racing Image, Joanna Campbell and Alice Leonhardt","review":"I think this book was great! I waited and waited for it to come out and read it happily when I finally got it. I love how Chris and Melanie are finally getting FULL control of their horses. I kinda wish that Wonders offspring would be left alone because it seems like almost all of them have had SOMETHING happen to them. However, I'm not writing the series, so I leave that to Joanna Campbell and Alice Leonhardt. I'm glad that Brad has gotten his hands off of Star and Image. I hope that in future books Star is bred to Image, because that would make awesome foals. I also think that when Star is retired from Racing, Chris should train him to do some jumping. Melanie and Jazz should be boyfriend/girlfriend too. But thats just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was disgusting","review":"i don't know what happened to these books, but they are a waste of money. lately they all have the same boring and pathetic theme. firstly, usually image, is the most perfect, fastest horse in the world. then some minor incident happens and melanie cries, thinking it is impossible to train the horse and gives up. then her perfect cousin christina tells her not to give up so melanie tries again. the characters are pathetic, winey brats. when mel's dad buys image, she expects it to be a gift to her. that is completely unrealistic. he did the best he could and mel blew him off. i disliked this book very much. you are no longer in touch w/ the characters or even the horses. personally, i don't even care if image or star ever races again. the horses and people have no characteristics that make them likable, unless you like spoiled brats like mel and christina. the authors need to develop the characters and horses better if they want to keep selling books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a let down.","review":"I finished reading the first book, The City of Ember, feeling like I needed more information.

It wasn't a horrible book, but its not a favorite. But Jean Duprau illusrated the human nature well in the conflicts between the emberites and the people of sparks. The characters were well developed, which is a rare quality in books I dont like.

When she gets back, the people of the two cities are ready to start a war. The Sparks used their most secret weapon. This makes everything catch on fire. Everyone works together to put it out. Then at the end of the story, something happens that you thought would never happen between the Emberites and the Sparks.This is one of the best books I have ever read. I think this book is for middle school readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"First was MUCH better","review":"while the first book was GREAT, and I was anxiously looking forward to the sequel, it did not live up to the first book. Everything is very predictable, and the plot drags on. It was hard to get through, even though I finished the first book in less than a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't it just pleasent when human nature gets in the way, again?","review":"I found this sequel to be okay. Alot of the parts are just talking and no action, and some parts are a bit boring. But otherwise, it was a pretty good book. Not on my list of favorites, but definetly worth reading. Very well written. I found myself wanting to hollar at the people for being so stupidly selfish (human nature getting in the way...again.) I found myself wondering why they didn't discuss their options in the very begining, but then it wouldn't have been a very good story if everything was all happy cheery. The book was a very satifiying sequel. I wasn't left wondering like I am with many other sequels. If you liked the first book, then read this sequel. You don't get left with too many questions at the end and it is a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid sequel","review":"This book is a solid sequel to The City of Ember, though the ideas were a bit less ingeniously original and, I'm a bit sad to say, just a bit too preachy. The City of Ember is a real masterpiece, and can be enjoyed by any age of reader, but I felt this book was, indeed, for kids. Still, the characters were real and the situations engaging. If you read The City of Ember, you need to read this book, and you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Really Good!","review":"After reading The City of Ember, this was a great addition. Athough Lina and Doon are seperated in most of this book, you have the opportunity to travel around and find out what the surrounding area around Sparks is like.Certainly different then the first book, not quite as action packed, but good. My 8 year old daughter loved it, She gave it 5 stars. Myself, I would have to say entertaining and good, but not as good as the first. I missed the interaction and problem solving presented in the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The People of Sparks","review":"I read this book aloud to my 8 year old son after we completed \\"The City of Ember.\\" We both enjoyed the book very much.

Just focus on raking in on all the money you have made ripping of your loyal fans who were expecting something equivalent to, or better then The City of Ember, and take all their money after they hurry to the store to by this crappy sequel. You should be ashamed!And to all of you readers out there, please, PLEASE! Don't be putting more money into the pocket if Jeanne Duprau, because you already know that they get out of the underground city. What more is there to know???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I hated it! Really, really boring! I liked The City of Ember, and wanted to see what happened next. But I really wish I hadn't read it. I only recommend reading this book to people who love wasting their time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, not like the first one","review":"This is the second offering in the books of EMBER. In this one we find the people of Ember finally emerging from their dying and beloved underground city. They have followed the instructions left by Lina and Doon. Now they join the people of the town of Sparks. Friction between the two groups starts right from the begining. Not enough food, the people of Ember have no idea of surviving in this new and strange world, where the sky is blue and there is no end in the horizon. Lina now learns about the DISASTER when travelling to a deserted and destroyed city.As I mentioned, this is in fact a good and great read. Nevertheless if compared to the first book \\"City of Ember\\" it lacks. The People of Sparks it's written almost like a lecture. There are no plots, no surprises. The book is a good read because the Author manages to keep the story interesting. I'm really looking forward for the next book of Ember. I hope the magic and the thrill are back.Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The people of sparks","review":"Great book!

You don't need to read them in order, but it helps. Not much to say about the kindle edition, it's your typical kindle book."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCE Student Review","review":"The science-fiction book \\"The People of Sparks\\" by Jeanne DuPrau is my favorite book. My favorite characters are Torren and Poppy. I like Torren even though he's a jerk because he's only a jerk because of his family issues, and a lot of people can relate. I like Poppy though because she's the cute little baby that's fun-loving and sometimes can be a troublemaker. DuPrau's writing style is good at describing feelings and things. She knows how to keep the action going and can put you on the edge of your seat. I love this book because it's creative and it's a good idea. There's action, fires, new people, and worse tempers. I didn't want to put it down. DuPrau's writing is very descriptive and well-written. You can feel the emotions she writes in this book. It takes you places in your mind you weren't before. Kids probably around 8-15 might be interested in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome book","review":"This is a great book.If you loved City of Ember you will love this one.

I had previously read \\"The City of Ember\\" which tells the story of an unknown, underground city on the verge of collapse. The ending left me hanging ... I needed to find out what happened next! So I ordered \\"The People of Sparks' and it did not disappoint. In fact, I think I liked it even better than the first book. The author does a great job portraying characters that 10 year olds to adults can identify with. The issues addressed are relevant to today's society and emotions. War, anger, empathy, friendship are all addressed in a way that makes the reader relate to the characters without being too didactic. The story will make you really think about today's world and the consequences of our actions. It would be great to use for extension into other subjects (science, government, writing). It's a fascinating read, I could hardly put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explores an important work...","review":"Metropolis is a work that seems to renew and remake itself every few years. First, it came out in different versions and different meanings. Is it a story about love lost or about science gone mad? It is fantasy or science fiction? Is it against the Nazis or for them? Was it made as a piece of art or to make money? Thomas Elsaesser explores one of the most amazing movies ever made. Yet also one that can't be pinned down. The meanings change with time and with those who view it. What does it mean to you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept-Poor Execution","review":"Don't get me wrong, the idea of taking a list of the greatest movies and then writing a series of books detailing the movie and its impact is a fascinating idea. The book by Anton Kaes on \\"M\\" is a stellar example of how the movie and book compliment each other. But here, in another Fritz Lang film the idea is torture. I could never get what the author was trying to say, he rambled on and on and never got to a point. It is neither a book of film criticism, nor a book on the times depected, nor quite frankly of anything else. I love Metropolis, I have seen it many times, in both the Moreder version and the incomplete silent versions. It is a masterpiece, this book is not. Watch and read M instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy Baby!","review":"This time Sony went for more looks than brains, the discman is amazingly awesome looking, however, the concept of the player is if you drop it once, it's destroyed.

His attitude (as in his recent novel \\"Pully Taffy\\") is frighteningly superficial and shallow. He doesn't appear to have a thought in his head about anything besides sex and drugs, and he seems to behave as if he'd never heard of AIDS. Being a sex worker is NOT a liberating experience. It's an act of desperation, often born out of a lifetime of abuse. For Sycamore to pretend otherwise is disingenuous at best. And for a supposedly legit publisher to put this thing out is absolutely irresponsible. This book does a disservice not only to the gay community, but also to those out there who would like to see an alternative to the pablum thrust upon us by the mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned","review":"I thought I was getting an all metal, blue bank.

The reviews were decent. After the first 30 seconds I was annoyed. Teh video and audio were out of synch. Since I didn't see this in other reviews I'm assuming that was my laptop's problem. I have not had a chance to watch it another way yet. The next thing that cropped up as I tried to ignore the synch issue was his personality and jokes. Not my style. Given the fact that I would expect anyone to have to watch this repeatedly before learning all of it I can't imagine hearing his quips over and over. My third discovery, and last since I shut it off after this, was that his fingering and camera angles made it almost impossible to see where he was playing. I will say that I am a beginner so this might not be so bad for more accomplished players. I couldn't tell if his second finger was playing notes or hovering over not and it blocked what his first finger was doing fairly often.I wish could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Ray Vaughan: Guitar Signature Licks (Greg Koch)","review":"I'm a huge SRV fan and was struggling trying to pick his style off his recordings. Even with tab in magazines and online I found it difficult to \\"nail-down\\" the nuances of his style. Enter Greg Koch via the Hal Leonard Guitar Signature Licks DVD series; just what the doctor ordered. From the outset Greg breaks down Stevie's style by demonstrating it on some of his most popular tunes. His virtuosity (no doubt partially due to his enormous hands!) and comedic style make for a great experience. I found myself handling the licks that I just couldn't get from tab and recordings alone. This is one of three instructional DVDs featuring Greg that I currently own and they have helped me learn the tunes I love and improve my overall skill level. I highly recommend this DVD to SRV fans or if you just want to get a little gristle from Greg."},{"rating":"1","title":"SRV probably wouldn't understand this!","review":"This DVD was a real dissapointment for me. You have an SRV wannabe bloviating to the max. Lots of music jargon that SRV himself admitted he did not understand. SRV was perhaps the best example that knowing a lot of music jargon is not required to play well.I was hoping to get some insights into how SRV actually played the guitar. I can figure out how to do things like string rakes myself. I really don't care for the jargon. What I see is a trio playing a few SRV songs and throwing around a lot of jargon and pretty much nothing else.If you like to talk the talk, you'll like this CD. I play the guitar for fun and get enough \\"talk\\" at work. I'd prefer to learn to walk the walk when I play the guitar, and for that, this DVD is not of much use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the negative ratings here.","review":"I normally don't write reviews but felt the need to chime in here.The negative ratings by the two Americans don't have anything to do with the quality of the product reviewed here.They are just frustrated with the fact that they didn't bother to look before they leapt.It states clearly that SRV's guitar parts are broken down here by an instructor and it says nowhere that this is a concert or that SRV is doing the teaching.So forget these dumbhead reviews.I have the other DVD in the SRV series by Greg Koch and I couldn't believe how well he nails SRV's style and, more importantly, how well he can convey his wisdom to the student of Stevie Ray's style.THERE SIMPLY IS NO BETTER INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL ON SRV THAN THESE TWO DVD'S!!If you have any interest in learning blues guitar and SRV in particular than you can't get anything better than this.'SRV isn't in this video'?? Hellooo???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Instructional Video","review":"This instructional video is fun to watch and will have you playing the licks in short order if you are an intermediate level or better guitar player. Koch is hilarious and an excellent instructor who has obviously closely analyzed and feels comfortable with the material. He is also a versatile player. The only other comments I can think of are that it would be nice to have the tabs to go along with the video and that SRV wannabes should know that the songs are not covered note for note from start to finish. Only the \\"signature licks\\", i.e. key rhythm parts, leads, intros, bridges, etc. are covered in detail. The \\"filler\\" parts are treated lightly or not at all. This should not trouble intermediate or better players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show!","review":"Well, I've seen a lot of great reviews on these two dvd's. But this is my review:Greg Koch is one of the greatest SRV replicas I have ever seen! On some of the licks, it's actually almost like hearing SRV himself!Well God bless you, Greg!But these dvds are more like a preformance than a lesson.You will not learn a note unless you are a professional guitar player!Let it be said that learning Stevie's stuff is a BIG challenge in itself.But Greg could have broken down some of the licks instead of just performing them and slow it down only once...Greg has a good sence of humor though, and like I said; Great performance!

It had a good basis and general idea, but the book didn't go where it should have. There was a lot of potential, but no depth to the characters and nothing was really thought through. Many parts of the book could have gone more into depth, but Pullman just glossed over most of the important parts and interesting subjects and facts. For example, the photo shop. No one cares.

The Victorian setting and detailed background (what with the opium trade and photography shop)are quite original for a children's novel, but other than that, the novel didn't strike me as particularly impressive.

Mr. Ury walks through step by step, coaching you and giving you a wealth of useful information. It's almost as though he's learned everything and woven it into one seamless, highly effective production. This book did more for my negotiations with less confusion then any other book I have ever read, period!

The story (by none other than Robert Bloch) is an eerie gem w/ plenty of supernatural darkness and death. The title SKULL has a sinister personality of its own, as we are given its point of view through skull-o-vision! Classic stuff! Also, watch for Michael Gough (Horror Hospital, Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow) as an auctioneer, and Patrick Magee (Asylum, Dementia 13, A Clockwork Orange) in a 10-second role as a police investigator at the end.

The Skull is adapted from a short story by RobertBloch (Psycho) called, The Skull of The Marquis deSade, whichoriginally appeared in Weird Tales back in the late 1940's.The Skull is a very interesting little film, highly recommendedto fans of sixties British Horror Cinema.

You half-hear some of the dialog and wake up occasionally to check out what is going on. Being half-asleep, your defenses are not up to par. There is a free-floating feeling of foreboding.This happened to me with \\"The Skull\\". Once when I woke up, this skull was apparently levitating and moving toward the professor. Under these circumstances, it was pretty scary!Like most Hammer productions, this one is well mounted and written. I have seen it again since 1971.

The main characters would get along famously with Dr. Richard Seaton, the main difference that the female leads are permitted somewhat bolder roles then was permitted when the Skylark books were written (though even back then they were hardly the type of hapless female who would inhabit a bodice-ripper of a romance novel).The plot does have a couple small holes in it (though they don't ruin the story), but these could well be due to the fact that there are things going on (ie that we will learn in the sequal) that we do not have total understanding of.If you are a fan of Smith and Heinlein's short stories..

They're fairly cardboard. Lots of technobabble. If you're a very plot-oriented reader you might like it. It feels Heinleinesque in some ways, except I can read Heinlein without putting the book down out of boredom. The writer seems to concentrate on the science aspects more than the actual *story*, probably because he's really a scientist. (And what's with all the blow-by-blow accounts of karate matches? Yawn.)

To say that the characters are cardboard is to do a disservice to a useful substance. To say that the plot is hackneyed is to slur workhorses. To say that this author is unable to develop a single original idea is an understatement. Even the names of his characters are something pulled out of a bad satire.

The chapter, \\"Legal rights of students with ADD\\" is useful and relevant, but that is 10 pages out of a 150.There are two other annoying things about this book.

It even deals with long term development of cities containing thousands of people. The concepts presented are viable although it presents some concepts that are to far into the future to my likings. It not only presents the theorectical concepts but also the work that has been done in relevant research areas and the problems encountered. It is not science fiction.

I was disappointed. Portugheis seems to have misunderstood what Ginastera's music is all about-rhythmic vitality. In most of Ginastera's music, rhythmic drive is of primary importance and pitch (though still important) is secondary. Portugheis romanticizes the heck out of it. Often, the rhythms he plays are the result of technical (as opposed to musical) rubato, i.e. he doesn't have the technical command to play the damn thing. He stumbles through almost the entire piece. He turns 5/8 measures in 6/8's. A strict tempo rarely exists for long. When the rhythmic vitality is lost, the energy of the piece goes down the drain.

His level of energy will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun content, worst mixing i've ever heard","review":"I watched this documentary on Netflix. It follows the course of enthusiasm around this style of recreation and why it's important to those involved. The audio levels are so outrageously out of balance i spent as much time adjusting the volume as i did watching the action. You will be heavily distracted by how the doc instantly changes from a mumbling interview to loud music, and that the levels required to hear a lot of the interviewees themselves are imbalanced amongst themselves, which feels like a set up for a noise complaint. One second after the interviewee stops talking, you will need to immediately turn the volume down, a jagged up and down routine that may remind the viewer of biking through most cities and towns on the planet.

It is very apparent at larger font sizes -- 14 and up. The tech. rep from amazon.com called NEC to explain the problem. NEC's solution was to run at a higher resolution. That solution worked to remove the blur, but I don't consider that a solution given that I want to run the resolution at 800x600. That's comparable to me buying a Ford and reverse doesn't work.

Imagine my surprise when looking at the roast after about 5 hours to cooking to discover it was fully cooked.Kind of defeats the purpose of a slow cooker if you cant even leave it for a work day without it overcooking your food.I speculate that the maker was worried about bacteria developing at the temperatures Crockpots used to cook at so dialed up the temperature, but I just dont know.The thing is unuseable to me so the purchase resulted in a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I wanted to replace my crock pot that I have had for ages.

The soup was not hot; oh, it was warm but not hot as soup should be. I am so sorry I bought it. I am going to get a slow cooker that I can use at the Costco and chuck this one. Since I used it I can't return it and I am so disappointed. This is the first thing I bought on Amazon that I was not satisfied with because usually Amazon has good stuff. Don't buy this one; it is awful. I would not trust it to cook anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted have broken up and...","review":"...Charlie Simpson is now in a band called fightstar.

If you need some comparisons, their music is similar to New Found Glory, Foo Fighters, Blink-182, etc. I found out about Busted last April or May and have loved them ever since. I bought their first UK album and loved it so of course I had to buy this one. Busted did not disappoint. This album rocks!! This album is a mix of their first and second albums, so if you like a Busted song that isn't on this album, just buy the other ones! They are all worth it! Busted is an awesome addition to any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars!","review":"I absolutely love this CD! Busted is such an original addition to the music industry here in America. When I first saw Busted in Top of the Pops magazine, I knew they'd be a hit when they would come to America.

By this album to keep busted goin on. because whatever anyone alse says Busted ROCK and they CAN play the insruments.

All Busted is is a slightly glorified boy-band. I guess they think \\"oh, let's strap on some guitars and now we can be be a \\"punk/rock band\\". Ha, don't think so. The songs on this cd are so lame. None of the lyrics are even the least bit funny. If you're looking for a good pop/punk/whatever band with lyrics that are actually funny, listen to Blink 182 or Relient K, not this crap. And that \\"What I Go to School For\\" songs makes me sick. It's like it is telling kids it's ok to have sex or mess around with your teacher. What the hell? Anyways, just take my advice and NEVER listen to this cd.and I'm PRAYING that these guys fall flat on their face here in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guyz rock!","review":"I am english and busted are huuuuuuuuuuuuuge over here and this album is fab my fave track on it is she wants to be cuz it rockz!I would recommend this cd 2 anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Busted--- The Best Songs On The Best Album!","review":"For everyone who knows of Busted knows this, they are probably one of the most talented bands out there, they write their own music, they sing their own songs and play their own instruments, but what is one thing Busted doesn't have in the US? The fame. With this album, and their talent, they can make it. All the songs on this album are the best songs that are available Bustedwise at the moment. \\"Who's David\\" would surely do great as a single in the US, because it's one of those songs you don't forget. \\"What I Go To School For\\" was a great song to release, but when it's all said and done, you need a serious song something that will appeal to everyone. Don't forget to watch America or Busted appearing on MTV2 on November 2nd! And keep an eye out on Busted in the US.

She guides the reader verse by verse through one of the most familiar passages in all of scripture. She brings life and understanding the the words of David and helps you to understand the significance of the shepherd metaphor. When I read this book I was struggling with God's call for our family to serve in a ministry with very little pay. By looking at the 23rd Psalm, I came to realize that the Lord would provide all that my family needed and that he would give us protection and grace to face the days ahead. What a joy to have that burden lifted and to fully trust in the Lord. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who desires to be lead by the Good Shepherd."},{"rating":"2","title":"cradle of filths best!","review":"Man what an awesome cd, some of the best black metal ive heard!

I just plug some headphones into my amp, put the DVD in my computer, and I can practice all the base lines without disturbing my roommates. Ed Friedland is a very well spoken and patient teacher. In the excercises he first plays them and then plays them again at half or quarter-speed so you can catch on. I'm having a blast learning some of these techniques. The DVD is very easy to navigate. My only gripe would be that he only plays grooves that are kind of old-sounding funk lines, which is fine, but it would be nice if he strayed a little from the formulaic stuff. It's realy not much of a gripe though. Love the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This cover offers a snug fit. However, the case doesn't allow for appropriate use of the Garmin.

It's amazing just to compare juvenile sci fi written now, to that written half a century ago. Modern juvenilia, such as Nick Sagan's Idlewild, is enthralled with The Matrix-like pretensions, trying to seem hyper-cool, whereas Heinlein's limp efforts are more like a cross between futuristic seeming industrial films and Boy Scout propaganda.The three novels are Tunnel In The Sky, Time For The Stars, and Citizen Of The Galaxy....Heinlein is very heavyhanded, in this and all three books. To read these books and then read Stranger In A Strange Land, published just a few years later, suggests that Heinlein made a quantum jump upward in writing ability. Read the later book, and save these books to fill out your Heinlein library, if you're so inclined. That's about all they're really any good for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love","review":"I LOVE these shoes! They are so stylish. I own two pair one in silver and the other in gold.

Insted we get an akward sounding dub, with not so great to terrible sounding voice actors. Youre probably saying \\"Oh, thats fine! I don't even watch the dub.\\" Well the sub is no better, the intent of various scenes and the overall point of the series ends up not making sense... Let me put it this way- FOR ONCE FANSUBS ARE BETTER.On to the product itself- the blu ray is pretty bare bones so there isnt much to it, thats it really.I wouldnt recomend this unless you can find a good deal used, much like im going to for part two...

At least they didn't use a hologram sticker that changed from the Eye to the symbol.When I first saw this in the tiny thumbnail picture my heart skipped a beat. Wheee, I thought, that's great!

This sword was made by same cheap knock off company who wanted a thundera-like sword, without buying licenses to have the real logo. Probably had a blue oval shaped jewel in the middle. Then someone else came along and said \\"wow that looks just like the thundercats sword!\\" So they bought the swords.. then realizing the jewel is supposed to be round not oval.... \\"ok let's stick the cat's head in ... um and make roaring/bad breath lines to make it look like we meant it to be oval shaped for that reason\\" and there you have it... near garbage.

It's nothing like the original. The Eye of Thundera is round, not oval. And what's with the \\"bad breath\\" lines from the cat's mouth? It's hideous. The guard isn't quite shaped right.

A child could come up with a better more similiar looking logo, and the sheath is cheaply made.

It looks like a regular bulb here on Amazon, but don't let them bait and switch you. I'd have stuck with it and not returned it since they included two bulbs, if it wasn't for the fact that the first bulb died the second time I turned the light on, and the second bulb died after 3 hours of use.So - returning it - and posting this review.

No replacement bulbs means you have a nice piece of junk with a pull-string on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expectations vs. Stick Up Bulb","review":"This bulb works, but you must not expect it to work like a wired-in light bulb. This is ideal for a space where it's too much to hire an electrician to install a light, plus I'm in a rental. I use rechargeable batteries, and recharge them overnight. They light up two small closets; 3'x2'x10', and I have two in each closet, one on each side. I use the adhesive plus nails to hold them up, and they have been firmly in place all this time. I have used them for years, and now finally one of the marble sized bulbs inside died, so I bought another one today. They came with one replacement bulb each, but I can't find them; I got them so long ago. I tried calling Telebrands but the automated system wanted to sell me some over the door hanger, possibly their latest promotion, so I'm not sure how to find the replacement bulbs. I will call back and attempt to talk to a real person. Still worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No source for replacement bulbs","review":"Stay away from the Stick Up Bulb product, as it will be trash as soon as the bulb burns out! This was a gift. I was a bit skeptical when I received it, as I usually stay away from overhyped \\"As Seen On TV\\" type products. I put in in a closet in my garage and actually really liked it. It wasn't the brightest bulb but it was easy to pull it out of the holder and use it as a flashlight to find what I was looking for. I used rechargeable batteries in it, so the fact that it goes through them fast was not much of an issue. Today, I threw it in the trash because there is no source for replacement bulbs as far as I can tell. There is a message on the back of the unit \\"For Replacement Bulbs visit [...]\\" That address redirects to the As Seen on TV site. I called the number and they have no bulbs and cannot tell me where to get them. That is false advertising.

Every week we found ourself replacing the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Don't be fooled like I was. Total waste of money. Unlike the infomercial, the bulb does not light up a closet; it has the lighting capacity equivalent to a little candle, or worse. It also does not switch on when placed vertically against the wall; it only lights up with the bulb facing upwards. Terrible product - do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE my Stick Up Bulbs","review":"I LOVE my stick up bulbs! I have them everywhere! I only got one that the switch is apparently bad on so the batteries go dead quickly. The others have a long battery life and are so handy in the closets, under the sink, at the front door for when you were gone longer than you thought you would be so you didn't turn on the porch light. Pull the string and see where to insert your key! Good for beside the bed and in each room of the house for when the power goes out at night. (which is often where I live).And if you don't like the bare bulb look you can clamp on one of those cute little clamp-on shades to match your room colors.

I bought them to provide light down my staircase so when you went down in the middle of night you wouldn't need to turn on the overhead light because it's so bright it would wake up my sons. But the first night I used it the bulb burnt out before I went back after 20/30 minutes. So the next time I use another one and the same thing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Currently Looking for a Replacement","review":"Pro: They do work and have options for installing with screws or sticky tape.Con: The lights use up battery power way to fast. I had these lights in my closet and keeping the light on, long enough to put a basket of clothes away caused the light to drain battery power. I even used rechargeable batteries and having to wait for them to charge and them having them drain power within 1-2 days, they are not worth the purchase if looking to use them in a closet.Also, the light iteself, is not very bright. I had to use 4 in a 12 ft walk in closet (in length, and the closet is only 3 feet deep), just so I could see all my clothing.Final Thought: They will work for you, but you must consider your usage. I DO NOT reccommend them for use in a frequently used area.....for an occassional, barely used, closet or stairway---maybe, but even then, they are not bright enough to light a full stairway (already tried it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"replacement bulb","review":"I have had this bulb for several years and I love them I have free replacements for life.

The alarm has never failed to go off, and the time is always accurate. The best thing about it is the digital radio, which means that you are fiddling with a knob to try and find a station, adn the reception in the morning is as good as when you set it in the night.I agree that the controls were difficult to find: you hold the clock button on the back and push the + or - button on the back to set the time. You hold the Alarm A, or Alarm B (depending on which one you want to set) button and push the + or - on the back to set the alarm. Then you hit the Alarm Mode button to switch on Alarm A (the radio), Alarm B (buzzer) or both (which is nice for usuing the radio at first, and the buzzer as a backup).

Now she has these special letters telling her in ways that only with the courage and help from family and friends that she can accomplish, letters from Gerry. So even though I'm half way through it.

Instead, I muddled through it in constant amazement of just how bad the writing was. I couldn't even believe that it had been made into a book until I read somewhere that the author is the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister.The storyline itself has potential, but all was lost as a result of the author's poor prose and consistently corny dialogue.

I really liked the whole idea of the main character grieving with the help of her deceased husband.

There were moments that were sad and others that were so funny that you had to laugh. It wasn't your typical sappy story it explores how Holly's relationship with everyone changed once Gerry passed away. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't really like it....","review":"I usually really enjoy books like this, but P.S. I love you didn't come together for me. I found the idea of it very interesting, that her deceased husband left her message to open. BUT other then that, all the in-between message opening I found to be sluggish and boring. I don't know if it was her writing style or the story, but it just didn't work. It actually was kind of depressing. I know it must be extremely difficult to get back on your feet again after losing a husband, but now that I think about, is that really something enjoyable to read about? Probably not. It might have been easy to identify with Holly if perhaps you have gone through the same type of loss, but for me it wasn't the best book."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.S.

This book was obviously published because of who's daughter the author is, not because she has any talent. I read the entire book hoping it was going to get better but it didn't. The plot is neither unique nor well thought out. Apparently the author felt she had to describe every little detail of every interaction her characters had, but when your characters are only one dimensional, the descriptions are overkill. I swore if Holly, Sharon, Denise, or anyone else for that matter \\"giggled\\" at something or someone again, I was going to throw the book out the window.

Such juvenile writing, and no inner substance in the main character. The only well-plumbed depth of feeling related to the sense of loss, but other than that, it felt like writing for a bad sitcom.

He was the driving force behind everything that she did in the book and he's is almost non existent in the pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly just annoying","review":"I was not impressed by this book at all. The characters were all immature and VERY unrealistic, with corny dialogue and narration. It was mostly just irritating to read.

The supposed 30-year-old main character is pathetic and unsympathetic, even considering the circumstances of plot.A knack for the visual is apparent, which probably translates well on film, but the excessively true-to-life dialog includes much pointless small talk that does nothing to further the story.I had high hopes for the concept, but it's mired in superfluous fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute concept, horrible writing","review":"I really wanted to like this book because I loved the concept and the movie looked cute. However, I couldn't get past the first chapter due to the horrible writing. I agree with other reviews, watch the movie or get it from the library, but don't spend your money.

Her concept is great, but she needs to take some creative writing classes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking depth","review":"I read this book after hearing about the movie, and I was disappointed. Not bad for a first effort, but all in all, this book was lacking depth. There is so much more the author could have done to develop the chain of events that occurred as the result of the notes.

I thought it would be an enjoyable book to read but the foul language turned me off from the beginning. Somebody needs to let Cecilia Ahern know that a good story can be written without every page in the book full of cuss words. I read the first 124 pages--hoping it would evolve--and finally closed the book forever. I probably won't even see the movie when it comes out. If you want a good book this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common","review":"I have recently dicovered the whimsy and fun of chick lit. However, I found this bit of chick-lit to be very pedestrian and drab. A common girl, newly widowed, who wallows in her pity party. While some of her reflections on her loss are downright beautiful and worthy of a hanky, the premise of this book could have done without the very naive, meandering, and sloppy writing style. I would like to see how this authoress might actually tell this same tale when she's 40. Ripe with sitcom, easy, shallow laughs, the young women portrayed in this book lack any ounce sophistication. While the idea of this piece is intriquing (her husband leaving her monthly notes after his passing that assist her with moving forward in her life without him) and clever, I found the characters to be boring and very common. Doubtful I will read anything by Ahern again even for escapist fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Reading","review":"This book is certainally not a Stephen King novel, but it kept my attention so well, I couldn't put it down. Everyone can relate to at least one of the lead character's feelings, emotions and personal tradgedies. It made me feel a little better to know that others have felt the same way, and can continue on with their lives. Fiction boarders on non-fiction in this novel. Great easy reader!Keep 'em coming Cecelia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"such lame and sophomoric writing--should have known when all the publicity was about whose daughter she was instead of her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring read","review":"I bought the book because I thought it could potentially be a great idea. Boy was I disappointed. It was very slow, and I really did not care much for the characters! A bit of a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRIPE","review":"Amateurish. Hackneyed. Clumsy. Predictable. Embarassing. Unsophisticated.Wooden.Laboured.It took me back to the teen-mag slush I used to read 20 years ago. Surely no one over 25 with a brain could possible enjoy this guff.Thankfully I got it from the library so didn't waste a single penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! I'm embarrased to have chosen this for my book club!","review":"You can certainly tell the author is young. There was no substance to this book. If I were 21 or so I might have enjoyed it more, but it read like a harlequin romance novel and I am truly embarrased to have chosen this book for all the other women in my book club to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare example of a movie being better than the book","review":"While the premise of the story is good, the movie did a much better job of capturing the characters. Her writing style needs polish and she writes as a 22 year old pretending to know what it's like to be 30 and widowed. The characters have no depth and you find yourself saying over and over again \\"that wouldn't really happen\\". Phrases are used repetitively and dialog is weak. There were some charming moments, but overall it reads like a high school paper. The author needs to mature a little and get some life experience. Skip the book and rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost too bad for words","review":"This book is so bad that if I hadn't had to read it for work, I wouldn't have got past the first chapter. Painfully clunky prose, terrible jokes and moronic characters make it one to avoid - it's not in the slightest bit moving, and the only laughs are strictly unintentional."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!!....","review":"This book was very charming and delightful to read. Not only can you laugh, cry, or feel angry for the main character all at once, but you get so involved with her that her emotions often times become your own. This book is one that the characters keep on living even after you've read the last page. I really have no complaints with the book, except for the fact that it is set in Ireland, and some of the phrases and wording are kind of hard to grasp. However, that takes NOTHING away from the main story line. Another perk of this book is that is really makes you step back and think about life and your loved ones in a whole different way...not many books can have that kind of effect. Hope to see many more books by this author!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Good Grief by Lolly Winston Instead","review":"Last week I picked up two books from the library: Good Grief by Lolly Winston and PS, I Love You by Cecelia Ahern. I like to read books with similar themes back to back. I read Good Grief in about three days. I lost my father in high school , whom I was very close to, so I have expereinced grief myself as well as watched my mother experience it. What Winston writes is very real and true. Two chapters into Ahern's book, I cannot stand to read anymore, it is so ill-conceived. Apparently the Ahern didn't do any research or experience profound grief herself, or if she did, she then lacks the talent and skill to write about it. PS I Love You is annoying and presumptuous. If you want to read a novel and understand, empathize, or relate to someone's grief, turn to Good Grief rather than PS, I Love You."},{"rating":"1","title":"No originality whatsoever... stolen plot?","review":"I haven't read the novel... only the main plot summary. There was a Korean movie, released almost a decade before this book was ever published, with a VERY similar storyline: newlywed couple, husband asks the wife what she wants most from him, she asks for a letter, he's never written a love letter before but tries anyways, gets a BRAIN TUMOR, passes away, and then a few days later the wife starts receiving letters from her husband... letters telling her how much he loved her. It just seems way too similar to be coincidence... I mean, he dies the EXACT SAME WAY. I'm 25 now (turning 26 in October), and I remember watching the movie when I was a sophomore or junior in highschool. It's called \\"Byun-jih\\" (Letter), if you're interested. Way to go Ahern... you, like Paolini, don't have a single original thought in your head. Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'd recommend this one only if you are somehow inexplicably stuck with NOTHING else to read. I had such high hopes for this buzz book but after the first 50 pages or so I found I had to force myself to pick it up each day and trudge as many pages as I could stand. Honestly, there are just so many other wonderful novels out there -- chick-lit or otherwise. You're not missing anything here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated....cute idea but terrible writing","review":"I really wanted to like this, but her writing and dialogue are very far-fetched and it all sounds forced and juvenile. Real women don't talk like this...actually, real people don't either. The idea is neat, I would have loved to see it written with less 'happily ever after' and princess-girly chatter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just loved this book!","review":"I don't know how anyone could give it a bad review. The lead character is witty and totally relatable. I read the whole thing in one sitting and immediately shipped it off to a friend. It's one of those books you want everyone you know to read. Happy and tragic all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful words, adaptable to life!","review":"I just finished this book a few days ago and to be honest I could not put the book down! It was amazing. I have been doing a lot of reading lately, but until now have not found a book that is so insightful. If you have lost someone special in your life whether through death or a break up this book will speak to you. Holly goes through the trials and tribulations of getting over Gerry after he dies. It is sweet and written for the heart. Life is a journey that we all have to take and it is not always easy, but instead of living from the past......use the past to springboard you into the future. I recommend this book to anyone who is going through a difficult time in his or her life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there nothing less than 1 star?","review":"I started reading this book with an open mind. By page 10 I felt I correcting a 10 year old's English assignment. It is awful!! Do not waste your money. The idea is good but it is written by a girl who obviously has no idea of grief or death in her little world. I really struggled to finish it.I can only guess that as she is the daughter of the Irish PM that it was published. To publishers out there...Do publish tripe like this ever again. Really REALLY BAD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read, but the list idea is great!","review":"I admit I'm not a fan of Bridget Jones. But I love Mariann Keyes and Carole Matthews if that helps! I was curious about the hype for PS I Love You. Probably shouldn't have read it after 'Crow Lake' and 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven', though. Ms Ahern's writing is very ' clunky': even amateurish in places. I know she's 22. And publishing a debut novel at that age is a huge achievement. But then Zadie Smith was 21 when she wrote White Teeth ..... (I think!)I loved the idea of the list. Thought that was so original. But something never clicked for me as to why list making was so important to their relationship. Was Holly disorganized? She didn't seem so ...Sharon and Denise were great! As was the funky baby sister with her pink hair. The secondary characters were the reason I finished the book. Holly, the heroine, never seemed three dimensional to me.Honestly? I couldn't recommend it. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I found the premise of this book to sound entertaining. A chick book....After five chapters, I was so bored and uninterested in it..that I left it (on purpose) at my nail care place. Didn't even finish reading it....Total yawner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.","review":"I bought this book second-hand because I was curious. The film is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I was hoping that the book would be better (which is usually the case). I'm afraid to say that this book is incredibly poorly written and not a thing like the film. Truly, the film was \\"loosely\\" based on the book and is, itself, far from brilliant. Honestly, it's not even good, but I do have affection for it. The book, however, is abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"PS I love you","review":"The story line seems really good, but i had to stop reading the book at about the third chapter, because of all the swear words. I did not appreciate that very much at all. Especially because the other book that I read from this auther did not have any bad words in it. I was not expecting that at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money......","review":"It's taken me 2 weeks to get through 3 chapters when I normally finish a book on a weekend. Very slow start, extremely repetitive about inane things, and, well....boring as heck. I was really hoping for more, but was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I have not received any items from this order. If you would send them to me I would be glad to give you a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea! Poor writing","review":"Great idea for a story.

The reviews were great for this book but it was just plain bad! I would never again by another book by this author. There was no grasping point to this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NightlyReading Review","review":"Cecilia Ahern had a great idea for a love story. It was well thought out and followed through beautifully.This story is about the love between Holly and Gerry. Mostly about how Holly must move on after Gerry's death and the struggles she faces to try to live her life again. With help from Gerry and \\"the list\\", Holly is able to overcome her fears of living and not forgetting her soul mate.This book was well written, it will make you laugh one minute and cry the next. The book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster as Holly reveals her notes from Gerry with each passing month. He will ask her to do difficult tasks until the most difficult one comes last.A wonderful read for anyone young or old. Just FYI...have the tissues ready!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I finally got finished reading this book and i have to say it was AWESOME!!!!!. I wasnt expecting it to be so good but it was. I would recommend this book to everybody especially if your a fan of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked . . . for 10 minutes.","review":"We purchased these when our son was about 17 or 18 months old. He was turning into quite the escape artist, and figured out how to open the very tricky doors at our old house. Shoot, some adults have trouble with them. We thought a doorknob cover would at least slow him down a little. These were not a good choice. He figured them out in 10 minutes. So much for the running headstart we were hoping to gain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These covers pretty much suck","review":"Sturdy, but they don't grip the doorknobs well enough for an ADULT to open. I try to open my children's door to check on them at night, and I make enough noise trying to get it open that I normally startle them awake. I'd feel like an idiot if it weren't for the fact that the covers don't grip on ANY type of handle, which I've tried. We have more than one type of door handle in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst","review":"These are the worst of the 3 types of knob covers that I have bought.

It definitely would not keep her out of somewhere she wanted to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At first, terrible, but they \\"broke in\\" and now work!","review":"These were awful at first, huge disappointment. Adults couldn't even squeeze and grip them, just like all the poor reviewers said. But Laziness prevailed and I didn't take them off. Now, after 8 weeks or so of being on being used, being squeezed, the plastic has softened up. They grip just fine and adults can do it. Sadly, it's still too hard for my 6 year old, so now she can't get in the bathroom to pee or go outside when really, she does not need permission, it's just for the two year olds. That's a little annoying, but if anyone feels like it's worth waiting to break this in, they are a fabulous child lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"Thankfully, I didn't spend a lot of money on them, even though I bought 3 packages, they're all in the trash after 10 minutes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety First Product Better!!!","review":"I agree with another review. This only works on round door knobs. With other common shapes, agile adults cannot even open the door. It's also difficult to later remove the product from the knob. The Safety First product is easier for adults to use, easier for adults to remove, and keep 2.5 yr olds out of rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless on day 1","review":"I won't go so far as to say that my toddler figured out the secret to opening a door by squeezing the tabs, but I he figured out how to completely remove the cover from the door the very first time he tried. So, if they stayed on the handle better, they would actually work. He's 2 now but was 22 months at the time.My advice: spring for a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about a week, then 3-year-old took it off","review":"This is not a well-made product.

But if they don't, you'll feel silly with 16 doorknob covers lying around.These barely work on our doorknobs, but our doorknobs are slightly oddly shaped. I find the tabs on the sides frustrating to use, but that may be due to the odd doorknob shape as well.The one thing i really don't like about these is that the little tab to cover any locking mechanism has become my toddler's new favorite toy. He'll stand there and play with it for ages. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for peace of mind","review":"i didn't realize how necessary these were until our boy could open doors. these make it so even the smartest tot can't figure these out and keeps em contained in one area. get extras to take on trips for hotels, grammas, etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have to open the door a lot these are a great option.","review":"For some doors it is a simple squeeze hard and open but it depends upon the handle. There are several doors in our house where you can't really open it with this on it. It works great for our 2 year old though and that was the point of it and so I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating yet effective","review":"These knob covers are easy to install and keep my 2 year old from opening doors. However, they are extremely difficult for adults to open as well! The grips on the inside of the product won't grip my standard round door knobs. I don't see myself using this product for much longer since I have to remove the entire cover every time I want to open my front door. Spend a little more and get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find a good set!","review":"I just can't find a good set of knob covers. The lock access for these is so small you only want to use them if you have a push button lock system on the door, or just a deadbolt. They didn't work for us at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prob works for some doors but not ours","review":"We have standard kwikset doorknobs. These are just too deep. They are a good diameter for a smaller knob but way too deep. The rubber grips are at teh very end of the doorknob so it barely grabs the doorknob and 90% of the time doens't work. Also, you cannot get your two fingers into the hole to turn the lock b/c he lock is prob an inch deep into the cover.We also got another type of doorknob cover (Safety 1st). It is just as deep at this one but the rubber grips that you squeeze are much larger. So it does grab our doorknob. However, it is also impossible to turn the lock and so we cannot use it on any exterior doors.The search continues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to open doors","review":"Very bad product.It does not have enough rubber surface, so it slides. Therefore, opening a closed door becomes a difficult task.I don't recomend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw them out","review":"Depending on the type of doorknob you have, these may be useless. If you have a round, architectural style knob, they're fine. If you have a much more common Kwikset type knob, they're much too difficult for even parents, or kids old enough to use the door properly. If you have the need to put these on a door that will require a key or lock with a turnbutton, think again; they are very deep and you can't get your fingers in the hole on most handsets"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another flop...","review":"Well, we should have known these wouldn't work. We had similar ones before and they kept my teens in and my toddler could get out. We had just moved and the old ones were lost so I bought these for something fast and cheap. Well, they are exactly like the others. One is fairly easy for the family to open (5 out of 10 times) but one refuses to open for them. They twist and turn and you just can not get it to open. I can normally open all of them and even I had problems at least 2/10 times when I try to open a door. Now for the one they are supposed to be for....my 22 month old. He can not grasp them to open them like adults, but he CAN and DOES easily disassemble them and take them off. He does it every time and then looks at us, smiles and opens the door. These are a complete waste. Pay the extra money and get the Kidco Door Lock Knobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"I'm trying every door knob cover I can find to keep my 2 year old from running a little too free. I thought these would do the trick, since the problem I have with the Safety First ones are that he puts his little fingers in through the lock hole and pops them off. I was wrong. No one in my house can open the door with these on! We have standard sized door knobs throughout the house, but these covers won't grip the knob. As hard as I squeezed on the tabs, the little amount of rubber inside never caught the knob.It's such a pity because they seemed to be fairly sturdy and I loved the idea of the lock hole being covered. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy","review":"The plastic is very thin and flexible. The result is that it doesn't take much pressure or strength to pop it apart and remove it completely from the door handle. Might work for toddlers, but I have an 8 year-old autistic girl and these are no match for her. We do have some Safety 1st handle covers that use a much more rigid plastic and they're able to withstand much more pressure and keep her from opening doors and getting into places where she could get hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for smaller doorknobs!","review":"These are probably too small for larger doorknobs, but we just live in an apartment, which has small doorknobs! So these work great! No point in getting the more expensive kind by others unless you need larger covers, and then you want to make sure that those covers will really fit your larger doorknobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"These didn't work at all","review":"We used them on several different doorknobs in our house, but once we put the cover on the doorknob, no one could open the door. The rubberized button things that are supposed to allow you to grip the doorknob are just not rubbery and slip right off. Fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Door knob covers: no challenge for your toddler!","review":"My son is 2 1/2 and had no trouble ripping these door knob covers right off! Pretty sure a monkey could defeat them. I will say that the actual mechanism for squeezing and turning the knob is good; he can't do that. What he can do, however, is pull the two halves of plastic apart and take the knob cover clean off. But, since these were so inexpensive, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much. A little home engineering and I have gotten them to work for us: duct tape. Taping the cover around the knob keeps it from being popped apart and removed. Now it is securely on the knob, spins when he tries to turn it, and has the little tabs that I can squeeze through the tape and open the door.In short, if you don't mind having to alter the product a little, it can work. But, if you're planning to put them on every door knob in your house, I wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits my door, but won't open it!!!!!","review":"Don't waste your money.

They didnt fit the curvature of the fender, therefore the clamp only grabs thin air. I had to remove the wheels, measure and drill them to fit the fender, and used self tapping screws to install them. They look good, and im sure they will work very well, but 2 hours to get them on, was a bit much. Would I purchase them again? NEVER!!

This book fits the bill! It has the feel of an adult cookbook with real recipes - not cutesy kid ones. Many of the recipes are classics, and kid favorites - and a few that will certainly be new to our family! And the retro illustrations just add to the classical feel. This book also has space for her to add her own favorite recipes as she learns, so that she can truly make this book her own.

I do not profess to be a blues expert, but I have been an avid fan since the mid '50s, have about 200 blues albums and know a bit about the music. The selections in the book are curious if nothing else. For example, there are three albums by Skip James and two by Paul Butterfiled yet there are none by Sleepy John Estes, Robert Nighthawk, Lightnin' Slim, Houston Stackhouse or Lazy Lester. I bought this book expecting (after the great \\"Big Blues Book\\") to find some albums I am missing from my collection. Not so!

Unless you are new to blues, I would pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT TOOL FOR BLUES LOVERS ON A BUDGET","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my brother in-law who is a musician. We both appreciate the blues and I thought this would be a good gift. I also thought that I would start his blues collection by buying one of the albums listed in the book. I brought the book to the record store and started shopping. This book allowed me to sift through the many albums available and pick out a really outstanding one by Howling Wolf. I passed over many recordings that the book panned due to recording quality or lack of songs and I wouldn't have known this otherwise. I feel this book is an essential tool for blues lovers wanting to build a record collection. Especially those who don't have a lot of time or money to waste.

To this end, the Scotch Gift Wrap tape almost always succeeds. The only time it doesn't, however, is when you have shiny or textured wrapping paper--which I occasionally use. But you can't win them all. Oh, and as far as using cheapie off-brands...Well, there's always some items when you should always buy name brand: aluminum foil, saran wrap, toilet paper, AND duct or adhesive tape. That's just my honest opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"I hate wrapping gifts, so I really liked how easy the tape made it. You couldn't see the fingerprints, it has a nice finish to it, and the pieces are precut to a nice short length. I found this all very helpful. I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls, and I have to agree that there wasn't as much, but for me that was a minor negative. I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"I have 5 November birthdays and each of them got a few presents. This Scotch tape is perfect. It tears off nicely and when you put it on your packages, you can't even notice it's there. Scotch is the only brand I ever got but they improved the quality of this tape by making it invisible.Also, the price on Amazon is great. I highly recommend it if you are fussy with your packages like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash it goes.","review":"The tape does not cut easily on the edge of the dispenser. It stretches if you pulls it to one side, often folds over on itself and I've learned the only way to cut it easily is to use a much monger piece then is often necessary. A total head ache to use so I'm going back regular old tape and throwing this in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"too little for such high price","review":"very small amount of tape, target has the same stuff for about $1 each. I would be happy to order again if there was more tape or a lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tape","review":"I've never had an issue with the way normal tape looks when wrapping presents, but this tape does really disappear and it looks good. You can still see the tape of course but it's much less visible than normal tape.If you wrap a lot of presents or are a Martha Stewart-type perfectionist, you might want to consider this tape. The other 99% of us can just use normal tape! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good tape for gifts and other stuff","review":"This tape is a bit more transparent and smooth looking than the regular Scotch transparent tape. Just as useful in my estimation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gold standard of gift tape","review":"Like Kleenex, Zippers and Google, this is a product that's so good at what it does we pretty much refer to ALL similar items by its name: Scotch tape.Unlike other brands, however, this is a strong tape with a nice, satin finish that disappears against matte wrapping papers. You don't even have to rub it like crazy with the back of your fingernail to make it invisible, like some inferior brands. If you're using a shiny foil paper you'll want to stick with a tape that has a similar, shiny finish. (Pardon the pun.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"DISAPPEARS ON GIFT WRAP","review":"This is a \\"third generation\\" Scotch tape. Like the Scotch tape of old, it has a shiny surface, unlike the second-generation \\"Magic Tape\\" Scotch tape which virtually disappears on paper with a conventional \\"rough\\" surface. It's virtually undetectable on shiny gift wrap. It also has more \\"body\\" than the Magic Tape variety, making it easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good, and as Invisible, as Ever","review":"When it comes to tape, there's nothing else like the Scotch-brand. Unlike other less-familiar brands, Scotch is dependable. This 3-pack of GiftWrap tape provides what Scotch-brand users have come to depend upon - a dispenser that dispenses a tape with a satin finish that will virtually disappear when you use it on most gift wrap. It dispenses easily, tears off without a hitch, and sticks securely, no questions asked. You don't have to worry about whether it's going to stick or not. This 3/4 inch 3-roll pack is perfect to have on-hand for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"It's hard to get excited by tape. As long as it unrolls, tears well and sticks, it's as good as it needs to be. I liked the finish, which isn't annoyingly shiny and doens't call attention to itself. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can you ask for?","review":"It's invisible and it stays stuck. If this sounds like faint praise, then you usually use gift bags instead of gift wrap. In the past I have had tape that disappeared against the wrapping paper, but also wasn't so great when it came to adhesive. Or the tape held well, but was as shiny as a beacon. If you take gift wrapping seriously, you'll love this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This is a continuous roll of very thin plastic, and one side of it is tacky (sticky). The roll is housed in a hard plastic container, which has a serrated cutting device at one end. What you do is pull on the strip of thin plastic, and when a sufficient amount has been exposed, you sever the plastic strip from the rest of the roll by using the aforementioned serrated cutting device. I know it sounds confusing, but once you do it 3 or 4 times, you'll get the hang of it. Truly remarkable new invention."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can scotch tape be difficult?","review":"Maybe it's just me, but when I'm wrapping paper, every finger is engaged in holding things down or in place. I bought this \\"gift wrap\\" tape because I thought it would be better than regular tape. It may have a satin finish, but man, was it hard to unroll and cut off the dispenser. Forget about using a couple fingers, I had to use BOTH hands in order for me to be able to rip the amount I needed off on the cutter. I don't know if they made the tape thicker or more adhesive, but I won't be buying it again. The satin finish wasn't worth the frustration for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotch 'n' Roll!","review":"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape, 3/4 inch, 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish, the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper, I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However, my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser, which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape, even if it means paying more, so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll, and there would be far less waste. Altogether, the tape is nice and the price seems fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This tape has an excellent adhesive, sticking to paper or foil with no problem. As advertised, the tape is almost invisible on the package. Scotch make quality tape and this is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic tape","review":"I think this is the best tape for your money and it's the kind I always buy. It's virtually invisible upon use and it's not too expensive. I won't use any other tape for gift wrapping."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this tape","review":"Scotch gift wrapping tape is wonderful. It's 3/4 of an inch wide, and goes on clear so you really can barely see it on the wrapping paper. Three rolls of tape goes a long ways. We used it for a recent birthday present and it looked great. Now I am on with the gift wrapping for the holidays. Thanks for the free samples. I love this tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticky!","review":"Now, I have used this Scotch tape before but I don't know if they have changed it or what - This tape is STICKY! Almost too sticky, if possible. I have started wrapping Christmas presents already and while doing so with this tape, there were several times where the tape would kind of get wrapped around my fingertip/fingernail or otherwise stuck to my fingernail and it was kind of a challenge to get it off. It posed a little difficulty in wrapping, but on the other hand, it is a good quality to have in a tape obviously. It blends in pretty well with the wrapping paper, but isn't as transparent as others I have used. All in all I do give it 5 stars because it is heavy tape..a little thicker than I remebered from previous use and of course it is very sticky which means it will hold whatever you need to stick together or tape down. I actually used a whole roll of this on packaging up small boxes for shipping as well as bubble mailers. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A better option than regular Scotch tape for gift wrapping","review":"I was skeptical that I would see a difference with this tape compared to regular Scotch tape, so I wrapped two presents: one in regular Scotch tape and one in this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The first difference is that the Gift Wrap Tape seems to be slightly more heavy duty. After wrapping, it is also clear that the gift wrap tape was less cloudy and did indeed look better than the present wrapped in regular tape. I wouldn't say that the difference was dramatic, but it was enough.So overall, as long as there is not much of a price difference I would definitely say go with the Gift Wrap Tape in situations where you want whatever you are taping to look nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Tape!","review":"For gift wrapping & other instances where you'd like tape to not be so visible, this stuff is great! I've actually used it on wooden picture frames & wooden press board furniture that had dents in it to just help maintain integrity. There's probably a better fix, but it works for me. Scotch knows how to make tape & this tape is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative but some flaws","review":"3M is probably one of the most innovative companies in the world. They can take one product and make a thousand slightly different corresponding products from that base product. They have done that again with the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. When you compare it to the standard tape with a non-gloss finish, this tape blends into the packaging material better than the standard. It gives a nice look that basically hides the tape from a distance.There are two negatives that I noticed: The tensile strength is slightly higher thus it makes it slightly more difficult to tear. It also seems to roll up on me with longer strips than the older standard version. Therefore the 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The volume is too low.","review":"It is very hard to hear the other party's voice since the volume is simply too low."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Phone, Better Choices Available","review":"This Sony phone, like most of the other models they make, works fine but the sound quality is \\"flat\\" and as a result long conversations tend to be difficult. I find the ergonomics (e.g., no lighted buttons, feel of the buttons, design of the headset) of Sony phones to be a notch or two below AT&T and Panasonic which is surprising because most of their other products are generally pretty good. As a phone in a room where you will not use it too much this is ok, but I'd suggest looking elsewhere for your primary phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traveling with Scott Haas isn't much fun.","review":"I just finished this book and came away with only two things. First; Why did I buy this book in the first place and Second; Traveling with Scott Haas must be about as much fun as contracting the black plague. He has all of the warmth of a block of ice. He looks at the people of the world as if they were a nusance. His writing style is about as entertaining as reading the telephone book. I love travel books, but this isn't one that is even close in that genre. It is a book about a sorry excuse for a human being who can not seem to find what life is all about.

Oh, and don't let me forget the very poor audio quality. I popped this DVD in after watching Lamb of God's new Killadelphia DVD which set the bar in my opinion for a brilliantly put together metal DVD, which of course didn't help this DVD's rating at all. Hopefully, Shadows Fall will release the polar opposite of this debacle sometime, we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Shadows Fall's first DVD contains many songs and a lot of bonus features, but compared to its fellow metalcore band's dvds (killswitch and lamb of God), this dvd is very subpar. First of all, it doesn't feature a single live song from 'The War Within', and the live performances are bootleg. I understand that Shadows Fall didn't want it to be a multi-camera perfect sound quality show, but the decision to have poor quality of video was a mistake. The other footage of the band is funny, but is not nearly as hilarious as it could've been, and doesn't tell us anything about the band or its members personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Puke","review":"I thought this DVD was gonna kick butt but I was wrong, I can't believe they agreed to release it ( a little kid could have done better), besides having a terrible sound the bootleg show killed the DVD, the documantary was boring as hell, one of the worst parts of it was watching one of the guitarrist throwing up on some window, how is that funny?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what to say!","review":"I'll make this as painless as possible, THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now that I got that out of the way, I am a huge Shadows Fall fan and I was very happy when I heard about this dvd. Now I wish they wouldn't have released one at all. The only cool thing on here is the videos, that's about it. The sound quality is the worst that I have ever heard by far. The live performance is very subpar and filmed at the back of the f-ing club for f***s sake! During the song, it even switches concerts, God this is just bad! I don't know if they are trying to push their fans away or what, but I am sure to never buy another dvd from these guys.

There is definately no magic here, just garbage, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I'm sorry I bought this. The band is decent minus the vocals but I thought it would be cool to have. Its not what I expected and its kinda a waste.

Its not worth buying unless you want a collection of miserable sounding bootlegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I echo all the other reviews. Sure, it's a bootleg \\"filmed\\" by the band and roadies but that doesn't mean it has to be so bad.

Every gas can, including this one, has an idiotic contraption that will not stay open instead of a lid. While supposedly helping protect the environment from evaporating gasoline they insure that spills and waste will take place every time you use them. All I do with this one is store gas. When I actually need to pour gasoline into a machine, I use a funnel to transfer gas from this joke of a gas can into a 2 gallon can (made by the same manufacturer) that has a screw off lid that can be taken off and replaced with a short hose. Then I can easily pour the gas into the machine.I love bureaucrats who think they are improving the situation when all they do is make life more difficult.PS - I saw a great vid on YouTube where a guy did relatively simple surgery on a plastic gas can to convert it to something much more useable.

The spring loaded cap keeps the gas in the can and the funnel allows much easier pouring than any other system I've seen.

Made of durable metal with a self closing lid, this can makes us feel much better about storing gas under our roof.

You cannot return this item to Amazon (due to product restrictions), and in California (our lovely state with the beyond-the-absurd personal safety laws) the tank will not fill due to the \\"special\\" nozzle gas-emission prevention controls that restrict the gasoline flow into the can because the spout is not compatible. My solution is to try to find an old plastic gas can that I can fill at the gas station even with the newfangled station safety nozzle, and then manually transfer the gas to these tanks for longer term storage using a good old fashioned plastic spout.While the cans are nicely fabricated, I would NOT have purchased these expensive tanks if I had known they could not be filled directly at the gas station.

Unfortunately, this one isn't it.It is sturdy and I like the positive, spring-loaded, rubber-gasketed lid but filling is awkward (why not have a way to hold the lid open?). Most importantly, I couldn't pour without spilling some gas no matter how I tried.The funnel is nearly useless, unless you don't mind gas dribbling down the side of the can and onto your machinery or the ground. The problem is that the funnel doesn't seal around the spout and even with careful pouring to try to keep the flow of gas beyond the funnel-spout connection, some fuel finds its way there and seeps through the \\"seal\\" and down along the side of the can. I tried taking the funnel off, using it in the traditional way, but still some fuel inevitably would spill down the spout aand the side of the can. The spout is just too short and wide to allow spill-less pouring, especially with a big, awkward can like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE CANS","review":"I bought 4 of these cans in March 2007. They are so bad, I have to throw them away and buy something that works.The problem with these cans is with the plastic funnel. First it's very difficult to install because the clearance between the spring loaded cap and the funnel is too small to allow the funnel to fit. And it's so fat, that you can't empty more than about 1/3 the can into a vehicle's gas tank. The funnel doesn't fit very well, so it ends up leaking gas on the floor under the can, and getting it all over you in the process. The only way to get gas into a vehicle is to buy a gooseneck funnel to stick in the filler pipe, and then pour the gas from these horribly designed cans into the funnel.We're so stupid now, that we can't even design a gas can that works.

This Eagle container is well made but after receiving it I wish I had purchased the one that has a flexible metal hose for the delivery nozzle. This funnel works OK until you get close to the end of the container volume. Then you are tipping the container past vertical for the funnel. Otherwise I am satisfied, the can is much safer than the standard outlet plastic ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So Black and White","review":"The product description says, \\"Though her sympathies understandably rest with her father...\\". That's to be expected, so keep in mind that the \\"villain\\" isn't quite the devil he's painted to be, nor is the books \\"hero\\" completely pure of heart. As with most of life, the truth lies somewhere in between the extremes. In talking with some of the old timers and historians who lived through this time in the city's history, it appears that there were other factors at play here that the author chose not to include in her story. When family is concerned, that fair enough. Still, it's a great story and a real page turner that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Gimmicky","review":"I purchased this based on a recommendation that this would help my daughter improver her spelling. I found that this device was too much of a gimmick and wouldn't really help her very much.It is slow and limited. It is not very interactive for the user. Some of the things that this device can do are somewhat pointless (like flashcards, and the speaking feature). For the price, I'm sure there is better software for a PC out there than buying this stand-alone device.One feature that might have been nice to have on this would be for the device to say a word and the child have to spell it.We've decided that spending 20 minutes of interactive time, one-on-one, with our daughter to help her improve her spelling is the BEST remedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible book","review":"This book was so full of fabrications I couldn't use it for information in a scholarly article.

I ordered this book from Amazon shortly after it was released and tore into it immediately after receiving it upon my doorstep. While the book was interesting, I believe it to be far more fiction than fact. This is based upon other accounts I've read about this well-hung legend. As told on the recent John Holmes addition of the E! True Hollywood Story, Holmes was prone to exaggeration and fabrication. There was also very little about his life in the adult film world - only a mere skim over. While I wasn't disappointed with the book, I wasn't satisfied either. But, give it a shot and see what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lamp!!!!","review":"The lamp itself is really nice.

The song that got the most air play on this album was the remake of \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\"! Joe Cerisano's voice and Clarence Clemons \\"The Big Man\\" on sax makes this my favorite version easily.The song \\"Good Lovin Don't Come Easy\\", was by far the song that should have been released as a single. The song had a wonderful sound and great chorus that just got you up and singing along.That is the problem Joe Cerisano seems to have had his entire career. Never really knowing the audience. He is a talent no doubt. But this album should have done far better then it did. Just on the two songs I mentioned.I still play this quite frequently. It takes me back to a happier time. When Rock and Roll was really Rock and Roll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minor AOR hit: \\"Holdin On (Barely)\\"","review":"Silver Condor had a few minor radio songs, back in the hey day of the AOR (album oriented rock) radio format. This is their 2nd release. The track that received airplay here is \\"Holdin On (Barely)\\", featuring Neil Schone on guitar. The neat thing about this record is the all star cast. Steve Plunket (pre Autograph) and Kenny Aaronson (Rick Derrenger) are in the band. Other guests include Clarence Clemons and Waddy Wachtel. The album was mixed by the legendary Andy Johns. The music is kind of bland and more blues based than most AOR bands of this period - still, \\"Holdin On\\" is a solid track and worthy of owning, if you enjoy AOR of this era. ...If you can find it, Silver Condor's first release features two radio songs: Angel Eyes and For The Sake Of Survival. Steve Plunket is not in the band but Earl Slick is (David Bowie, Phantom Rocker & Slick)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for heartland rock fans","review":"Joe Cerisano has been called \\"the most famous anonymous singer in America\\". He's done commercials for the Army and Navy as well as Pepsi, Mountain Dew etc and worked with a huge variety of artists. He has a very recognizable voice and this album will be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of 1980's AoR or heartland rock.

He used a few songs from what was going to be the third Fenix Tx album and put them on here. This album reminds me a lot of Lechuza which was probably one of the best albums of 2001. Their first album was ok but it sounded too much like Blink 182. I'm glad it didnt take them 5 or 6 albums to figure out that you can't gain any self- respect playing to ten year olds.This album has that Lechuza mature sound and basically is an extension of it. I've read some reviews on here and i guess if you're 10 year old Avril Levine and Yellowcard must seem like AC/DC.

All this sounds like is another poor blink 182 album and I personally hate blink 182 as there the worst band ever, they sound terible and are just made too public. So if you like real punk, dont buy this but if you love the whole blink 182 pop punk 'stuff' buy it.This album SUCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Start, yet...","review":"The first set of this night is fantastic. It has a nice pace, a few missteps (Wishlist) but overall the band is right on cue. A humorous exchange begins between Eddie and the audience when he argues with Stone about song selection. The second set is not as listener friendly, with slow periods and drifting which sound to me at times like \\"going through the motions\\". Yet even there, sections and songs stand out. Yellow Ledbetter and Black highlight the last hour. Overall, I found it very satisfying and look forward to buying more of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"educational & fun","review":"This Easel is remarkable!!

Based on the reviews I had read, I was prepared to put aside or throw out the magnets that came with it. As one previous reviewer has mentioned, the manufacturer or seller must have been listening to comments, as the magnets that we received are made of soft foam with a flexible magnetic backing which seems very secure (no little magnet pieces to fall out). There are one or two small pieces (a division symbol, for example) which you may want to remove if you have a child who puts things in his or her mouth, but overall they seem perfectly safe to me. And while my daughter has enjoyed drawing on the chalkboard side, she is much more interested in playing games with the magnetic letters and numbers for now. Overall, a big hit. I definitely recommend this easel."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOSH! TATYANA ALI!","review":"This is an excellent movie! That's probbaly why it cost so much...20 whole dollars for a vhs tape?

Being the first show on their tour, one can understand when Ed flubs up the lyrics here and there, esp. on \\"Immortality\\". But it just doesn't matter. The crowd picks up the slack, and between songs chants like wild soccer fans. Almost disturbingly so when they sing the title line from \\"Alive\\" in unison before \\"Last Exit\\", sounding eerily like a scene early in the movie \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\".Glad to see that \\"Faithfull\\" made it onto disc one, while fans of the max-firepower \\"Corduroy\\" won't be disappointed. Ed even throws in a small snippet of what sounds like \\"Save it for Later\\" from English Beat at the end of \\"Better man\\".As usual, it's the improv that makes the live show sound great, and the reason to get more than one of their live discs.

The first game was fabulous, and this had a lot of promise, but fell short in the fact that it was released buggy, and then didn't have the momentum to force proper updates. A game that makes me work that hard to find fixes for this video card or that motherboard, well, it only gets 1 star. Sorry KoTOR2:TSL, you're no KoTOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the ending?","review":"It all started so well, the improvements on KOTOR were welcomed and useful but the whole series has been let down by dead end quests and massive plot holes. By all accounts Lucasarts pressured Obsidian into an early release and it shows. Whilst some planets and quest are fun and challenging, other areas of the game seem to be afterthoughts and the ending itself is abrupt to say the least. The game is good enough but it could have been so much better. There is talk of Obsidian releasing a patch to finish the 'iffy' parts and all I can say is I hope they do.All in all: not as great as the original but still enjoyable until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game has lots of bugs and an incomplete story.","review":"The gameplay would be great if it weren't for the bugs. Also the story is incomplete so you get a quantem leap to the ending where you get to go, I paid money for THIS?!!They also took out a force powers that all classes used to have. Only Jedi Guardians and their Sith counterpart have force jump.Note: there are 50 character levels in this game, the most you might ever reach is level 30. Lucas Arts cut out around 40% of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor forsight","review":"I purchased this game in may of 2009. My computer is about a year old and runs very high quality internals to allow for maximum gaming. This game will install but not play. it freezes at the main menu and shuts down. When contacted, lucasarts (via Yoda's help desk) simply stated that I have too good of a video card and thats too bad. I searched high and low for updates and drivers, but the game simply wont support a card newer than 3 years old. if your card isnt the on listed on the game reqs DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. you will lose your money like I did. The same is true of other lucasarts games such as Jedi Knight and Jedi Outcast so beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disapointment","review":"While its true that there were some improvments in the game, it was shipped in a unfinished state.

I would not buy this game, the storyline is ok, but its not worth the frustration you will face."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfinished game","review":"Simply put, this game was published before it was completed. It has no ending, no conclusion. It reaches a climax and stops. Then there is a short cinematic that makes utterly no sense in the context of the events leading up to it. There are many plot lines and quests that cannot be completed because the endings were cut. There are a few that you discover yourself in the middle of and have no idea what's going on because the beginning was cut. The entire last 1/3 of this game leaves you feeling as if you have been slapped and do not know why. You have. By Lucas Arts, who were so determined to release this game by christmas they did not care if it was ready or not. It was not. My advice is, wait and see if they fix this game. If they do not, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment for the fans","review":"The game is truly unsatisfying, bugged and incomplete.

What do you get when you add broken gameplay, imcomplete storyline, confusing controls, and horrible graphics? KOTOR2 of course! Now you may think I am just being mean, but I don't particularly enjoy bashing games. I much rather enjoy praising them, but in cases like this, there is just no praise to be found. Ok I would not be so mad if Lucasarts actually stuck with their promise of releasing a patch to solve this horrendous mess. But I regret to say that they have so far released no such thing. And unless they do soon, I will tell you to STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, despite some flaws","review":"This game is actually better than it's predecessor, despite the fact that it was a bit rushed on the market. I encountered several, (unacceptable in my opinion) bugs. Thanks to the latest patch 1.0b most of them are gone. While KOTOR had a great plot with a fair amount of twists, the game path was rather linear. KOTOR II offers a similar experience, but the story has more depth and the number of possibilities are greatly increased. The good graphics and superb voice acting contribute a lot in recreating the Star Wars Universe \\"look and feel\\". The AD&D rules are a bit simplified, yet the legacy is kept intact. It's one of my favorite games and I strongly recommend it to anyone. Only 4 out of 5 because of the stupid people who force release dates."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only it had been...","review":"given a little more time in development.This game should have gone down in history as a true masterpiece, but Lucasarts had to have it out by Christmas. The REAL kicker is that the PC version didn't come out until two months later. That should have given them time to clear up the plot, and dialogue holes. They could have even patched it later, but they refused to admit that they sent out un unfinished product.But I digress...Don't let any of the above deter you from buying this game. I was just venting in case anyone from Lucasarts reads this :) This is one the games that you will not be able to put down once you start it.

However sometimes things did not make sense, you are left wondering why this person talked to you out of the blue about nothing.My biggest erk is the cut content for the 3rd KOTOR.Cut content, yes.... and they didn't think the fans would know or get mad about this? Cut stuff from the game?Don't buy this unless they patch this thing then it might be worth it. Buy it now and you'll regret you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"SW KotOR II Not Ready for Playing","review":"I have KotOR I (PC) and all patches.

I had most if not all the problems mentioned previously by other reviewers from the forums and here. KotOR II was supposed to be the \\"long awaited sequel to the 2003 Game of the Year\\". It was \\"awaited\\" and KotOR I was, is and always will be the 2003 Game of the Year. KotOR II needs a \\"fix\\" patch. It also needs a \\"content\\" patch. It may get the first; but I highly doubt the second. Only buy the game when the \\"fix\\" patch is available. DO NOT pay more that $25 for the game as is. Nearly every reviewer (XBox and PC) who has played KotOR II completely has written similar things: Bugs, Cut Content, Missing Quest, etc. WE ARE NOT WRONG!!! LucasArts and Obsidian \\"screwed up\\".

Dozens of hours of engrossing and fun gameplay culminate in what is possibly the worst ending of any game I have ever played. It's not that the ending is just bad, it's not even there.

The plot has a million holes in it and seems to not tell you what really happens. Some poeple i know complained about Carth in the first one but all of the characters in this game are 8 times worse.

For those who want to 'be all they can be- without having to join the armed forces' this book is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fortean Delight","review":"Patrick Harpur poetically captures the splendors and horrors of the paranormal spectrum in this fantastic book. With humor and wit, he continues the exploration into the underlying mechanism of these seemingly unrelated yet disturbingly similar events. As creepy and insightful as Ted Holiday, as world view shifting as Charles Fort, but uniquely beautiful and celebratory, Daimonic Reality is definitely a required field guide for the researcher of Fortean events who wishes to be enlightened and mystified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daimonic Confusion","review":"I am almost through with this book, and after looking up the definitions of both the \\"collective unconscious\\" and \\"anima mundi\\", I still can't figure out what he is trying to say these things really are...the concept he is presenting is kind of interesting if you suspend any type of rational/critical thinking...they are both real and non-real? There are so many questions that come up while reading this book that it makes it very difficult to finish reading it. Having said that, I have learned a WHOLE lot about some \\"paranormal\\" manifestations that I never knew, so the book hasn't been a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extrordinarily, Mind-Numbingly, BORING!","review":"While this book does have some interesting things to say on the subject of mass psychology, it is by no means an exploration of other realities, dimensions, etc. Pick up Hyperspace by Michio Kaku for something worth while.This is nothing more than a Karl Jung text-book with some notable quotes, but nothing new is explored here."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book or bad translation?","review":"I was expecting an interesting point of view about this topic, but what I found was kind of confusing, i found contradictions between ideas, they were not clearly exposed.I was expecting maybe more philosophy related subjects. But I read the spanish version, and I am not pretty sure if it was appropiate translated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-contradicting and Silly","review":"I started to read this because it presented itself as a serious discussion of what I thought would be an interesting topic. In the introduction, the author leads the reader to belive that he will look at the history of sightings of various things (UFOs, fairies, bigfoot, etc.), and offer a serious analysis of their psychological implications.Despite claims to the contrary, the author clearly believes fairies are real. People who don't believe in them are \\"unwise\\". His evedence for the reality of these various creatures is that people keep seeing them.When the author seriously suggested that a reasonable person should conclude that the psychic surgeons of the Philipines were using magic, I stopped reading. I couldn't take it anymore.That said, if you believe in Yetis, gnomes, and trolls, you will probably love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop talking about it.","review":"This book is by far one of my favorites. People try to punch me all the time because I always talk about the ideas this book puts forward.It makes you think. With apsects such as collective unconscious, the entire paranormal spectrum, mythology, the reality of imagination, etc., this book has it all. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge his normal views about the world around him. Patrick Harpur, with his Irish charm, did Joseph Campbell, Carl G. Jung, and Terence Mckenna proud.Plus! It comes in a beautiful, quality, hardback edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift 2008","review":"This is a really fun dress for my 3 year old niece.

While this monograph is anything but a influential and momentous study, it serves as a nice introduction to the sub-field of the identity and role of the BD in the Gospel of John. Charlesworth does a great job of introducing the problems and perplexities of the BD as well as offers a great overview of various speculations on the identity of the BD throughout history.Some criticisms of the work are indeed justified. Charlesworth theorizes that Thomas Didymus was the Beloved Disciple of John and offers marginal and controversial evidence to support his claim. This is a rather liberal view for the BD and one that many conservative scholars (Brown, Dodd) would probably have rejected. In spite of this, \\"The Beloved Disciple: Whose Witness Validates the Gospel of John?\\" is a great read and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlesworth's \\"comprehensive\\" work fails to look at all pos","review":"Charlesworth provides a detailed analysis of scholarship on the question of the identity of the mysterious \\"beloved disciple\\" in the gospel of John. After carefully anaysing each scholar's thesis, he lays a case for identifying Thomas as the beloved disciple. Unfortunatly, like most other scholars, he fails to consider the candidacy of Mary of Bethany, who fills the bill better than Thomas does. See Thomas W. Butler's LET HER KEEP IT: JESUS' ORDINATION OF MARY OF BETHANY, Quantum Leap Publisher (1998) for a careful study of Old and New Testament evidence to support the thesis that the beloved disciple of Jesus was a woman. Her identity was hidden because that fact was not acceptable to the established leaders in ancient Christian, Jewish and Greek culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Picture quality!","review":"I owned this tv for about six months and I realized that enough was enough!

The picture on this tv is average when there is lots of light in a scene, but watch dark content material and it is terrible! I now switched to a Panasonic TH-42PX60U, and that plasma has it going on! Great contrast, color, black levels! It is just plain beautiful, sure you may pay more but it is worth it!

I got so caught up it in I couldn't put it down. It was great knowing what happend to Ashleigh so many years ago, and why they sold Wonder's Champion.

Champion was my favorite horse, but that is probably the only book he's gonna be in, cuz i doubt he will come back to Whitebrook. It was also sad that Ashleigh couldn't have another baby.One thing i didn't like is that Ashleigh didn't care that Cindy loved champion, and just sold him like that, and when Cindy went to Arabia, she'd rather race then be with him, and just left him there for 12 years.Hope the next book tells more! =D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring your own adhesive","review":"I purchased these for use in my car, but struggled to get past the installation phase.

Wynne was forced to sign over her infant daughter at an early age to her husband Edward, who was very over-bearing, and the daughter grew up thinking her mother had died. Another Kind of Magic continues on with the story of Wynne coming to grips with letting go all her covered up feelings, wanting to see her daughter, wondering if she'd hate her if she found out her mother wasn't dead.

And that is pretty much what I got. The book does not cost a lot, it is pretty easy to read, it covers most of the things good beginning relational database books usually do, and it does it in the context of PostgreSQL.If I had to choose between this and \\"Practical PostgreSQL\\", which is the only comparable book out right now (mid 2002), I would probably choose the latter, but I think it would be better to get both, since they are both presenting similar information pretty well, but slightly differently, so I think reading both would result in a better overall understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still refer to this book","review":"I think the index is weak.This is a good book if you can get your hands on it.

I'd had no prior experience with using a database server.3 years after purchase, I still refer to this book. It's especially valuable for the server-side programming section, however, I've refered to it for the forms of the SELECTS, INSERTS, UPDATES, and subqueries. it's a very good book for database beginners. very good! 4.5 because of the weak index.If I lost this book, I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeee-licious!","review":"I'm a cookbook hound (really, not going for the pun here), and many of them end up sitting on my shelf without my ever having made more than one or two things out of them.

And, not for nothing, the photography in it is really beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"My advice is to save your money. Get their catalog with free recipes in it and spend your money on a worthy cookbook. This one is of very little value. It is , like their restaurant, highly over-rated and over-hyped. I purchased this book on impulse because of the colorful pictures. It was only when I searched it for interesting recipes that I discovered that it was lacking for any cohesiveness. Only one who has endured a meal at their flagship restaurant would understand what the recipes are doing in a book together. At best they are hit or miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never been to The Black Dog...","review":"This cookbook's not just for Vineyard groupies! The Black Dog restaurant is on an island, so expect lots of recipes for seafood and fish. There are pictures... and lots of 'em, so you'll be able to see what you're making.

Like the quick Hollandaise sauce (for those times you really want it and don't want to spend time on the real thing - ala my old standby \\"The Silver Palate\\" version). Don't think by any of this, I am not a serious cook. But these simple recipes sound wonderful, workable, and a nice break from the complications of \\"The French Laundry Cookbook\\".

I got the book hoping to discover some wonderful and innovative new recipes. What I found instead was an advertisement for a restaurant. I just don't see what the big deal is. Adding fruit to pancakes and substituting vegetables for the canadian bacon in Eggs Benedict is hardly a brainstorm worth spending twenty dollars for. Other recipes call for outragously obscure ingredients. The outcome is seldom worth the pursiut of exotic items. I made the black bean clam thing...disgusting. My dog wouldn't even eat it. I recommend instead buying something like the new Joy of Cooking. It contains plenty of exotic and innovative recipes along with all of the basics. I guess I thought this would be a cookbook worthy of the shelf space it takes up.

Also identifying and picturing local suppliers shows some of the real people on the island. Recipes aren't that complicated.I've spent limited time at Martha's Vineyard as don't really like it there.

I stated in my review that I had some issues with the verticle bars and loss of video at various times since I purchased my set in 5/05. I have been contacted by TOSHIBA recently, and a \\"file\\" has been created for my complaints. I have no idea if anything else will be done to settle my claim for a new replacement or not. I gave them details of my problems and asked them to let me know their decision. I will insist on the identical model, as I love the hd performance and I am willing to give them another chance to make it right by me. As of today, two weeks after their phone interview, I have not gotten any response on my claim. I would still reccomend this television almost without hesitation (pendind a fix by TOSHIBA). For the money, the digital picture is very good to outstanding and the hd performance will knock your socks off!!!!.............still waiting............"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspect screen carefully before accepting delivery.","review":"Inspect screen Before signing and accepting delivery of any Toshiba DLP, be sure to check the screen to make sure that the coating on the inside of the screen is uniform. On mine, there was a circle about 10\\" in diameter that you can see in certain lighting and even when the TV is off! It will appear lighter than the surrounding areas at times and can be annoying. I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common, Toshiba will not replace the screen. I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude. So, look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing. If you see this problem, refuse to accept it. Or else just buy a Samsung or Mitsubishi DLP to avoid the problem I have.carefully before accepting delivery"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try to buy such kind of TV at Amazon","review":"Amazon uses the company which is very irresponsible in shipping the TV.

George Plimpton has compiled the difinitive interviews with some of the centuries most intriuging playwrights including Edward Ablee, Harold Pinter, Sam Shepard and Tennesee Williams. The questions are indepth and utterly facinating. We hear from the playwrights themselves on process, craft and thier candid opinons on the state of modern theatre. Undoubtedly the most comprehensive guide ever written into the mind of the dramatist and a must-read for anyone who has an interest in theatrical studies.

However, I decided that I really need to describe my experience with this product so that you can understand why some people give it 5 stars and some give it 1 or 2 stars. I have two Persian cats who will use almost any litter. So I decided to try this because of the commercials and the reviews on this site. While the litter does a decent job at first of clumping and covering urine smell, it does nothing to knock down poop odor. Also, it needs to be changed very frequently to cover up the urine smell. For the first time in the 11 years that I've owned my two cats, my house actually reeked from the smell of the litter box. Even my cat sitter (who is a vet tech and helps me out when I need to travel) begged me to go back to a clumping clay litter.Don't ignore this post - I don't have anything to gain other than to save you money and the annoyance of determining that you need to get rid of this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matches its name","review":"I did quite a bit of research before ordering this product for use in an automatic litter box. It does a great job of clumping and, best of all, as long as the cat covers over his business, it kills the smell. I will continue ordering this product as long as I use this litter box. But be careful when you order because some of the listings for this product are eligible for free shipping and some are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells worse than poop!","review":"I picked this up because there was a coupon for it and I've been trying to find a litter that is more natural... This litter clumps amazingly, but it smells SOUR. I'm used to scooping the cat box, but this litter smells worse than cat feces and urine. I'll definitely be switching back to something less repulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"I think there was a typo on the bag because this is the World's Worst Cat Litter. I have multiple kittens and tried this litter because I hoped it would control odor better than other cat litters I have tried. Not only is litter extremely expensive for the small bag, but it is horrible! When I walked into the room where we keep the litter box the morning after I put this litter in the box I was met with the most wretched smell of urine and feces that I thought I was going to vomit. Apparently the cats were disgusted by the smell because they stopped using the litter box during the night and began pooping just outside of the box. I can't say I blame them, I would step into that stink-fest either. Save your money and just buy some Tidy Cat, you can get triple the amount for the same price and it works infinitely better."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Worst Cat Litter","review":"Absolute garbage. I tried this awhile ago and was horribly disappointed. It doesn't even deserve one star. Why? First of all the clumps are not clumps, they are sticky piles of goo, and the smell is awful. I pride myself on having a home with 6 cats and NO odors. I thought I'd try this litter to be more environmentally conscious. I had to dump out the 2 litter boxes after a few days and go back and get my usual because it rank of ammonia. Try it if you want but don't say I didn't warn you. If you want the most superb litter in the world, get Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Clumping Cat Litter. I've tried numerous styles and brands and it really is the best for multi-cat households."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes: it stinks!","review":"I, like several other people, wanted desperately to love this product. I wanted my 5 cats to not have to deal with dust and tracking litter. I wanted not to deal with it either. I wanted people to seem surprised when they found out that I actually had 5 cats in my home. They were surprised, but only because they thought I had 10 of the stinkiest creatures in God's creation. The smell was awful. Sure, it covered up the smell of urine nicely. But the smell of feces was overpowering. I would wait by the litter and try to scoop it up immediately to avoid the stench. We stuck it out for a week, until finally, we could take no more. Maybe our cats are stinkier than the average cat, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It smells worse than my cat's feces","review":"It smells so bad.

But this book does nothing right. Every character is unlikable. The plot (or one of the many plot lines) involves the \\"evil corporation\\" cliche that dominates so many books and quickly became tiresome. And I can't imagine that this book ever got past an editor. Some of the prose was so poorly written I was literally laughing out loud. I rarely stop reading a book once I've started but with only 40 pages left of this 500 page novel, I gave up. I had no interest in the story or any of the characters and just couldn't stand to read another page.What a waste or real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really enjoyed The Corrections and hoped that Strong Motion would be good as well.

But for my money this one is no less brilliant... and hey, a story, when it doesn't make you cringe, can be kind of NICE.

That's a good sign - no one in this story is one-dimensional. Franzen has no problem with digression, which provides some of the strength of characterization. His people will take a page or two at any time to go on about things that are really important to them (nostalgia for punk and new wave music, for example, or how it feels to want to buy clothes that you see worn by the kind of people you can't stand.) Even the least important characters get filled in. His plotting is, in the end, a bit weaker, but still serves.

When I first purchased it it had all the capabilities I was looking for. I only had two problems with the phone but the second one was a killer.The first problem was that I had to select which line I was going to use rather than have a switch that defaulted to my preferred line. I use the phone mostly for business and wanted to use line 2 but it defaulted to line 1. Switching the incoming lines didn't work so I was stuck pushing the line button every time I wanted to make a call.The second problem was that the phone quit working on line 2 about 14 months after I purchased it, 2 months after the warranty expired.

It is a nice book, bright colors, lots of attention to detail, silly story line, but I didn't think the areas for the child to feel were large enough.

It has a 1960s family living in an ancient house with mysterious rooms and neurotic relatives. Set in rural Essex, it is the story of the dysfunctional Cosway family, who are locked in a power struggle. The story is narrated by the young Swedish nurse hired to care for the only son, John who suffers from what we now know as autism. True to her style, Vine tells the story in flashback, which has a dramatic impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly cold comfort farm","review":"A young, but in no way naive, Swedish woman is ensconced in the most disfunctional family since Flora Poste visited Cold Comfort Farm ... but without the humor. Kerstin (whose name we're regularly reminded is pronounced \\"Shastin\\") comes to Lydstep Old Hall to care for a young man. As a registered nurse, Kerstin is well equipped to provide care for just about any illness. However, the source of John's problem is diffuclt to determine; he reportedly has some sort of mental illness, but he's definitely not the only person in the family with problems. Add a strong and nasty matriach, overly familiar family doctor, odd daughters, an unmarried vicar, and a sexually predacious painter, and Barbara Vine (aka Ruth Rendell) has given us all the ingredients necessary for a good and dark tale of the English countryside. There is definitely something nasty in this family's woodshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give it 6 stars if I could","review":"Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell is the best writer in her genre. She is streets ahead of anyone else in the field. The plot has been dealt with by several reviewers (on Amazon's UK site) so will not repeat it here. What is so marvellous about Vine's writing is her building up of the story to a great (and usually unexpected climax). True, the plot was fairly obvious but it was the way she approached the story that made it so interesting. I also have the problem of wanting to gallop ahead and yet rationing myself so that I don't finish the book too quickly. I have read all her books and most of them twice. Her ability to deal with and develop the characters in her books is just amazing. Each and every one of the Cosway children as well as Mrs. Cosway and the outside characters were made so human and so believable.

I love this girl, so I was VERY excited when this book came out. However, her poetry is of the level of things I was writing about when I was 13.

Then she continues on with \\"something is wrong (ya think?)/And it's hurting me.\\" DAMN, Alicia, you had me thinking I would get some deep thoughts for a second there. The metaphors she uses are often trite and some just plain don't work. Also, it's great to have the lyrics to her songs in book form, but without her delivery and fiery piano playing, these lyrics lose their luster. Alicia has writing of greater caliber than this in her head, for proof just check some of her \\"journal\\" entries at her official site. I don't know what went wrong with this book.

The first is a collection of poems, along with some explanations as they relate to the singer. They are many different types but most of them deal with love.

The second section is filled with the lyrics to her first album while the last section has the lyrics to her current album.Tears for Water flows well and allows readers to understand Keys a little more. As she explains her poems, readers are invited into Keys thoughts. It is nice to be given the lyrics to Keys' works to explore their meaning farther. Tears for Water is easy to read and a nice change from novel reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing, unsatisfactory poetry","review":"I am a well known and respected poet from the bay area, and also an Alicia Keys fan. I was very dissapointed by this book, in which the poetry is mediocre and stereotypical. It sounded like one long running teenage rant, like \\"why don't you love me? I am sad! I hate my life\\" kinds of things. not intellectual or original. I am surprised because i thought she was lyrically better than that. The writing is poor, and on the level of a middle school student. People that I know that like this book have even admitted they are not familiar with a lot of poetry and don't know how to recognize good poems. Shes lucky she has the connections to publish a book, because if she was some regular girl no one would wanna read her poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Alicia has a beautiful writing style. She's very personal, and shares every emotion in completeness. I'm glad she took the time to share her work. It was a very addictive read. I can't wait for her next work, hopefully on it's way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime drama . . .","review":"For murder mystery fans who don't mind plots that wander well beyond the realm of credibility, this who-dun-it will keep viewers puzzling over the clues right to the end. Not just a who-dun-it but a what-was-it, the film begins with two violent deaths and in a series of flashbacks reconstructs the series of events leading up to both of them.There's a bit of Jane (\\"Prime Suspect\\") Tennyson in Cecilia Roth's portrayal of the investigating magistrate as she pieces together the details of the case, determining how and why three men, all brothers, would confess to the same murder. Entertainingly far-fetched, the film introduces us to a life-celebrating family of Greeks in modern-day Buenos Aires who get mixed up with a sexy femme fatale and the usual corrupt suspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing Hodge Podge","review":"If you like films that glamorize disturbed people and dysfunctional families, you'll probably enjoy this one. The flashbacks were too long and disjointed -- a far cry from the exquisite use of this technique in MEMENTO, for example. In fairness, the flashbacks did heighten the suspense of the \\"whodunit\\". Cecilia Roth's fine performance as Judge Teller shines through the muck of this depressing story. If you're looking for a well-made and acted \\"steamy thriller\\", BODY HEAT puts this one to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book was very instructive and insightful.

I somehow expected more of the G Minor Quintet from the Lindsays after my first venture into their Mozart. I listened again this morning. I was wrong. No, it cannot be played better. This is magnificent, unparalleled work. Peerless. (I still admire the great Albon Berg verson, but this replaces it.) The Allegro and the ending of the last movement are brisk, but beautifully performed. The heart-stopping, sad glory of the Meuetto and following, utterly tragic Adagio are exactly right. The quintet, and the quartet, too (though it cannot measure up to the greatness of the quintet -- very little can), are artistic triumphs. Irresistable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEGINNING TAGLOG: A Course for Speaker of English","review":"This book is a disappointment to me. The book assmes a classroom situation.

I have had a Sony clock beofer this and it lasted for many years. I just got it yesterday and i used it last night. Even though the shape seems a little wierd with the time being to the back of the clock it did not make a very big difference.

Though that occured to an extent, I felt more like I was reading some sort of stream-of-conciousness narrative. The stories just seemed to ramble--no synthesis of ideas or cohesion of thought. The writing was mediocre at best.Some points were valuable, but not worth the investment of time and money. If you don't care about how you spend your money or your time, perhaps this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After reading the wonderful book, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, I was expecting great things from The Ruin of Kasch. Unfortunately this disjointed, disorganized, collection of odds and ends never seems to pull together into any cohesive whole. The tid-bits about the life of Talleyrand were not substantial enough to maintain a narrative thread throughout the entire book. There wasn't enough cohesion around the Talleyrand sections to begin to say this was really commentary on this fascinating personality. Read The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony twice rather than read this book once."},{"rating":"2","title":"bangin and slappin","review":"I like this cd better then most of yukmouth.

If you are interested in the entire span of art deco fashion that includes the 1930s, this isn't the book for you.

Includes sketches and actual photos from the time-period. I used it as inspiration for decorations for a 1920's theme wedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visually beautiful small book on Art Deco costume","review":"This book is not about Art Deco as an art movement, but rather instead concentrates on how the Art Deco ascetic impacted on fashion. The book gives you an overview of the background of Art Deco and then progresses through in sections with brief biographies of the better known fashion designers of the period including people such as: Poiret, Lanvin, Vionnet, Channel and the various Russian designers in Paris in the period. The emphasis is on Parisienne fashion rather than what was produced during the period in London or New York.While only a small book this is nevertheless a lovely reference for fashion from c1912 to 1930. It is packed with images of costumes from various museums, reproductions of fashion plates and photos. If you love art deco fashion this book is a visual feast though it probably couldn't be used as a reference book because the depth of the designer biographies are only designed to give an introduction to the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Deco Fashion","review":"I was very impressed with this publication.

First Off, this is the EDITED VERSION, and ONLY the EDITED VERSION! Scenes were cut from the original Japanese theatrical release to 'tame the violence to the dog' sequences, which were some important moments. Also, the original Japanese dialogue is nowhere on this disc.But for some reason, the VHS release comes in either edited and dubbed, or widescreen uncut japanese with english subtitles.My opinion is to go for the subtitled uncut version on VHS. Either that or somehow find the original series that aired on Japanese TV years ago to get the full story.This movie is an absolute treasure in many Japanese childrens' childhoods, and now pioneer disgraces the DVD format.5 stars for the movie, and 4 stars gets retracted for the butchering."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"What a disgrace.

Throughout the books wonderful \\"itinerary\\" we continue to find that the shortest distance between all of its varied points remains the line between our hearts.

A brilliant approach to a neglected era in American history. This book is a vital portrait of a living body: the House of Representatives as it was before the Civil War. Its quasi-protagonists, Theodore Weld and John Quincy Adams are drawn boldly and vividly. However, I have to say that I found Miller's constant asides somewhat grating after a while. I began to wish that he had used more quotes from the participants and let them speak for themselves. Some of the moral conclusions he draws are overly simplistic and too-broadly-drawn.

I started with the basic and rapidly worked my way to advanced. I am not a dancer and have played sports most of my life, but am now over 40 and have terrible knees. The rebounder works very well for bad knees, back, etc. My only complaint with this DVD is JB Bearns does, indeed, use the Lord's name in vain multiple times. That, and the rebounders in the background (namely Tracey Finan) are sometimes extremley irritating.

Since I had nothing else to compare it to, I went with it. You MUST start at the beginning if you've never done this workout before. Even though the choreography is very basic, there's still lots of safety tips and basic moves that must be learned. I'm pleased to say after just one month of using my rebounder I was using the advanced routine. Each routine ends with strenth and ab work which I was not impressed with. However, the cardio portion is well worth the money. After three months of the advanced routine, I got bored! Luckily, there are more compilations. Even though I liked compilation 3 better, I'm glad I started with #1 simply for the more complete instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is a good dvd to have if you own a rebounder.

It oxidizes (rusts) around the handles, although the handles are said to be high grade stainless steel.

I suspect the copper used is actually mixed with something else causing this.Other similar copper products from Calphalon, which I also own, show a complete different behavior.

I am a huge fan of these works, and I highly prefer the versions of the Der Schwanendreher (Albany Records) and Konzertmusik (Old Louisville recording) by Raphael Hillyer, and the Kammermusik by Kashkashian. This disc is about equal in quality to the Brett Dean recording of the Hindemith Concertos (with Queensland Symphony Orchestra), which is equally lackluster. Overall, these interepretations are somewhat unimaginative. I missed the quicker tempos of the fast movements heard in the Hillyer versions, especially the 3rd movement of the Konzertmusik and the last movement of the Der Schwanendreher. The tone quality in the Kashkashian Kammermusik is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch does not match product description","review":"This watch looks pretty good but is a lot shinier than it appears in the photos, with a lot of chrome all over. The \\"unidirectional rotating bezel\\" does not rotate. The links on the band are not uniform along the edges and give a low-quality appearance.

I've never used Act before, and thought this would be a great book to start with. I read the whole book cover to cover in about 2 hours! 90% of the pages are full of screen shots. It glossed over synchronization, and also use with a Palm Pilot or CE device. If you are purely a user that wants to make ACT work at the most basic of levels, I guess this book would be OK.

Many of the tracks are very powerful and make you want to get up and move. Franka Potente has a beautiful voice and her tone matches perfectly with the fast paced drums and bass.I really enjoy the way this soundtrack features all the music from the movie along with extra remixes. I felt like I got my moneys worth from this CD and highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lola rennt und zwar schnell!","review":"I just saw the film in a DC sneak preview and the music is still pumping thru me.

While first listening to the CD, it was missing something without the film, but has since taken on a life of its own. This really is great techno music - I've been looking for stuff like this for years. The only downside is that many of the tracks on the CD are remixes - I guess I was hoping for a few more original pieces.. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"techno-r-us","review":"if you like techno, this is a good choice.

I knew I had to go find the soundtrack.I was not disappointed. This is a great album. The peak is at the beginning (\\"Believe\\") and the second half (remixes of the first half) gets a little repetitious, but it's still just the thing to put on when you need a little lift.I carry it in my CD case wherever I go. Try it on a long drive, or at the end of the working day. It's not hard to imagine Lola running away your fatigue (whoa, sorry, got a little cheesy there).Anyway, if you like electronica or are looking for a good high-energy disc, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Stuff but a bit repetative","review":"Loved the film, loved the music. The first track in particular - 'Believe', this is very much like the early 90's euro-techno crossed with Madonna's more dancy stuff but more sinister, a real quality track, but the next few although worked great in the film, were a bit samey when standing alone, the re-mixes were good, but just that - remixes. However I would give this soundtrack 4 stars for the first track alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast","review":"This is some fast music.

I bought this CD cheap, but when it came the tracks just wouldn't read. I have to skip tracks forever and then one will kick in for a while. There is nothing wrong with my player, just this seller. I didn't try to get another due to the price I paid, but maybe I will now. This is one of my favorite movies/soundtracks of all time. It is an introduction to the knowledge one will store exponentially from life experience, as long as they live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I usually can't abide techo/electronica music.

Now that I've finally located a copy, I'm not disappointed. As other reviewers have said, this is excellent music for exercise. I'll probably be using this in some of my fitness classes.Some tunes, like \\"Running Two\\", are evocative of tracks from Underworld's Dubnobasswithmyheadman. \\"Rock Me\\" by Pills reminds me very much of \\"Around the World\\" by Daft Punk, and Sun Electric's \\"Introduction\\" makes interesting use of backbeat and dub techniques.If you like electronica or experimental trance, you'll probably get a kick out of this CD. Check it out, but make sure you also see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD","review":"This is CD is great, and the music is very fast paced. I think if you seen the movie, it makes it even better. The only downside is that the songs repeat--just different remixes. The first 5 songs I enjoyed the most, the rest not as much. But is it a good CD, especially if you are driving on a highway. Anyway, I recommend it:):)"},{"rating":"1","title":"liked the movie, not the soundtrack","review":"Repetitive like Moby=OK, but the same repetitive song done with slight variations on several tracks? No thanks! I really liked this movie because of its creative \\"alternative outcomes\\". The main song on the soundtack rocks. The only problem is that there are not enough songs in the movie to warrant a full soundtrack. To overcome this, some genius decided to fill the CD with too many remixes of the same song; thereby ruining it for you forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and invigorating","review":"A really great CD that literally propels you into a state of energy and excitement.

Very good soundtrack! I couldn't resist moving to the beat. There are a few songs that repeat with different remixes, but I like remixes. My one complaint would be about track #8 (Somebody Has To Pay). It doesn't really flow with the rest of the CD. I love the earthly sound of the song Casino. Overall, it is a good CD to shake your groove thing to. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I was a clearing, no secrets left inside...","review":"The 'Run Lola Run' soundtrack is perfect for working out, in my opinion. I could definitely run laps around the track at the gym to this kind of music, because it's very upbeat and fast. And if you've seen the movie, then you'll have an image of Lola running, so it's very inspiring. Yes, it is repetitive as some other reviewers have pointed out, since a lot of the tracks are different remixes of the same thing, but if you're doing something else to the music, you won't notice it too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pharmacutical corporation in dirty dealings shock","review":"This book is initially quite a complex and interwoven story dealing with a series of characters and situations connected with genetics and pharmacuticals. Each of these develops into an absorbing amalgamation of the central theme and until the middle of the book this works and I certainly couldn't put it down. A smattering of the occult graces the pages from beginning to end and this may be enough to get you through but by the end a familiar and somewhat cliched parody of many books of the same ilk becomes evident.

It survived being at the bottom of her backpack. You can bring it to the pool and anywhere else that you want to. It does not skip very much. It is strong and it is worth your money. It also has great headphones that are not heard by other people. Sony makes the best Sport Discman. This is the best discman that you can get because it is high quality. You will love it.

I've had it for about 2-3 years and all the features are really excellent. The headphones are nice and it's generally easy to use. A few months ago the LCD screen started to go, which was a big pain because it is really hard to adjust the volume and the what song you're on. One day I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't go. I tried new battteries, hooking it up to the wall, etc. It just died. Now I'm really mad because it was expensive and only served 2-3 years. Come on Sony-this is just cheap!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good CD Player....until it breaks!!!","review":"I had an updated version of this Sport CD Player (the one that was out as of 11/00)..I give it two stars rather then ONE because it did have a lot of power (volume) and the thing really didn't skip while jogging...BUT it eventually gave out after only 7 months of using it. This is a [expensive]CD player....and to fix it was going to cost an unbelievable $150!!!! It needed a new laser.

I found this novel to be confusing from the outset. He introduced too many characters and had them not only all talking to each other - but Rechy would also throw in tidbits of feelings and why this person felt the way he did. I found it difficult to keep track of who was talking to who! It seemed the entire book consisted mainly of these 4 people talking, talking. Too me the story didn't move anywhere. I finally started skimming the pages looking for something more that the unending conversation. Finally I read the last chapter in which the same characters were still conversing!

Because this is DeCaf, you won't feel more alert after drinking it, but it will warm you up if you are outside or cold. The coffee will stay fresh for at least several months with refrigeration, making it ideal for when company turns up in large numbers and a bunch of them are likely to say they just HAVE to have Sanka - OR ELSE!BOTTOM LINE:This is very reasonable to keep around the house, especially when you use it as a secondary beverage. If you drink this regularly, try either Sanka Ground Roast or Colombian Supreme DeCaf from Maxwell House. There are usually coupons for this product, and many supermarkets will double them.

Henry Doktorski's performance is indeed breathtaking. It is as if someone were transported back to the days when Guido Deiro himself was performing these songs. Guido Deiro was a recording pioneer who he became the first star piano-accordionist, the first piano-accordionist to perform on the vaudeville stage, and to make sound recordings(I've got at least two of Mr. Deiro's old Columbia 78 RPM records at home). In fact, Guido became the first person to coin the phrase \\"Piano-accordion.\\" You'll find plenty of good stuff about Guido in Mr. Doktorski's liner notes on the two-CD set as well as on the GuidoDeiro.com website. Mr. Doktorski's sparkling performance certainly does Mr. Deiro's songs justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accordion as you have never heard it!","review":"Guido Deiro was the first virtuoso of this much maligned and very difficult to play instrument. An accomplished composer and recording star, Deiro was a hughely popular in Vaudeville. The liner notes reveal his marriage to Mae West and I enjoyed the vintage photos. Henry Doktorski plays Deiro's compositions with great technique and every piece is a revelation of what the accordion is really capable of when played by a master musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Can Relate To","review":"Death is a tragic event that many people react to in many ways. Grandad Bill's Song does a wonderful job at relating how different relations to Grandad Bill react to his death. The words are not only poetic and filled with emotion, but also accepting to however one feels. The illustrations capture how full and rich one's life is with \\"snapshots\\" depicting different characteristics of Grandad Bill. Grandad Bill's Song is a book that can be used with children and adults both to help in the grieving process of a death of a loved one. The book discusses different emotions, shows the different relationships to the characters in the story, and offers comfort and validation to the feelings of the different characters. Additional explanation should be used with this book to clarify who is speaking.

I'm just outraged that this book was published in my favorite series. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Portraits of Freedom: 14 People who came out of Homosexuality","review":"This book is very well written and inspiring.

I have become so attached to the Pritchard, Dunphy, Tucker clan that I record the repeats to enjoy over and over again.The cast is perfect; you never think of them as actually \\"acting\\".

If you haven't had a chance to check out this gem, please don't deny yourself any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season Two Just as Good as One","review":"This show remains one of the big pleasures of sitcom television. Wisely, its creators keep the focus on what worked on season one, that is the everyday hilarity of being family members to this extended nuclear family. Last year my favorite couple was Cam and Mitch, the gay guys. This year I have to say that the daughter and Phil come into their own. Phil especially takes deadpan comedy to totally zany hilarity. He is especially funny whenever in the presence of his father-in-law Jay, who can turn him into jelly in less than five minutes. Jay's Colombian wife Gloria remains very funny as well along with her son Manny. When Jay finally gives in on getting Manny a dog, it is a real high point. This show stays tightly focused on these characters inside the family, getting the comedy out of every interaction. This is its genius: never straying off point or far afield from its premise of showing the comedy of modern family life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good easy going comedy","review":"It is great to watch something during the day and relax a bit since it lasts only 20 min aprox."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blu-ray price is $10.00 cheaper than the HD instaant Video price!","review":"Why is the HD instant video price ($39.99) $10 more than the actual HD Blu-ray season 2 ($29.99).

The DVD case is really cheap, made cheap, very flimsy, smells like chemicals, and it doesn't even properly keep the disks in place (the disks keep falling off).What's worse, the disk doesn't work properly. It stops every other minute and drives me nuts.I love the show. I really do. I was so excited to receive the DVD... But the quality of the disk, its prints, its case...

I love the show, and since it is not on Netflix and I am a poor college student, I decided to purchase it for less on Amazon.com. I was extremely excited when I popped in the first disc, only to learn that it was \\"unrecognized\\" by the player. Not wanting my disappointments to get the best of me, I thought positively and inserted the second disc. It worked to my enjoyment and I watched all the episodes on that disc. However, when I put in the final disc of the season, it also was unrecognizable. So in short, I am unhappy that I am unable to watch one of my favorite shows after paying for season 2.Sincerely,Disgruntled"},{"rating":"1","title":"TV In The 10's","review":"Pathetic and unfunny.

The heterosexual male is the weakest link of the show which is typical for it's time. The females are all dressed like \\"uniform prostitutes\\", also typical.

Masuda has been through so much, seen so many sides of a tumultuous cultural relationship that most of us will never be familiar with. Unfortunately, I think she wrote the book TOO soon after her experiences, too soon after her liberation and life shifts into the political rights movements. Her writing comes across very naive and childish. Should she decide to edit and re-release this book 20 years from now.. I think it's ability to open people's minds would be astounding.I know she is doing great things for the world and I truly hope that, even though I did not think this book's quality of writing was that high, that she writes another book soon. Her content is extreme, it is real and it is something that people need to be exposed to, especially in the Western world.

A couple of crusty surveyors and a native are working to map a new planet. Things are not all as they seem, however. The native is constantly fining the off- worlders for the degradation to the planet. The off-world survey might harbor an ulterior interest for the government.Willis' comedy here is, like a lot of her stories, true screwball. That means a battle of the sexes, with misunderstandings and misrepresentations. I'm told that this type of humor is an acquired taste, which may explain some of the comments I've heard from people who say Willis' stories don't do anything for them. Personally, I can't get enough of them, and have to find other authors to fulfill that need during the months it takes Connie to write another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After reading some of Connie Willis' other books, I must say that this book was very disappointing to me. After finishing this book it didn't even enter my mind once like Doomsday Book and Bellwether did. It was very confusing and it didn't seem like the plot was going anywhere. Like another reviewer said, I didn't know that Fin was female until almost the end of the book. The reason that this isn't just one star is that the book was funny, especially the character Bult so I could enjoy the book a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Personal Narrative","review":"I am in agreement with Mr. Hall. (The reviewer from Sierra Vista obviously has issues.) The thing that strikes me so much about this book is the sense it gives you of how important life is--not just the importance of being alive, but of living life with a purpose. Death can come to any one of us at any time. Live life earnestly, love earnestly, and rejoice that you have a place in the universe. This point is made with great PERSONAL power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 1 = 0 stars!

The quality and weight of the material is excellent. The fit and finish are also very good.I don't like the logo on the pocket and I always cut them off.I mostly wear XLT short sleeved which fit me well. However, the long sleeved XLT henleys are too big in the shoulder. This is somewhat disappointing.

So four stars for a great shirt with a bad fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Size Too Big","review":"These Henley Tees are at least one size too big. I wear XXL in virtually every other shirt on the planet, but even after a wash, the XXL was big enough for Shaquille O'Neal and then some.

It's too bad, because they seemed like a decent quality shirt, but I had to send them both back. I'm prone to try one size down, but I often wear shirts not tucked in.

This is NOT a biography of John S. Mosby, though. It is a biography of the unit, with special attention towards the leader. The depth with which Wert has researched the individuals in the group provides a clear picture into the inner workings of the Rangers, and the civilians living within Mosby's Confederacy. The book was gripping, especially for someone who grew up and lives on the edge of Mosby's Confederacy.I would warn others, though, that the lack of maps (Only one at the beginning of the book that charts all of Northern Virginia), can lead to confusion about the whereabouts of the Rangers, their adversaries, or allies, as well as the general positions of the people when in conflict. This is a let down to me since Wert included many maps in \\"Longstreet\\" to help transplant people to the Tennessee and Virginia battlefields, but I had to rely on my own knowledge of the area for Mosby's Rangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I found Mosby's Rangers to be a very interesting book and it is now one of my all-time favorites, Wersh gave very a detailed history of Mosby's life and his actions as a guerilla raider in the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Mosby","review":"Jeffry Wert's book on John Mosby's adventures reads like a great novel.

I have read all of the books on Mosby and while the others are good, this one was the most entertaining.

The text is poorly organized and often times repeats its self to the point that reading it becomes more than a chore.

The examples of studies provided are followed up by biased remarks in parenthesis such as \\"women are just as inclined to particiapte politically as men are (if not more)\\".

Food safety is food safety; but when you buy a book on the subject; you want one which is applicable to you. The book is narrowly focussed on the U.K. food industry. Beyond the geographical location; the book lacked depth. Short paragraphs (which made for an impressive Table of Contents) provided no substance.

Napoleon was a representation of a shift in the governing order whose rule was once largely regarded as a matter of divine right. Though no believer in democracy (as exemplified by Britain), he supported and nurtured people of proven talent both in the military and civilian spheres.Yet notwithstanding his considerable talents and intellect, it was Napoleon's own egotism and the seemingly unending years of war from 1803 to 1815 that led to his own undoing.I confess I felt deeply sympathetic about Napoleon in his later years (in particular, the post-Waterloo era when he was exiled on St. Helena island, where he was treated rather shabbily by the British governor there). At his best, he was a master military commander on both the strategic and tactical levels.

Why Eddie occasional flubs the lyrics this far into the tour is anybody's guess, all but completely destroying \`Soon Forget,' but it could have been the band were not entirely comfortable in this tiny offshoot of Yugoslavia, as Eddie's closing comment (\\"Be safe.

It's certainly an instrument that doesn't have many recordings to its name.I can't imagine what would possess the negative reviewer to be so bitter - maybe they are some sort of sick perfectionist? My only qualm was that at times (when the bassoon had its solo with a high tempo) it was too easy to hear the clacking of the valves.

Not so here.Take a chance on this CD and you will hear, not just a talented female slide guitarist, you will hear a guitarist and singer and songwriter whose artistic depth (staying in the slide zone) reminds me of Lowell George.

If you want really strong tea, then (in my opinion) follow the package directions. I have had to water it down a bit because the peppermint oil is a bit too strong for my system. The bag is huge and a little really goes a long way. I am sure this will last for several months. Be sure to by a nice tea infuser - this is the best way to enjoy this tea.

To me, a decent 5.1 mix is a deep full sound with a sound stage that puts you on site. This DTS recording is tinny and flat.

However, if you are a highly sensitive audiophile, pass on this DVD. The sound mixing is an embarassment to any professional. Sub-standard doesn't describe the sound mixing on this DVD. It's so bad some instruments are barely audible, and Sheryl's voice is set at a lower level than the drums at times.

As a Jew interested in the history of Israel, Itzhak Gurion's book opened my eyes to the harshness of British rule in pre-Israel Palestine, showing how they ruled with an iron hand, not to mention the gallows. But in addition to making me aware of how intense was the struggle for a Jewish homeland, even after it has been promised by the British in 1917, it made me reconsider my view of the British Empire, and how it was maintained. It brought into focus the struggles of not only the Jews in Palestine, but the plight of other British subjects, such as the Irish, the Indians or the South Africans, and their treatment.The book was well organized, written in an easily understandable manner, and in my opinion, well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"well...it works","review":"Not bad.

Throughout the book, Simon runs into many conflicts and works through to problem solve. The problems that Simon and his companions run into, are simple and don?t need much thought for the characters or the reader. The time period and setting in this is very interesting because it?s not modern time but in the 1800?s. Turkey walks and sales for them actually existed in those days and it was amusing to read about what it would be like to be in that time of the history.

The language especially dated the book to the 1990s instead of the 1860s when the story was supposed to take place. Aren't we past treating Native Americans as Noble Savages? Would people of this era use the expression, \\"the bottom line\\"? By 200 miles it was too annoying to listen any more. Book editors are supposed to help authors fix problems like these.

The swiveling jaw faces have a rugged griping surface with a relief in the middle that will accomodate a round or irregular object. After buying and using this clamp I bought the 2.5 inch model. There is a one inch clamp too. The ISD feature is used also in a line of bar clamp/spreaders of which I have two and will soon get two more.

To others it might not mean much of anything. But regardless of wether you care or not, the music contained in these double live albums is nothing short of inspiring. Pearl Jam have always been known for their dynamic live performances and on the Katowice Poland show(#16), they give you everything that makes a rock concert great. Of the astounding 30 tracks which spans their entire career, there are rarely heard songs like \\"Soldier of Love\\", \\"I Got Id\\", and a blistering version of \\"Leaving Here\\" wich I believe is worth the price of the discs themselves as well as great performances of classics like \\"Alive\\", and \\"Black\\".

Buy this if you doubt that Rock still exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best since \\"Ten\\"","review":"This is a strong album from Pearl Jam, their best since \\"Ten,\\" in my opinion. There's a nice mix of slow and fast songs. The lead guitarist (who I believe is Stone Gossard, playing a Gibson) has some ferocious but economical lead lines somewhat reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane's Jorma Kaukonen, circa JA's \\"Bless Its Pointed Little Head\\" album. Gossard's playing adds new excitement to well-known songs like \\"State of Love and Trust.\\" The album is, at about 2 hours 20 minutes,over two compact discs, also incredibly long; I have rarely been able to listen to the whole set at a single sitting. There's also a fair bit of guitar noodling between songs, which suggests to me that the guitarists could have been allowed to \\"let it out\\" a bit more in the instrumental sections of the songs. Certainly, long-form tracks like \\"Sleight of Hand\\" gain power by their slow increase in musical drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Little Gem","review":"I'm listening to it for the first time right now and I can already tell it's going to be beautifully unique. With only 1000-odd in the crowd, the band seem a lot less nervous and in a more relaxed and playful mood. This mellowness and passion is effectively exuded in their performance.

He puts a bad name to the bassoon and its capabilities. My suggestion is to STAY AWAY!!!! If you are interested in Vivaldi Bassoon recordings, I would suggest finding any recordings by Klaus Thunnemann or Milan Turcovik.

Together, as a side project, they formed Derek + The Dominoes, recording one album together, \\"Layla + Other Love Songs\\", (1970), before Duane died of massive head injuries in a 1971 motorcycle wreck. (I've hated motorbikes ever since. Damnable death-traps!)The Allman Brothers themselves rank as my favorite American band. Today's lineup of the ABB (2010) is very, very good.

It was virtually co-authored by Veronica's grasping stage-mother who used her as a meal ticket and who also sued her for support once the money dried up. Miss Lake's real problem was alcohol and this book's dubious (and central) theme that she was a paranoid schizophrenic does not seem based on medical fact. The authors provide no proof of this 'diagnosis' -- only hearsay -- with Veronica's redoubtable mother as the only reference. The real truth about this beautiful, tragic actress who was more sinned against than sinning remains to be told, and sadly, may never be. Miss Lake's own autobiography \\"Veronica\\", while glossing over a lot, gives a much better sense of her as a person -- flawed, alcoholic, but seeking only love and peace of mind in a much less enlightened world than today."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this thing get published?","review":"I will keep this short and sweet.

The handle to lift the bucket was broken and a rivet on the bucket was missing. It was easier for me to fix this with a small bolt, epoxy and wire than to return it. Once fixed it is a little front heavy when the bucket is up so it tends to fall foward. I need to add some weight in the back end. Other than this the design is simple, which is good, and somewhat sturdy. However, I do not know how it would handle functioning as a bulldozer with a heavy hand.

Yet Ginastera's three quartets can hold their own amongst this dignified company. They are each from a different phase in his compositional career: the first from his early nationalist phase, in which Stravinsky and Bartok loomed as models, the second from the beginning of his expressionist period in which Berg was the dominating influence, the third from his final avant-garde phase. In the last quartet Ginastera uses many avant-garde techniques of his day, including aleatory passages and semitones. He also, borrowing a page from Schoenberg's second quartet, includes a soprano voice in some of the movements. Though I had never heard of the Lyric Quartet before buying this recording, they have a fine sound and give an admirable recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really starts great conversations even with teens","review":"I love this game because it gets the family truly communicatingThe game itself is not that great but it is just a way to get to the cards which start the conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst \\"academic\\" book in history","review":"I read this book while an undergraduate when I took a course in urban politics.

There is also the problem, still in the first chapter, of time. Maybe a better educated person than myself could sort this out but I do not know enough to get past the errors.

More like a coma!","review":"If Mendeleyev had the opportunity to read this... boy would he dream. It has to be the best cure for insomnia I've ever stumbled upon. There is far too much history and not enough Mendeleyev or periodic table - the reasons I bought the book in the first place. At two thirds of the way through, the only things keeping me going are sheer willpower to get to Meneleyev's cameo role and the fact I've cheated and flicked to the end so I know I'll get to it eventually. Definate thumbs down for anyone wanting to know more about the elements but fine for anyone wanting to know what inspired the research. Chemistry fascinates me... this book does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inexpert Review","review":"As someone who loves popular science and history, but who is neither a scientist nor a historian (I'm an illustrator), I found this journey, culminating in Mendeleyev's insight, to be one of the most engrossing and eye-opening books I've read in quite some time.Reading the other reviews above reinforces my belief that the more one knows about a subject the harsher (and more fussy) the criticism. Though some of the negative comments may be deserved, I nevertheless recommend this as an imminently readable history of the personalities who sought to uncover the secrets of the elements. I'm convinced that if science education were supplemented with the kind of engaging narrative backstory contained in Strathern's book, non-science-minded students would take a much greater interest in learning molar masses and balancing chemical equations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slap Dash","review":"Mendeleyev's Dream continues a disturbing recent phenomenon post Sobel's \\"Logitude\\" of apparently hurriedly pulled together science history books.Catch phrases like \\"must have seen\\" or \\"surely would have felt\\" are evidence of hasty writing substituing for solid research. One last bug: what is it with publishers these days? So many travelogues without maps...and here an entire book essentially about the construction of the periodic table...with no periodic table? A little more care and preparation would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses a bit of credibility at the end.","review":"I thought this was a quite engaging book until I neared the end, and the author's science started to get a little sketchy. His description of why warm Coke is fizzier than cold Coke seems to be wrong, and in the final chapter about Mendeleyev, there are a couple of mistakes, such as confusing bismuth with boron, and a bizarre confusion between uranium and indium, which looks like it needs explaining.

The PIF errors are almost nil, which is superb. As a comparison, the batch of Ritek +R's that I got a few months back from Amazon have PIF errors of 20-100+ at the end which is not good.

These discs are just not as reliable as the MCC discs that Velocity was shipping last year.It seems that these discs have a decent burn rate, but you can tell that the manufacturing is just not quite up to spec.Additionally, my DVD-recorder/VCR (AKAI, Lite-On) can not recognize the OR8 Discs. So far everything else, Sony, Memorex, TDK, Ridata, Phillips, and OLD Velocity have worked great.My LaCie dvd burner (external) and Lite-On drives on the PC have no problems except that it can only burn the media at 4x, not 8x as stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Were Great...Not Now","review":"I bought 200 of these last year and Every disk was good.

It's bad of me to be cliche, but you really cannot understand what it's like to be able to move your head and have it naturally correspond to the movement of your player's head inside the simulation until you do it. Tasks that require rapidly looking around a cockpit in an airplane become extraordinarily easy, and it frees up whatever control is normally bound to head movement, usually the numpad or an extra hat switch on a joystick.It may be hard to locate a TrackIR 4, mine came on the market gently used after I'd been looking for some months. Additionally, some fiddling is required with the settings, but it's easy and reasonably intuitive to set up the software to read your head movements correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor documentation and no support","review":"I followed the setup, everything seemed to work.

I've been playing the ukulele for about 2 months, and was looking for something to really accelerate my progress. In particular, I was hoping for good instruction on right-hand technique.I really enjoyed learning the split strum. Unfortunately, although the section on right-hand strums covers the basic split strum slowly and in detail, all of the variations and embellishments are explained outside the context of the basic strum, then shown in context only at full speed. This made it very difficult to figure EXACTLY out how to incorporate embellishments such as the initial double strum, the thumb roll, etc. into the context of the basic technique. It would have helped tremendously if each new element was shown slowly and in close-up (in useful context).The DVD format has tons of data capacity and potential for a great instruction disc. Why not at least have a section where each technique is shown in slo-mo?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall 2 stars","review":"With all honesty I was hoping that I could trust the fellow reviewers of this product, unfortunately my opinion differed that than the majority who like it.

Honestly it felt as if this was a rushed course that had a deadline.

The plot moves along at a very nice pace - fast enough to keep the reader interested, but slow enough that we can pause to take in the intricacies of the alternand ate history-type world as well.

I have read several books about the subject, go to a real estate investment club once a month, and bought a duplex two months ago. Learning how to invest WISELY in real estate takes time and is a constant learning process. There are many specifics you need to know about investing in real estate, and I do not think this book covers them. You definately cannot jump in head first by just reading this book. I do not think he wrote this book with the mindset of educating beginners, I feel like he wrote this book for himself to understand, not the general public.

Well, most of the companies you invest in will use debt for you let alone trading on margin. Furthermore, he fails to realize that not all stocks have giant swings.Thats just what he fails to mention. On top of that, some of the numbers he does use are needlessly exagerated. A 400 dollar paint job? Wake up Dolf, unless your hiring illegal immigrants I dont think thats going to raise property value much.I think the author does make some good points... but his distortions make me extremely wary, if im investing in property i dont want the glitz and glamour I want to know the risks in order to make an informed decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Estate Riches","review":"This was the first book I ever read on real estate, and at the time, I found the book to be very motivational and enjoyable to read.

Yes, some ideas of his are enlightening, but I could no more apply for an investment mortgage now than I could before reading this book.

One week after buying this book I refinanced my duplex so as to buy 2 additional properties which would bring in the equivalent of my current working salary. To be clearer, in one week I have doubled my salary but the second half of it is mostly tax-free. If you find nothing compelling in what I have just described then buy another book (perhaps something on the stock market?), but if you want to create a similar situation for yourself, then this book is invaluable.

For the nuts and bolts, there are many other books. For the formula that turns it all into gold, Dolf is your alchemist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Dad taught this fellow well.","review":"I have read several of Kiyosaki books, listened to his audio tapes and I always end up asking myself... WHERE'S THE BEEF. All of his materials are all fluff and no substance. While a part of me thinks he may be sincere in his attempt to educate, he would fail as a teacher. His lesson plans are lacking and leave the buyer struggling so that they buy more of his \\"meatless\\" products making him the only RICH DAD in America"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that it is cracked up to be.","review":"This book is comparable to the Dummy's books. It really doesn't offer any real estate advice that any other book couldn't have given. It was relitively boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'feel good' book with little meat :o(","review":"What a disappointment! The more I think about it, the more irritated I get that I actually shelled out money for this book! The author spent WAY too much time heralding the benefits of real estate investing and VERY little time on actual details. I very much enjoyed Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but Real Estate Riches was a HUGE disappointment! I didn't come away with any new ideas or techniques - I already knew that real estate investing can be lucrative and didn't need to spend ... to have that confirmed. If you must read this book, check it out from the library and save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little substance","review":"This book primarily discusses stock market investing versus real estate investing, but without any serious numbers. While I'm no quant jock, I do want to see something other than assertions without thorough analysis. This book also lacks any useful guide to analyzing properties, neighborhoods, or rates of returns. Overall, I can't see why anyone would buy this book with so many better ones available (e.g., Investing in Real Estate, Buy It, Fix IT, Sell It, and Nickerson's now dated, but still helpful, $1000 into a Million in my Spare Time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Written","review":"This Book is simply a means for you to go onto Dolf de Roos' website and buy more of his \\"products\\". Such as a $3000 Seminar or a $600 software that will \\"help you analyse property\\" (Simply a calculator). There is no substance in this book. I know it is a \\"why to book\\" not a \\"how to book\\". However, If I wanted to learn about properties in New Zealand, I would be living there. THANKS...But No Thanks. I donated this to my public library after reading it....It's definately not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"This book gives you no information regarding real estate what-so-ever. The author goes on and on about how wonderful Real Estate Is. We all know Real Estate is Great, but we also know that it takes money to make money. That is one thing that this author does not understand. We all know that your banker WILL NOT lend you money, unless you have money. This author makes money in book sales and seminar sales. He doesn't make money in real estate. Try buying a HOW-TO book, not a WHY-TO Book. NOT A GOOD READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of substance","review":"The author does injustice to the Rich Dad series. The book's title is horribly misleading. The book lacks substance, and is only a motivational book that \\"touches\\" on why someone should get into real estate. Even if you have the smallest amount of knowledge on how to invest in real estate, do not purchase this book; you can find many other books with greater information.The author tries to upsell his other material in the book \\"for further reading\\" and fails to disclose any useful information about real estate in this book. I speak very highly of the Rich Dad series, and this one does not belong in it; very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comparison!","review":"I reviewed this book earlier, and now just want to add this comment: If you really want a thorough comparison of stocks to real estate, you must read Eldred's Value Investing in Real Estate. Eldred succeeds with specifics of why and how. In stark contrast, Real Estate Riches merely throws out glib generalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max marketing, mini return on investment","review":"Dolf De Roos markets the concept of Real estate well but unfortunately has little more to offer the reader. He shares simple ideas using examples from New Zealand..(one of very few countries not to have capital gains tax on properties)which are interesting but may seem impractical. There are other books by De Roos on Real Estate investing which are more informative and a lot more hands on than this one. The book is still worth a read;just don't expect to retire young or retire rich from the information."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-8e3ae0cd"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/48.md","filePath":"guide/48.md"}'),M={name:"guide/48.md"},P=Object.assign(M,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
