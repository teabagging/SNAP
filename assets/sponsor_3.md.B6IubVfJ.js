I saw this movie with two more friends at 10:30pm and it was amazing, we were scared the entire time....Maybe it's illogical, but it truly scares and makes your heart beat faster, specially the scene when two girls burn...What I didn't like about this movie was the ending, it's very open for continuing with the sequel, but it just leaves you there, without any conclusion, but the rest of the movie is very entertaining, although a little predictable in some scenes, but still good, specially for the way people die.In Chile this movie was rated G!!!

But during that second viewing, one of my friends pointed something out to me that I hadn't noticed, and apparently very few people did.In the premonition sequence, Frankie Cheeks drops his camera and it latches onto the coaster rail, starting the sequence of events that led to the deaths. However, when Wendy gets everybody off the back of the train, Frankie is one of the people that survives, never having dropped his camera.The roller coaster sequence could not possibly play out in the same fashion as the premonition, and theoretically the deaths might not have happened at all without the camera on the tracks.I don't understand how this could go overlooked by the hundreds of people that produce and edit a movie. That glitch has the possibility of rendering the entire movie pointless, and nobody seemed to notice it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose your fate feature is missing","review":"The choose your fate feature is missing from this Bluray even though it is ADVERTISED on AMAZON and on the case too.

In fact, it was so disappointing, I almost wanted a refund, but chose to watch the remainder of the film to see if it could redeem itself. I was mostly wrong. While some of the death scenes were entertaining, there was too much predictability and the acting (with the exception of Merriman) was horrible.This is truly mindless murder fare that should be playing in the background of a party and not the central focus of your movie watching evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people died!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"SOMEPEOPLE DIEDJUST HORRIBLEI BOUGHT THIS MOVIE TO WATCH IT WITH MY UNICORN, BUT WHEN I SAW WHAT WAS IT ABOUT I BROKE THE DVDANGRILYBOB THE REVIEWER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Destination 3","review":"I like the Final Destination movies.

You know, snotty girls, jocks, emos, etc. I swear you almost cheer for them to get killed, and wow do they get killed in cool and new ways!

Ms. Cole does a brilliant job crafting this fine tale and takes the time to bring you up to date on some of the favorite characters from A Hunger Like No Other and Playing Easy To Get (although, I am still dying to find out who blooded Murdock--maybe we'll get a sneak peek in the next novel).

I would sit up all night reading one book because I could not put it down. No matter how much I thought I could guess what would happen next or how hard I tried I was blown away each time.

Gripping Hand's storyline is convoluted and confusing at many points, the characters, some of whom are from T.M.I.G.E. are completely uninteresting and droll or have become so in transition from Mote to Hand. Obscure and boring references to the history of Asia Minor did not help. A poor sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gripping, Really a Letdown","review":"As a sequel to \\"Mote in God's Eye\\", and this was immensely worse. Moties have no reason to fight over the second Alderson point; they should take the resources and get some distance. There goes that plot.... Decent to low quality space battles, but no real reason to fight them. Ending was more of 'we've written a bunch of stuff and run into a deadline, here's a point to stop' than a real resolution.I've read Niven by himself and liked it. I've read Pournelle by himself and liked it. What happened here? I don't know, but the convoluted hand-waving over why the Moties are fighting and repeated inclusion of random sexual-type scenes (maybe to try and keep reader interest, since the story and characterization were failing?) just didn't work for me. Female characters get the stereotype 'dumb girl' treatment.A book I will be donating to the local library sale. Not recommended. Hated how authors I normally enjoy couldn't write a readable book together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing in light of its predecessor","review":"It pains me to confess that I was very disappointed with the Gripping Hand especially because I really enjoyed The Mote in God's Eye. The Mote was a classic work of Science Fiction, one which has all the elements of a great book. It is gripping, exciting, intriguiing and internally consistent - a real page-turner. The sequel on the other hand, is boring and trivial. The characters are cardboard cutouts who lack depth and intellingence. The story is boring and captures none of the original excitement - we don't get to learn anything new about the Moties or their civilization.

Every bad thing said in every other review is utterly true, it's not nearly as good as the first attempt by those famous million monkeys with a million typewriters. As a LONG time fan and reader of Niven's works, whose stories led me down fascinating paths of amazing storytelling, fantastic worlds and fascinating characters in my youth, it really does break my heart to realize that two writers who had so much talent and ability to create interesting stories have fallen this far, and I hate that all those great memories have been capped by this. I pray they realize their careers are over and just gracefully retire.

The Mote In God's Eye is one of the great works in SF. The best extrapolation of what an alien race trapped in their own solar system would be forced to evolve into in order to survive. Oh, sorry, I got carried away about a piece of GREAT fiction, not this garbage. Reading the phone book is more exciting.

The book was every bit as good as the \\"Mote. . .\\" The writing was excellent, as I have found in all books by Niven/Pournelle.

I would recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a sequel","review":"I enjoy the work of these two authors, both individually and as a team. But as a follow-up to The Mote in God's Eye this was slightly disappointing. It was that typical sequel which is a bit less exciting than the first book. My expectations were probably too high but in any event they were not completely met.None of this is to say the novel was bad. The characters were well-developed, the created universe was interesting and the Moties were a smart creation by men who know their job and do it well. However, the book had sequelitis and that can't really be overcome.By all means read the book. It is fun and interesting. Just don't expect another The Mote in God's Eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as exciting as the first; Very slow to start","review":"Went with this based on the positive experience I had with the previous book. I found myself plodding along not getting anywhere, all the way to 50% mark of the book. Then suddenly, the plot took off and I finished it. The experience was so bad that I have no desire to check out the supposed third installment, \\"Outies\\". This book is nothing more than a expanded epilogue to the first book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much a completion as an abandonment of \\"The Mote\\"","review":"Perhaps, had I not read this book's predecessor (\\"The Mote in God's Eye,\\"), I might rate it more highly. This book involves the same characters, but they seem to be running in neutral; there are no new science toys, no new cosmology, no new species, little in the way of new culture, nothing to surprise or invite thought. What is here is a trivial resolution of that supposedly-irresolvable conundrum which was the \\"Mote\\" in God's eye, a casual and thorough disregard for the \\"beam\\" it disclosed in our own; and the intriguing new philosophical construct of the title, shrunken down to a simple faith that such trivializing solutions are always possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was easy to put down.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. As a big fan of theMote In God's Eye (I have recommended it to many manypeople, all of whom have thanked me) I was bored to tearswith this book. In fact, I put it down when halfwaythrough and then ended up starting it over because it hadbeen so long. I finished the book only out of loyalty toNiven (I usually devour his books), and out of the hopethat perhaps it would improve. The story line was veryslow to develop, and the ending, I thought was complicatedand difficult to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"a medicore knockoff, not a creative continuation of the great first novel","review":"I just spent the afternoon reading this after feeling mesmerized by the first one, Mote. It was terribly disappointing. OK, perhaps not a pure commercial potboiler, but vastly inferior to the mysteries and utter fascination within the first one.In this, you know the problem: the aliens, by their biology of uncontrolled population increase, are a terrible threat to mankind. But ah, humans have been able to experiment with some of them for decades; the deus ex machina solution that emerges after some spectacular fighting is, to say the least, a letdown. Everything else is needless detail. That makes this a profound scifi dud, lacking the magic of the original.Not recommended, except for uncritical cultists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard sequel fare...","review":"Look, this is a sequel folks, and like nearly all sequels, it loses some of the magical mystery of First Contact. The sequel further explores the question of, do we (can we) blow up the Moties, or do we (can we) negotiate. It's a question that keeps getting repeated over and over again in real life, between warring societies...Just look at Israel now, and the people they consider \\"aliens\\" -- the Palestinians. Only the Moties, with their stratospheric evolutionary and reproductive rates, present the greatest possible risk. Besides that single question, this is more of a flat-out adventure book, with lots more hard SF stuff thrown in... As with the first book, the writing is not literature, or even about the future human society -- it's about the cool aliens..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than The First One!","review":"Unfortunately I had the sequel to The Mote In God's Eye because I gotten both at the same time from the Science Fiction Book Club. Boy was I in for a chore.The Moties were about to escape their system and would be able to do battle with the humans. I just plain thought this book was a bore. I will not be reading anything by these two again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as the original, but good none the less","review":"Oh come on, of course it's not as good as TMiGE... but few books are!!

Man, this made the flight even longer! I could NOT believe that two of my favourite authors could write such a horrible book so I had to read the entire thing, hoping it would get better... It didn't. Looking at the window of the laundry washing machine is more interesting than reading this book. I actually threw it away in disgust - I could have sold it but I did not want to do that to a fellow human being.I'm a huge fan of Niven's earlier work, and like \\"The mote\\" very well; but most of his later work is uninspired and boring, and this one takes the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sequel","review":"A new cast of characters doesn't reduce the quality of this book. The authors recreate an interested and new environment while maintaining good continuity with book 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"The masters of Science Fiction at their finest.","review":"Larry Niven is our modern day Heinlein and Asimov rolled into one. Jerry Pournelle brings a sophistication to writing that is rarely matched even by contemporaries. In this sequel to A Mote in God's Eye, the characters we came to know in the first book go back to the Mote in a desperate attempt to solve the problem that could destroy the only two known intelligent races in the galaxy.

It heats up and cooks evenly and browns up your food perfectly. I bought this to replace a Calphalon non-stick skillet that everything stuck to and was a nightmare to clean. This Cuisinart skillet is a nice weight, not too heavy like All-Clad, and not too light. It is SO easy to clean. The most you have to do is soak it a few minutes, then wipe it out.Advise to other stainless steel newbies, it heats up much faster than non-stick or hard anodized cookware, so watch your heat - high is around 6 as opposed to 10. And you want to use some sort of oil, butter or spray to cook with, and put it a cool pan, not when it's heated up or it will burn onto the pan.I look forward to cooking when I use this skillet and I plan to buy more from this line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Stove","review":"I received this pan several days ago and have waited until I could give it a good workout over in action. I have an electric stove, not by choice,and I've had bad luck before with some pans heating unevenly and food sticking even when I added oil or butter. I used this pan to brown some ground beef, saute onions, garlic and bell peppers. I simply washed the pan as suggested in the handy \\"use and care\\" pamplet included, set it on the stove and turned the heat to medium.

These pans look very nice so I was extremely surprised when one evening my husband and I both heard a loud gunshot in our kitchen and found one of the pans blew a rivet off! I was scared to death! Fortunately I had a splatter screen on, so no one got hurt. I emailed Cuisinart and got no response from them. My husband called them today and they will only replace it if we ship it back to them at our expense. I don't know if it's worth it, it's a heavy pan. If you look at the other rivet on the same pan, you can easily see that that one looks like it's ready to blow off, so I can't use that pan anymore. I'll have to just keep my eye on the other pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I recently received a set of Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless for a gift.

I love the deep sides and the helper handle is very useful. It's difficult to heft for pouring into other containers, but the balance is good if you choose to do this. Please note it doesn't have a lid! I find a lid essential for many situations, but I already had a 14 inch lid from a former pan, and it fit fine. It's a great bargain and performs well - I'm not sure what kind of deal it is if you have to buy a lid seperately. As I've discovered with stainless clad, even heavy fond doesn't stick in cleanup as long as you heat the pan slowly, then crank the heat up to where it needs to be and add the oil or whatever. Otherwise, you get burns that are very difficult to remove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinar Chef's Classic Stainless 14 inch Skillet","review":"What can I say about this pan?

If I had been near it, I could have lost an eye.I called Cuisinart and they paid for me to ship it back (gave me a reference number), said they'd look into it and replace it.Since then, I've seen multiple reports of the same thing.

Overall they are the best pans I've had in many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out","review":"It's a nice looking skillet, the handle works well (staying pretty cool while using it), and it cooks with even heat distribution.However, the coating is very sensitive to heat. After a single use, the inside sides became badly stained, and there were spots on the coating on the inside wall which were marred or slightly pitted. Even after using a top quality cookware cleaner, the stains remained, and of course the blemishes in the finish remain and will only worsen with time and further use.Be very careful with the intensity of heat you use, and the size of the burner. I use a gas stove and the flames can come up the outside sides of the skillet, and even using only moderate heat the result was staining and marring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, inexpensive","review":"The pan is quick to heat and the surface never needs anything but a nylon scourer to clean it up.Have cooked Chinese, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and so on without a hitch.If food didn't stick at all, then it would get a 5 star, but I haven't used a pan yet where that was the case, (at least not for very long).JB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Large Pan! wonderful for those family meals","review":"This is a great stainless pan with an encased bottom to provide good heat transfer. The primary handle stays cool to warm. The secondary handle does get a bit hot.I was looking for something larger than my other pans, and boy this one does it! I didn't realize at the time that this 14\\" pan is giant. It crowds the surrounding burners, so if you want to run 3 or 4 things on the stove at once it is a bit difficult.

I can make up to five small pancakes in it, or finish things like sauces and potatoes very quickly to name a few recent things that have been in the pan. If there is any stuck on food say from something like potatoes with onions and garlic, I just soak it on low for a few minutes and it cleans up very nicely. In fact I seem to need very little oil for cooking things that might normally stick. When heated I can turn the pan down to medium and it holds the heat very nicely.

I bought it because when I tried browning a butterflied pork tenderloin for 6 people in a 12 inch skillet, I had to do it in two batches. Kind of a pain. I have used this 14 inch pan a few times since then. It does a great job of browning chicken breasts in oil even without flour and heats fairly evenly. I agree with other reviewers that the pan does not require as much flame under it to heat it to a good browning temperature. Very satisfactory for the price of about 40 dollars. It has become a little discolored and does not heat absolutely evenly, but these are very tolerable defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised....","review":"I like it a lot.

I guess I'm not as bad as a cook as I thought.Only thing is, it is big and heavy, but I like being able to have that extra room so I can deal with it. I just store mine in the oven.

Ever since we've had it, the doors fall off every time our children play with it. It's a great design, and the kids want to play with it, but they get very frusturated when it constantly falls apart. I would not recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"doors fall off do not stay on","review":"Out of the box the bottom door where the car is to drive up was off we would put it back on and it would pop right back out if opened and closed gently even once. The other doors did the same after a short time of play. Would be a nice toy otherwise but that is a big problem. I bought this toy because of the good reviews don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent toy","review":"The picture on this toy does not do it justice. It's the perfect rocket ship for children age 1 1/2, 18 months, to at least 5. It's very solid, big, has noises (two types) and lights up. It has very few parts and those that are attached to the ship, the doors, come off very easily so they can be attached back very easily. Also, only a few extra parts, like the people and the dog, but they all fit in the rocket so you don't lose them.The only caveat is the alien that doesn't fit in the ship and really is kind of boring looking. My children immediately dismissed it.But really, I can't believe this rocket ship isn't known about more but when trying to do a search on rocket ship I can see that it doesn't show up so finding that it even existed took quite a long while.I'm so glad I found it, as are my two boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality, but simplistic and too heavy for real ACTION.","review":"We bought this toy for our three year old. It is nicely made, but the pieces are kind of chunky and simplistic. (Especially for a boy who has older brothers with cool little-piece toys around.) It seems best suited for a two year old or maybe an oldest child. (Kind of on-par with Fisher Price Little People.) For a boy like mine that wants to actually pick up the ship and fly it around, I would recommend the Rescue Heroes Micro space station. That ship is much lighter and more flyable, the guy is cool and the space station itself is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rocket","review":"Very nice toy.

It looks very durable and very cute! It arrived within a week and I'm looking forward to seeing him open it on Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price.","review":"Both my son (3.5) and daughter (1.5) have enjoyed playing with this toy quite a bit. It is very durable (Have owned it for 2+ years and not broken in any way) with no small pieces to get lost or choked on. There is a volume control (hi-lo) and everything but the alien and his pod fit inside the rocket. Great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Door broke off within a week","review":"This is a beautiful and fun toy, which makes the main door (with interior bed etc.) construction all the more disappointing. It had only one tiny plastic hinge, which broke very quickly.

First of all, the doors fall off easily, so I am frequently re-attaching them. Secondly, the rocket itself is rather heavy and large so it is rather difficult for my 2 year old to lift it and \\"fly\\" it around the room. Otherwise, it's cute, colorful and sturdy for fun imaginative play. I haven't found any other rocket that opens up that is good for little toddler hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy Spaceship","review":"My 4 year old niece wanted this.

Recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"The small hinge for the center compartment has broken off after more than a year (of not much use) - so now that compartment falls out easily. My two year old was also greatly frustrated by the doors that (were meant?) to pop off easily - we had to constantly put the doors back on for him. The toy is also a bit too heavy. Don't like that the dog and the alien are too big to fit in the rover. I wasted over $40 on this toy - disappointed. This one is probably getting donated so it no longer frustrates my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son is now 6...and STILL loves this rocket!","review":"We bought this rocket for our son's 3rd birthday. Over three years later, he still enjoys playing with it! He has always loved the way the rocket counts down and then continues to add cool sound effects as he makes the rocket fly through the air. The astronauts and accessories were perfect while he was younger, though these days he's more likely to use Playmobil or Star Wars action figures as passengers. This rocket has given our youngest child many happy hours of imaginative play over the past few years, and I am so glad we purchased it. I am also impressed by the rocket's durability, despite lots of not-so-gentle excursions. One of the doors came off around a year ago, but I still think that overall, the durability is pretty terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, small and not worth it","review":"We purchased this set almost one year ago. While the rest of the set is fantastic the pillow is small and continues to tear on a regular basis with very light use. The pillow rips on the fine white gauzy block which makes it hard to fix/sew. I would recommend a solid coordinating pillow!The white alphabet sheet that comes with the set is also small for our matress- which I think is standard size. We were not able to purchase additional white sheets as they do not make them but, did get the blue plaid sheets and they are fine. Overall it looks great and we have enjoyed the set over the course of this past year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinch Me single","review":"This single is definately worth having: not only is the title track addictive, but it also features the previously unrealeased song \\"Powder Blue,\\" which is a great song written by Steve Page and Stephen Duffy.

The book gives the impression that 25 pounds overweight is \\"obese\\" and almost a justification for people to be making fun of these teenagers. Take a look at our schools. Not every teenager is a toothpick and the ones that aren't, are not all being made fun of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled Brat, Little Insight","review":"What a spoiled brat! Her parents spend thousands of dollars to send her to fat camp and she does is whine, whine, whine. She lives a priviledged life in New York as the only child of wealthy parents, and she just totally, like, hates it when her parents gently encourage her to eat healthily and lose weight.The book is boring. She does not provide any background, any insight, or any discussion of how she became overweight. She merely describes clothes, food, exercise and a camp romance. She does lose weight, and grudgingly concedes that she feels better when she exercises and eats well.Brat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat camp","review":"um this book came fast but i have to admit, itz very boring. i didn't finish reading it and i dont want to to.. no conflict and very little emotions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A basic introduction to the power and use of light and color","review":"Healing with Color and Light is an easy-to-read examination of the ways color and light can be used to improve our general well being and/or specific physical conditions.

After trying this for a week she has found that not only does it NOT help her sleep, it keeps her FROM going to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works I think","review":"This CD features a man's voice with relaxing new age music in the background. He goes through the usual litany of instructions...stretch the arms, the toes, the fingers, and hold for 5 seconds etc. It is actually a bit difficult to understand exactly what he is saying because the sound quality is quite poor - very muffled. The soft music continues...I once began the CD before I got into bed because I wanted the music to lull me to sleep but apparently the music never makes a solo appearance. After the sleeping instructions end, it is wake-up time and the voice tells us something about getting up. I just get out of bed and off I go. But...coincidence or not, it does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to counting sheep!","review":"As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective. A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I've had difficulty sleeping since my husband passed away and had typically used just a soothing, quiet music type cd to fall asleep to. After reading the description, and in Time Magazine no less, I felt confident that this was going to be a better option than just plain old soothing music. Boy was I wrong. The voice and words Prince uses are lame and the second cd that I choose to purchase with the first, was even more disappointing. It was suppose to be for Health and Fitness. What a \\"crock\\" it is identical, I mean identical to the first, only Prince may say a word or two about how you should eat healthy and exercise. Give me a break,I feel like I was totally deceived and ripped off. I will surely not recommend this to my friends!

You will get the benefit of a nap plus a lot more...including some great ideas and solutions to problems.And, don't miss the second cut, a visualization that will get you into a deep, restful full night's sleep.This has got to be the best [$$] I've ever spend.Way to go Frank!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does Help","review":"Having recently started working graveyard shift I needed some help getting a nap before the workweek started since I need a less than normal amount of sleep and cannot go to sleep in the middle of the day.Speed Sleep seemed like a reasonable risk.After using this product for 2 months I found that the 30 minute power nap portion was only waking me up about half the time at the completion of the 30 minutes, I do wake up 'clean' and even though it is not an exact substitute for a full nights sleep, it does get me through the next night shift.Because I used it most often to get a nap Sunday afternoon when I was not necessarily tired I find that I can get a least a 1 hour sleep in when using the normal sleep program.I do use the relaxation techniques every morning to help get to sleep fast, and they have been very effective.Overall, if you have special sleep needs this can be effective for you, and I recommend giving it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relaxing","review":"I couldn't get past a few minutes with this tape. I was looking for something I could play and have set on 'replay' so that it would be relaxing music all night. But it starts off with a commentator speaking in a voice that wasn't relaxing at all. There was no way that was going to get me in a relaxed and sleepy mood. And if by chance I did fall asleep, then when it began to 'replay' his voice would certainly wake me up again. A soothing voice that began with a guided visualization that led into sleepy music might have worked.

It is no more battery hungry than other digicams. Its image quality is the best I have seen for its 1280x960 resolution with one caveat - many shots taken in \\"auto\\" (the default) or \\"sunlight\\" white balance mode have a bluish cast, presumably put there by overcompensating white balance circuitry. This cast unfortunatley mutes reds, greens and yellows. However, I have found that if you take all pictures in \\"cloudy\\" white balance mode, the cast is removed and the camera produces excellent color. Before you buy any digital camera, I recommend that you visit one or more of the digicam review sites on the web in order to examine sample images from the camera and read the reviews and especially the user comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this camera!","review":"This is a terrific camera, and not having to buy film lets you take pictures where you wouldn't have before (like whiteboard sessions at work). I would recommend getting the Olympus NiMH batteries which last a very long time. They're expensive, but remove the battery hassle. Also a 16mb Smartcard is a good investment. Lastly, a good tripod, since you will be tempted to take low light pictures and it is hard to do without blurring.

I kept the box very clean and even added more litter and baking soda but the smell continued to linger. Once I switched the smell went away.

And since you can't get it out, it sits and rots and becomes disgusting until your cat, via leaving you little presents elsewhere in the house, informs you that it's too stinky for use (I would have realized this myself earlier if I didn't have a covered box with an odor filter).It does flush - IF you break up the clumps before you try to flush. After my first time clogging the toilet with clumps, I learned to let them sit in the bowl and then smash them up before I tried flushing.

Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"litter everywhere","review":"I bought this cat litter at my supermarket. I thought the claims of the product to be odor free and entirely flushable were great reasons to give it a try. It does have a reduced odor - not odor free and is flushable. The material is very fine and a large quantity adheres to the cat's feet (and in the case of my very hairy cat - to the hairs on his back legs). There was litter all over my house after one cat's use of the box. Constant vacuuming - In addition - When you empty the cat box entirely you find that the litter has formed a cement like formation on the bottom of the box. It takes a lot of scraping and scrubbing to get it off. This was alarming because I had been flushing this stuff down the toilet. I only bought one box of the stuff which was good in theory but had too many negatives to continue using."},{"rating":"1","title":"What good is it if the cats won't use it?","review":"So we originally got this stuff for our athsmatic cat, thinking it was her old clay litter & it's overpowering fragrance that was setting her off. Also because that fragrance would get in your nostrils & linger forever.The cats were okey with it at first, but the litter didn;t clup on urine & it has no deodorant, so if you didn;t change the litter daily, the cats would take to urinating & defficating on the floor instead.This stuff is pricey, we have 4 cats, so it's not cost efficiant to replace 3 litter boxes worth of this stuff a day. After we went back to their old litter, the cats stopped using our carpet as a diaper.I'd also like to recommend \\"Nature's Miracle: Stain & Odor Remover,\\" or at the very least pooring rubbing alcohol any plase your cat has peed after cleaning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS!","review":"I've tried this litter and I really disliked it! I've purchased it because it was flushable. That was the biggest mistake. The litter stunk so bad when the cat urinated in the litter. A friend told me it smelt like rotten meat.

Now instead I use Nature's Miracle cat litter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nide idea, poor execution","review":"I have had this wringer for several years now. At first it worked pretty well. Then, as it got older, something in the roller rubber changed to the point where I can hardly use it. The problem is that the handle drives only the bottom roller. The top roller depends on the the pressure and friction of the item being pulled through by the bottom roller to roll at the same rate. The rollers are now either too slippery, or hard, or both so that the rollers don't move at the same rate. That causes the chamois to start to bunch up so it can't be pulled through. The bottom roller eventually slips so much that the chamois just stops dead while the bottom roller slips. This could have been avoided if the two rollers were geared together as part of the design, but they're not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag, bad zipper, Great warranty","review":"I've had this bag for three years and one of the zippers just ripped from the adjointing material.

But after one week the zipper ripped right off the cover. Not at the stitching but 1/8 in. The actual fabric ribbed along the zipper. Talk about cheap material. Like all good jackets this should have been re-enforced around the zipper where it connects to the fabric at least 1\\" in or so. Also I was zipping it up when it ripped. Hardly any force was used.Those camera cases you get at your local department store are 10 times more sturdy and of the price.

I never got a chance to test it out because once I got it mounted on my Delta Megarack (which I like) there were long pieces of strap hanging both behind and in front of the rack just waiting to get caught in my wheel, brakes or whatever. I considered modifying the straps somehow but decided I shouldn't need to do that and could probably do better with another bag. I'm returning it.Another irritating thing about the bag is that when on the rack it remains partially collapsed and does not look like the picture. This is an appearance, not functional issue.I cannot recommend the bag because of the long flapping strap ends. I suppose that it might fit on other racks better but mine is a Delta Megarack and the Delta website description says it fits them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product if you think that it comes with a Seat Post Attachment","review":"1.

Neither was Motown. They just did it for PR. Those young people were just thinking about singing, dancing, partying, doing drugs, and sleeping around. The author used Motown to make money off the book. Notice the title 'Dancing in the Street'. I'm not convinced there is an actual tie between Motown and advancing the civil rights movement besides PR. It's definitely not worth over $10.00 dollars.

He realized the possibilities of his first symphony when he orchestrated it soon after completing the sonata. The outer movements reflect the storm and stress of the time, shortly after World War I and the smashing of the Irish Easter Rising of 1916. The middle movement, in particular, reflects Bax's fascination with everyting Celtic. He creates sonic structures that remind one of the creation of Ireland by the ancient Celtic gods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Applicable for Men Only","review":"Maybe I didn't read prior reviews, but I bought this for a girlfriend that was turning 50, and it is completely written towards men, not women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"I purchased this disc looking for a recording of the J.C.

Sound reasoning is telling the American politicians HOW to get out of the growing catastrophy which faces not only this country but the world.

That is Vienna, Austria at the turn of the century. Hanging over this whole novel is the question of how a city of beauty and imagination could have also been a hotbed of rampant and violent anti-semitism. But what truly sets this novel apart is its brilliant re-creation of the figures of this age: Henry James as a secret reader of potboilers; Edith Wharton the secret writer of pornography; Carl Jung's indiscretions with female patients; and Sigmund Freud's early failures. The author Hill, is at the top of her game though in inverting the Freudian theories of \\"female hysteria\\" and the women characters are strong and appealinq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all, a nice product","review":"I purchased the knight to go with the blue king's horse.

Its about life in the 1900s and a boy's journey on his way to manhood, and about hard work, dedication and being true to yourself. I liked how realistic the book was in regards to horses. The author obviously has a love and a real working knowledge of these animals. I liked the way the boy related to Blue Boy, the horse he chose for himself, and how he took the animal's needs and fears into account when he worked with him. His quiet understanding of what the animal really needed, instead of just \\"breaking\\" him and forcing him to do what was obviously not his calling. Doing what needs to be done, not whining about it, and sucking it up, taking responsibility, no matter how rough things get is what this book is about. I enjoyed it very much, and would recommend it to anyone liking to read about adventure, ranch life, and its a special treat for anyone who loves horses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the very best of the series","review":"What a grand adventure for a 12 year-old boy to work in a real man's job, earning a real man's salary, working for a cattle rancher/trader Mr. Batchlet. Moody skillfully portrays the cast of characters who compose the ranch crew and the owner's daughter Hazel who is a commanding figure in the book and in Ralph's young heart.This is a never to be forgotten look at a old west that was rapidly changing and would soon be forever altered, but here it is preserved forever for our enjoyment and education.But is is more than an interesting story or an enlightening look at a historical time, it is a sotry that reads like a novel, and yet carries the authority of truth while embodying timeless values and demonstrating how character is formed and maintained.A delight for the whole family and as with nearly all of Ralph Moody's books it retains the read-a-loud quality that makes these stories so treasured among those who still read in the family circle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I purchased this for my Kindle, having read it years ago in HS. It has laughs, crises, and poignancy; a coming-of-age and a touch of young romance. I bought it again in paperback for my 11-year-old neighbor. Reading about someone his own age, a real cowboy in real adventures, should hold his interest, and maybe the low-key life-lessons will sink in.It's also a little sad to consider that the epic ride Little Britches takes in 1911 would be an hour-and-a-half drive now, barring traffic; and his ranch and plains are now no doubt tidy little subdivisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, very odd.","review":"Diane Williams has collected a lot of ultra-short stories in this book (most of which are under three pages in length.) Her characters are intriguing, especially given we only read about them for one or so pages. We can learn, in such a short space, much about one aspect of each of her characters. What we learn more of, however, is about Ms. Williams's views on society and how women are treated. Many of her characters are very similar, so much so some could even be the same woman. Is this one of the great works of literature the world will ever see, no, but is it worth reading, yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This is one of those TV Series that should have been left in never to be seen again vault and so don't waste your time and money to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite a deception","review":"This book is quite a deception:* The author basically copied from other books (especially Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger, Theory of plates and shells) even the errors.* There are a lot of errors in the text and equations.For the price the book is sold, one could expect a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump at the opportunity to read this book aloud!","review":"I am a children's storyteller, at my last reading, the children chose this book because of the front cover, and loved it all the way through the back cover.

The story has a wonderful chase atmosphere, a 'froggy' version of the \\"Gingerbread Man.\\" The kids loved the names the Bullfrog was being called as he was gobbling up everything in site: 'Pickle-Skinned Pizza Theif,' 'Canyon-Mouthed Fruit Catcher,' 'Loaf-Liftin Cousin to a Grasshopper.'

Bullfrog Pops did have some pretty clever name calling which my husband and I found amusing. Our young granddaughter didn't understand the humor. The idea of over eating is absurd and unhealthy even for a bullfrog. So the premise for the story is unappealing to me. The name of the first person to chase the frog \\"Starvin Marvin\\" is so unoriginal it almost made me want to stop reading right there. The ending was even weaker than the rest of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not perform as advertised !","review":"Don't buy it.

There are several step-by-step photos that don't have some of the colors added yet because they are showing how the pastel sketches were made! See pg 81 for an example. There are also some extreme close ups which show the natural grain of the strokes to show how the larger image was created. These type of photos are exactly what any reader (beginner or expert) wants in an art technique book. The previous reviewers that didn't bother to read the captions of the photos should be a little ashamed if this is what they were describing. The book also has photos of the finished pastels.

The author connects with the reader on a personal basis, making it feel as if she wrote the story for your eyes alone. I could not put this book down. I had to find out how the author went from such a disturbing and traumatic childhood to being able to write all the pain down and share it with the world.

I have to say that even the most attentive father can forget about the favorite toy when things get hectic (I once left our \\"Knuffle Bunny\\" at a pharmacy).This book is so popular at my daughter's school that they actually had to ban it because the kids were starting to speak in Trixie's baby talk and it was disruptive in the classroom!Mo Willems has an excellent sense of humor and this book is simply a lot of fun.

This is a really fun book. Aside from being so funny the artwork is really cool. There's black and white photos of buildings in the background with cartoon character's drawn on top. It's a really neat effect. There's plenty of things to point out in the pictures to help little ones learning to talk or just for describing what's going on (like a dog being walked, a runner in the park etc.).

After reading numerous 5-star reviews, I decided to go ahead & take a chance... big mistake. My son has the attention span to sit through books with more substance than this one (such as The Giving Tree, The Sneetches, & Frog and Toad are Friends). Knuffle Bunny only has a few words or 1 sentence on each page. The best thing I can say about this book is that the use of illustrations combined with black & white photos is unique. I really did expect more from an award winning book, in fact, I'm returning it. For the price I know I can find something better. By the way, my son didn't act too excited about it either.

After giving Kelsey this book, my daughter told me that DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS (another one of Mo Willem's books) was one of Kelsey's favorite preschool stories. After a week of experiencing the book, my daughter told me how much they like reading it together. However, I believe my daughter is the biggest fan of all! It also includes a little humor for the adults, since all parents can relate to losing or misplacing a favorite blanket or toy. I think this will be one of those books that Kelsey (and her mom) will remember forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best-ever children's books","review":"Every children's book library should contain this book!

Our youngest has a precious bunny that goes with her everywhere, so I thought this would be a good book. I was hesitant to buy it after reading some of the reviews criticizing Trixie's tantrum... so I borrowed it from the library (and then quickly bought our own copy after reading it). First, let me say this is not a preschooler having a tantrum, but a toddler not yet able to speak, so the little girl is really just trying to get her point across the only way she can... any parent who has been through this will appreciate the humor shown by the illustrations.I laugh more each time I read this book to our 22 month old and 3 1/2 year old. The expressions on the cartoon characters are priceless. My kids also LOVE this book. It quickly became a favorite for the younger one; after introducing Knuffle Bunny Too: A Case of Mistaken Identity, that became the favorite of the older one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd LIKE TO RECIEVE IT!!","review":"Purchased end of JULY..

Through these relationships, Judith discovers that in a world of male power struggles, love is complicit, marginal or impossible. The films makes a stunningly coherent indictment of male-dominated society' (National Film Theatre, London)...Valie Export is 'one of the five or six truly original filmmakers working in Europe today who have not been recognized widely and turned into classical \\"auteurs\\" and this is why each of her films seems initially disturbing, jarring, \\"difficult\\"' (Gary Indiana, East Village Eye)...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"The Capture of Constantinople is an interesting history of the disastrous and controversial Fourth Crusade. Written by the monk Gunther of Pairis, it tells of the sacking of Greek Orthodox Constantinople by the Roman Catholic crusaders, casting the abbot Martin of Pairis as a hero. (In reality, Martin was viewed in an ambiguous light for his theft of holy relics from Orthodox churches.) Gunther serves as a kind of apologist for his abbot. The text is engaging and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Repuation for poor reliability","review":"The LCD seduces you at first with a decent display, but components are cheap.

But I wouldn't use it for games or graphics. 1280x1024 maximum resolution and .29 dpi is on the low end, although a contrast ratio of 700:1 is most impressive. The monitor is also very bright, even at its lowest setting. There's only a 1-yr. warranty on it, so there's a chance you might need to replace it after a year or buy an extended warranty from your retailer if available, the cost for which will then have to be weighed against the value of this monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of Information in this book!","review":"The book was well written with a lot of info.

Overall, it is an interesting read, and you'll pick up a few good tips, but ultimately I felt that authors focus on the mechanics of these exercises missed the larger point: remain curious, try new things, meet new people, and you won't have to worry about dedicating time to special mental exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"Basically a book of memory and brain exercises, with a few anecdotes thrown in. I was expecting more about brain function in diverse areas of human endeavor. The title is one of the best things about the book. The exercises are probably effective, but seem so tedious I can't imagine doing them (physical activity has shown this need not be the case with exercise).Worth a magazine article, perhaps, but not an entire book. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not a passive read!","review":"Be prepared to spend a lot of time with this book.

The diagrams are clean with well-written instructions. \\"Helpful Hints\\" appear throughout the book. It ends with a nice bibliography until you can do further research on Zulu beadwork and several blank pages in the back.Sadly the only color pictures are on the front cover.

We explore our classrooms as communties, our school as a community, our neighborhoods as communities, and our larger society as a community. We examine the ways in which respect and responsibility are crucial components in each community and this book allows us to make this concept come alive when we study our government as a community.

I just think it would be nice if Diana Prince changed out of her dress for a more convenient pair of pants (notice her dress never seems to get torn or dirty by the way).

Revisiting these episodes more than 25 years later I am amazed at how poor they are. The show has one thing going for it--Lynda Carter looks fantastic as WW. Other than that, there's nothing. Though Carter's acting grew more assured on CBS, her decision to portray Diana/WW as sarcastic, flippant and bored with crime-fighting is a huge turn off. After about the first six episodes there is virtually no resemblance to the comic book character. It becomes The Diana Prince Secret Agent Show. The direction is dull. The writing strives for more sophistication than on ABC, but it doesn't deliver. Unintentional camp is the result.

I found that despite having a lot of nice extra features, e.g., mp3 player, considerable configurability, the Lowrance fell short in the basics of navigation. The satellite acquisition time took much longer than the garmin, and the lowrance frequently had to update the route. Most importantly, the Lowrance offered navigation information that was incorrect, e.g., left turn where no left turn was possible. Because the Lowrance 350c failed at the basics of navigation (compared to the garmin c340) I returned it. If Lowrance can update the maps/navigation software to be comparable with the Garmin, it would be a unit worth considering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected.","review":"I have had this unit for three years. When going to an address it would do a good job of giving me the best route. When entering addresses, it was not at all intuitive. It could not seem to find many of the addresses I entered. While entering addresses, I would have to press a letter more than once to get it to register. This became worse with time. The unit's power button did not always work. I would have to unplug it from it's power source to shut it down. After 3 years of use now it will only turn on in power saver mode. I have retired the unit and purchased a Magellon. Overall I would say the routing software worked well, but the unit was glitchy. I would not recomend it.

Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences.

On the down side, it has trouble with following a well established interstate, continually directing the driver to get off the interstate and then merge back on. It uses route numbers instead of street names and many 10+ year old pubic roads in the Washington DC area are missing. Detail of the local area is frequently marginal. WAAS works well (usually) but the system is very slow to gain its initial position location - as much as 7 minutes to initial 2D lock, even when starting from the last shutdown location.All in all - to use this GPS, you better know the roads well enough to understand when it is giving you bad directions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Call to Mercy","review":"Seeing Children, Seeing God is a powerful challenge for the people of God to live a life of mercy.

Intensity is one of Janson's strong points, and it shows here. The first movement has an epic sweep to it which is appropriate to the score. Ditto the last movement. The Oslo Philharmonic responds to Jansons's committed direction with gusto! The inner movements are well conceived and played, although the third movement could use more of a sense of repose. Other than that, I would count this recording as standing very high on my list of recommended CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzz.....","review":"Jansons is very much a Tchaikovsky expert, and could likely conduct this work in his sleep. Unfortunately, it sounds like that's precisely what he did during this session. I always thought that, given a bad interpretation, Tchaikovsky could be made to sound overblown, cheaply sentimental, or downright tawdry. But boring? Somehow, Jansons manages to do so. The overly-distant recording doesn't help matters, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tchaikovsky: Manfred Symphony - Jansons","review":"The work, as presented by the Oslo Phiharmonic Orchestra, Jansons conducting, falls far short of this listeners expectations.

Canada seems to have a disproportionately high number of outstanding young musicians and their work is often showcased on CBC. That's where I first heard the wonderful young violinist James Ehnes, and have been buying his CDs ever since. The collaboration of Ehnes and pianist Wendy Chen on this CD is a revelation, especially in the three works by Maurice Ravel. The violin and the piano are so well-articulated- in the sense of being jointed together- that at times the sound gives the impression of a single (not yet invented!) ethereal instrument. So often in recordings of works for violin and piano, the role of the pianist seems to be that of an accompanist. That doesn't happen in this CD which is the best thing I've come across in quite a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So full of errors I don't know where to begin","review":"The pictures in this book are beautiful, the words in the book are so riddled with anti-Catholic non-truths that it makes one question the validity of anything that Mr. Shearing has to say. Early in the book he gives a 'history' of the Catholic faith that I believe he took straight from the pages of one of Dan Brown's novels. Some examples:- Early Christians never believed that Jesus was divine- Constantine founded the Roman Catholic Church and appointed it Popes- The 'brothers' of Jesus started what became the Eastern Orthodox Church- The Church was forced to adopt the idea that Jesus was divine to assuage the 'divine' Constantine.The list goes on and on.I am comforted in knowing that I bought this book used and did not support this anti-Catholic author with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of false information","review":"First of all, this book is very poorly written. It reads like someone whose native language is Pakastani wrote it. Many sentences don't make sense, and many other sentences are contradicted by the following sentence. Much of the historical and musicological information is flat out wrong. The origins of Christian chant described were disproven long before this book was written. Jewish worship is especially misunderstood.

I wasn't expecting Hemmingway, but was hoping for some light entertainment. Unfortunately, just within a few pages, I realized that this is a lost cause. Ms. Goodman-Davies's characters are absurd. No one talks the way Harry or Penny or Jessica talk, unless they are brain-damaged. And I am at a loss of words when it comes to how the character Juan speaks. I doubt that the author has ever talked to or knew a Spanish-speaking person.The character Harry uses the words \\"dude\\" and \\"man\\" excessively, because he is from Los Angeles. And the author's endless references to \\"JAPs\\" and \\"WASPs\\" were truly nauseating.

I pulled this album out of a bin on a whim and have been delighted with the decision ever since.

One of the finest pieces of 20th century music ever written and brilliantly performed by Orbelian. I loved this concerto the first time I heard it and it remains one of my favorites. This is Soviet-era music at its best. Khachaturian loved powerful rhythms and many sections are evocative of locomotives and heavy machinery. Although there is some mild dissonance in the music, it is pleasing and does not detract from the beauty in any way. The concerto is an emotionally charged work with a distinctive Armenian flavor and the second movement is pure poetry.In the Gayaneh Ballet and Masquerade Suite, the Scottish National Orchestra pulls out all the stops and is obviously having a rollicking good time playing these terrific pieces. In addition to his love of rhythm, Khachaturian had a remarkable harmonic sense and these pieces are replete with beautiful melodies and lush orchestration. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Khachaturian's Piano Concerto","review":"This is a fine recording of Khachaturian's only piano concerto and includes the Gayaneh Ballet Suite and Masquerade Suite. I was surprised that I got a new copy of this recording after not finding it readily available anywhere else. The concerto is an unusual piece not often played. There is a mixture of dissonance and awkwardness about it, with a section where whistling, nearly off-key, treats the music like a surreal view of streaky color.This transaction--amazing how fast if arrived.

I contacted Amazon and they re-submitted the order and assured me that it would be a dozen balls, but again only ONE ball. I ended up returning the ball(s) for a refund -- VERY frustrating!!! Amazon's only explanation was that \\"there must be an inventory issue with this item\\". No kidding.I was looking for a nice dozen baseball for my son that had leather, not synthetic covers. There were many to choose from on Amazon but ALMOST ALL of the others had at least one negative review that they had received only one ball, not a dozen. I ordered this particular ball since there were no such complaints, and the fact that it is fulfilled by Amazon and not a third party vendor.

But when I connected it to the old DirecTV receiver, the picture came out extended.

Tanyel and Brown, not soloists on their day off but a true piano team, are totally sensitive to Poulenc's mixture of elan and tenderness. They get the saucy bounce of the little early sonata, the stark profundity of the later, greater one, and the time-stands-still sighing of the wonderful Elegie.And, as is not often the case, the two pianos are well recorded, sounding present but pleasant in a large room acoustic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and Authentic","review":"Well designed and categorized by ethnicity.

It is soeasy to follow and written in a way that one could participate in the spiritual practices with an uplifting result.It was good to be able to unmask much of the mumblings of other spiritual paths who oppose Pagan practices. I would venture to say that most of them have never read anything except some of the more fantastical, inflamatory and outrageous diatribes that have no relation to what Paganism is about. I find their practices and beliefs are more in line with Christian spirituality than I ever realized until I read this.

The conductor fully understands the architecture of the score, providing a powerful reading of the first movement ('Babi Yar'), a brilliant scherzo, and then allowing the final three contiguous movements to flow naturally to a stunningly quiet climax. Okko Kamu conducts the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Men of that Orchestra's choral ensemble massed with the City of Birmingham Choir. The choral parts are among the finest on record. And to crown the performance is bass Nikita Storojev who offers one of the most richly glowing interpretations available. Highly Recommended and worth seeking out among the available resources.

When I received it, I almost didn't give it to her because I thought it was so dumb. But I thought perhaps I just didn't 'get it' and gave it to her anyway.

I have always been a label reader and I have done research on many chemicals and additives and know that there are 1000s of KNOWN carcinogens, mood destabilizers, & biological disrupters that are in our food and household products.

The thread is metric and you should use the original screw to match the thread pitch.Problem two: For the panniers I was using.

Hope so. I also hope that sooner than later someone will digitally publish all of Crews' work.

As mentioned in these other reviews it's a great jumble of just-a-little-too-weird characters, unbelievable plot-twists, manic behaviour and the clean, crisp prose that is Crews' signum. He is truly the bastard child of Bukowski, Hemingway and the swedish author Sture Dahlstrom (if such a thing is conceivable?)

I selected these headphones for use where great audio performance isn't a necessity - primarily for watching movies and television programs on my laptop. I don't disturb those near me and the cushy ear pad keeps my outer ear pain-free.Because of the low price I wasn't expecting much but the sound quality is quite good - not great - tonally muddy in places - but dialog is quite clear. I wouldn't listen to music with this pair and expect great performance. But, they are great to throw in my bag with the laptop and tote them around without concern. Not as compact as ear buds, but also not as fragile.I've been using them for a few months, and am pleasantly surprised.

Much of this video is not comedy at all. It is French and Saunders hanging around the BBC office trying to come up with a skit that will work for their new producer. The majority of the film occurs there and they don't ever come up with the comedy routine. I love their work and have howled at all the others in this series, but this one misses the mark. I think part of the problem might be that it relies on humor best understood by people who are actually involved in network comedy. Their experiences with and knowledge of the industry allows them to see humor where the average person does not. Buy ON THE ROCKS instead...you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a miss","review":"If you've purchased and enjoyed other French & Saunders DVDs, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed with this.This DVD features sketches from French & Saunders' 2004 BBC TV series. This series was a departure from earlier series in that it features sketches based on Dawn and Jennifer writing sketches, or rather, doing anything other than writing sketches at BBC Television Centre in London.Whilst there are some funny moments, and Lisa Tarbuck deserves recognition for playing French & Saunders' producer, the sketches are little too close to the truth. French & Saunders have, sadly, just seem to have run out of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have all of her CDs and I have to say this is the best!","review":"Great singing voice, awesome arrangements/production (courtesy of Steve Abbaddo) are the main reasons to pick up this CD. I can't really pick one track as my fave, since I love all of them. There is a reason why Jane has such a loyal following, the fact she is an artist FIRST, making wonderful music for her fans. I commend Varese Sarabande for putting album out in today's musical world that thinks Celine Dion and Mariah Carey are divas. JANE OLIVOR is a true diva!For the person interesting in buying any of her albums for the first time: Think of Jane as a mixture of Streisand and Piaf vocally but with the musical ability of a woman who sings every note like it meant her life in the balance. You cannot just listen to her songs, you melt to them.Am I sounding too biased? NO! I really feel that she is the best female singer around!Thanks Jane for coming back and putting out such a wonderful album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Olivor's Heaven & Heartache","review":"I am so glad to hear something new from Jane Olivor. I have had to purchase replacements for worn out previous cassettes of hers. I cannot get enough of this new collection. My favorite is \\"Half Heaven, Half Heartache\\" because I think that most appropriately describes Olivor's voice. For me, Streisand does not compare; Olivor is her own talent, style and sound. Thank you, Jane Olivor, this comeback was worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music 101 - How a REAL singer sounds!","review":"Jane Olivor is a perfect example that talent and being a staple on the radio have very little to do with one another. It would be very difficult to find a more talented singer! She actually knows how to sing a song with her voice, not with endless \\"effects\\" and having to yell above the music, nor does she find it necessary to \\"display\\" every note she is capable of singing in every song she sings. She is so talented she can be subtle. She doesn't have to beat you over the head with what she can do. I, too remember seeing her on the Tonight Show and was totally blown away by her. I bought all of her albums as soon as they came out. I was so happy to see in ICE magazine last month that another offering was coming - hope there are many more to come! Welcome back, old friend, you were away too long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WELCOME BACK JANE OLIVOR!!","review":"Could it really be possible we waited 18 years for her to record another CD? I purchased this on the mere notion that Jane Olivor recorded a new CD and I was not disappointed! I have loved her since the 70's and when I listen to those CDs I recall such wonderful memories and her voice knows how to wrap around me, hold me tight and make me feel good. This CD does the same thing and is just as wonderful as she was 18 years ago. I just pray she will follow this CD up with more of this style music. It is hard to say which is my favorite as each are different and wonderful in their own right. I like the feelings of Warm and the honesty of Half Heaven Half Heartache and the emotion of I Had This Man speak to me and the truth of Love Decides hits home, and the charm of In This Moment is clever. All stand outs but I cannot narrow it down to a single favorite. So, what am I saying...get this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you were never really gone","review":"When Jane Olivor first started recording, her haunting and intimate style set her apart from most popular artists...she made it seem as though she were singing directly to me. She is something we don't find much in America...a true chanteuse. I fell in love and kept her close even as she disappeared. About eight years ago, she quietly returned to live performing and I was lucky enough to have noticed. She then promised a return to recording, but again there was a long wait. It was worth it. This recording presents all the warmth and honesty that first made me fall in love with her. It is pointless to try to address individual selections on her new CD...they are all wonderful. We should all be thankful she's back, but for me, she was never really gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Voice, Finally Back!","review":"I am listening to this CD, as I write. If you are a Jane Olivor fan, BUY IT! You must have it for your library. I have been a fan since hearing Jane sing with Johnny Mathis in concert. I certainly hope there will be more to come. Jane has the voice of an angel. The duet with Gene Pitney is wonderful! Jane please keep your fans supplied with your elegant voice.

It feels very sturdy without being too heavy to carry on a trail to a bird blind. The images are very crisp, clear and bright especially if you are not zoomed in all the way. Once you start to zoom, it does get a little less crisp, but nonetheless, it still is a very clear image of whatever critter you are trying to watch. I would buy one of these again.

Chickens are usually pretty cold-hardy, but I wanted to give them a little something to take the edge off of the cold on really cold days/nights. I placed the mat in the coop under the sand that is in the coop and plugged it in. Now on very cold nights, the chickens have a much cozier place to sleep. The sand on top of the mat is nice and toasty to the touch yet does not get too hot. (PERFECT!) The temp of the coop actually heats up to about 8-10 degrees warmer than outside from the mat during the day and at night I noticed it is even a bit warmer in there with the mat and their body heat. The chickens love ducking in and out of the coop now from time to time to warm up for a bit on cold days before going back out to scratch and play in their covered run. This is a perfect addition to their coop for the winter.

I can get 25 degrees C in a seed tray with the ambient temperature in a conservatory a minimum of 10 degrees C overnight. I placed the mat on expanded polystyrene sheets with capillary matting on the heating mat- this gives a good heat spread and a humid atmosphere.Do take note that the mat runs at 110 volts and needs a transformer to operate in the UK to get 240 volts.

I've been drawing for several years, but could never manage dragons quite as well as I wished. NeonDragon's book was very helpful; it broke down the complex and ununiform dragon into simple steps with plenty of colorful visuals. NeonDragon even made it simple to personalize my drawings by giving examples of different horns, body and leg shapes, wings, and all other things that make dragons unique. The parts on other mythical creatures wasn't as in depth, but still held my attention and gave me some ideas. It is filled with NeonDragon's humor and spirit and is a wonderful book for one struggling to make thier dragons look good and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginner to intermediate artists!","review":"Ok, so i got this from barnes and nobles a few months a ago and so far it has been really great to use.

His essays on Jack Kirby and the Searchers are some of the best writing I've read about comics or film in a long time. The scene where he describes his cynical junkie friend ruining a viewing of the Searchers should resonate with any member of Generation X who had their private passions invaded by the that slew of non-commital flakes we found ourselves surrounded with in the 1990s:eyebrow cocking stoners, who despite their lack of commitment, were always vigilant for passion, always ready to chide us for taking a stand on anything, whether it be a political position or art. If there's one thing I didn't like about this book was Lethem's display of self-consciousness about seeing Star Wars 21 times, something that no one from his generation would bat an eye at.

Jim Gaffigan is a surveyist(however you spell it). he takes ordinary topics from food packaging to waiters, and tells how it is. im a simple man. i dont enjoy much comedy nowadays do to the fact that most comedians are nasty and perverted. he is as clean as a fresh towel falling on the floor. most of his material relates to what people are thinking. all in all, a funny white guy for the good in me"},{"rating":"1","title":"He tries","review":"You really have to be in the mood for this one.

That was amazingly funny. Still, this was a very funny show.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inner Voice = Annoying","review":"The reviews on this being an entertaining piece of stand-up is a fair assesment. Though Gaffigan will not offend many people or shock anyone out of the room, the inner voice bit is annoying to no end. For every joke or comment he makes he adds a high-pitched \\"inner voice\\" comment. The crowd appears to be puzzled by this as well and he even makes fun of himself for doing it...in the annoying inner voice pitch. It is a clean stand up set and the jokes are of run of the mill situations, mostly about food and other average things. I did not relate to much of his humor. Im willing to bet that not many will be wowed by his genius or delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, unfunny, unoriginal","review":"I didn't really want to write a review. I just wanted to give this one star and vote against it. He starts off with a bit, talking in a hushed squeaky voice, acting like he's speaking for supposed members of the audience. Much of the phrases he speaks aren't funny in the least and make no sense whatsoever. He continues to do stuff like that off and on through the entire show. If this is his gimmick, I do not understand his popularity. It's lame and not funny. Finally he gets into making comments about life, but they are not original, they are not funny; it's just dull observations with no wit. I guess that's a better term than \\"lame.\\" This guy is dull. Yawn. Did not watch the whole thing. Could not endure it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"One of the worst comedian's I've seen.I watched this since it was under \\"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\" section.I watched Louis CK and Bill Burr.This talentless comedian showed up.I suffered through the entire thing.

His jokes are great and fun for the whole family.Jim Gaffigan manages to entertain and produce good quality comedy without resorting to sex jokes and dirty language. That's not to say crude humor can't tickle my funny bone just as well, but it's refreshing to listen to Jim Gaffigan's routine and not worry about offending the folks. =)The bonus features on this DVD are sub-par, but the actual stand-up is great and well-worth the money.

But, we were so glad we stopped to hear this truly original and so very funny man! From his bit about the different holidays to the hot pocket joke - we laughed so hard we were hurting! Our favorite thing he does is to say out loud what some in the audience might be thinking...he surprises you with it, but always does it in the same voice so you catch on to what he's doing.

Well, look no further than the palest of the pale, the son of a swedish man and Elton John - Jim Gaffigan.Most people will recognize him from the Sierra Mist commercials, as most people will recognize Brian Posehn from Just Shoot Me, but he's so much more than a stand in for a soft drink. I don't even know what to label his style of humor - it's not toilet humor and it's not stupid humor, it's more of a dry-catch them off guard, style of humor, and it works ten fold.This DVD in particular is a goldmine, his bit on traditions is probably the funniest thing in the whole set, but the entire, what's it? 71 minutes? is comedic genius.Gaffigan Pocket"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff","review":"Hilarious!

I originally had a receiver similar to this but then upgraded to the RX-V559 and then eventually to the RX-V661, and every Yamaha receiver I have had ended up being amazing. I will always trust Yamaha to make excellent products as far as their receivers go and would never buy another from someone else.EDIT: I ended up with the Yamaha 863 which was the best one yet....but so far I'm disappointed with the 65 and 67 series.

In writing this book, we interviewed hundreds of Heads - at shows and online - and we tried to undo a lot of the shallow stereotyping of Deadheads promulgated by lazy journalists by depicting as broad a spectrum of Heads as possible.You're welcome to read excerpts from Skeleton Key by following the link from my home page at http://www.levity.com/digaland/Take care!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Hey everybody!i have just finished this book! it's awesome! it really takes me back to the tours of the day!

The author made broad generalizations about what big women are like and why some men find us attractive. I found her arguments weak and her conclusions iffy.

For instance, the Archbishop was accused by South African President Thabo Mbeki of being a liar and a charlatan, while President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, in his better days, called Tutu 'an angry, evil and embittered little bishop'.I have listed much more about Mr Tutu in Apartheid South Africa, but coming from such well-informed people, statements like these should be enough to get readers thinking.John Allen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedic Genius","review":"I should not have to review any work by French & Saunders!

I was a little disappointed by the size of the speakers. That is.. until i turned them on. The highs and the lows on this system is incredible. The mids definitely need some work but are worth every single penny. I've had my system for more than 3 years and its still running great.

It's definitely a keeper, for a long long time. Absolutely no complaints from this audio freak <g>I love the remote control too. Now I can lie down on the nearby sofa and listen to audio programs with total control :)It has an auxiliary input jack on top of the subwoofer. This is a great function for me. With a good A/V selector (Sony's SB-V40S A/V Selector is the one I have, which has an Output 2 audio output with stereo mini jack), now I can also use this PC speaker system for my nearby 13\\" TV, DVD player, VCR, and camcorder.

I was looking for something light that would not harm my carbon seat post. This is the best I could find. Weighs 540g with bolts- a few less grams than the quick-release version. Be careful not to strip the soft-metal bolts which require an english allen wrench? 5mm allen is close but over time will strip socket. I like that this system allows me to keep stuff off my back in the heat of summer, AND it does not drastically alter the balance of the bike like panniers do. It also doubles as a fender on wet roads. Better bolts and this would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jammed Bolt","review":"The item arrives with the attaching bracket bolted in place, Upon attempting to install this item I found one of the 4 bolts for attaching the bracket to the seat post was so thoroughly jammed in place I could not remove it. Even though they are Allen wrench cap head type bolts I stripped out the insert point for the Allen wrench as the bolts are also aluminum. The other 3 bolts removed easily. I am returning this item and will probably replace it with something different as I have always had problems with aluminum bolts."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE, DO NOT BUY!","review":"This rack was originally rated for 25lbs, but at some point customers must have complained about it breaking because the manufacturer stuck a sticker over that rating saying 20lbs.

I went of a curb at walking speed (because there was a crowd) and the weld to the bracket which attaches to the seat post completely failed. I ended up carrying the battery pack on my ride home.

I needed a lightweight rack to hold my bag containing things I needed during the day. This worked well, but it's not as easy to use as the rack on my hybrid, in which the bag just snaps into place. I had to use straps and a bungee to hold the bag on, but it did stay in position, and I was able to access all the pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"like it","review":"I like this rack better then the ones with the quick release. This rack alows you to really clamp the rack down to keep it from moving. I use a little bit of rubber tabe so it doesn't scratch the seat post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Bought it maybe 6 months ago for my mountain bike. It seemed ok at first. I ride 7 miles to work each day one way. 5 days a week. I put my work back pack on it so I don't have to carry it. Some days it weighed more that the new weight limit of 10 pounds, but most days it did not. The Tubular spine is aluminium so it started to bulge at the base of the tube and the paint started to flake off at the top. After 3 months the bag area was level and slowly headed towards the wheel. Then before it could make it the aluminium pins holding the clasp together broke. Its not very well made. Everything is Aluminium to save weight. Its weak. The printed card that came with it said it could handle 40lbs originally. It was edited with a sticker that said 10lbs. I don;t think it could even handle that over rough roads and time. Get something more durable. This doesn't last. I got a Topeaker QR beam rack in the end. Its a bit shorter which is a shame but its much more solidly built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta Mega Rack Post Haste Does The Job","review":"I purchased this rack to hold a 15 pound battery pack for some very bright commuter bike lights. I installed the 4-bolt clamp with some rubber gasket material (from Home Depot) between it and the seat post, and I tightened the bolts in a \\"criss cross\\" pattern, just like tire lug nuts. I only used it for about two weeks (I switched to using a back pack for the battery because it was so heavy it really messed up my balance and maneuverability when attached to the bike), but it never slipped or rotated, and there were no signs of stress. My only suggestions for improvement would be to include rubber gasket material with the rack as sold, and to use stainless steel nuts, rather than just the threaded aluminum clamp, because aluminum is subject to stripping more easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior product","review":"Yes, our local Walmart carries algae wafers BUT not this brand. And the last ones we bought would not even sink. Nevertheless, our plecos, clown loaches, cory cats, tetras, barbs and rainbow fish all show a definite preference for these wafers. While they ignored the other brands we've tried, they attack these as soon as they hit the tank. We have to allow a couple extra each feeding to make sure the bottom feeders get any, as the larger fish grab the first ones in and the rest play chase with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All my fishes like it!

That's the only negative I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I bought this for my sucker fish and it ended up being a great treat for all my fish in the tank!! great buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"My pleco is all over this stuff. He doesn't leave any behind, so no leftovers get sucked in the filter. Unlike the Wardley brand which he just sniffs then goes back to his hole to let the stuff dissolve and get sucked up in the filter, he sucks these wafers like a lollipop laced with stimulants. The difference is significant. The wafer is barely bigger than his mouth so it sucks and sucks with so much effort it's fun watching him eat. This bottom-feeder will be in mid-water in every angle you can imagine sucking away. I could tell this guy is in paradise when he's feeding on this stuff. Thanks, Hikari!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Wheat Wafers...","review":"I do my best to give my fish a diet that's similar to mine, which is full of protein and all natural. My Angels and Blue Rams get brine shrimp and blood worms a couple times a day and live brine shrimp as a special treat once in a while. I feed them flake food and shrimp pellets as a last resort. Because of this I have some seriously gorgeous fish that are happy, healthy, and constantly laying eggs (diet is important for libido). I was a little disappointed to see the first 13 ingredients in these pellets had no sign of \\"algae\\" whatsoever and included things like \\"wheat flour, wheat germ meal, starch, dried bakery product,\\" etc. I gave it 2 stars because they do seem to like them... but I figure it's the same sort of enjoyment that comes from eating a twinkie or big mac. Yeah, it tastes good, but it's crap. I'll be searching for a more natural algae wafer for my Pleco's and will relegate these to the bottom shelf with the flake food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and the fish don't like it.","review":"Neither my pleco nor my loaches are a fan of these. When I put one in, the pleco will come over, take an exploratory nibble, and move on to other things. And he's a total glutton. Within just a couple of minutes, the wafers dissolve into a green icky mess on the bottom of the tank.On the plus side, my cats love it. It's become an effective decoy when I feed the fish.

Reading these stories has helped me so much. I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone who loves their pet dearly and wants to feel comfort that they will see them again once they pass on.

I probably would not have purchased this book had I been able to skim through it at a bookstore.On the other hand! It was very interesting reading, carefully thought out and presented. I strongly believe that each of us, after the death of our pet, must find peace for ourselves and not everyone holds to the same belief system.

I used this book in my Advanced Placement English Literature class in high school, and I did not come away especially \\"enlightened\\" about poetry. Perrine and Arp seem to forget that the best poetry is inspired and should jostle thoughtful readers into philosophic contemplation. Any hint of this is lost in the way the authors dissect each work, measure it, judge it according to their calculus, and, in the process, strip it of its former beauty.

I find myself lifting his butt up with one hand while trying to use the clippers with the other. When I first began using the table I had some problems getting the legs to extend fully and lock into place. This was important because I wanted a table that could be easily set up and then stored when I was finished. I called the company and was told to spray the hinges with WD40.

But I feel that Ms. Wentworth can draw characters very well indeed as well. Her characters are so real that as I read, they bring to mind actual people that I know that \\"were just like that\\". Her character of Mrs. Latter in this book is a fine example of this talent. She is exceptionally well-drawn, and appears so realistic. This book has a very limited number of suspects when Mrs. Latter dies from morphia poisoning, and it just doesn't seem that any of them could have possibly done it. Or could they have? Miss Silver is brought in to get to the truth of the matter, and you can bet she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hard drive","review":"I dropped my computer and broke my hard drive.

This is true--but misleading, too.

We had tons of data for ourselves and others, and by New Years Eve it was all gone, every last bit of it.

Well I got it home and everything worked great except I couldn't figure out how to change pages, they said there was a button on the top of it. B-S. Eventually when I ran out of space on the 1st page I got angry and did something about it. Went to their site and read up on it. It says that you have to press L1 R1 and start at the same time, and with still holding start in use R1 and L1 to change the pages. I haven't had any problems with this card whatsoever. True it is slow. But I use one page for each game and everything works like a dream and never deleted stuff on me without me wanting to. All in all I think they should tell you how to change pages, but now that I know I'm very happy with everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"When we got a Playstation two years ago, we just wanted a simple Memory Card. We couldn't understand at the time why anyone would buy one of the Sony cards. Not only did they cost more per block, but they didn't have the same storage capacity. So we bought this. What a mistake!This card is completely unreliable. It corrupted an entire season of NFL Gameday '98. The other files on it are shaky at best. Buyer beware of this garbage.

I thought I had committed some fumbling luddite error. So I went back and used it again. Same story, same time frame. Never again.

When the sales person walked away for a break - I did a check to see if Amazon carried the watch and THEY DID. Love the watch, love the complements that I get while wearing it. I have a rather small wrist that tends to be a challenge to find a watch for - most watches these days have larger faces that over power the size of my wrist. This one - perfect sized for the small wrist people. The only thing that made me not give it 5 stars is that it is a bit large for my wrist and removing the links is super difficult so I wear it more as a \\"watch/bracelet\\" than just a watch. With all of that said - if you are someone who has a smaller wrist that is overpowered by the current styles who is looking for a classic timepiece - this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!","review":"This is a fun game but it doesn't make noise.

I've played Life also and that was fun too. I don't know anything about payday. Good game and worth the $15 I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"I love these games, espcially 'Game of Life', but there is a problem with 'Pay Day'. At times the game just freezes and I have not idea why. I tried playing the other games first and that seemed to solve the problem, well at first it did, but it did freeze on when once and it also went a bit strange when it changed the amount for one of the players to a enormous amount so that there was no way that any other player could win. The other two games appear to be fine which is good as I love them. It's just frustrating when 'Pay Day' freezes up on you. Besides that I do love playing the other games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game!","review":"I bought this game for my daughters since they love to play these games and because it's faster than playing the board games with all the little pieces.

I've never played Payday, but there is no instruction with these games, so I don't know how to play it. Therefore, if you aren't already familiar with these games in their board game state, don't expect to learn how to play them here. Yahtzee is Yahtzee, and if you like to play it, here's a nice way to sit with your GAMEBOY ADVANCE and pass the time. As for LIFE...UGH!!! It could have been so cute and fun IF there was any detail to it at all. There's not. No mini games, no extra choices, nothing. You could just sit and keep pressing the \\"A\\" button, and the game would play itself.

I own all of this author's other books and reread them but this one I feel is not up to par. The characters are such one dimensional caricatures: tart-tongued lassie and hardened rake. Once in a while a glimmer of the old Carlyle shines through but this book is just so formulaic and unsatisfying. There's no meat on the bones! The only reason I kept reading is because it's by Carlyle; if it had been anyone else I would have given up sooner and just thrown it away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat read","review":"I'm disappointed with this book as well. I have loved Carlyle's past books because they were dark, sensual, humorous, and manned by vivid,unforgettable characters. Not to mention that she put her own stamp upon the Regency Historical sub-genre by exploring things that most RH authors don't. But One Little Sin is very conventional. Carlyle's stunning prose is evident, but her beautiful characterizations and use of setting flicker on and off throughout the book, leaving me unsatisfied and confused as to whom I was reading. From the beginning of book, I found myself impatient to finish it, and highly anticipating the next two books of the trilogy.

There are a couple of recordings by Russian conductors/orchestras (Svetlanov, Mravinsky) which are more exciting, but the sound quality and orchestral balances are MUCH better here.

It then explains each game in detail. It explains why progression betting systems don't work long-term, and why money management is psychological, not mathematical.

I used the low level input. The hardest thing about the installation was threading the tie down strap through the tie down strap base. I mounted it in the trunk the way the manufacture recommends and with some adjustments to my head unit and the level adjustment on the subwoofer I got it sounding awesome. (I was a little worried that it wouldn't have enough kick back in the trunk but it's fine)I would recommend this subwoofer for anybody looking for some bass but without the huge pounding bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am blown away by the amount of sound that comes out of such a little speaker.

The Frosts came out of nowhere, appropriating the term 'Wicca' for their own version of what religious witchcraft might be. Their synthesis bore almost no resemblance to the traditions of Wicca, either in ritual or theology, and certainly not in the grotesque suggestions about the sexual upbringing of children. It was a different age in those days, as 'swinging' emerged as a lifestyle and many folks hoped for a real revolution in sexual mores - too bad the Frosts chose to add their wacky ideas to something that they chose to call 'Wicca'.This book was an embarrasment in 1972, and it's an embarrasment now.

Not just a portion of the point, the whole thing was broken. It looks like the break occured inside the barrel. I dont know if it was just bad luck on my part or faulty product.

I don't read too many really bad books. This is one of them. I guess that Kemal chose to write a \\"epic\\"-style book. Unfortunately, this means paper-thin characters and an utterly predictable plot. Special mention goes out to the dialogue, which reminded me of my 4th-grade class's production of Shakespeare. An example, as one of our characters is about to light a fire: \\"Wait, don't touch the tinder with wet fingers!\\" \\"Yes, that's right. You must never touch the tinder with wet fingers.\\" See? We enjoyed ourselves and we learned something too. This sort of thing goes on for a couple of hundred pages, you understand.

When I plug them into my ipod and put the player in my back pocket, i'm constantly pulling the plug out2. The volume is too low. I know, I know, you're supposed to keep the volume low, but when the ipod is on full volume, you can barely hear it in the headphones, regardless of whether the machinery is running or not.Result, I bought a different pair of headphones for that purpose.

Great stuff and I recommend it. Like the other reviewer said it is pretty expensive, but it works and it's supposed to be healthy for the fish so I tried it out.

Yes, we know these recordings were made before the advent of tape, etc.--I don't think most people interested in Parker recordings are looking for pristine studio sound, but this is a disgrace. I have many C.P. recordings, including lots of old Verve and Savoy issues on LP--none of them sound as bad as this CD. Not just surface noise, but actual musical distortion that could have been mitigated with today's technology. I was suckered into this one by the Burns affiliation, since I had enjoyed the TV jazz series. Not a fraction of the care put into that effort was expended on the CD. There is so much Parker out there today put out with more care; I would look to the Dial and Savoy sessions, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"good godfrey, clean this up!","review":"I don't know much about how they remaster and transfer music to CD's, but it sounds as if the originals were used to sweep up the studio floor and then transferred to CD.

It's a great collection from a true genious, but Ken Burns should be ashamed to put his name on this disc sounding the way it does. I've heard hisses and pops, but my old records sound way better than this :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"He is OK","review":"I do not like Parker's style at all. I can't really say anything else.

In order to use the fingerprint reader you will need to be an \\"administrator\\" on EVERY computer on which you intend to use this device, which is not practical. Software is limited to Microsoft 2000 SP4 or newer operating systems, although this will not be much of an issue for Windows users. Software only supports Internet Explorer favorites. Encryption is limited to individual files.Recommendation: Pass on this one and buy a higher capacity USB flash drive for the same price, then download and use some free file encryption software such as axcrypt ( http://axcrypt.sourceforge.net/ ). Business users should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finger print reader cool, but overall features pathetic","review":"Do NOT get this gadget if you are looking for a secure/lockable portable USB storage device for files. The Lexar hype is misleading.It only encrypts individual files (not even folders) using the software package that comes with it. The device is always open (just like a regular USB thumb drive). The only thing the fingerprint reader or password does is open up the software on your PC. Once the software is open, you can unencrypt individual files or use the integrated IE password storer.Whoopee :(So in conclusion, the only thing it is good for is saving IE bookmarks and saving IE browser Web page login passwords.(and goofing around with a finger print reader)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Willie","review":"This is just a great DVD.

This book was vile! It was so self-indulgent..........Bridget Harrison does not represent a \\"Brit Chick\\". I cringed my way through this book as a London girl. She is a spoilt, boring, frightfully tedious writer. You don't like the subject, because she is a selfish c*w and you end up completely blase about whether she hooks up with anyone. I think my most cringe worthy line was \\"and I looked damn sexy\\". Though the worst bit was her brush over of 9/11. As a News Reporter during the biggest tragedy of the last 20 yrs, all she cares about is why she wore a stupid ironic T-shirt (ironic meaning I am a slapper in this case). All in all the only thing that made me laugh was the fact I was stupid enough to buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Absolutely awful. Parts of this book were fairly readable, if copycat, chick lit (as if she'd lifted Bridget Jones in many places), but the real Bridget was utterly unsympathetic, and worryingly blase about major events like 9/11 (all she cared about was what SHE did that day, and how SHE didn't get asked to cover anything more 'exciting'. We the reader never heard a word about how what happened that day affected New York). It is no wonder to me that Bridget is still sad, single and searching - she never seemed satisfied no matter what she had. As a reporter myself in the UK, I found this a pretty horrific read, and wonder why I bothered spending the money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"I felt sorry for Bridget, because she is so pathetic.

There's An Acronym For Everything (TAAFE)! Small sample from pages 100-103: IPDM, PCSB, CRM, BPI, EAI, SOI, API, ERP, EDI, TCI, BCI, BAI.

In many places, he makes statements such as \\"There are two important topics regarding.......and he gives you number one, but try and find number two. And so on throughout the book.

This is quite a shame. I know better copies exist for some of these songs. Perhaps even a run through an electronic noise filter would of helped a lot with these recordings.If you are a music historian or researcher (or perhaps a recording \\"purist\\"), this may be a good CD for you because the performances are brilliant.

What they just didn't understand was that the documentary was only meant to be a starting point...an introduction to the storied past and the diverse music styles of the jazz world.The same holds true with Ken Burns Jazz series of artist compilations. This one by Billie Holiday is the best place to start as any, offering selections from across her entire career and from all her major recording labels. Despite her voice's limited range (even in her younger days before drugs and hard living took their toll, power was never her strong suit), Billie is a master at somehow capturing the ache and subtle phrasing of each and every song. Try this one before moving on to her other releases. \\"Autumn In New York\\" will make you cry in your coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable bad cd quality.

However, the fit left a lot to be desired. The waist was definitely larger than the stated 44 - may have been closer to a 46 because the jeans just fell off me. The other issue for me was the \\"full leg\\" (18 inches?). The wide legs made the fit feel much more like a \\"baggy\\" jean than a \\"relaxed fit\\" jean.

Put the small round inside the large round, and then both into the oval. Once the rounds were washed, I discovered the oval underneath was done for. Apparently the weight of putting the outer edge of the large round through the water onto the inner edge of the oval was too much for it (the large oval and large round don't nest, so they were at an angle). When I was a child, my mother severed a tendon by breaking a glass in the sink, so I practically have a phobia about being rough with dishes while washing. The other casseroles are fine, but I was disappointed with the fragility. You may have a better experience, but I'll be leery of Corning products in the future. Love those ramekins though - couldn't imagine what use they'd be, but absolutely perfect for dipping bread in garlic and olive oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR PACKAGING","review":"I placed two separate orders for this product and each order was received with one broken dish.

It's a 12-piece set and 3 of the dishes were broken upon arrival.

Out of the 4 sets, 2 had broken pieces. Amazon replaced those sets, with two new sets - both of the new sets had broken pieces - but between the 4 damaged sets, I was able to put together 2 whole, good sets.This was not a packing deficiency on Amazon's part - the sets are just not packed well inside the sealed boxes.The plastic \\"refrigerator\\" covers are a little difficult to get on, but seal well once you do manage to get them covered. I wish all 4 of the big containers had the covers, but only two of them do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product still gets 5 stars!","review":"I also received my set with a broken piece, but Amazon was more than gracious in replacing it with no cost to me.

I can download RSS news feeds in the morning and read them while going to work. I can watch news videos or even listen to music. And nothing else can help kill time than games! This is like your own little personal entertainment system! The graphics are great even for something at this size (4.5 in. diagonal). I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the design","review":"Just bought this fan a few weeks ago. I simply love the design. It's also such a nice space saver. The breeze feels so natural compared to a regular fan. This model is nice and quiet. I can barely tell that it's on. The only draw back that I have with this model is that it isn't height adjustable. While the air it blows out is nice, when sitting it barely catches your face. A major draw back especially if you are a tall person. I have to prop it up on top of something on those really hot days just so it will cool my face. All that being said I really like this tower fan. I don't know if it's right for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"adjustable but noisy","review":"I bought this rack because of the advertised weight, rated capacity, and a $17 experiment isn't going to kill me. The adjustability is nice and the single rear support helps with aerodynamics. However, the rear pivot makes such a racket that it drives me nuts. I like my bikes to be silent except for shifting and braking.450 grams is an exaggeration. Once you add the beefier seat stay brackets it's more like 580 grams. The 30 lb. capacity is likewise an exaggeration. I tried to carry a twelve pack of beer in addition to my tool kit the other day and the 13-14 lb. load was enough to bend the seat stay brackets. It's fortunate that I rarely carry more than 5 lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued Product","review":"National Geographic has discontinued this TOPO! series in favor of their newer approaches to displaying topographical maps. They do not support the product on OS X Mountain Lion. NG and Amazon are still offering TOPO! for sale for a few states and unless you need and ask for support from NG the marketing does not mention it is discontinued and unsupported for the latest OS X.Since my FedEx delivery occurred to the wrong address and was not found for about a month it is too late to return the software but that is what it deserves.The concept of displaying topographical maps without borders is a good one and if the software worked reliably and was marketed honestly it would be worth about half of the asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could have given this CD 4 1/2 stars","review":"This is a great collection of music, and a wonderful reflection of the hard work and careful choices involved in the inclusion of material in the Ken Burns \\"Jazz\\" collection.

A great CD for anyone interested in Jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Normally, I love Omar Tyree's work, but I could not get into this book. There were no relatable characters, and the plot is extremely slow moving. Terrance spends a lot of time explaining and excusing himself and then describing his sex life. You'd think that Terrance's travels and sexcapades would make the book interesting, but it tends to slow the book down. Once you get to the 5,000th description of his arousal, it gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I will never buy another Omar Tyree book again.....The chapters were consisted of Terrance meeting a woman and screwing a new woman while getting phone calls from numerous other women. There were almost too many women to keep up with. For me the last 20-30 pages were good and then that is stretching it because Omar just wrapped that part of the book up. He should have devoted more of the 400 page book to what happened in the last 30 pages (don't want to give the ending away for anybody who will actually read this book after reading these reviews) Don't buy this book. The only reason I finished the book was because I paid for it and I wanted to move on to the next book I had to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I only gave it one star because I didn't have the option to give it half.

If you like a book that has ABSOLUTELY no point to it whatsoever, than this is a good book, but the plot had no purpose. All it was about was how many women the main character could sleep with. And don't get me wrong, I love erotica, but this was NOT erotica. If you want sex, stick to Zane, this book just didn't do it for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"this book is all about sex and is totally predictable. thank GOD i checked it out from the library and didnt spend my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst read","review":"I purchased this book based on a lot of ravings- I was sadly mistaken. I was very disgusted and bored with his thoughts and writing. I mean where was he going with this other than a young male model screwing a lot of women. It was not worth finishing his book. I will never suggest or purchase another of his books again. To tell you the truth, this book was a waste of money and I don't want to keep this on my shelf. Beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Do They Want","review":"This is my second time reading this novel in five years and I still do not have a clue as to What They Want as far as this book is concerned. This book lack substance and a story line.Mind you it could of been good as each and everyone woman in Terrance life brought something new and different to the table which made me believe that Tyree may after all have a point. Sadly however this book was a flop. The only saving grace were the sex scenes except one in particular . So in the end, what does it really boil down to? I still do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"What They Want is a disappointment","review":"Mr. Tyree is losing me. What They Want and Pecking Order were both huge disappointments. My number one problem with this book is the fact that it is 400+ pages. You need to have more than sex to keep that going. My other problem is that parts of the book are drawn out to tell about situations that were not interesting to begin with. The drama with the sister, the celibate friend, all boring. The book was boring and I skipped to the last 3 chapters so I would know what happened. I never even got a good idea of what Terrence looked like, with the 500 million descriptions in the book, I don't think the author ever described what the brother looked like (or I skipped past it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Great!","review":"At first I thought that this character was just going to be a straight hoe throughout the book and he wouldnt see the error of his ways. But he really stops and thinks about what he is doing and how it actually affects the women in his life, he really sees the trees and not just the forest. Omar Tyree is exceptional at story telling and his books are always page turners. I cant put it down and I cant wait for the next one that he brings to the table. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"A excellent book on relationships and just what we as men and women want. It really made me think again especially being single again after 14 years.

How about a decent book by Omar","review":"This will be the LAST Omar Tyree book I buy. They have gotten WORST since Fly Girl.All this guy (Terrance) in the story is a oversexed 33 year old. He can't keep a girl because his crotch gets him in trouble all the time. This guy gives Dre (How to Be A Player) a run for his money.At least Dre had some redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Storyline","review":"The author should have just written erotic fiction, because this is the entire plot of the book: how many women he could bed. The author expects us to believe that this whoremonger of a man could sleep his way through countless women, sometimes 5 women in 3 days, and, poof! just settle down upon reconnecting with the mother of his child. I'm really glad this is a work of fiction, because, Omar, this doesn't happen in real life. Once a dog, always a dog. He didn't even develop his character to the point that he was monogamous to one woman for any length of time before he decided the character would suddenly give up all the cha cha he was getting before settling down. Totally unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!!!!!","review":"25 pounds, please, any more than 10 pounds+ a bump=bent and dragging on the tires. Waste of money.

They don't fit correctly any more. How sad. Vanity Fair you need to go back and hire your original manufacturer. I would pay more for the vintage produced item. Your manufacturer must be laughing on his way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Panties!","review":"I discovered these years ago and am thrilled that Vanity Fair is still making these panties. They cover my largish rear perfectly and NEVER ride up, even as they become old & worn. I machine wash AND dry them and they wear beautifully. Because they have a satiny finish, pants slide right over them. I wouldn't CHANGE a thing about them; I just wish they were available in additional colors and prints. I had a leopard pair years ago and I miss them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"vanity fair panties","review":"I bought this model before and really like them.

I would not buy them again or would buy them a couple of sizes bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as other websites.","review":"I've bought these from other websites and they fit perfectly, but when purchased here, they feel very tight. Not only that, but they are made from different ingredients than listed on both Amazon and other sites. Because of this, they feel stiff and uncomfortable. Sorry to say it, but I'll just go back to paying more to make sure I get what I'm ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong size no response","review":"I ordered these underpants a few weeks ago. As far as the brand goes they are terrific. I bought this particular kind about 10 years ago and they have last that long. However, my low review is because of the company I bought them from. I ordered all the same size about l0 pair. 2 of the l0 came about 6 sizes too large as they were mislabeled. The person who packed each one didn't care enough to even bother to get all the same size. I have e-mailed amazon and tried to contact the seller with no response. I would not use this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED these used to be my favorite brand","review":"I have a sensitivity to latex and elastic and since this style has covered elastic it used to be the best I have found that didn't cause skin itch and irritation. However, they must have changed factories or cut costs because the sizing is completely different than in the past. I have worn a size 6 in this very same style, but I thought I would try one size larger for extra comfort. The size 7's I recieved were actually cut quite a bit smaller than the previos size 6, and I can't even wear them. Now I have to start my search all over for another brand I can tolerate. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"These are NOT SIZED correctly.","review":"Size 8 were way too tight which I thought was weird so I bought 4 more size 9 and they were just as tight.

This last time, I ordered the same size as always and although I have lost 20 lbs. due to health issues, all three pair of panties I ordered, in different colors, are way too tight for comfort. What happened Vanity Fair?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Smooth","review":"This panties are extremely comfortable and smooth. As a male long frustrated with the limited selection of male underwear, usually cotton, white and somewhat binding, these panties are great. They provide all day comfort, do not bind or pinch, and provide the needed support. The satin trim provides a bit of sexiness. The high-cut style moves well with the body and ensures freedom of movement during activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad writing.","review":"I will just add to the two negative reviews below by saying that the *explanations* I read when skimming through the book were so bad that I could only understand the sections on points I was already familiar with. I think this is the worst technical writing that I have ever seen in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demanding Refund","review":"I am unable to derive any benefit from the book, it is too bookish and not \\"step-by-step\\" explanation.I therefore, demand refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy and nothing more","review":"A total waste of money (and the English language). The authors are more concerned with showing their \\"guru\\" status than with actually instructing the reader in such basics as applying plug-ins, transparencies...

But then again, if you're a guru yourself, you shouldn't need to toss your money away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The information that some readers assert is lacking from the book is in fact easily found. For example, instructions for downloading and installing new plug-ins is on page 51 in the section \`\`Extra Plug-ins.'' People who have more patience, and who are willing to spend the time with this 900-page volume, will find it extremely helpful. I have been using it for just a few days and have already learned many useful techniques. The numerous illustrations well demonstrate the operations that can be performed with all the available tools. See for yourself. This is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it.","review":"The book was easy reading because it gave short, concise, interesting synopses of world history. The book included both man-made and natural disasters from the big bamg to 3-mile island. A must for all history teachers and anyone who likes to read about history. The book is easy reading and you can get through it in a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Commentary on Personal Gardening Experiences","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The advice is outdated, and the writer is a novice both in writing and in gardening. She does not profess to be an expert, however, and gives only her personal account of her experiences in and history of her own garden. Her humor is corny, but probably fits her era (50's-60's). I cannot recommend this to the modern gardener. As far as the title, well no garden is work-free, but that is part of its appeal(a labor of love). If you want a garden without work, hire a gardener. The author doesn't really give much direction on how to garden without work. I am a master gardener and have 40 years gardening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"We needed something to keep the doors open through the laundry room when we bring stuff in the house.

So that in adittion to the lack of magnetic stregnth means they dont hold the door open in anything more than a light breeze.A HUGE dissapointment after reading the other good reviews.I even tried two on one door, still no good.A VERY disapointing purchase, my worst buy yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic stopper stops the drift","review":"I purchased this for my laundry room door which would not stay open. It works like a charm! I had ordered this type of item originally from 2 other places and was told by both it was backordered.

Easy to install and unobtrusive, this makes my previous problem of the partially opened door history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic Door Holder & Stop","review":"Great product. Very simple device will hold door in place just like in commercial buildings. Always had a problem with the door slamming shut when the windows were open and the door wedge would always go missing. Not anymore. Give it a decent tug to move it off the holder. I installed the holder at the top of the door, so the kids wouldn't accidently step on the holder and break it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Serves as a great door stop and also hold a heavy door that has two spring hinges with no problem.

I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes. I am using this and the CD Healthy Hair Butter as a leave-in. I love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately for relaxed hair. A dab'll do ya.","review":"I've been a fan of Carol's Daughter since my hair was natural and she was mixing up concoctions in Brooklyn. Now, my hair is relaxed and the Mimosa Hair Honey is the ONLY thing I use on my scalp. I don't trust the drugstore brands that are full of mineral oil and petroleum products designed, not to help our hair but to fill up the jar and turn a profit. I have long hair and using other hair greases/moisturizers leave my hair stringy and limp. When I apply this only to my scalp, massage and comb my hair, it is lustrous and keeps flakes at bay. It is also incredibly potent since I've been using the same 8 oz jar (weekly applications) since Christmas '05 and have a ways to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey is Worth The Money","review":"Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true. This product is rich, but at the same time light.

I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I have natural hair and I find that this product does absolutely nothing. It is a VERY light oil and seems to be most appropriate for very fine textured, relaxed hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair honey!","review":"The Mimosa Hair Honey is wonderful! First of all, it arrived on the date promised. Based on the reviews I decided it would be better for my hair than one of the water based products. I'm not conversant with the number/alpha system of grading hair, but mine is an abundance of thick, soft and kinky loveliness, so breakage is a concern as well as finding a product with enough oils (and of course without mineral oil or petroleum). I wear my hair natural, and am not interested in waves, shine, etc, just healthy hair. Some of the Carol's Daughter hair butters list water as the first ingredient, which would dry out my hair. The smell is pleasant, although heavy. I apply it at night so it won't compete with other fragrances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"It was sticky and overscented. My sister loves it, but I felt that CD took the style over substance approach -- it wasn't terribly conditioning/softening for me, so I don't know what it is really good for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Product","review":"This pomade by far is the best hair product I've ever tried in my entire life and i'm not just exaggerating. I have natural curly thin hair that tends to get frizzy a lot! I've used everything from mousse's, gels, sprays, other curly/antifrizz creams and nothing tames my hair the way this does. You don't even have to re-apply it. It'll leave your hair super soft, shiny and with no frizzies. And it smells great! If you do need to re-apply, you can re-apply as many times as you want and it won't get greasy. I hope this product never discontinues cause I have found the solution to my hair. It's awesome awesome awesome! It's for all kinds of hair by the way. Whether you have straight wavy hair, coarse hair, natural curly hair or processed hair, it works for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!","review":"This product is now in my everyday regimen. Even though I don't need to, I use this with a leave in conditioner. This product leaves my hair moist and soft and with more curl definition. With natural hair you have to try products yourself to see if you'll have the same results as the next naturally curly girl. This product was well worth the money. This has a delicate scent to it. If you use another scented product it will not over power.I plan on buying more Carol's Daughter products thanks to the results of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I am a black woman with natural, fine kinky hair and I use this product on my hair daily as needed.

Taylor is hiding a deadly secret from this woman who is totally blinded by her love for him, a man she barely knows, who just happens to have saved her life. The idea is just too unbelievable, for this reader. Had the male been at least 15 years younger, perhaps the idea would have been a little more convincing.Also, I felt somewhat lost because the author allowed Frank to place too much focus on a story within this story. It seemed as though he was just babbling on at times about the past.In addition, I never really understood what his true feelings for the female protagonist, were. Her feelings were well known, while his remained questionable.By the way, I had Frank figured out halfway into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long and boring walk","review":"This book was nothing more that a female basically getting what she asked for. How in the world can someone who professed to be so intelligent (Kat) the female lead in the book be so gullible. Throughout the entire book, the male lead (Jack) warned her not to read to much into their situation and to think about what she was saying and doing to him. He even told her that she didn't know him well enough to profess all of the undying love she purportedly had for him. Jack gave her all the clues in the world to the underlying of his character and she still ignored the signs to the inevitable outcome of the book. About one quarter into the book, it can be figured out what is going on between the two. The author made Kat out to be some kind of love starved, love sick, SEX STARVED, illusioned, naive, and too trusting person. Her entire dialogue consisted of \\"I love you so much Jack\\" and \\"I want you to screw me now Jack\\" This got very old after the first couple of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am tired of walking!","review":"I have to agree with mamalove...this book was ridiculous.

Do not fall into the name brand of scopes and give the NcStar a try, I have them on all my gun's and will continue to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time!","review":"I worked in a bookstore about 10 years ago and had the opportunity to read \`Sleeping With the Enemy'.I found it to be one of the most poorly written books I had ever read, as the writing ability of the author resembled something out of an 8th grade composition class. It seemed a poor first attempt by a fledgling author and I remember being very surprised that it actually got published. \`Sleeping With the Enemy' was a disappointingly easy read, written in an immature style, by an obviously inexperienced writer.Years later I was shocked to find that someone had based a film on what I considered one of the worst books I ever wasted two evenings on.I think the pseudo feminist message (an abused woman fights back against her oppressor) and the movie's \`Julia Roberts Dazzle Factor' might confuse some with whether or not this is a well-written and interesting book.Sadly, it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is better","review":"This is one case where I thought the movie was better than the book.

Honestly, the book gave me a headache. I also couldn't understand why Sara was even interested in the professor - there just wasn't enough elaboration on that point.

Also \\"Bessie's Blues\\" is not on my album, but \\"Mr P.C\\" is. But apart from those discrepancies, whether there's 2 versions of the same album, I don't know .. but I do know that it is a great introduction to Coltrane. Of course, no one disc can do real justice to such a jazz giant, but I was kind of suprised that nothing from \\"Blue Train\\" was included here. That happens to be my favourite Coltrane album, and I think they could have substituted \\"Mr P.C\\" or \\"Naima\\" for one from \\"Blue Train\\", seeing as they are both from the same album.

I gave up on this unit and am now using the probe and the rj11 to clip wire with my Klein VDV LANscout Jr. which can generate a loud enough signal and won't blow up if there a current on the line.It's a cheap low tech solution for ethernet testing, tone and trace is a failure. Keep it away from phone systems, PoE, and anything involving controls and field instruments.It will blow out a couple of the lights if you hook it to a line with PoE (Power over Ethernet).Conclusion, Lame but they gave you a nice set of wires to use with the unit you pick to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Despite the reviews here, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm disappointed, but not surprised. The cable test function is fine; powers each wire sequentially so it can be seen on the remote end. Toning/tracing is hopeless. It explicitly won't work on a live line, so you'd have to be sure both ends are unplugged; useless if that's why you're toning in the first place. The receiver seems to have no filtering on it, so it picks up 60Hz hum if you're within several feet of a power cable. The tone signal is so weak that I couldn't trace more than about ten feet before it was inaudible. It has the ability to apply an unbalanced tone to counteract the shielding properties of twisted pair, but this mode didn't fare any better.I'll be returning this unit and shopping for something that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"If you are a Dragonball Z Fan-GET THIS MOVIE!

As with many writers who dip into that genre infrequently, it can be a toss up whether or not the next attempt will be good. \\"He, She, and It\\" is good. The main character is Shira and we follow her life for a few months as she fights for her child, herself, her family, and her hometown, and her lover. These \\"fights\\" are almost universal, they seem as though they could happen at any time but by placing them into the future, Piercy allows us to question the reasons for these fights at all. Are they \\"natural\\" or \\"social\\" or a mixture? Frankly I found the idea of corporations controlling most of the world except for agriculture and a few \\"free towns\\" difficult to grasp but since this isn't really the point of the story, I'm not docking points stars for that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ursula K. Le Guin, she ain't","review":"I disliked this book so much that I had to put it down after just 80 pages. As a Jew working in artificial intelligence, I found nothing even remotely compelling about Piercy's description of Jews working in artificial intelligence, and I found her ethnic stereotypes especially galling. The Jewish stereotypes were awful enough, and making the Jewish grandma into a ravenous slut didn't improve things, either. But the way that Piercy stigmatizes latinos by calling the street punks \\"ninos\\" and having them use Spanish words in their dialogue, made me really sick.Theodore Sturgeon, defending the science fiction genre against the accusation that it is 90 percent crap, replied that _everything_ is 90 percent crap. He was right about that, except that, as the dismal _He, She, and It_, suggests, with science fiction, it's more like 99 percent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Reading","review":"This book is a very hard book to follow.

I've since lost the book but plan on buying a replacement copy.I've read all 14 of the previous reviews and I have to agree with them all. Yes, feminism and an arguement against corporate - political states and male - dominated societies are present in this book. True as well that there are unfavorable stereotypes in the novel. The novel still has great merit.At its best, \\"He, She and It\\" is a thought provoking parable about the consequences of the paths we may find ourselves on. At its worst, it's a new addition to the cyberpunk genre which is far better than anything Gibson has produced to date. Whether you agree with the views expressed in the novel or not (I personally don't), the story is still an entertaining and well-written diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, Fun and Full of Surprises","review":"I asked a friend to suggest a book of the kind you can not put down.

Certainly this one has its share to offer; likeable, interesting characters, a future with some original twists, an excellent feeling for what it is like to live in a community with reasonable comfort but no security. But the conclusion here is really quite a disappointment; not one but two plot developments are essentially cut-and-pasted from the story outline with no development. Piercy has done better.All in all, worth a read if you like Piercy or enjoy thinking about cyborg theory ala Haraway. Otherwise, try Slow River."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than interesting and well-written...","review":"I read this text for a Science Fiction course I took at UCLA.

It's odd because it's clearly SF but just as clearly not written by an SF writer. Piercy is a mainstream feminist with a strong grasp of characterization and (unlike, say, recent Tepper) the ability to communicate her politics without polemics and man-hating.Anyhow, the novel is set mainly in a somewhat dystopic semi-near future, with a portion of the book alternating between the main story in the future and a retelling of the classical golem legend. In fact, the main story is quite clearly an adaption of the golem tale, not only in the notion of creating intelligent life, but in that creation being the defender of a shtetl-like town weathering a pogrom. The ending could be stronger, but the book holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study sessions, get the study guide!","review":"The DVDs for Desiring God have 10 sessions that you can go through as a group study, Sunday school class, or just by yourself.

The sessions were able to stand alone without having read the book as a precursor. There is a study guide that you can purchase separately, which I did not have. I believe it would enhance this study when doing it in a group setting.Overall the experience was favorable. I would be interested to do this study again in a group setting with the study guide. I think having multiple perspectives would only enhance my learning and growing experience.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desiring More","review":"There is a small percentage of people I know who would enjoy this 2-DVD set on Desiring God. Piper is very educational and informational in his teaching.This 2 disk DVD set had ten sessions on what it means to truly glorify God -- finding complete joy in Him. Piper was speaking to an audience of mostly older adults in an auditorium setting. He used an overhead projector as an aid in his teaching. It seems a little old and outdated, but there are little treasures throughout these DVDs.Is this worth sharing with a class? Maybe if they are older adults who like being lectured to. I would not use this with jr/sr high. Piper shared some personal struggles from when he was in college, so college age would be the youngest I would go in using these DVDs.~disclaimer: I have not read Piper's book, *Desiring God*.

When compared to other hedge fund readers this book really contributes to the hedge fund literature. Never before have I seen so many high quality papers in a hedge fund reader. I am convinced anyone interested in new research on hedge funds will find this book as the best reader presenting cutting edge work.

I know some people say you can't give this disc a low rating due to the fact that these are recordings from the 30's and 40's. Well, I say you can when there are other discs out there of the same material with sound quality that is far superior to what is offered here. If you want a good introductory disc of Pres that has a lot of material and is not too expensive check out the album \\"Lester Young: From A Cool Perspective.\\" You get over 40 songs on two discs for around $17 and the sound quality is excellent on all the cuts, especially by 1930's and 40's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound and unacceptable noise ruins great music","review":"This is the worst sounding CD I've ever heard. And I own hundreds of CDs of music from this era. Obviously Ken Burns rushed this product to market to cash in on his PBS series, without spending any time or money to find the best sources for this music, or to digitally clean up the sound. You will find much better sounding collections of this music on other CD reissues of music by Lester Young, Count Basie, and Billie Holiday. I have some of this same music on old scratched up vinyl LPs and those stll sound much better than this messed up disc. Obvoid this disc at all costs, but do search out this music elsewhere. These tunes are monumental achievements in the history of jazz. Too bad Ken Burns was content to put out such a horrible sounding product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never look at water in the same way again!","review":"I used this book extensively for a college report on the bottled water industry and found out there is a lot more to water than I thought.

It seems almost all these pond/aquarium pumps have positive and negative reviews, so I figured I'd chance it on a less expensive model. After a couple months it is still running strong. I use it with a home made wet/dry filter/sump and the 72 bow. Flow is great at 4 ft - not as much as the Turbo Sea, but adequate. Originally I was planning on getting two of these and running them in parallel, but the one is enough. At first I was a little worried by the noise of the pump, but once I submerged it in more water it became very quiet. Now my bubbler and trickling water into the filter make more noise.

Product consists of mouse cord clip, rubber mat, and plastic mousing surface. Mousing surface fits into the rubber mat, which does a good job of keeping the pad from sliding around. The rubber backing also helps deal with imperfections on the desk.Mousing surface has two sides. The 10 side is smooth, while the 30 side is rough. The 10 side provides an amount of glide matched by few other mousepads. The 30 side is not as slippery, and is meant for more easier control. The 30 side however, is very rough, and will cause significant wear on mouse feet.Because the rubber backing has borders that surround the mousing surface, certain mouse cords may drag noticeably on the borders. Proper cord management will prevent this from being a problem.Mouse cord clip is very cheaply designed and made.

Senator Kerry tells two stories, the first of his uncle who was killed in WWII. Second, his own story of growing up in Nebraska, joining the service, going to Viet Nam, being wounded and recovering. However, there is no analysis of the events past the obvious \\"Viet Nam was a mistake\\" and we were not fighting to win.

This would not even be considered adequate for VHS. Aside from the DVD quality, the camerawork is disappointing also. It is full of closeups of the conductor- and some of instrumentalists. The result is that you never get a sense of the big picture, the whole orchestra. The same could be said of the sound. It focuses on specific instruments, and sounds artificial. The performances are otherwise fairly good, though I find them a bit cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Producer/Director/Cameraman/Video Editor Ought to be SHOT!","review":"The music is great, the performance is great, and the audio is great. BUT one buys a VIDEO recording of an orchestra performing in order to SEE the orchestra performing.

Nor am I satisfied merely to be given glimpses of the various sections of the orchestra playing. Certainly not when the entire orchestra is playing!

These DVDs aren't!","review":"Herbert Von Karajan is great, but the DVDs in this series are horrible. It's good when they show him conducting, but when they cut the shot for close-ups of the instrumentalists, the picture becomes oddly much more clearer than of Von Karajan. I did not see one single segment in the entire DVD with either the entire woodwind or brass section in panaramic view. They are only shown through side views. Why is this? This made me skeptical. Then I noticed that if you watch carefully, many of the players in the close-ups of the string sections are not the same players as those in the background when Von Karajan's conducting! Some are, but most are not. This leads me to believe that these segments were inserted later and are not the same players playing with the maestro. I may be wrong, but I doubt it and I am skeptical as to the authenticity of the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an orchestra here???","review":"Very disappointing. If you are the conductor's mother, you will love this DVD. You get to see lots of close-ups of him. Occasionally you get to see close-ups of individual symphony members as well. Unfortunately, anyone close to the point of focus in the shot is completely out of focus. I watch DVDs of symphony orchestras to feel the sense, the power, of the full orchestra. If that is what you are looking for, you are going to be very disappointed. If you are a relative of the conductor, then this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best Angle book I have ever read.","review":"It was the first angel book i have read and i loved it.

Included are a couple of vocals, one with Jimmy Rushing, \\"Goin' to Chicago\\", and the immensely popular hit \\"Every day I have the Blues\\" with Joe Williams. And the sound is pretty good too, even the songs from the '30's. There is a very little hiss on some, but nothing too noticable, unlike some of the other Ken Burn's releases.

I got a book that seemed to be aimed at helping an abusive parent temper their anger. While I applaud the effort to help abusive parents control their emotions, it didn't seem to apply to any of my problems. I was concerned that I was raising my voice to my kids far too often, not that I tended to hit or scream at them.In all fairness, I couldn't get past the first few pages. Plus, I read this after I read a James Dobson book, \\"The Strong-Willed Child\\". Hands down, Dobson's book is the winner. That book taught me to deal with my children the minute they start acting up, rather than letting the anger build up and allowing myself to explode. *That* was the advice I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good reading","review":"Well, quite dissapointed with this book, I've to force myself to actually finished the whole book.

Not exactly for 3 bikes...","review":"Well, we bought this two months ago for our three bikes. My nice, light, Schwinn 26\\" (about <30 lbs), an old-school ladies 24\\" 10-speed (<30 lbs), and my son's new Aviso Blade 26\\" bike (30 lbs). This rack worked well when it was being used for just my bike and my son's. But once we added my fiance's bike to the mix, the right upright tube buckled. This proses a serious problem because with the tube now leaning away from the assembly, the small, silver bracket used to keep the trunk-mount part of the rack perpendicular to the rest of the rack, pops out. This allows the assembly to shift and almost collapse off the car; not a good thing.So, before I totally trash this product, I'll just say that as long as at least one bike is a child's bike, it \\"can\\" carry three bikes. If you're looking to carry three adult bikes, you may want to look elsewhere.By the way, the manufacturer says that the load limit on this rack is 100 Lbs.

I use if for two adult bikes on my Mazda which has a spoiler. The design of the rack does not allow for a lot of clearance over the spoiler by the two small metal braces. When I add the bikes, the rack is sitting just barely over the spoiler and when I go over bumps the rack damages the spioler and chips the paint off. Not only that, the rubber padding leaves a mark on my trunk. I wish I spent more money and got a better product. It depends on the car and the weight of the bikes you are trying to transport. If you have a car like the audi TT that is pictured you wont have issues with the metal braces. Transporting three bikes would be not be advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged my trunk","review":"I bought this rack based on the favorable review by others. However, the second time I used it, I heard a loud \\"clunk\\" as I was driving along smooth pavement.

As a result, it put a dent in my trunk, and the bike pedal put a deep gouge in my bumper.I reattached the brackets in the holes and continued home. Upon arriving, I discovered that one of the support brackets had *again* popped out of the hole, but fortunately it hadn't completely collapsed on my trunk as before.Very poor design--cannot recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I travel 20 hrs with my 3 bikes, i only adapt a 3 support in the middle and all 20hrs no even a inch of movement"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Item is ok, but had some issues.

It works great for two bikes, but I have a 2011 Dodge Avenger and the bike pedal hits my car in the closest bike holder. That is why I gave it fourstars.

The tie straps are cumbersome and you really have to work to fit the bike frame into the plastic housings. Once installed and set up with 2 bikes attached, it seemed very sturdy and ready for travel. After about 45 minutes on a busy parkway, the metal braces that hold the rack in its extended position popped out, causing the rack to slump down onto the bumper of the car, nearly dragging to the ground. Thankfully I noticed immediately and was able to pull over before the bikes and the rack went flying and caused a major accident. (As my son was in the car behind me, this anguish was multiplied.) We were able to continue the remaining 2 hours, with extreme caution, and with the braces heavily taped into place. Needless to say, the rack was returned immediately.

Detailed complaints:1) The rack is stated to carry 3 bikes but it is not big or strong enough to do so. It carries one bike OK.2) The rack lacks side straps (it should mount with 6 straps not 4) so it has no lateral support (it will shift sideways in a sharp turn).3) The upper trunk clips scratch up the trunk (other brands have thicker rubber on the clips).4) The lower clips dig into the bumper.5) The rack includes no method of securing the lower portion of the bicycles so the bikes swing in the cradles.6) The lower bumper put serious dents in my trunk!!!7) The rack requires an adapter when trying to carry a woman's bike that lacks a proper top-tube.Save your money and get a hitch mount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I ordered this on a Friday directly from Amazon, and received it Tuesday morning.

The film is marked by strong performances from some of the best actors available at that time. It is not a classic boxing movie in the traditional sense but instead it is a film which focuses on the personal and social damage associated with a sordid business.Anthony Quinn as a punchy heavyweight at the end of a long career and Jackie Gleason as his greedy, conniving manager are superb. Mickey Rooney is the boxer's trainer and Julie Harris is the employment counselor who tries to help Quinn make the transition to a life after boxing. There are cameo appearances by Cassius Clay and Jack Dempsey.Ralph Nelson also directed some other good movies such as LILIES OF THE FIELD and FATHER GOOSE. The Oscar competition in 1962 had several strong contenders.

No offense to Jack Palance, but I prefer this version without ever having to see the original TV version.I certainly don't like the sound of the editing job, and saw a different version from Netflix (and on TCM) that I am not sure if it is a re-released version or if I would be stuck with the butchered one.

They are nice and thick and the soft feel of the sheets is incredible. The thickness does not make them heavy, but luxurious. I've ordered extra sets and have given all my other sheets to Goodwill - I won't need them since I've found these! The only word of caution I would give is that the colors in the pictures are not very accurate. I have Chamois and Sage. The Chamois is a nice tan color and the Sage could be described as mint.

They are very soft and after we washed them we did find some lint, but nothing extravagant or major to talk about. We put them on the first night and felt very comfortable using just the fitted and flat sheets as blankets. They are so thick and soft, yet light enough that they do not tend to pull you down.The color seems to hold and I have no pill to speak of. At $65.00 a set, this price point makes these an excellent buy. I am going to run these through the wash a few more months and see how they hold up and if they keep impressing me like they are right now, I will most likely be buying a few more sets for next winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinzon Signature 190-Gram Flannel Sheet Set","review":"Very soft and pleased with purchase.

You will not be disaapointed with these if you are looking for good quality flannel sheets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality Flannel Sheets","review":"I received two sets of these sheets as a gift and they are amazing. The sheets are much softer than other flannel sheets I've owned in the past. They are of high quality, the flannel is strong and thick. I'm very pleased with the sheets and would definitely buy additional sets for myself or someone else. I was a little hesitant about Pinzon, a brand I'd never heard of before, but no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrinks After First Laundry Cycle","review":"First off - love, love the fabric finish. Very soft! After unpacking the sheets, I washed them (like I always do for purchased fabric items). I used the warm permanent press wash cycle, and low 40 minute dry cycle for my king sized sheet set. They did not pill. However, the set was noticeably smaller after removing them from the dryer. I have a pillow top mattress and the sheet set barely fit after the first washing. The pillow cases were a major struggle to put on my standard king pillows. I do like the feel of the sheets, but they should be either pre-shrunk, or made slightly larger than a king sized mattress to earn a \\"luxury\\" label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comfortable sheets - wash and wear well a year later","review":"We've bought 3 sets of these sheets in different sizes for us and our parents. Colors aren't always true but the sheets are comfortable and reasonably long lasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"first time user of flannel sheets","review":"These sheets are warm soft & comfortable. They fit nicely & wash well without pilling or shedding. However, my only complaint is the tan color I selected - it looks more like something fit for an army barracks or boy scout camp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheets great for first few weeks","review":"My husband and I absolutely love these sheets, however after washing them for the first time and putting them back on the bed, the fitted sheet ripped quite easily. I immediately stitched the rip on my sewing machine and we are continuing to use the sheets which are great for cold winter nights. Just disappointed that they were not better quality resisting tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soft and comfortable","review":"This is great purchase I have made on amazon. The flannel sheet set is very soft and very comfortable. When I washed it for the first time there was double the amount of fluff in the dryer than my any other normal load. But from the second time on wards it didn't leave as much fluff. My husband said that sleeping in this flannel sheet made his think of a bed in a upscale hotel.I never thought there would be such a big difference between this flannel set and my egyptian cotton set."},{"rating":"2","title":"No pilling, whole in top sheet","review":"Love these sheets. They are thick, velvety soft, and warm. The best feature is that they do not pill. Unfortunately, I had to give the item 4 stars instead of 5 because the top sheet came with a quarter size hole in it. I could have returned the item, but it wasn't worth the hassle. Check your sheets closely for holes and immediately upon receipt; returns are accepted within 30 days if there is a problem. They tend to shed a lot in the dryer so I hope they maintain their softness over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I want to spend all my time in bed","review":"These sheets are so comfortable and warm, I could be happy with them for the rest of my life. I've had sheets with 600 and 800 thread count, and none compare to these velvet flannel sheets. One of the nicest things about them is how they look. You put them on the bed and they don't wrinkle! No iron needed, and they look so smooth and perfect. They fit perfectly. They do not shrink in the wash, they hold up perfectly after repeated washings, and they feel so beautiful. I can't imagine a better sheet. I'm so lucky to have found these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable!","review":"These sheets are the most comfortable sheets I have ever used. They fit my deep, pillow-top mattress very well. Even with an additional 4-inch memory foam on top of the mattress they don't slip off and still fit very nicely. They wash well without pilling and are very soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Softest sheets ever!","review":"'Nuf said. We love these sheets. The first set we got had a little hole in the flat sheet but we rushed to get a replacement. Sooo soft!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made","review":"Silky flannel sounds like an oxymoron but it's true in this case. I am thrilled about the quality of these sheets and also happy to have selected a product made in Europe! Time will tell about how these wear, but I was so thrilled with the feel of these sheets that I ordered the duvet cover. I will follow up with my review after repeated use but at this point, I have no hesitation about recommending this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these flannel sheets","review":"I was very apprehensive purchasing flannel sheets without having the opportunity to feel and see them but what a pleasant surprise these have been. I purchased the queen size in sage green. I love the color and they are soft, heavy and well constructed. I hope the elastic in the fitted sheet lasts longer than the local flannel sheets I have purchased but if the quality is anywhere neat the stitch quality of the seams and fabric, I have nothing to worry about. Functionally, the sheets are so soft and warm, I find myself sleeping later than I ever have in the past. I will definitely purchase these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinzon Sinature 190 Gram Velvet Flannel King Sheet Set","review":"Great quality, washes perfectly and what I really loved is the size and the coziness of these sheets. The color was very rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soft","review":"These are AMAZINGLY comfortable sheets. They fit my 10\\" deep mattress \\"slightly\\" loose, but there are no issues with them riding up and coming off.I wanted to give it 5 stars, but the \\"smokey blue\\" that I ordered, is a turquoise green... like the ocean in Southern California. Not the most appealing, but I don't care that much because they are SOOOO comfortable.I'll definitely buy another set, just gotta figure out the right color...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, better than my Pinzon 600 threadcount Sheets","review":"I bought this after reviewing so many positive reviews and was satisfied after using it for a week. I washed the set when I received it, there were some lints but only a small amount. This is very soft and warm. It doesn't get too hot either. I'm able to sleep comfortably on it without any problems so far. Highly recommend this!

With Winter coming along these sheets will make me late for work more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"While I will have to wait to see how these bear up under regular use, I must say that they were fine out of the box and after a first wash. I particularly liked the fact that they were plenty long enough to tuck in: no shaving inches to save fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinzon 190 gram flannel","review":"Great price, great comfort,We have another set of flannel sheets...Pinzon 200 gram. I honestly can not tell the difference between the 190 and the 200. We machine wash and dry and have not had any problems. The sheets come out soft and fluffy and smooth. I wanted the dark color. All of our other sets are light colors and prints. I'm tired of sleeping with flowers, birds, stripes.(sorry that was an attempt at some humor) We decided we wanted to try something different with the darker color. No regrets. I'm sure it is just psychological but the bed feels warmer. Dark colors may not be to everyone's likings but our next set will also be dark. However I think we'll stick to the lighter shades and prints for the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy Cozy","review":"I have bought a lot of flannel sheet sets over the years from cheap department store sets to catalog orders. I must say that these sheets are THE BEST I have ever owned. I love them! They are so thick and soft. When you slip between the sheets at night you notice how good they feel. I'm so glad I have these. I bought a couple of sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I'd love sheets so much!","review":"We bought these sheets at the beginning of 2012. It is now September, and we haven't taken the sheets off the bed except to wash them. They are unbelievably comfortable. We liked them so much we didn't change them when the weather warmed up; we couldn't bear the thought of sleeping between anything else! They are not too hot, although we keep the bedroom pretty cold at night. I would highly recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets! warm, comfortable, durable, high-quality, high-value","review":"Have had these sheets for almost a year. They're great. The elastic all around the fitted sheet makes a difference. I've washed every week and the sheets are holding up well. The sheets recommend a warm wash. For the last few months, I've been washing in hot water for allergies. These sheets have help up better than others I have. Also, these sheets don't really wrinkle, which is nice. I only wish they would make this product in other sizes besides King and Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Soft !","review":"These flannel sheets are amazingly soft and warm.

I then decided that we needed a set on our bed at home. If you do not use an electric blanket these sheets are great in the winter as they are not cold like regular cotton sheets. They are soft and very comfortable. They do pill and release lint when washed. Too early to tell how bad the pilling will be. Stay tuned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and comfortable.","review":"These were bought sight unseen and I and my wife were PLEASANTLY surprised. Great quality, super comfortable and hold up very well with washing.

I'm pretty pleased so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm leaving a trail!","review":"I'm pretty dissapointed with this purchase. I washed these prior to their first use and the first night we slept on them they left droppings everywhere. (Including on us, hence the trail when walking away from the bed.) After two additional washings and I guess 20 or so nights on the bed they're still doing it. At this rate they're going to worn slap through before too long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and quality","review":"We love these sheets.

You can't go wrong with these sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior, comfortable, durable","review":"This is the second time I've bought Pinzon sheets when the price got within my range. I almost never use any sheets but flannel, and these are the best I've ever used. The ones I bought a year and a half ago have still never become pilly. When they are brand new, they OF COURSE shed some lint-- anyone who has had flannel sheets expects this-- but these do not wear out fast the way cheaper sheets do. These were a gift for my stepfather, who loved the color, warmth and softness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best flannel sheets ever!","review":"I surprised my husband with these sheets.

They are the thickest and softest flannel I have ever felt. I am about to wash them for first use so will report back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Just bought these sheets and will be returning them as they are not true flannel sheets. I should have known better as the word 'velvet flannel' is used in the description. As the name implies, these sheets really do feel like velvet (or microsuede) - which is fine if you don't care whether you have the real thing or not. But I want traditional flannel for winter so I will keep looking until I find what I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheds tons of fiber","review":"This sheet set had very good reviews on Amazon. I shop from Amazon all the time, and my decisions are mostly based on user reviews. But I have to say, this time I was extremely disappointed.First of all, the fabric does not feel soft. It does not feel comfortable on skin. But more importantly, it constantly sheds fibers. This gives me allergies and irritation. Even though I washed the set many times, it just keeps shedding fibers and eventually I stopped using them. Is it only me, or did you have a similar issue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very comfortable but faded with first wash","review":"these sheets are not color fast. they faded in splotches with the first wash.

I used to have alot of blankets on my bed to stay warm in the winter but after I bought the sheets I had to take some off because I was too hot. I was also impressed with how they fit my deep mattress. All my other flannel sheets almost don't fit. If you are looking for flannel sheet you must buy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy","review":"Overall, the quality of the sheets is very good. They are soft, wash well, and are generously sized to fit my thick mattress. The only negative I have is that they pick up a lot of lint and critter fur. Not a huge problem, but it would be nice if they attracted a little less of the fuzzy stuff. However, they are very soft and cozy and that is what I was looking for. (I purchased the Aubergine color - very rich and a good match to the color you see on Amazon.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine.","review":"We've used them for a couple of months now. Soft, warm.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and thick","review":"This set is very soft, fits but barely fits our 13\\" mattress & the flannel is thick. It's so thick it is almost a very very thin blanket. The whole bunch is heavy to pull out of the washer and put into the dryer. We didn't like the no give taut regular sheets on our new memory foam mattress so wanted to try flannel. Bought this set because of the great reviews and it works for us.

This one seems to get the best review and also the most reasonable priced. I was a little worried before the sheets arrived but after receiving the set, I was very relieved. The flannel sheets are thick, smooth, warm and cozy, just like the description, also was made in Portugal. There are firm elastic bands around all 4-side of the fitted sheet, a sign of good quality sheet (since many companies cut corner at this step). Upon looking closely, all the stitches are made perfectly. It certainly made the bed warmer (temperature-wise), and very snuggly. I would recommend this sheet set."},{"rating":"2","title":"blue flannel sheets","review":"I purchased these for my son who lives in Alaska, has a Cal king bed and 18 inch mattress. He called and said ,\\"Mom, you hit a home run with these sheets\\". They are deep enough for the mattress, and the softness was great.

Not bad for a day's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Velvet Flannel Sheets","review":"I ordered these sheets and although they are extremely nice they do pill up. I washed them prior to first using them and have washed them twice since. After a few days on the bed I had to vaccum all the pill balls up before I could remove them to wash again. I like them better than most flannel sheets I have purchased in the past and will see what happens after a few more washings. I cannot recommend them at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sheets!","review":"These sheets are perfection! Washed them on arrival, came out of the dryer soft, few wrinkles (I removed them immediately), no fading and no pilling. Less lint in the lint catcher after drying then expected and none when in use on the bed. The weight is perfect (for our Minnesota fall and winters), but would be too heavy for summer. The color is just as shown, a beautiful rich blue. Generous in size; worked beautifully with our very oversized queen mattress. So far, cannot beat them for the quality and price. I cannot speak to how they wear as I haven't had them long enough, but from what I have seen so far after a few washings they appear to wash and wear well (I always use cold water and dry on low) And, as usual, Amazon had them here in a flash! I would recommend these sheets to anyone. Love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SO SMOOTH","review":"I was looking for some new sheets and I love flannel. I didn't even realize that they made a velvet flannel. The reviews for these sheets were really great, so I ordered a set in cream. I feel like the color is exactly what is shown. When I first opened the package and felt them I was sold. They were so soft, and smooth and like no other sheets I had ever felt. They washed up really nice and still felt and looked smooth and brushed. Then I was doubly sold when I slept on them the first night. Because it seems like every time you find something you really love they discontinue it I decided to order myself a second set. I wasn't too excited about the other colors, so I ordered another cream set and,I am debating on ordering a third set. My favorite sheets I have ever had, and I have had some I didn't think could be beat !"},{"rating":"2","title":"deep pocket","review":"I read almost every review on these sheets prior to purchase. My main concern was how deep the pockets were. Our mattress is 17\\" thick and I wanted to be sure the sheets I ordered would be able to fit on our mattress. I finally decided, after much research, to order the Pinzon 190-Gram Velvet Flannel sheets. They washed very nicely and yes, you do need to clean the lint trap on your dryer a few times the first time you dry them. They fit the mattress and felt wonderful. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I noticed they shrunk a bit on the 2nd washing and fit the mattress a little tighter. I'm washing them as per the directions and drying on low heat. Since they were reasonably priced, I will be happy if I'm able to use them for the rest of the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm!","review":"These sheets are the bomb! Soft, warm, and snuggly.

The fabric is soft and the fitted sheet has wonderfully deep pockets. So far it seems to be a good buy. My only complaint is the color. The color is a true deep camel color.

This sheet set makes it difficult to get out of bed in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"These sheets are so comfortable, smooth and just the right amount of warmth!

We love their velvety warmth. I am somewhat of a sheet snob and just love them! I also bought these to go on my guest beds. I ordered 3 sets total!

Do yourself a favor and just buy them; you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE sheets!","review":"Ordered these sheets based on the recommendations of other reviewers, and we are very pleased with them.

I find them to keep us both warm without making me too hot. And my wife no longer needs the heavy quilt blanket. I am ordering another set before they disappear. The best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soft and comfy","review":"Sheets are velvety soft, and the fitted sheet is generous, but the top sheet is not. It is long enough but I would prefer a wider sheet for better coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"After reading the reviews I expected to have to work on this sheet set to obtain what I was after, soft sheets that do freeze you on contact in the winter. The only thing I did different and because of other reviews, was adding a little extra fabric softener to the wash when I got them out package but I can not even say it was necessary. Very happy customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coziest sheets ever!","review":"This is my second set of these I love them so much. We are still using the first set and they have held up very well over the last several years. They are hands down the best sheets I've ever bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought about sending them back","review":"I'm a fan of flannel sheets. When I got these, the texture was so very different that I'm used to, that I was going to send them back because I felt I was misled by the ad. Then I realized that they are listed as the VELVET flannel. I read other reviews that raved about them, so I kept them. Glad I did!! They are warmer and thicker than the cheaper traditional flannel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Sheets","review":"This is our second set of these sheets. We have very thick mattress at 19\\" and these sheets fit great. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love these sheets!","review":"We love flannel sheets and use them exclusively all year round. These are now our favorites. They are soft and velvety and wash beautifully with no pilling. We have put in an advance order for two more sets to arrive in October."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Flannel Sheets","review":"I have washed them several times. I have an apartment stackable washer dryer. Not very big. I didn't have to empty the lint basket half way thru like I have for other sheets. They are sooo soft. I love going to bed. They haven't pilled, the color is great. They are the best ever! Ordered a another set just to have them.They don't make things this good for this price anymore and I didn't want to say I wish I had gotten another set back them. Can't say enough good about then."},{"rating":"2","title":"SILKY SOFT","review":"THESE SHEETS ARE TOTALLY WONDERFUL. NOT TOO HOT. JUST SO COMFORTABLE. GOING TO BUY ANOTHER SET. NO PILLING, NO FUZZ IN THE FLOOR, NO COMPLAINTS. LUXURIOUS. FIT AN 18\\" MATTRESS GREAT, ELASTIC ALL THE WAY AROUND ON THE FITTED SHEET. DOESN'T CRAWL OFF THE MATTRESS EITHER. LOVE THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK -- will update after more wear","review":"So, OK, these are flannel sheets, a full notch above in terms of quality that I already own (from Kohl's and Target). But, my gosh, the list price is so, way over-stated. They would be a bargain at 30 bucks, and OK for 40. I don't think I would pay fifty for them, but I could imagine that as a sale price at a department store like Macy's.I just washed them & put a king set on my bed. They washed up nicely. The fitted sheet has deep pockets and fits my mattress fine. But the flat sheet's width shrank a bit, which was disappointing. The king set also came with two king cases. I deducted a * for the shrinkage.I will update my review after wear & several washes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend","review":"Save your money! These sheets are over-priced for what you get. They feel like a thin piece of felt. I'm genuinely surprised at how many positive reviews have been given for these. Sixty dollars for what are basically cheap Walmart sheets is too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinzon 190 gram","review":"O-M-G!!LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these sheets!!I have had LOTS of flannel sheets in my time, but these are thicker, smoother, fit better, and dont pill.I've washed the first set I bought well over ten times now, and still no pilling.One word describes them - AWESOME!HIGHLY recommended!!I'm buying 2 more sets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality, but odd color","review":"The sheets are actually pretty good quality--soft and pretty substantial weight for the price. We've been using them for two to three months and so far no pilling or notable thinning.The only disappointment was the color: we bought the \\"Cream\\" sheets, thinking they'd be a close color match for our \\"natural\\" ones. Not even close--the sheets we got were a bit darker...more like \\"Latte.\\" Not a big problem unless you have other bed linens you're trying to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped after 2 uses...","review":"Had these sheets for one month, washed in the washing machine twice using manufacturer's instructions. Bottom sheet has 2 small rips in them already. I missed my return window by one week. $60 down the trash. Will never buy sheets this expensive again. Save your money and buy a pair of less expensive sheets. They will probably last longer than a month...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best flannel sheets we've slept on!","review":"Love the length and depth.

They are so soft and warm and really good quality. Sometimes flannel sheets can feel thin and cheap but these are excellent. Worth every penny. Thinking about getting another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Comfy","review":"Definitely super comfortable. The only downside is that when I put the fitted sheet on the mattress the elastic band let loose so now the sheet rides up.

I have recommended them to others and they also love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality sheets","review":"Bought these to replace junk bought from Overstock-Excellent sheets- sure they lint a bit first few washes, they all do....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo Soft and Fluffy!","review":"I bought the 190-gram cotton velvet flannel queen sheet set for my sister. She said they are wonderful! They are so soft and fluffy after washing and drying - and if folded right after drying are nice and smooth - no wrinkles. They are a nice weight and not thin or scratchy - again - sooooo soft and fluffy!! And the color seems to stay true even after washing. She especially liked the heavy duty elastic that is all around the bottom of the fitted sheet - fits well - stays on snug. This is the second set I have purchased for her - this time with extra sets of king sized pillow cases which she also loves. An awesome product for a very, very good price. No problems with giving this product 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice soft sheets that smell like oil","review":"Nice soft flannel sheets that out of the plastic wrap smelled like oil. I washed them six times, left them outside on a line for three days in the wind and sun and still they smelled like oil. So i can't recommend unless you enjoy the smell of oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sheets, horrible color (Chamois)!!!","review":"Ordered the Chamois color sheets for our new bed and bedroom set. Based on the pictures online I figured they were a tan/camel color which would go nicely with our Espresso finished furniture. When I got them however, they were pretty yellowish... almost mustard like. My first response was yuck, and I thought about returning them but our bed was coming the next day and there would be no way to get new sheets in time.Even though I hate the color, I must admit the sheets are comfy. My husband could care less that they clash with our bedroom so I'll probably just reorder the cream color and use this set as a back up.**Also, use caution when washing/drying the first time as they do shed a lot (I mean a LOT) of lint with the first run through. I had to empty my lint tray 3 times when drying to prevent it getting plugged up.**"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment After the Wait","review":"Bought this sheet set in December and was wowed by the substantial feel of the sheets. They were soft and warm and wonderful and I wanted more. The new set came today, but the quality was not same. The new sheets are thin and smooth and don't have that \\"feel.\\" What happened? The sheets were out of stock for 2 months, perhaps the manufacturer changed. Amazon, though, is amazing with their easy return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected: Lacks \\"Warm and Fuzzy\\" Feeling","review":"I'm a flannel sheet fan, but I like a \\"warm and fuzzy\\" quality in them. To me, it's the degree of cushiony softness that makes a great flannel; it feels softer and warmer. I should have interpreted the description of these sheets better. \\"Velvet\\" is one clue, \\"most pill-resistant flannel available\\" is another. Both indicate less \\"fluffiness\\" to the flannel and, thus, less of a \\"warm and fuzzy\\" feeling (in carpeting terms, these would be \\"low pile\\"). Still, these sheets are soft, heavy, generously sized and have a quality feel about them. I will use them in my rotation, but for now, the best flannel sheets I have found are the Woolrich 100% cotton ones sold by Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great quality, but not deep enough to fit my bed","review":"These sheets are great quality & very comfortable to sleep on! Unfortunately, they are not deep enough for my bed. For a 14 inch mattress (& topper included), these 16 inch sheets still do not remain in place & fitted sheet comes loose from underneath my mattress. I should've returned them for deeper pocketed sheets, but they have already been washed & used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Favorite Sheets Ever!!","review":"I recently purchased my fifth set of these sheets and I will be purchasing more for family as xmas gifts. They are so soft, warm and wash beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheds like crazy","review":"The velvet is extremely warm (perhaps a little bit too warm) and soft. However, within a few days, it started shedding like crazy. Now, my entire floor is filled with little pieces of the material and my clothes, hair, etc. are all covered when I get up in the morning. I kind of look like I just was under a snow machine. Hopefully a wash or two will take care of it, but I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinzon sheet review","review":"Love them........they feel wonderful after washed........would definitely buy more They are so warm and comfortable on the bed. Will order more thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice sheets","review":"Purchased these for my teen who graduated to a larger bed to match his growing frame. The color is as depicted and the sheets are very soft and warm. We are noticing a bit of piling after only a few washes which kept me from giving these sheets 5 stars. However, I would definitely purchase these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick","review":"These are really thick warm sheets. They are wide enought to tuck in on the sides.

I read alot of the reviews and several people said it's hard to get out of bed and I totally agree. The sheets are soooo soft and warm you really don't want to get out of bed. I used to get flannel sheets when they went on clearance and they would always ball up, these so far have not done that and I don't think they will. If you order them you will not regret it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great sheets","review":"A beautiful set of flannel sheets-very soft-wash up great. Love the fitted sheet with elastic all around-fits like a glove on deep pillow top mattress. Would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sheets I've ever owned","review":"I bought these when they were on sale and I thought I would gamble a little. My wife wanted flannel sheets and all the ones we had ever bought were thin, cheap, and pilled after a while. These were super soft, thick, and down right luxurious. I bought these in 2008 and we are still using them to this day (late 2011) and they are still holding up just great. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"This is our second set of Pinzon flannel sheets -- the first set spoiled us and we didn't want to swap them off for washing. We have an extra foam pad on our king-size mattress and they fit great and stay in place. We don't have king-size pillows, so also bought two sets of standard pillow cases. They were shipped separately, but came in the same time and the color match is great.The most important factor, of course, is comfort. They're warm and cozy, perfect for Ohio winters. They feel like a real splurge, but if you catch them on sale, they're not that much more than the cheaper flannel sheets that only last a season -- if you're lucky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Lessons for Kids....","review":"How can adults cover every lesson each child needs through life? Start with this series, \\"Book of Virtues.\\" My niece and nephew are 4 & 7 and love them. They are truly terrific videos with loving, calming messages.

I just dont understand how some people dont like this triogy so far. Granted the writing style of David R George is a little different than most star trek writers. so if you can look past the writing style there is still a good story there.

Despite moments of disconnectedness between chapters (and within the chapters sometimes), I think Ismail provides interesting insights on the \\"state\\" and the relationships between the rulers and the ruled in a Middle Eastern city. Her take on gender, youth, and mediation with the everyday state is fascinating. I particularly enjoyed reading chapter 4, which seems to be well thought of. Despite emphasizing \\"space\\" as an integral component of her research, I do not really fully concur with her theoretical framing of how to understand space, and I found it a bit lacking, marginalizing great theorists of place and space that don't get mentioned here. Nevertheless, it remains a very good and refreshing work tackling issues of governmentality, religion, informality, gender, and urban space in the Middle East. I very much enjoyed reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's meaning in there somewhere ...","review":"There's meaning in there somewhere only I can't find it for all the words. The thing is I really wanted to like this book but I can't seem to get past chapter two.The Author simply uses too many words to say the simplest things. And seems to hide everything behind several layers of imagery. It may be vivid imagery, and quite poetic, but the end result is confusion.A lovely first draft really but not a book that I could get anything out of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craft of The Wild Witch: Green Spirituality & Natural Enchantment","review":"Poppy Palin has written a very inspired, sensitive and intelligent book about the real meaning of living a life as a wild witch, at the most essential level. The book is so well written and well organized, and completely brought me back to my green spirituality, which in my everyday \\"overload\\" of work, media, telephone, etc. I had lost touch with without even realizing it. Poppy Palin brought me back. Since reading her book I have changed my priorities completely. Poppy Palin is very articulate, and has a beautiful very readable writing style. The only thing missing from this book was Poppy's delightful artwork, which would have been such a treat, but which were not included as she wanted to focus on the importance of the text. Poppy is a wonderful artist, however, and it is worth seeing her website for inspiration. I look forward to reading her other books !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good at explaining...","review":"I got this book as a gift, although if I didn't, I probably would've bought it on my own eventually. I like Palin's writing style; her descriptions are beautiful and wordy, and she explains (very often) what it means to be a Wild Witch and what it means to live your life as one. She gives tips on protection magic and a lot of basics of green witchery. There aren't many exercises and rituals in the book, which is what I found to be the most disappointing thing about it.If you're interested in green witchery, this is a good book to get, but should be supplemented with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free spirited witchcraft at it's best","review":"If you are looking for non-restricted, non-dogmatic information on the art of wild witchery than you have found the right book. Poppy is very articulate and her words are easy to comprehend. She truly writes from a stand point of love and she completely lacks pretention. You will not be disappointed when you read this wonderful, makes you feel good, book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful BUT","review":"Both salt shaker and pepper mill are large, colorful and very attractive BUT not functional.

The reader starts thinking about this big mystery and she solves it in two parragraphs. I think Mrs. Taylor Bradford is more interested in the money she gets when she finishes the book than in its content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy this","review":"I got this from the library as an audio book and first off, the reader is absolutely HORRIBLE, one of the worst I've ever heard. Plus she sounds extremely old and the characters of the book are around 30, so that was weird to start with. I can't even describe her horrible reading style--just awful.I'm already bored to death with the whole thing. The background info on the characters is so long and dragged out and pathetic. I wish I had read the reviews before I even bothered checking it out from the library. I can't finish this awful mess and it takes alot for me NOT to finish an audio book.Who, at the publisher's reads these books? Could they possibly think this was good???? Or is it the usual case of an established author can produce any kind of drivel and they print it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 weeks of being anoyed","review":"I chose 3 weeks in Paris because I like to read about modern women and I love Paris and I even enjoy a good romance novel now and again but this has got to be by far one of the worst books I have ever read! It started out alright in fact i really enjoyed it until the prologue ended. The book may have been passable had I been a ble to stand the main character Alexa but there was just something about her that made me want to ring her neck! It may have been the fact that everytime she said or thought something she sounded like someone who knew they were good at something but were trying to be modest in order to get attention. I have a strong feeling that Barbara Bradford is a very superficial woman and I dont think I will be reading another one of her books if I can help it. I would strongly recomend you stay away from this book or if you absolutly have to read it rent it from the library, dont waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just So Much Drivel!!","review":"Since I consider \\"Woman of Substance\\" to be a benchmark in women's fiction, I have read most of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books. \\"Three Weeks in Paris\\" was an utter disappointment and a waste of money. This 'essay' is such a sophomoric attempt that it is hard to believe she actually wrote it. It is filled with cliches, errors, repeated information and a very weak plot. The beginning showed some promise but before long it seemed the author got tired of writing and decided to wrap up quickly and go on to something more interesting.What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...tastic","review":"Every page of this book is filled with cliches and the most superficial content I've ever read. The most enjoyable part is on pages 134-35 where Anya is descibed (on page 134) with eyes that are \\"a lovely blue\\" and on page 135, she focuses her \\"light-green eyes\\" intently. The \\"plot\\" is boring and the writing is shockingly trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I checked this book out at the library!","review":"This story centers around 4 women who are were best friends in Sedgwick's School of Art. By invitation they return to Paris 7 years later. These women are so boring and you can't avoid not predicting the outcome of the story. The author spent an enormous amount f inki describing these characters and Paris; its streets, café and even the lamps that I began to think I was reading a tour guide instead of a novel. My suggestion is that you go to local library and check it out and form your own opinion, because its hard for me to believe that this book ever got published. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are too many books to read to waste your time on this","review":"This book could have been half as long if you take out all the long boring descriptions of everything. BTB gives way too much information about what the room looks like, what the characters are wearing, etc. Using your imagination is one of the great things about reading a book. I should have learned from the last BTB book I read. This one is the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have read all of Ms. Bradford's books; and enjoyed most of them. I had to try to keep from nodding off while reading this one. I would have liked to learn more about each of the characters; and less about the \\"lovely\\" Paris. There just was not the substance to this book that I expected from this author.Reading about room appointments and descriptions of homes and places I can get from any decorating or travel book. A good story line is what fiction is all about. I will be cautious about the next book by Ms. Bradford."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived and predictable","review":"I have never read one of Bradford's books before but this one called to me from the shelves. It was a story I was eager to read. By the time I was into chapter 4, I was embarrassed to tell people I had purchased it. The conversations sounded like horrible soap operas: pathetic and overly-detailed compliments. The reason for the characters' fight was weak and all actions were pre-determined. I wouldn't read any more of her books. Don't even think about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"expect to be bored","review":"... The characters are flat, the story unexciting, and the events very predictable. I decided not to give up on it because I believed it would get better. I was wrong.

I can't believe the author of \\"A Woman of Substance\\" could come up with such banality. The so-called fued was a joke, and the ending was so sweet it made my teeth hurt. I'm sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words to describe this book.......","review":"I enjoy Barbara Taylor Bradford\`s books immensely and this one is no exception. Anya the mentor to these girls, made me wish I had a special person like that in my life. I have only two words to describe this book, it is \\"purely feminine!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring","review":"This is a novel that I began b/c I adore books about Paris. Plus, I have read some other Bradford books and enjoyed them. This novel feels incomplete; characters are flat and the storylines are are wrapped up too neatly for my taste. In particular, the Alexa character gets on my nerves- too perfect to be true. Bradford presents us with scenarios that could be interesting (all the women have great careers) but are undeveloped. Only one plotline truly touched me and even that was rushed through. Paris isn't even that integral a part of the book! Thankfully, the book reads quickly. I recommend THe Last Time I saw Paris by Elizabeth Adler instead of this book if you are looking for something romantic, interesting and with more vivid Parisian scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Boring","review":"Boring story, forgettable characters and lots of French words. Pretentious to the extreme. I checked it out from the library, it was worth every penny and not one penny more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book was one of the worst I have read in a long time. Don't waste your money! It was extremely short and most of it was spent introducing the characters, none of which were interesting. The 'huge fight' that separated the 4 main characters was insignificant, none of them could even remember the exact details. These women were selfish and immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Boring","review":"Please do not waste time on reading this one.

About 30 minutes into it I was thinking that an abridged version would have been better. This is a story about self-absorbed women who are talented, but still need men to \\"rescue\\" them. It ends happily-ever-after with handsome men and gifts of jewelry. I particularly hated the part about the woman with the weight issue. It did pass the time on the road and saved me from bad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This isn't the worst book I've ever read but it's very close. The story is about four former friends who haven't spoken to each other in seven years but will be reunited when they celebrate their mentor's eighty-fifth birthday. What makes this book so bad is the fact that you don't care about any of the characters. All of their tribulations are all summarized so you don't experiance them with the girls.The feud that tore apart their \\"strong\\" bonds was juvenile and pathetic, worthy of only junior high students. One of the biggest beefs I had with the book is the fact that Alexa leaves America engaged to a fabulous guy and then hooks up with her old flame. Suddenly they're together and you never hear another word about Jack. In fact by the end of the book you're not sure she's even called him to break off the engagement.If you feel like you absolutely must read this monstrosity, borrow it from the library and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TOO GREAT","review":"Sorry I did not wait to buy this book used. Was not worth the full price I paid.....The main characters were very predictable and kind of boring....You know from the start where this story is going....Too much descriptions of the streets of Paris and houses....The story is about four women who return to Paris 7 years after graduating from Anya Sedgwick's School of Decorative Art....These women were best friends while attending school, but had a terrible fight and left after graduating. each persuing her own life and career without contacting each other all the years since..... They each received an invitation to attend their beloved teacher, Anya's 85th birthday party......They all attended and the rest of the story is spent rekindling old memories and revisiting all their old haunts.....etc. etc...If you want to read this book I suggest you borrow it from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same author?","review":"This author just can't be the same person who wrote \\"A Woman of Substance.\\" It was such a tremendous book but they have gone down hill from there and has now ended up in the bottom of the barrel.This book spends much time developing the characters, but when you find out what the \\"big quarrel\\" was, you just want to say, \\"Get over it\\". This is a quarrel high school girls would consider major and these characters (30+) carried on for 7 years over that little incident? It was a disappointing and boring book. You would be wise to save your money. If you must read it, get it from the library -- but believe me, nothing happens in it. How do the author's get these types of books published? Because their names will sell anything - boo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the movie \\"Beaches\\"?","review":"This book reminds me a lot of that movie, which I loved. In this book about friendship and love we find four friends who have not communicated with each other in many years.Once upon a time, these friends were inseparable. They attended the same Art school and you never saw one without one of the others. That is, until one of them makes the others cannot forgive. Eventually none of the four are even speaking to each other until a surprise FED-EX envelope mysteriously appears, forcing them together again - to hate or to love. Each girl has a story of her own. Each girl believes without doubt she is right, and each has a story never told. But there just may be magic in the air in the form of an 85 year old lady named Anya. Watch for a surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"irony-free zone","review":"Three Weeks in Paris deserves its bad reviews.

In describing (and describing and DESCRIBING!)their world of unreal glamour, the author seems to have made a deal with every upscale product placement company. Characters' motivations are petty. I did listen to the whole thing (albeit using fast-forward on the library's CD as often as I could). Afterwards, I feel as if I have eaten six dozen twinkies. What junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad!","review":"A Woman of Substance, which I thoroughly enjoyed, is the only other work I've read by Mrs. Bradford. So, when I checked out the audiobook of Three Weeks in Paris from the library, I was looking forward to good read (listen??). Even a reader as excellent as Barbara Rosenblat couldn't make this book better.The characters were all self-centered, soulless, shallow, and unsympathetic. I never want to encounter any of these people. I should have stopped listening, but it was like a train wreck--I was mesmorized by the horror!This is not a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange anti-rationalism","review":"This book is the most rabid attack on rationalism that I have ever read. Shestov seems to be out to get all of the \\"great\\" philosophers, particulary Emanuel Kant. Kant put forth that all religion must be scrutinized under the microscope of rational thought. Shestov makes the point that no religion could withstand this scrutiny, and that we would then be essentially making logic the religion.Shestov's text, having been written by a Russian Jew, provides a point of view that most Americans would find extremely unfamiliar. This is not a book for the faint of heart, one must be prepared to view Western \\"thought worship\\" in a whole new light. This is a mind-expanding work. PS I have never seen a philosophy curriculum on-line or during my schooling that included this man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to make, delicious, appetite satisfying recipes.","review":"From skillet-roasted chicken with black-eyed peas and savory to a one-pot Beef, Bean and Barley Casserole, Bean Bible is packed with a range of bean dishes from appetizers to side dishes and desserts, and will please any who want to use the versatile bean as a staple in their diet. No photos, but the easy recipes don't need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, lovely book for food lovers","review":"This book is quickly becoming one of my favorite cookbooks. Each recipe begins with a descriptive paragraph containing historical information about the dish or specific recollections from the author as to the origin or the travels that led to its creation. It is imaginative, innovative, and very informative. I really love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional, literate mystery","review":"Homer Kelly has come to Nantucket to complete his study of the men who sailed with Melville. When poetess, Katherine Clark, is arrested for the murder of her ex-lover's beautiful new wife, Homer is asked to help find the real murderer. As he investigates, it turns out that the beautiful new wife, Helen Boatwright Green was keeping secrets that someone would kill to protect. When you read some of her descriptions, especially those involving the natural world, there is a lovely moment of recognition, of her descriptions being exactly right. This is the second in her Homer and Mary Kelly series and is considered to be her best novel by many critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Book by Good Author","review":"Jane Langton's series of Homer Kelly mysteries is excellent; this book is weak. The characters are thin, the plot is disappointing, the atmosphere lacks her usual charm. Langton's a very enjoyable writer, but this book does not demonstrate it.If you've read and enjoyed the others, you'll probably want to read this to complete the series. If you haven't read any of her books yet, pick a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mystery based on an incredible coincidence disappoints","review":"Langton's picture of Nantucket is vaguely matching my own recent memories, although she succeeds in making it duller than it was for me. More than that, the story begins with a scene that is explained as an incredible coincidence pointing to our heroine as the murderer. I kept thinking, \\"No, this is a device to mislead me\\" but it was not the clever intricacy I'd been waiting for. It was just plain silliness. This is not just a small problem; this is the kind of mystery in which one must suspend commonsense. Some people can accept that fantasyland escapism. For them I've got a great bridge to Brooklyn cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing plotline undermines scenic thriller","review":"This mystery takes place on Nantucket Island, which I've visited. And the feel of the island is nicely drawn by Langton, if not with particular colorfulness. the incredible coincidence at the core of the mystery, however, undermines the novel. It demands a leap of \\"faith\\", that is, fantasy beyond any degree of realism, which I was not willing to take. In a nutshell: Langton, here, can't tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIY was needed for my road bike","review":"Initially the attachments did not fit my road bike.

I can hardly wait for this Summer when there isn't a pile of two feet of snow with slick ice under it to start working on all of her exercises! After reading Kursinki's masterpiece, it is much easier to under what your horse is doing, an how he feels about what is happening rather than letting yourself get frustrated with your horse, you know what to do to make his work happier and effective at the same time. I like that she lays out a weekly schedule, and it is easy to customize to your own lifestyle and horses needs. Anne's book is really step by step, complete with great pictures and lots of explanations to go along with them. I would for sure suggest this book to any rider past the beginner stage, especially if you are self taught. I am also looking forward to using some of these techniques with my students!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intermediate Rider's Bible","review":"This book exceeded my expectations. As an intermediate rider, the combination of multiple illustrations and accompaning technical commentary is instrumental. This book covers basic flat work and jumping and makes the \\"upward transition\\" to advanced work. Anne Kursinski's written style uses common sense and visual imagery. After reading each chapter, I couldn't wait to try out her techniques on my horse.If you want to become more connected with your horse through feel and athletic ability, this book will work for you.Anne teaches you to communicate with your horse physically and emotionally. A combination that is essential but understated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone who rides english!","review":"This book was excellent! It's perfect for anyone riding english weather you haven't even taken a lesson or you've been riding for 10 years! It's very in depth and will help you perfect your riding. It teachs the basics to advanced dressage and jumping. It includes great pictures and explains everything very well, and anyone can understand it. I HIGHLY reccomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Prefer George Morris","review":"I bought this book at the same time as \\"Hunter Seat Equitation\\" by George Morris. I much prefered Morris' style of presenting information and have been able to incorporate pieces of it much faster. Kursinski's approach to this book, essentially telling the reader to tell his or her instructor what to do, did not work well with me. Try telling a \\"lead mare\\" what to do in her own barn! From personal experience telling your trainer that a book determined your training program is not a bright thing to do.

So, I'm thinking, if they claim a 25 mile range, certainly that's under optimal conditions. With this in mind, I was sure these would work for me at a range of at least 15% of their claim. That's about 3 3/4 miles. Surely if they claim a range of 25, I can get 3 3/4, right? WRONG!I live in a small town with small short buildings, no sky scrapers etc. Very few obstructions in fact.

Obviously anything said during that time period is lost. Could live with that except when utilizing the VOX capability.

The weight is well balanced and they are thin enough so that you can practically place darts on top of each other without messing them up.

I would feel confident reaching for them in a pinch if my main darts developed issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"These are awesome darts. The spinning shafts help me keep a nice tight group for my triple bullseyes! Recommend getting washers to keep the stems nice and tight. Good buy! Also purchased the 26oz darts, both of them work miracles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Here Besides Excess","review":"I'll be honest, I sat through the hour and a half mess that was RoboGeisha and I'm still not 100% sure what the movie was about. There's a lot of blood and violence but there's not a lot of sense to it all.I like movies that try really hard to be serious and fail miserably. Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Room come to mind as movies that worked because they were disastrous. RoboGeisha on the other hand doesn't even look like it tried to be serious. It was a joke from the start, plain and simple.RoboGeisha will have its appeal to some. Some people enjoy the over the top action and lack of apparent plot. Crank and Shoot Em Up come to mind. But RoboGeisha lacks the fun that I found in either of those movies. Unless you're really into Japanese B movies, there's not much appeal to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would have made a great, funny short.","review":"The first 30 minutes of this movie are quite entertaining. Think a female 3 Stooges meets Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and 70's video games. But the ole' Butt Blade gets old, and while lines like Pig Geisha B****es Die! have a certain amusement factor, the film gets repetitive with its cheap effects and cheaper dialogue and before you know it, the fun and humor have worn off faster than you can realize that no one in the film can shoot, no matter what orifice the bullets fly from. There are some really original touches -- the breast-powered machine guns are a hoot, as is some of the fighting -- but a lot is downright silly or a snooze and there's no real character development. A good idea that could have worked well as a short film, but too much of a good thing gets boring and the plot is too convoluted for the level of hilarity that doesn't quite ensue."},{"rating":"2","title":"quirky japanese film","review":"Haha it is a very random film, although i liked it alot. It's made by the same people who made \\"The Machine Girl\\" To be honest i liked the machine girl more, but this movie was funny because it took itself so seriously yet it was so random. That's what i like about Japanese films though, I enjoy their out of the box thinking which usually makes the movies more enjoyable to watch. There was blood and gore like in the Machine girl but it was portrayed in the usual quirky dark humor ways. An example of this would be been one of the girls gets stabbed in her v agina and tons of blood comes out... All in all I thought it was a great film and would recommend it if you like really random plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messed up","review":"Here goes for the third time of me trying to review this movie.This is one messed up movie. My daughter is an avid anime watcher and as well as drawing her own and making shorts, she too was struck by this movie, and not in a good way. I am not sure what I could add that my fellow reviewers have not already said, but this is one extremely violent for the sake of violence move. Just when you think the characters have reached the pinnacle of screwed up, they break that glass ceiling and get worse.If you are into pure violence, gore and blood just for the sake of the gore, this is the movie you want. If you are sane, you will no longer be after watching this crude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad moive","review":"Not much can be said about this movie. It has an awful script, bad acting. Bad all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is total rubbish, bad script, poor acting, senseless plot","review":"At first I thought it might actually be worth watching because it was released by the same folks that produce the animes. However, Robo Geisha's plot and characters don't make any sense, and it isn't even in a silly way. It is as if a 3 year old wrote out a wild story on index cards, threw them in the air, and a director just randomly picked them together. I highly recommend you avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Dreadful!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. As a matter of fact, I didn't even watch it in play. I watched it at 2x speed to save 45mins of my life. Even still, 45 mins of my life was utterly wasted.If you want to see geisha robots kill opponents with: ninja stars that shoot out of their (covered) breasts, swords that are attached to their butts, a skillsaw that forms out of their mouth, slicing a man in half with their hand, and numerous other completely non-sexualized, not even humorous fashion . . . then rent this movie (don't even buy it as it may still disappoint).I want 45 mins of my life back . . . can Amazon refund me that?Dreadful!!P.S. Nothing erotic in the entire movie. One kiss in the movie, that's it. WASTE."},{"rating":"1","title":"From DVD Player to Trash CAN!!!!","review":"Probably the worse movie I have ever seen and I have been to some Bachelor parties in my life. The plot was terrible the English dialog must have been written by a middle schooler. The English speaking was like talking with people from California and one of the Geisha voices sounded like a valley girl. I don't know who would watch this. When I saw this on the Vine program I thought I would expand my horizons, this was like drinking a glass of milk two weeks after the expiration date!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not my style...","review":"I did have a very hard time to watch this movie. I usually expect either a good story, or senseless fun from Japanese movies/animation. But this did not have a good story, neither a lot of sense, and of course no fun.There are very good FUNimation imports here, this is just not one of them. I can't even compare this to anything. If you look at the cover, and like what you see, you might probably enjoy it. However, if - like me - you do cannot make any sense, I assure you your experience would be worse than what you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Movie, Good Japanese Practice","review":"Actually I think this movie has a plot but it's too silly to give it any attention. My interest was in using this movie to practice understanding Japanese and in that regard it's actually ok. Because some lines are repeated this makes listening to the same thing twice easy without having to rewind.Visually the quality appears to be fairly decent (some rather simple sets).If you're looking for entertainment, this certainly fits in the category of \\"mindless\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acid Breast Milk","review":"Yes. The subject is correct. There is acid for breast milk in this film. This Japanese movie is one of the craziest things I've ever watched. It is about a band of female assassins that recruit geisha. They are on a mission to clean up Japan. There are robots and crazy fight scenes. This film is so surreal that you will enjoy it for the strangeness - but I'm not sure you will care for much else. There are sub-titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing film","review":"I am a huge Vanness Wu fan. I watch everything he does no matter how bad because I see him as a star with a ton of potential. However, I cannot make any allowances for this steamer. Everything is horrible from the poor script, bad acting, poorly choreographed fight scenes and the terrible dubbing of the voice overs. The only strong point and the only thing that allowed me to watch the entire thing was the fact that Vanness is the hottest guy on the planet. So, unless you just want to watch V-Dub with the sound down I really do not recommend this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is terrible!!!","review":"I had heard about this movie some time in 2006 and decided to pick it up. When I saw the cover, I said to myself \\"Oh man this movie is gonna kick some serious a**!\\" People don't let looks deceive you, this movie not only deserves a big fat \\"0\\" but it almost seems as if they made it bad on purpose. I thought I was watching a drama instead of a martial arts movie. No disrespect intended but this movie looks like it was made for women, the way how there is almost little to no Martial Arts being done, to the way that the fighters are basically covered in sweat the first few seconds of the fight made me really think about who the target audience is. Oh and don't get me started on that horrible acting. \\"BOND, BOND!!!\\" Lady shut the hell up!! I was actually rooting for the dudes that were going againsthim, just too terrible for words.

From the very beginning, I was inspired by the amazing accomplishments of a man who first began his Tai Chi journey, at age 47, when he was at death's door due to an enlarged heart and severe gastric disorders. The extent of his accomplishments is quite evident from the extraordinary insights he shares on the internals - the true essence of Tai Chi. I dare say that there are many very senior practitioners of Tai Chi who, upon reading this book, will realize that they have not really been practicing Tai Chi at all. This book will quickly let sincere students everywhere know whether their current instructor truly knows Tai Chi, or whether they need to continue their search for a genuine master of this marvelous art. Master Tsung Hwa Jou's writings serve as a clear guide to help students to distinguish the few flowers that exist today in a vast field overrun by weeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the hardcover edition!","review":"The original hardcover version (The Tao of Tai-Chi Chuan) is a classic of sorts, with numerous line drawings of different taiji forms, silk-reeling exercises, and Taoist diagrams galore.

There is so much information on each page, you simply can't absorb it all in a few sittings. Once I was done reading this, I realized how little some of my tai chi instructors knew about tai chi, which was kind of depressing. On the plus side, I now know what I need to look for in a teacher so I can be sure I'm getting the real deal, instruction-wise. If anyone wants to know more about the late author or his school, the TaiChiFarm, his students recently put up a memorial website about him. We're not supposed to put URL's in the reviews so you'll have to use a little detective work to find the site but it's worth the hunt. It gives you an idea of what the guy was all about and may also give you another reason to consider buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dao of Taijiquan:Way To Rejuvenation","review":"This is an exelent book for biggener or an advanced student for it teaches forms,taiji quigong,an intro into the art of pushhands,and gives wisdom to sought after questions. There are two things that I found wrong 1)the illistrations are computer print out and are not very large in text and ,2)it definatly is not a complete manual into the art but only a referance book that is very well written, as well as a great book to rely on only if you understand the art. Other than that it is a realy great book for digging deeper into the mystery of tijiquan, that others books of its kind would never go. Another great (if not the best, for it was the template for The Dao of Taijiquan)book to invest in, if you can read chinese, is TAIJIQUAN by Chenyanlin.

Mayor Daily may have tried to wipe out the past in the 1960's, but history is what history was and closing your eyes, sticking your fingers in your ears while yelling, \\"la-la-ls-la\\" while having important landmarks torn down is not the way to deal with this bit of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"John Binder rates among Chicago Gangland's most knowledgeable researchers.

The man knows what he's talking about. This book offers some DOs and DON'Ts regarding displaying data on dashboards. It's all about aesthetics. In fact, Stephen Few cites \\"optical\\" scientific research about how the eyes processes and retains information.If you have read Few's other work, Show Me The Numbers, then you will notice plenty of overlap in content (I actually prefer that book over this one). Therefore, you wont glean much new information from this work. Overall, I love the detail Few puts into this book since I am intrigued with Data Visualization. It's always good to hear from the experts in the field.I recommend this for anyone interested in data visualization, dashboards, or design. This book is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save millions of dollars by reading this book first...","review":"Over my many years as a performance measurement specialist, I've worked with quite a few organisations who built performance dashboards that cost them many hundreds of thousands of dollars to design, tailor, populate and launch, and got very little value from the investment.The very first performance dashboard I saw cost $2million, and heartbreakingly was decommissioned two weeks after its launch. Why? Because it contained irrelevant information that was difficult to interpret and use.Most of the dashboards I've seen since have focused too much on spangly technology (gauges, dials, animations, 3D effects, etc...) and continued to leave relevance, usability and interpretation validity by the wayside.If you want a peformance dashboard that helps you truly manage performance (and not just pretend to), read this book first. Then buy a copy for your dashboard developer, or hire a developer that already practices its principles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good value for money","review":"disappointing 2006 publicationThese are very standard type Dashboards not up to date and the book needs revising for latest MS product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty, Nice","review":"99.9% of the content is derived from Tufte, but Tufte covers more.

But note this is about graphical design not dashboard Content design. I agree with author when he states that it's a little presumptious of him to claim to have invented bullet graphs, but he is the first to get them into print and he presents a definition of their construction which is useful. The most important thing I learnt is that there is an upcoming as yet unpublished edition from Tufte due in 2006 from which he references. I await that eagerly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring collection of analysis & esthetics","review":"As a long-term senior manager at a Fortune 200 company, I found this work to be clear, direct and enlightening. The book is structured well, is very well written and lays out salient points in a manner that entices the reader on. My experience indicates that the points in the book are NOT intuitive to the programming population in general - which is why it was purchased. We will use it along with Mr. Few's latest Now You See It to ramp up our automated analytics. The book was recommended by my favorite dashboard blogger, Dashboard Spy. It should probe to be a valuable reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim and extremely informative book","review":"If you've ever worked to design or implement dashboard software you MUST read this book. Stephen Few has set new standards for information representation (see Bullet Graphs) and belongs in the company of greats such as Edward Tufte.In about 200 pages this book covers every aspect of usable and informative dashboard design. Because of its brevity and readability it's a great recommendation for your manager also!Before starting any work on a dashboard read this book to learn about: 13 common dashboard mistakes; learning the limits of short-term memory; dashboard usability; and other essential aspects of dashboard design.This book is worth buying for the four sample dashboard designs at the end of it. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Theory","review":"One of my project managers lent this to me at work when we talked about dashboard development. I am a .net developer with a background in SQL Server.The author has some great points about the unnecessary fluff in dashboard graphing. For instance, focusing attention on 3d aspects as well as shading brings no value to the graph. But who doesn't already know this? He states things that are important or matter should come first on a dashboard and should be noticeable, again who doesn't know this?His examples were well drawn? Or where they developed in a language such as Dundas graphs with .net technologies? We won't know because there is absolutely no source code. So if you are looking for a book that has examples with code, you wont find it here. What you will find here is good practices and how to keep your dashboard clean.I would of given the book a 3.5 stars but you cant, so I was being a bit nice. The author is knowledgeable but most of it is knowledge that most designers already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"too basic","review":"Working in BI i thought this would help with visualising and better techniques to build dashboards but the book didnt give best practices or information on what gives the end user more value. it instead gives you choices on what is available for dashboards but that is more common sense. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes when picking up this book.

The author is very objective and conducts the reader to a quick understanding of dashboards principles and best practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of depth and necessary detail","review":"This book seems fit for people concerned about layout more than how you actually build a dashboard. The fact that most dashboard projects are 80% data warehouse/OLAP work and 20% design work has been ignored by the author. There is also a sense of arrogance in the writing, where the author gives most attention to his own unique dashboard layout ideas which are partially irrelevant to the commercially available dashboard tools that most organizations are buying today. In summary, this book may be helpful if you need help deciding what colors to put on your charts, but it is completely missing most of the activities that are key to the success of a dashboard project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Practical Contribution to Visually Communicating Data","review":"This book offers more than the title might suggest...more specifically, this title provides a good foundation for how to communicate data visually in general. Stephen Few does a good job demonstrating examples of good and \\"not so good\\" visual presentations of data utilizing Information Dashboards.I found the example Information Dashboards at the end of the book to be particularly useful. This book could serve as a good reference for those interested in effectively communicating data visually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"How to do\\" guideline","review":"This book provides a very good framework for how to graphically design performance dashboards.It focuses entirely on the graphical design and does not take into account aspects of selecting the right KPIs, how to gather data, and how to make dashboards interactive and supporting root cause analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advice that works","review":"I suppose that comparisons to Tufte's work are unavoidable, for he is the best known expert in visual information display and his work is undeniably elegant, but \\"Information Dashboard Display\\" is an entirely different type of book. While Tufte and Few would probably agree on most points in a discussion of information visualization, Tufte's focus is wide-ranging and conceptual, while Few focuses on the practical needs of business, and in this book specifically on dashboard design.Few pulls together relevant advice from a vast body of research, organizes it, and makes it digestible for people like me who must display large amounts of data in the limited space of a single computer screen in a way that clearly and efficiently communicates. No one else has done this. He exposes the common problems in visual dashboard design and step by step leads the reader through practical instruction in how to do it right. I have a job to do; this book has helped me do it, and do it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for dashboard designers","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone responsible for designing or developing a dashboard.

Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource, with plenty of good examples and advise.","review":"Excellent! Goes hand-in-hand with \\"Now You See It: Simple Visualization Techniques for Quantitative Analysis\\". Some overlap between the two, but well worth reviewing the core principles that guide them both.To a significant degree, I found Stephen Few's books more useful than even Edward Tufte's books, due to the immediate applicability nature of his material (of course, Tufte's books are excellent, too, if you want to learn the whole story... and have enough time to read them).Highly recommended.By the way, I suggest trying/playing with Tableau Public, while reading this book (just to be clear, I have no association with Tableau)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter","review":"You could happily skip the first couple of chapters, but that said it's a great introduction to dashboard design.

Less electronic and more of a live feel compared to their second album. They've been playing many of the songs from this album for at least 2 years (more shine, amiga, karma, changes, sometimes), and one has appeared on DJ Nicodemus' album, but appears here in a totally remixed fashion (mariposa). Label problems delayed the release of this album, so for me it was great to finally hear the songs on wax, as they tend to sound radically different from the live versions.Si Se is always great, and if you liked their first album (which means that either way, you should buy their first album), you will definitely like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let It Shine","review":"I have to say that this is album is good. Very good. Having stumbled across the group via David Byrne's Luaka Bop Records site, I have taken some time to really explore the music. I just bought this album today. At this point I have played it at least 3 times. Every track on this album is great. With Carol C.'s vocals soothing you into a relaxed state along with the laid back sound of the track itself makes this album perfect for driving, working around the house, and playing at a party. If you are a fan of Sade I am sure that you will like this album. With the fusion of jazzy beats, electronic hints, and sultry vocals how could you not.

Well, before you say \\"Sign me up\\", let me advise all potential viewers that this flick's tame, even by 1967's standards, and there's nary a sign of nudity, profanity or sleaze to be had anywhere.

All they have to do is find the money that is supposedly buried somewhere in an icy river where Hap grew up. But nothing comes easy for these two and it isn't long before they're not only dealing with vicious weather but also greedy and psychotic humans.This is a short little book that packs a punch. It is unflinchingly and sometimes painfully graphic but the characters of Hap and Leonard, who both have a really nasty sense of humor, provide much needed comic relief. I don't want to give too much away here but this book isn't going to become one of my favorites, even though I enjoyed most of it, because of a certain horrendous plot twist towards the end of the story that tore out my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written, captivating (yes, its a pun)","review":"Having read some of Lansdale's short stories, I was acquainted with his somewhat brutal style. I wasn't at all certain he could maintain the pace through an entire novel. In fact, I was prepared to be disappointed. Instead, this book was like driving past one long, bad auto accident. I couldn't look away. I was there - I cared, feared, smelled, tasted and felt it all. Many authors take hundreds and hundreds of pages to convey those feelings and that level of detailed impression. In my opinion it takes talent to do it effectively with such economy. This is not a book for the faint of heart, but it was very engaging. I suggest you put it near the top of the stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gigante is El Gigante for Hap and Leonard","review":"Reader Phil Gigante gets to the heart of the novel through his performance that spans five CDs and five hours in this unabridged presentation of the first of a planned \\"Hap and Leonard\\" series by author Joe R. Lansdale.The reading - changing voices/accents for the variety of male and female characters - captures the balance between witty humor and vicious existential nihilism surrounding the personalities and adventures of good ol' Texas boy Hap and his best friend, Leonard, who is a gay, martial arts-practicing Viet Nam veteran. They have a plan to pursue some easy money that will take care of all their troubles, but their plot quickly unravels and sends the duo stumbling down a path of great intrigue.Gigante comes up huge and the listener is the beneficiary as Hap and Leonard bound through their foibles while in pursuit of their variation of the American Dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my life","review":"This is without question the most powerful book I have ever read. I think I have read it at least a dozen times, and underlined in at least 5 different color highlighters and 4 or more ink colors. It exposes the self serving motives behind all my attempts at spirituality and unveils the greatest satisfaction that is available to me as a believer, the joy that I have overlooked in all my attempts to make life work. I will never be the same again...all my energy wasted on shallow pursuits that dissolve in the face of the greater hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressure's off: a great book to buy","review":"Every Christian should give this book a try, just to refresh their understanding of the doctrine of salvation. Larry Crabb takes a look in depth at why we can't earn our place in heaven, so why are we so concerned to the point of stress when we end up failing and sinning constantly.This doesn't mean that we can sin without guilt, but it reinforces the notion that we don't deserve God's forgiveness in the first place. If you've ever felt like trying to live as one of God's children is stressing you out, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very very helpful to me.","review":"This is not an academic book on theology or counseling. In it, Crabb provides a rather transparent look into his own journey through an important transformation process in an attempt to help us grasp what he found out. He explains how we can insidiously come to the point of thinking we are following, and even serving God when we are really attempting to manipulate God. Sounds like a simple concept to intellectually grasp, but I found the varied and personable ways Larry communicates were necessary for me to fully process what he was talking about so I came to really see how much pressure I have put myself under, and perhaps why some things have not worked out the way I thought they should. Larry's admonitions remind me of Jesus' critique of the Ephesian church: \\"But this you have abandoned, your first love.\\" Since I feel God used this book to shift the way I hold my life in a very positive way, I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ for burdened Christians","review":"Larry Crabb is one of my favorite contemporary authors. He has an ability to ask hard questions and grapple with significant issues Christians deal with with a candor and authenticity that is freeing!!I truly value the spiritual perspective to which he challenges me without quoting Christian platitudes that cover over issues rather than exposing them and dealing with them in spirit/Spirit and truth/Truth.

You're saying \\"OK, OK, doc, how do I DO IT?\\" That is Crabbs point that so many, including myself, need to hear repeatedly,,,there are no formulas, ONLY JESUS!! It's not \\"go to HIm (A) to find out what you must do to make life work (B)\\". Crabbs desire is that we will want HIM more than we want life to work. We are given the ultimate blessing which is the grace he offers us: we have the precious treasure of simply being in his presence. \\"He offers us relationship in suffereing so that we learn to value intimacy over blessing.\\" (quotes from book) This book was a wonderful encouragement to me that I intend to read again.

The hangers are in the correct location, but you're not going to get this thing to sit nice and flush on your muffler without a lot of bench bending.I went out to my local hardware store and picked up a 4 inch bolt, and 3 inch probably would have been okay. I used picture hanging wire to hold the two ends close enough together while I installed the bolt, then cut it and removed it once the bolt was in place to start tightening. Otherwise, it would have felt like I needed three hands.Anyway, the part works, it's just not exactly perfect for my vehicle's muffler.

Problem was it did not fit the contour of the new muffler even after trying to bend it into shape. Used this new Walker muffler clamp. Had to rotate the clamp 180 degrees and use the longer original bolt to engage (bolt supplied was too short). Also had to cut the original nut off the old assembly so I didn't need to go to the hardware store to buy a matching bolt. Final result was fine but didn't exactly work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New...","review":"My biggest complaint about Mark Bego's book is that it appears he just gathered together all of the People Magazines Cher has appeared in, and compiled them for a book.

Mary Wilson, who has been a friend of Mark's for years, writes an intro, that is absolutely useless to the Cher fan. Yes, Cher is nice, she's always friendly. But Mary Wilson is not a chum of Cher's, just a casual aquaintenance. Some of the pictures are nice, but if you're looking for a better biography of Cher, go with the one that J.

The book is useful insofar as it sets the tone of the telecoms revolution, however it ultimately avoids analysis. The text is as hurried as the synthesis of ideas is absent.

As hard as they tried to fill the void with Georgette and Sue Ann, it just isn't as well rounded as the show was before.

A True Dud","review":"*This film is really, really bad. Save your time and skip it. It is the story of a young woman from a mentally ill family who seems either very dysfunctional or mentally ill herself. She has a few relationships with people she treats very poorly. She experiences a life-changing event and decides to value her relationships, but it appears to be too late. The movie ends in a very ungratifying, depressing way, consistent with the general tenor of the movie.The acting is poor, the plot skips all over the place, and several things make no sense at all. Worst of all, after watching it, I felt quite depressed, and I didn't beforehand.Definitely not recommended.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the movie I thought it was","review":"I had thought that this was the new TV serries by the same name.

While at the same time, remain true to their calling. After all, they are not machines.Now the bad news: There is nothing new here, it's not an exciting transformed sound. Additionally, to my ears, the new personnel sound mostly the same as the previous personnel. It's a somewhat predictable recording.Being a fan of PMG, as a group or individually, I'm disappointed in this latest effort.Some fans here have articulated this much, so I will not speak to that. Musically, these artists show their years of honing and mastering their skills. But this new recording has nothing that would show a new musical direction.

I really think he's lost it. This is the most generic disc he's ever produced, following a trend that started with We Live Here. SoN will not offend anyone; this disc does not contain a single song that has any significant emotion or dynamics. I can't believe the man who produced Secret Story and Wichita Falls came up with this monotonous, blatantly commercial drivel. Strictly by the numbers. I bought this disc and listened to it on the way home. The next morning, I went right back for a refund. A huge disappointment for me. After 9/11, how could Metheny produce such perfect Muzak? I guess many great artists lose their energy after awhile. Pat sure has.I guess it's great for the Berkeley/Marin County mild leftie-Vegan types who drive to Whole Foods with Free Tibet and No War For Oil stickers on their sport-utes."},{"rating":"1","title":"a review","review":"I was very disappointed on hearing just one cut from this album.

But it was different and beautiful, but i dismissed some of it as nothing special and uninspiring.After 50+ listenings, i'm somehow drawn in and addicted to this music...it's subtle message is happiness. Analytically, i canattribute some of this feeling to Richard Bona, the vocalist who is incredibly talented. His voice is central to many of thesepieces.

Personal style has been the big thrust in design for a decade or more, and my favorite home magazines and books have always, always advised people to do their own thing and forget what the neighbors will think. The idea of this book is fine, but, my goodness, it's old, old news to most of us. The book also is wordy, and I longed for her to get to her point more quickly.

Yes, seven dollars on sale (the regular price was $9.95 at all stores I visited). So, buyer beware of anything coming from JNL TRADING.

They seemed nice enough, well made and solid. But after pulling back the little clips and removing the glass, the glass would not go back in. Now I'm not a clumsy hamfisted guy, and I tried carefully as I could to get it in. With barely a push, the glass from the first frame broke in a corner. Not wanting to make the mistake again with the second, I tried ever ever so delicately to push the glass back in. Not only did this one break even easier, but when trying to get the glass out, the shard CUT my poster. So not only am I out the thirty bucks from both frames, but it cut my 20 dollar poster.

It didn't seem to be a shipping issue as it was packed well, and the glass was intact. I am keeping the frame as I don't really care too much about it (which is why I bought such a cheap frame to begin with!) but it is definitely a noticeable flaw when you walk by the picture. Otherwise the glass and hanging hardware were fine.

The glass split right down the middle leaving 2 sharp shards of glass just as I was trying to get all the ridiculous cheap metal prongs up to put my picture in. I could have cut myself very badly. After I wrote a previous review (which I now can't find on the website) I received calls and emails from the company wanting to send me a new frame. WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER???? So I CAN cut myself this time?? When I didn't respond they sent me another anyway - it sits unopened in the corner. Each time they contacted me they asked that I take my bad review off the site. I find that the most disturbing. Replace a cheap frame with a cheap frame and I'm supposed to be satisfied and not share my safety concerns with others? Don't think so.

It was a guide to my favorite martial art, Tae Kwon Do. I take Tae Kwon Do and as a practitioner of the sport, I can tell you that this book is very accurate and informative. It covers the 3 aspects of Tae Kwon Do: forms, sparring, and training. I found this to be unusual. Most of the Tae Kwon Do books that I have looked at have stuck to one or two of those topics instead of covering such a wide variety of information. I would recommend this book to practitioners and anyone who may be interested in starting Tae Kwon Do. The best part was the techniques section. It provided very detailed and accurate descriptions of the techniques such as sidekicks and spearhands. Sometimes my master may leave out a small detail about a move and this book helped me correct my mistakes. I would give this book a 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of the art textbook on taekwondo","review":"I have purchased many books from Amazon and have never left a review. I feel compelled to write on this textbook because it is an extraordinarily well written and has fleshed out in my mind the history, principles and practice of taekwondo.All of the important fundamentals are here, with concisely rendered figures of the stances, strikes, blocks, kicks, footwork etc. What is most helpful to my children especially the poomse sections. All of the taegeuk forms are here with explanations and review sections with schematic figures of the patterns. This book is essential for any age taekwondo practitioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well written and comprehensive text of modern taekwondo","review":"I thought this book was very well written. The section on taekwondo history is more comprehensive than I've seen in any other tkd book. I especially enjoyed the layout of the forms section, I only wish they include black belt forms as well, and I appreciated the inclusion of the Korean terminolgy. I reccomend this book for any serious taekwondoist as well as those with a passing interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a full TKD book","review":"To be fair, I don't know if Masters of TKD are allowed (or even want) to put everything they know in one book. Maybe they want people to pay for TKD classes. What I DO know is, this book is very helpful. However, there are certain things in the book that is missing.It has all the color forms (belts), but does not have every kick, punch, or other move that you can learn in an actual TKD class.This book is good for beginners. Once you hit green or blue belt, you will only use this book for the rest of the forms, or for a random kick or punch that you should have learned before but didn't...It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but it's just helpful for certain things..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book covered all the aspects of taekwondo as both a martial art and sport. The illustrations were great. The poomse section beautifully explained the WTF forms. My favorite part, though, was the footwork section.

Anderson claims to be in communication with various saints (St Teresa and others) but emphatically states that there is no such thing as the hell, the devil, evil spirits, etc. and that everyone (including murderers, rapists, suicides, etc.) goes to 'the garden', which is a direct contradiction of Biblical teachings. He expresses surprise that some people question his sources as possibly being evil spirits even though the Bible clearly warns against mediums, soothsayers and the like. He repeatedly refers to God as 'the Infinite Light', which sounds too close to Lucifer (from the Latin 'lucem ferre', or bringer of light) for my comfort.I don't doubt Anderson's 'gifts' and I suspect that he is a compasionate individual, but as a Christian I cannot accept many of his statements, including that he is in communication with various saints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort","review":"I read this book in two nights - could not put it down. This book has helped me immensely as I grieve the loss of a loved one in my life. This book has helped me to see that my loved one is still with me in spirit, although realistic in acknowledging that I will still feel pain because this soul is no longer physically present in my life. I recommend this book to anyone who is open to the idea of the afterlife. Anderson made a believer out of me and brought me comfort when I most needed it.

The story moves along quickly, with twists and turns and additions, but sometimes I wonder about the dispatching of so may citizens in one area. I sure wouldn't move to Blue Deer! But if Jules was back and available, I might. What with Jules going off to be an archaeologist again, and taking Caroline with him; Edie and Patrick Ankeny neatly wed; Mom has a sleep-over; and Peter and Alice wed with child, what else can happen?

Williams was actually Dr. Williams and practiced pediatrics for many years. These stories are built around a series of clinical vignettes from medical practice in the early part of the century. While these stories are not great literature, they are very good and Williams is very good at descriptions of clinical phenomena. Some of the clinical entities at the center of the stories are now rarely seen. These stories convey the experience of medical practice in this era very well and several stories have considerable emotional power. This book will be of interest to anyone who likes American literature but will perhaps find the most appreciative audience among physicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perusing Williams' Mind","review":"I feel like I've been able to peruse William Carlos Williams' mind after having read this book because he is so honest with his thoughts and feelings. Nothing, it seems, is held back and that is what I first fell in love with in his writing when I first studied his poetry in college. The raw truth is exposed over and over in this collection and I just kept wanting more. If you crave truth and honesty, this is the book for you. The poetry of Williams' thoughts, his observations of the mundane, show how poetry is in everday life, not in the fantastic, the fancy, the glitterati. Poetry is in the plodding, the hardscrabble, the undaunted...all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Uplifting","review":"I differ with another reviewer in that I was not bothered by passive voice nor the occasional personal aside. Joel's book gave me an incredibly authentic view of what it is like to live in America with a highly visible disability. His expression of his equal discomfort with the extreme reactions of both pity and hero-worship was very eye-opening. His faith in God is clearly what helped him through his challenges and gave purpose to his life. I began the book thinking that it would have been better had Joel been allowed to die at the scene of the accident. By the middle of the book, I came to see that his life, while having tragic aspects, was not the tragedy that his loss would have been. A fascinating read, but keep a few tissues nearby in the early chapters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimony to Faith and Family","review":"I met Joel in person at a conference, where he autographed a copy of his book for me. The book is an autobiography of Joel's life so far (he was born in 1977). After hearing him speak, I expeced to read about the powerful role that faith in Christ plays in his and his family's life and he is quite clear about that in the book. What fascinated me more was the role of his parents in his life. They did everything in thier power to make Joel's life a success and to count for something. If it had not been for his family and thier commitment, Joel's life would probably have turned out very different. This book is a testimony to the positive influence of loving and dedicated parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Beautiful--Haunted Me for Days!","review":"Joel's story is unforgettable and truly a treasure among biographies.

We studied this book together to learn about English vocabulary, and how to use these words. We had a brilliant English teacher who taught us about the best way to use a word in a written sentence.I was just a young man who took an ESL class(English AS A Second Language). Now, I think back about the lessons from this book. It takes time to learn the words if you have the time.However, you will improve your standing in the educated community if you learned something more than when you first started to read this book. I was just glad to share this book with that young woman so many years ago.Yes, I still remember Words, Words, Words."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!

With this software, I can create a copy of my information as an encrypted SAFE eKey file that I can read on any other computer. I always have my information with me now since I carry it on a ThumbDrive Smart USB digital hard drive. I don't worry anymore about someone finding my list of passwords or trying to remember just what password I used where.

It was one of the first shows I watched as a young girl that really stressed what \\"GIRL POWER\\" was all about. :) These are not just any notecards, they make such a statement that no matter who you send them to, it is bound to put a huge smile on their face.

I completely recommend the book for anyone who cares (or wants to try it out) about more than just themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool album","review":"This is one of my favorite Yngwie CDs. The songs are all great. There is one bad thing about this album, though--Mike Vescera. His vocals aren't horrible, but sometimes annoying. Other times, his voice is quite fitting, such as \\"No Love Lost\\", \\"Voodoo\\", \\"Time Will Tell\\", and \\"Fire in the Sky\\". I prefer Goran Edman, Mark Boals, and Joe Lynn Turner, though. The guitar work is great as usual. \\"Amberdawn\\" features two of the most emotional solos that I've heard from Yngwie, surpassed only by \\"Like An Angel\\" and \\"Prelude to April\\". All in all, \\"Magnum Opus\\" is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorites","review":"I don't understand why some fans don't like Magnum Opus. I guess if you want something with the fire of Seventh Sign, you should listen to Seventh Sign. Magnum Opus is not the most boisterous of all Yngwie's albums, and I doubt it was intended to be. The songs on this album have more of a grandiouse feel to them. \\"Time will tell\\", \\"No love lost\\", \\"Voodoo\\", and \\"I'd die for you\\" have a great mystical feel that cannot be paralleled by most artists. \\"Cross the line\\" and \\"Fire in the sky\\" are great rockers. Critics should give this album a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yngwie Album","review":"why dont half the people like this album, its soo damn good. the production is superb, unlike most yngwie albums, also the songs on this are great, vengeance has a jaw dropping solo on it and id die without you is an emotional song."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad CD","review":"Although he tried to make good songs, this Cd is no good, thanks to singer Mike Vescera.

Unfortunately, those things that are true are not new, and those things that are new aren't true. Before reading Heifetz book, I strongly encourage you to read a good sociology book (i.e. Randall Collins' Four Sociological Traditions), and a good strategy book (i.e. Dixit's Thinking Strategically). After that, you will have a better understanding of how and why individuals, groups, and societies behave the way they do. Furthermore, you won't be fooled with Heifetz's \\"scientific discoveries\\", pretentious claims, and nave and simplistic conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant. The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders. Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless. Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader. So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.Do yourself a favor and keep surfing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"liberal agenda","review":"does anyone else think Heifetz is pushing a liberal agenda...Every liberal politian/action is praised, and every republican is demonized.

If the characters had the same names, I wouldn't know I was reading a different book. Even the \\"surprise\\" ending was the same.The author made a point of telling us that Brenna was very smart, so why did she do such stupid things, and act so childish?The sex scenes were so 70's, the kind I read from Harlequin novels at age 12. I read one excerpt out loud to my husband.

(Chance book is an example). The first book was very entertaining with a new concept. This book went for the pity me angle -the I'm so tortured with pain, guilt whatever.

Blake is a Paladin and watches the border between our world and the Others. Paladin's are born warriors and often die in the line of duty, but are continuously brought back by their Handlers. Once a Paladin has been brought back one time too many, he becomes an Other and must be put down. In the First book, Blake was very close to becoming an Other. I had the feeling he was on the edge of losing his humanity. I did not get that feeling in this book, even though it kept saying he was close to having to be killed. I just expected more of his character and felt somewhat dissapointed. I didn't care too much for Brenna either. Dr. Laurel Young and Devin Blane's characters were more fleshed out in the first book. I still enjoyed the story but I wouldn't give it 5 stars.

In way of extras, all that was included are commentaries on the first and last episodes. In the final episode, the commentary is done by Dennis Dugan. This is the actor who briefly played Maddie's husband. This is the worst commentary that I have ever heard. I listened to the whole torturous episode just to see if there was anything he had to say that was worth listening to. There was not.Again, I am grateful to complete my series of Moonlighting, but it would have been nice if there were more extras of one of my favorite shows from the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - bad item","review":"I'm a huge Moonlighting fan, so of course I love the show itself.

After reading its 162 pages, I feel that Mr. Friedman has succeeded in interpreting the nativity scene anew in a pertinent, meaningful, unforgettable way. I would never have guessed. I would recommend it for readers 12 and above - the plot takes place in a time when heretics were starved or burned to death, and there is a mention of that on the first page. And the ending is not easy, not trivial. But if you persevere through the first chapters you will meet a 10 year old boy orphan artist Benjamin who has never spoken a word in his life, never felt at home, never missed anything or anyone. You will also meet Valorie, a talking pig. Do persevere!

The book was written 15 years ago, before the science was \\"settled,\\" as they say. Trefil mentions things like urban heat islands and measuring problems, things that don't get much attention anymore.

One of Fiffer's friends in the book refers to his \\"healthy perspective.\\" I think not! He takes such advantage of people, especially those who try to help him. I felt so sorry for his parents, particularly. It's a tribute to their love that they stuck with him. Does Fiffer ever think about anyone besides himself? Ask such characters as Dave Scott, or Sandy, or the nurse Miss Boland, whose treatment by her patient can only be described as sexual harassment of the worst sort. Far more inspiring books are Tim Hansel's \\"You Gotta Keep Dancin'\\" or Joni Eareckson Tada's autobiography.

It's not so bad when it comes to low-budget horror but it had it's fair share of problems. It's paced too slow which makes it boring most of the way through. Too many of the story pieces felt like they were just thrown in \\"just because\\" to me as well. It's pretty anti-climactic too. The only thing that redeems this film in any respect is the 'classic' ghost story elements.

Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good actors in a terrible movie.","review":"They really don't get much worse than this. In spite of great actors like Sid Haig and Leslie Easterbrook, this movie fails in every way. The script is idiotic, even by low budget horror standards. The direction is strictly amateur in quality. Many scenes look as if they were shot on cheap VHS tape (perhaps they were). The editing and sound design . . . rotten. The film is also DULL. Incredibly DULL. Slow, pointless, predictable. Even if you love oddball horror films you will probably find nothing of merit in this awful mess. I'm surprised I'm the first one to give it a one star rating. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DEAD MOVIE","review":"A DEAD CALLING is another of those low budget throwaways that you'll feel compelled to finish watching just because of the time you invest in it. Alexandra Holden sheepishly portrays a young tv journalist who suffers a breakdown when a stalker kills her fiancee. She returns to her hometown and joins the local small tv station where she finds herself embroiled in the mass murder of a family by their physician father/husband. There's hints of more than just journalistic involvement, however, when Holden makes a shocking discovery.The movie suffers from a predictable and implausible script, and mediocre acting...the father is particularly laughable. For true lovers of the genre only."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and witty","review":"I feel sorry for all those people here that give this book a poor review. It appears that it didn't match their expectations, or they just didn't \\"get it\\". I had never even heard of this author before, let alone read any of his other works, so I couldn't be disappointed.This book is not trying to be comprehensive in its critique of cities. In fact, some of the chapters on cities don't necessarily have much to do with the cities themselves. Instead the author rambles on delightfully with a tapestry of anecdotes, sometimes about people, sometimes about places, set in the past, the present, and even the future. It might all seem a little bit disconnected unless you catch on to the underlying themes, his very strong opinions regarding what makes cities livable and unlivable places. He cares a lot--he is not just insulting I.M. Pei and others for the sake of getting attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to commentary on the urban condition...","review":"While Kunstler in the past has accurately described the current dilemma of the space in which we live, particularly in the Geography of Nowhere and Home from Nowhere, his focus is much less acute in this text. Take his chapter on London--instead of his usual critical eye discussing the landscape of London, we get a rehashed lesson in history and countless digressions in reference to other cities topped off with a remark about homosexuals in a park. Most annoying however, is his increasing penchant for attacking individuals rather than problems (note his inexcuseable comments about a woman who has just lost her husband in his chapter on Atlanta). His anger may keep him vigilant on the subject of suburban sprawl, but it often times detracts from the reader empathizing with the position he puts forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialistic Eurotrash","review":"This book is nothing but Socialistic Eurotrash.

Two Thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. Think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or Vogue or Madamoselle magazine today. Many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic. One in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. Don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism.

The illustrations propel the text's message to the next level, powerfully demonstrating the beauty of God's creation. It's worth pausing at every page-spread to admire the pictures for a few extra seconds, and it doesn't detract from the reading of the story at all.Each 2-page spread has 2 lines from the hymn, and a 2-page illustration spread surrounding the words. The text is a nice large size. In the back two pages, the hymn is printed if you'd want to play it or sing it with your children.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone with young children that they want to teach of God from their earlist days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best","review":"I got this cd as one of my Xmas presents which were mostly WWF, Pamela Anderson & Xtina stuff and this wasn't as good as it is described on the back of the pkg.

Bio, 2. Sing-along-with the weirdo (not to be confuesd w/karaoke) 3. Answer the weirdos questions although shes not there 4. Another sing-along with the weirdo, I found this cd offensive. I'm not psycho so why would I want it? The cd-rom which contains \\"games, links & trivia\\" is no better except for the fact that it has a few pics.

I substituted my own (much nicer) hardware and got them assembled, but I would never trust them with anything heavier than about 25 pounds. The idea of using (a very cheap) 6mm bolt to support the entire weight of the speaker is laughable and the overall quality of the stand could be surpassed by a first year metal shop student. If anyone actually used these in a studio (which I doubt), it would only be long enough to buy new stands and get these sold on ebay. I blame myself since I was suckered in by the low price, but these are not suitable for any professional use.

She is happily entertained and we get a rest from trowing the ball around and of course the joy of seeing her so happy and excited just throwing the toy around trying to get the kibbles and/or treats out.

I started him out with the small one and as he got older I got the larger one so I could fit a whole serving in it.When he got older he developed epilepsy and the phenobarbitol has made him even more food obsessed and even lazier. This toy is perfect because it occupies him enough that he can be food obsessed and he gets a little exercise too. By the time he's eaten his food he's worn out enough that he's ready for a nap instead of snuffling around looking for things to get into.My favorite thing about this toy is that you can adjust it for the kibble or treats you are putting in it.

If you have a powerful chewer, avoid. If you have a light chewer, it would make a great great toy for them because treats dispense at a slow rate, enough to keep their attention. I'd recommend this with the above caveat."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for chewers","review":"I have two dogs an italian greyhound and lab mix (a VERY strong powerful chewer). This toy would be good for a more delicate chewer. The concept is great and could keep a non-chewer occupied for a little while.

After a week the smell has not gone, so I have returned it. In addition to not being able to tolerate it myself, I am concerned that the fumes emitting from this cheap plastic might be harmful to my dogs with continued use (can't be good).

My dog loved this toy when i put treats in it, but within a couple of times she ripped chunks off the top making the toy useless.

Yet after only 10 minutes with the Twist 'N Treat there were the sort of chomp marks on it you would expect to see in cheese, with pieces on the floor and in the dog's mouth.

Frozen food makes my sheltie work harder for the reward, and he goes nuts for it. It's excellent mental stimulation for him, and is so much better than him just snarfing his food up out of his food bowl in 20 seconds. The Twist & Treat toy goes right into the dishwasher!

Awesome, I'll buy more to rotate in the freezer as one's freezing while he's working on the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy that keep dog busy..","review":"I own 4 months old golden retriever and he loves this product. He knew right away to paw and make the toy flip to get the treats. I put his purina puppy kibble inside so he just keeps flipping until he gets all the kibble. The only downside is that it took him to get all the treats in less than 5 minutes. Even though I twisted to the most difficult level, he still got the treats less than five minutes.

She likes to tear things apart, but in general it takes her several days to destroy a flimsy squeaky toy, however the twist and treat did not last more than a hour. I had great hope for the twist and treat and envisioned it as something that would keep my dog occupied for short periods of time. She took it out of my hand ripped it apart and had the treats out right away. I was out $10 bucks with nothing to show for it. My dog is not destructive nor an aggressive chewer, and she simply ripped the thing apart. I will never ever buy this again for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Paws Up","review":"Great little treat container! Unlike other reviewers, I found it very easy to fill. Unscrew it enough to slip the treats in from the side or take it all the way off, easy either way. I prefer this to the round treat ball because it comes apart for easy cleaning. Not good for flat treats as they fall out all at once. My terrier is very picky and took to it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 minutes","review":"A nice shape but it took my red Heeler x 180 seconds to chew a chunk off.

My dog loved playing with it. She would toss it in the air trying to dislodge the treats inside. It entertained her quite well. But it was only 2 weeks when I noticed that I was having trouble unscrewing the treat toy to add more to it. I found that the toy was not made well. The center knob that screws into the hole on the opposite side, basically unscrewed itself from the wall of the toy. It was nothing my dog did, and nothing I could have done to make this happen. It was shoddily made. Whoever heard of a bolt breaking off from the base? That's what happened. I will stick with the tried and true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad!","review":"My 18-month-old lab shredded this in an hour. I'm really glad I caught her in time.

This toy lasted one month. I took it away after the food was dispensed, which took him only 5 minutes no matter how tight I closed it, so he couldn't chew it up.

What they fail to say is that the toy doesn't stay closed. If you twist too far, they can't get anything out. If you open it a little more, it opens by itself and all the kibble tumbles out.

This is just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME for my beagle","review":"my beagle is a chewer, and she is in love with this toy. we've had one for a year or so, purchased at a local pet store, and it has held up very well. there are teeth marks in it and whatnot, but it still functions great, even with daily use. I like to smear a bit of peanut butter or put some liver treats in it and she will chew and lick until every last morsel is gone. It keeps her occupied and chewing on something she should chew on. My only gripe is that I wish I could tighten the toy more, to make it harder for her. Otherwise, every dog I ever have will have one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves it, but owner not as much...","review":"DOG'S EXPERIENCE: Loves it. Easy enough to get food out.

Angel flash backs are always interesting to further establish his character. Also the faint Buffy references provide a nice continuity. But the flash backs between Angel's life, Meg's life and the past often break up the action. In the end as masks are removed and villians become victems there is no satisfaction and much confusion. Angel's encounter with an dying old woman is the most touching I've read in a long time. I almost wished for an epilogue in which Angel finds the child and passes the memory so she is not forgotten. I enjoyed the book but the plotting is not Ms Holder's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"This book is about a cult worshiping an Indonesian death god and bringing over illegal immigrant as sacrifices. This book had the potential to be really good, but was rushed and confusing near the end. The writer also needs to do more research.

That way, you can maintain the illusion that the author actually wrote an ending. The flashbacks only served to break the story's continuity, or allow the author to write off her vacation to Indonesia as research, I'm not sure which. So many of the story threads weren't resolved, and what was resolved was done so poorly, it was better left unread. ...The author would've been better off writing \\"The good guys win. The end.\\" I'd seriously question the intelligence/objectiveness of any reviewer who gave this more than 2 stars.While a rabid Buffy fan myself, and one who's been pleased with the author's other works in the Buffyverse, I found this book to be pure drivel.

The question also arises, \\"Does His will change along the way?\\" In the Old Testament, Abraham is called to sacrifice his son.

When it's the front and center of a horror movie, that's when there is a problem.

However, the two works on this disc are vintage Reger.He lived his short life as fast as he composed his music.

Dalziel comes off as a gruff blue collar worker, but he is fiercely intelligent. His partner Pascoe is an ideal book smart foil for Dalziel. The crimes they solve are far from ordinary, and despite the length of each episode, the stories move at a quick clip. In technical terms, the DVD transfers are pristine and the episodes are uncut.

It just doesn't have that comfy, 'fall in love with it,' feel. I'm pretty positive it's going back, my only question is, do I actually give this to my wife?

This woman went back to work, as a counsellor, 4 days after a late -term miscarriage. Either she was in denial, or not very attatched to her baby! Her advice for handling comments from people who say hurtful things is invariably \\"turn the other cheek\\". Although that is very Christian, that's not the only way Christ handled things. If a grieving parent were turning the other cheek as often as this author recommends, they'd have so much anger internalized, they'd NEVER get out of therapy! There ARE other ways to handle situations, and ways to gently teach people to help you. It's too bad she didn't focus on that, and she would have written a book that was truly useful!

My son and I love trains and this book has a lot of factual information about them that even a 4 year old can grasp. But the true reason we read Mr. Lippman's books is because of the artwork. So much detail is placed into these pictures that each time you read the book you see something new. For instance, on the title page the conductor is holding a ticket that is really a place for your child to sign their name. It says \\"one ticket to be used anytime, issued by Busy Trains.

Randolph has a seemingly \`perfect' life while Olivia Hewes' life is turning upside down. Olivia's mother is ailing and her brother is mentally slow. As they draw closer together they realize that neither of their families are as \\"evil\\" as their families have taught them. While their forbidding love blooms their church is in the decision of breaking up because of a \`heretic'. And when it seems that their families might accept them more obstacles come their way. Though it is a romance novel the message is a strong one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This first in the series by Catherine Palmer is so very good.

Somehow, he understands and it is amusing to watch him gingerly work to get the treats out of the ends.

I love that it is actually DIFFICULT for a treat to fall out, because this keeps my dog busy for a longer period of time.

This work was written essentially to counter the works of rationalists like Reginald Scot and Johann Weyer who argued against the belief in witchcraft and demonic magic. James I was in his younger years a firm believer in the power and danger of witchcraft and was himself convinced of a plot by witches to kill him and his queen during a sea voyage in 1590. The case of the North Berwick Witches is famous even today and was definately the motivating factor in James intense support for the trying and execution of witches in Scotland prior to his accendancy to the English throne in 1603. Following his rise to the throne of England, James seems to have lost much of his interest in witchcraft, but maintained enough mistrust to see that his official English edition of the Bible included the translation of Exodus 22:18 as \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book long before I had children.","review":"I attended Middlebury's Bread Loaf School of English with the author, Sam Swope.

The Araboolies themselves were fun and interesting and the artwork was good, but the overall message of tolerance is flawed. There are the Pinches (the bad guys) that abhor anything or anybody who are different. The end all solution to dealing with the Pinches is not to help them see that being different should be applauded or by pointing out that, even they have their own uniqueness.

Once again they rip the fans off by splitting the 4 Sagas (Saiyan, Frieza, Cell, Buu) into completely unnecessary \\"seasons\\". 13 episodes for 35 dollars? That's 400 dollars(EDIT -- Turns out they're shooting for 100 episodes, not 150.) for a shortened version of a 20 year old show. This is definitely the most overpriced DVD set I've ever seen. I could understand them selling each Saga for 40 bucks each. 160 dollars is reasonable for such a long show, regardless of age.

It is hard to say how many episodes it will be but they claim the story will still work. They have just finished the Freeza Saga. I worry because I was a fan of the original Japanese voices but I was also a fan of the original voices through Saban. I am sorry.... Funimation has done an excellent job with their anime but not DBZ. I thought the voices were bad and the scripts were horrible. How can you mess up a script when it is already done.

This time with much more emotion in the voices plus the even used some original Japanese names of the attacks. The mood in Dbkai has change a little but in a good way. I can understand why people where saying that they wanted to see the entire show re-animated but I can look the other on was in this case and with fillers cut out it kept my ampped up for more action. It doesn't take away from the story it just makes it so you won't have to wait 5 or more episodes for one fight to finish.

Mount is solid and seems substantial (time will tell since this is a outdoor installation)and price seemed fair especially compared to the big box stores.Would have rated a Five Star if I didn't have the mounting bolt issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I think this mount is a good value. The directions could be a little more clear about the spacers and which screws to use, but once I decided, it went up very easily. It's great, just what I was looking for, and the price was the lowest out there, and I got the free shipping. Totally satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent TV Mount","review":"High quality and sturdy. Permits swivel and tilt adjustments as well as swing out from wall. I am very pleased with the two I am using for Panasonic 26 inch and 32 inch flat screen TVs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Thinking Creates Right Action","review":"In this short book by Manly Hall, originally published in 1931, discusses, initially, the problems of disease and how our thinking manifests problems in our lives. What may start out as a small problem many times never gets resolved. By holding it within, it infects our thinking and festers over a long period of time and eventually becomes a disease. The cure, then, accordinly, is not through medication, pills and avoidance, but rather a dissolution of those old issues by bringing them to light (consciousness) and resolving it. As he writes, \\"If you think this fits you it probably does not; if you are sure it does not, it probably does.\\" This is a general safe way of thinking to prevent avoidance of facing yourself and your problems. The book is designed to challenge your ego and to start correcting irrational behaviors and repetitive structures that we have developed over the years. It is an excellent book and very thought provoking, if not, action inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book !","review":"This book is NOT a Physics C review.

It became clear thatthe antenna, the overall signal processing of the unit, and my laptoppower were inadequate. Next I tried on my desktop which had much fasterCPU and USB 2.0 and etc. Still, I did not get a good reception. My regularTV with the indoor antenna worked ten times better.

I wanted to be able to record good quality analog video and also try to view some over-the-air HD programming. I could not recieve any HD programming with the small cord attached to the small antenna but that was not a huge deal. Like I said the analog cable picture quality is very poor. When recorded and converted to DivX, 2 minutes of poor quality video was 22mb. If you can receive over the air HDTV this may work for you, but it did not work for me. It is now on an auction site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinnacle: The height of ?????","review":"I wonder if those who gave this product more than one star are posers from Pinnacle corporate. I note that they write long wordy paragraphs of praise... hmmm. This is an absurd product, pure and simple. It should take no more words to praise it as it does to knock it. Thankfully Amazon will refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of PCTV HD Pro Stick USB2 TV tuner","review":"I was not able to hook up the product to cable or a satellite box. The attachments for these don't really work. Also, the fact that the antenna has a magnetized base is not made clear, making it hazardous to computer hard drives. Finally, you need a really fast computer on the order of 1.7 Ghz minimum with at least 1GB memory for it to work smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSTALACION Y USO","review":"La instalación del producto fue bastante simple, la configuracion y operacion tambien los son, solo he observado un problema con el control remoto, en ocasiones deja de funcionar, no controla el volumen ni cambia los caneles de cable, solo despues de oprimir el boton de apagado y luego de vilver a activarlo es que regresa la funcionalidad de los botones de control de volumen y selector de canales; otra observacion en el funcionamiento es que al seleccionar en forma progresiva canales estos saltan al siguiente."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out - Can Destroy Your Hard Drive","review":"The antenna that comes with this product has a very powerful magnet in it's base. There is no warning about the presence of the magnet on the package - and as you know, magnets and hard drives do not mix well.I was just unpacking the product with my laptop in my lap. The antenna latched on to the palm rest of my laptop, and I had to pull it off. Evidently, the hard drive on my laptop is right below the palm rest, and the magnet was strongly attached to it. By the time I could pull the magnet free, all of the data on my hard drive was gone AND the hard drive could no longer even be used. I had to replace it entirely.I contacted Pinnacle about this. They are not taking any responsibility for the fact that they packed a strong magnet into a device that was made to be used with a laptop computer - and did not even put any warnings on the package. Be very careful about getting this antenna anywhere close to your computer - or poof! Bye, bye hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need a good computer","review":"I got this back when I was using Win XP and a slow computer. I could see programs just fine, but it took around 10 seconds to change from one channel to another.A few weeks back I got a new PC (Win 7 x64, Intel i7 8-core, 8G RAM) and when installing the software for the product I was given the option to install it for Windows Media Center, so I did it and it works flawlessly and super fast!So I cannot blame the product of being slow back in the day with my old computer, because it was really my hardware what was slowing it down. A good surprise because I was thinking that I had to get a new tuner to work with my new computer. I was mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuner is alright but software SUCKS!!!!!!!!","review":"The tv tuner works fairly well but the software is total junk. I wouldn't buy this thing again for $10 if I had to use the same software. The recordings look horrible and the program is really glitchy. It takes forever to load and sometimes records with no sound. Don't but this.4"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not what you're looking for","review":"The video quality of the video you will be receiving will be severely lacking. If you've got a good signal it could give you an ok standard picture, but the compression rate is just too much to give decent quality to your PC. If the packaged software is also not great and it won't work with a Mac. Overall if you just want to watch TV on the go then this is for you, but if your banking on an 1080p signal look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The model of PCTV HD pro stick that I received, was an early model that had software compatible with XP. Since my computer is a very recent model, equipped with Vista, I downloaded the latest software on line to try and operate the device. Even with a series of on line helps from the manufacturer, I was unable to obtain HD, and the standard TV image was shaky and not very clear. I decided to just lump it, and return the item to the seller. I haven't heard from him, and don't expect a refund at this time. I was just glad to get rid of something that wasted my time trying to get it set up. I'm perfectly happy to get my HD TV the normal way, from a new HD television set."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loose the remote you are out of luck.","review":"I bought this product and it works fine. My biggest problem with itis that I lost the remote and when I contacted the company I was told that they do not sell a replacement remote. They told me that I can go to any store that sells their product and buy a replacement. The two stores I went to told me that they did not know why I was told that because they have never seen the remote alone.Bottom line: if you loose the remote there is no way to replace it. That is why I am giving this product a one. If there was a way to give them a zero I would. Be ware of any product that does not offer replacementparts. Especially a remote control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Vista Media Center","review":"You can watch HD television with this product, but only using the crappy software that comes with it. Repeated interactions with their offshore tech support yielded only frustration. I returned the product after three full days of trying to get Media Center to see the tuner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not record HDTV with this device","review":"I was able to watch HDTV and digital TV broadcasts received over-the-air using the attenna provided with the Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick. But I could not successfully record TV programs with Pinnacle's Media Center software. I have a 3.0Ghz Pentium 4 with HyperThreading, 2 gb of RAM and a SATA hard drive on my Windows XP system but I think you need a more powerful system to be successful. I noticed that while watching HDTV, my CPU utilization was around 80%. When recording TV programs, the CPU utilization was about 100%. The resulting recording was of poor quality and unwatchable. I tried various recording settings to see if it made any difference but it didn't. I was able to uninstall the Pinnacle software but it made changes to my system that cause some game programs I had to stop working. I tried to do a XP system restore but was unable to do a roll-back. Bottomline: I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a keeper.","review":"As long as we are going to drag \\"stuff\\" home, we might as well learn to at least catalog, organize, and store it safety, and with style.This is what you call a \\"perennial\\"--a book that you can bring out at any time, year after year, and still find it useful.

Schmidt was a contempoary composer with Strauss and Schoenberg. But like Joachim Raff, he tries to keep alive the dying torch of the Romantic echoes of his beloved land. Enrooted and influenced by Bruckner, Brahms and Mahler, the color of his melodic motives leave aside a solid architectural building. And so you may listen and even enjoy this inspired vignette of captivating melodies that will delight our senses but hardly to permeate our souls.Neem Jarvi enhances and faced the hiuge challenge to carve in relief the virtues of his music. The Chicago Symphony proves the heavy wieght consistence of his powerful sound but at the end you may find it a music without transcendence. The similar impression you feel with Grieg, Medtner or the Symphonic Scriabin, for instance.Nevertheless the level of the performance justifies and rewards its buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Genuine Brother -- BEWARE!","review":"This toner is NOT a genuine Brother TN350.
