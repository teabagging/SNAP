It is written in a survey style giving the reader a general overview of why real estate is such a smart investment, how to acquire property and other aspects in the game. The book is well written and easy to get into. You finish wanting to read more in-depth books and go out and see some properties. I would recommend this to anyone with no to little experience but if you've been in real estate before you might find one of his other books more helpful ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended at all.","review":"I have read several books on real estate investing. The examples in this book are wrong at best. All examples on rental income do not account for property taxes, maintenance expenses and property managers fee (if applicable).

The second half of the book is better, but spends too much time talking about investing in New Zealand. The book oversimplifies investing, without digging in deeper on issues like operating costs for duplexes versus apartments etc. The book advocates maximum leverage without covering risks like rising interest rates, unexpected costs etc. The only useful info I found was in the discussion of internal rate of return for comparing investments.

Wouldn't turn on or respond in any way to new film or batteries.When I called Konica Minolta, they told that I could not return or exchange, they would only repair.

The setting, a California dairy farm, is unusual, but so are the characters and the story; this is romance at its best--heartening, uplifting, touching. Susan Floyd is going far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous reference for fantasy postcard collectors...","review":"Mashburn writes great books, no question about it.

He coveres all the basics: fairies, nursery rhymes, dressed animals, mermaids, teddy bears, Santas, Krampus, nudes, death fantasies, Halloween, Hold-To-Light, and a whole host of other types of weird and wonderful subjects.As well, Mashburn gives us a comprehensive history of postcards and collecting, covering the seven eras of postcards. He discusses the various types, how to date them, grade them, and value them. Since the book was written in '96, his prices do not always reflect current online auction prices, but that's understandable. My only real quibble with this book is that after reading through it and looking at the many black and white illustrations I only wanted to go out and buy more cards!

This two-disc compilation--containing thirty-nine tracks and released in 2005--fit the bill, and I do not regret the purchase. It is all the Zamfir that I need and has done its job well. The pan flute is a beautiful-sounding instrument that I also find to be relaxing. The first disc has twenty-one tracks, while the second disc contains eighteen. In addition to Zamfir's pan flute playing, this compilation also includes other nice instrumentation--orchestration, for example. There is also an essay and some photos of Zamfir that are included in this collection. The first disc is just over eighty minutes, while the second disc is almost sixty-six minutes.

This wouldn't be so bad, except she doesn't even like knitting. It's as if she felt like she Should be a knitter, and she just doesn't get knitting. Instead of celebrating the stories of people who love knitting, she drags us through her swatch fetish. Also, most of the stories are of knitters in the Northeast and in California. The stories were good, for the most part, but I was very disappointed that Nargi's major focus is on other urban knitters. Your grandmother isn't the only one who knits anymore, but neither is knitting the sole purview of hip urban artists.

I thought the eraser was some errant packing material! It's white foam and not shown on the picture. The timer is a great concept, but also difficult to use. It is supposed to start when you roll, but often needs to be smacked.The concept of the game is good. It does get interesting to try to fit your words as the game progresses. The scoring is reasonable and pretty straightforward. Perhaps with better quality and more enthusiastic opponents this would be more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Small","review":"I have a normal generic leopard gecko 1 year old female that is 6 inches long. From other customer reviews I thought this product would be perfect. I immediately noticed the hole was really small. My leopard gecko can barely fit her head through the opening and cannot move freely inside.I rate this product a 4 because the hide loosely fits together and can be easily knocked off from herps getting in and out. other than that, this hide would be ferfect for anoles, very small snakes, and baby geckos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping","review":"We bought this for our leopard gecko and we use it as the moist hide.

I did not expect this when I bought it. In my opinion, it was not very relaxing, my baby still screamed his head off and it really didn't help much. I had serious issues with colic and honestly the only things that helped were the books, \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" and \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\".

I have been an OB nurse for over 20 years and have used this tape in nurseries everywhere. It's great for preemies-it helps them relax and feel comfortable so they can gain weight. Regular newborns love it too. It always puts them to sleep. It sounds kind of like you are in outer space. A woman is humming quietly in the background with a lot of white noise and a whooshing sound. You may think this is dumb, but it is actually created from audio taping inside a pregnant woman. This is what your baby ACTUALLY HEARS inside. Your baby does NOT know that you are singing cute lullabies or getting smarter because he is listening to mozart. This music is a great way to make a newborn feel safe and warm and content."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleeping miracle","review":"my baby had really bad colic and would wake all the time at night.

The information isnt bad, and gives a good coverage of the subject, but the errata list I receieved from my professor spanned at least 20 pages, front and back. You'll learn controls with the right professor, but expect the book to confuse you with changing subscripts, even changing values in example problems. For example, the area of a wing in one example problem is listed as 945 ft^2 and yet the problem solves using the area of 965 ft^2. Equations will be missing subscripts entirely, or duplicate them. For example, in one end of the chapter section of problems, the 2-D coefficient of lift for the tail is listed twice as opposed to giving you one value for the tail, and another for the wing as they should have. Expect to make assumptions like they have never been made before either. So much will not be given to you, it will be up to you to decide what value is reasonable that youll use.

Because of that, the story lacks the emotional impact it might have had if it had been written at that time. I've read it before, I've seen it before (\\"Longtime Companion\\", for example)...I've lived it! Since then, something called combination therapies have exploded on the scene, drastically reducing the number of AIDS deaths.

The trial transcripts are only when Wilde is in the box.

The \\"Bellerophoniad\\" retells Bellerophon's story, combining it with the \\"Dunyazadiad\\" and confusing it beyond belief with all manner of mythological and deconstructional and metafictional interruptions. The enormity of this book is matched by the enormousness of its detail. The book is amusing in parts, but in the end is itself a Chimera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, thought-provoking, humorous, generally excellent","review":"This is one of the finest works by a fine author. Several scenes and lines from it have entered my personal mythos.Each of the three novellas is a gem in its own way, and the trio work beautifully together. In each, the basic idea is to show a legendary figure as a real human being. We see Perseus after his glory days have passed, for example, and also meet Bellerophon who secretly feels that he has been a faker all along. But it's much more than yet another retelling of old legends.It will make you think. It will probably also make you laugh in places and move you in others.The wrapup is unexpected.

Dr. Grinker does a wonderful job of not bringing his personal feelings about Colin's work, his homosexuality, or his relationship with Joe Towles into the book. Grinker does, however, give a wonderful sense of Colin and Colin's take on life. One doesn't have to be interested in either anthropology or homosexuality to like this book; it is, simply put, an excellent study of an all-too-human man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but. . .","review":"This is a really great book.

This is a biography of Colin Turnbull but I wanted to know much more about J. Towles. What I did find so moving was the passionate relationship colin turnbull and joe towles had.

This album is partly straight blues, but mostly it's Butterfield's later, funky, approach to his music, with a very tight band. My favorite tracks are \\"Everything Going To Be Alright\\" and \\"Driftin' & Driftin'\\" - mostly because they are more bluesy and less funky, and because they feature some great, extended harp solos - but that's just my personal preference.This CD replaced my vinyl copy that had a few skips.

It's just as scattershot and disjointed as that overrated classic. I enjoyed Kristen Hersh's commercial struggle on House Tornado and The Real Ramona: she wanted the pop market to kowtow to her freaky fragmentation. The fight ended a thrilling draw. Before that, she didn't seem merely unhinged or abrasively inspired: she sounded crazy. There are times when the thrashing time changes and trilling rants work: \\"Civil Disobedience\\" creates meaning from its abrupt rhythms since the song's about defiance. \\"Pandora's Box\\" strums its seductive melody into a neo-blues once the evil box is opened. They make sense. Otherwise, the tracks - though well played - feel arbitrary; a ... band playing with intricate tempos because they can.

HUH??? I usually don't really like a CD that much until I read the lyrics. Being a poetic person, the words draw me in. I tend to feel a bit cheated when a CD doesn't contain lyrics.Maybe if I find the lyrics on the net, I will grow to like the CD more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel to \\"Time\\"... a \\"World\\" of wonder.","review":"His 3rd album for W.H. is an obvious sequel to Citizen of Time ( his 3rd album for Narada), and Mr. Arkenstone has done it again. I believe his best is still yet to come (which is why I only gave this album 4 stars) and \\"world music\\" is really not his forte- which is probibly why the more \\"cinematic\\" pieces like Safe Passage, Ceremony, Pharohs, and Dreamtime seem to stand out as typical, familiar and,of course, classic Arkensound. Still, a fine piece of music-making and sound-designing overall. D.Ark is still my alltimefavorite- followed, ever so closely, be Vangelis...which is darn good company for Dave to be in. Duke Wally Mondo sez =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not David's best...","review":"A cluster of world music cliches'; a disappointing outing from the ususally reliable Arkenstone. The album feaures none of the grand, sweeping orchestrations or pop nuances that marked his best efforts; instead, we are given song after song of bland, meandering sameness, more in keeping with meditiation/contemplation music than anything else. Fans of that kind of music may find this interesting; it would probably be good as ambient background or relaxation help. Only the last track, \\"Into the dreamtime,\\" features anything resembling what fans have come to expect from David--and the best part of the song comes in the last two minutes! I was very, very disappointed with this album; but David redeemed himself with his next effort, \\"Caravan of Light.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting!","review":"This music is perfect for listening to when I'm cooking, sitting around or being with the rest of my family. My six year old daughter loves it too. One song, \\"Safe Passage\\", makes me dream of seeing my daughter and my son on horseback, the wind in their hair, and the sun in their eyes, cantering across a wide plain towards an unknown but good destination. The rest of the songs are catchy, danceable and hummable; some don't leave my head for a while. My husband made fun of it at first but he came around and now he likes it too. This is worth buying for a beautiful music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmosphere","review":"On this musical outing the sound is often gentle and restrained, at times better suited for relaxed listening than mind-stretching.

When I study the Bible, I want to make sure that what I am reading is accurate. Mr Rotherham was a good Hebrew and Greek scholar who was very careful in how he interpreted the Sacred Scriptures. Although there are other good Bible translations, there are also several poor translations. From personal experience, I believe that The Emphasized Bible is the most accurate translation that we have available in English today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Bible Study Tool","review":"I would have given this Bible \\"5\\" stars if the print size would have been larger and more comfortable to read (font is probably a 7-point). In any case, what makes Rotherham's Emphasized Bible such an excellent and useful Bible study aide is it's uncompromising loyalty to the authorized version for accuracy, its continued adherence to the literal \\"word for word\\" rule of interpretation, the scholarly yet easy-to-follow footnotes on specific verses, and also its overall character of genuiness of devotion to the veracity and inspiration of the Scriptures. I strongly recommend this Bible to any serious student of the Scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, a cinematic masterpiece!","review":"Its a shame it hasn't been released on dvd.

You basically pick up items and try to piece together clues in order to figure out what happened. It is quite challenging. If you have never played it before and you enjoy these style games, you should definately buy it. Another similar game by the same company which takes place in Midevil times is Shadowgate. If you like Deja Vu you will like Shadowgate, and vice versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Game!","review":"This game has it all, great graphics, color and a fun plot with some twists.

Interesting and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Gameboy games I have ever bought","review":"The graphics are fine, and for what it is, the game is fine. The problem is that the game isn't much fun. Basically, the game consists of you looking through drawers, pockets, etc to try to get things to help you. The problem is that you never know what you are going to need. You end up with sausages and plates in your pockets, and the game is so arbitrary that there is no sense of real game flow. If you love these types of games, you probably won't be disappointed, but Shadowgate (made by the same people) was much better than this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality & Value","review":"Lovely quality glass in a classic shape made for decanting your favorite wines.

Steele could spin them off into a short textbook. The explanations of antibody diversity, gene rearrangement and hypermutation are really very good. The rest is a little hard to believe, and where the immune system is concerned doesn't even make sense. Adaptability and variability, not hard-coding, are key to the immune response, so it seems that what he proposes--that learned responses could be passed back into germ-line DNA--wouldn't even be benficial if it were to turn out to be true considering the rate at which most pathogens mutate.

For years, I have anguished over my faith (or lack thereof), which put incredible stress on my relationship with my family. They could not conceive how it was possible for me to doubt my faith since I grew up in a committed, Bible-believing family. The relationship grew so hostile and strained that I thought we were finished. Ruth Tucker's book helped bridge the gap. It expressed my struggles with faith in just the right tone and manner. After not speaking to my family for several months, I sent my mother a copy of the book. I think the title scared her at first, but she eventually she picked it up.

He can't sit up straight and slides into a slouch. In colder weather, when he is wearing more than a light jacket, the bulk of the jacket makes it impossible to even get him to stay in the swing. Since there is no way for him to sit up straight and slide his rear end back (even without the jacket), he ends up right on the edge of the swing when wearing a jacket, with his body in basically a straight position which causes him to slide right off. Plus, the harness straps are not very long when adjusted to their maximum, so with a heavier jacket they don't fit. I'm not talking about a big child here either. At 29 months, my son still only weighs 25 pounds.

If one of these ideas did not work or was not appropriate, there were others to explore.

It gives a brief overview of both sides of the story- very good for opening the field for questions from your child. The only part that I did not like was how it said how the parents \\"cired, cried, cried\\" because they could not give birth to their own child, and the birth mother \\"cried, cried, cried\\" because of her situation.

I first thought the \\"Practice\\" mode would only let you throw a few darts, but it lets you play a full game to my delight, since I don't get to compete with others often. The cartridge is even cool because it is a smoky transparent cartridge allowing you to see the electronics inside. The game even has a voice that speaks at the intro and during the game. If you don't like darts, you most likely will after playing this. My only complaint is that some of the characters you play are too fast or too nervous.

I have also tried a roller photo cutter and they are fantastic, but by introducing the adhesive, it would gum up the cutter guide bar and it had to be cleaned.

In the future cyber-punk dystopia where the story takes place, things took a turn for the... weirder.After a five year mountain self-proposed exile of The City, Spider (in a remarkably hippie appearence) finds himself money-wasted and with a contract to finish, so he has no choice but to return to the City he so eagerly left to get a job and start once more to bring forth all the dirt there is behind the people of the City, as his duty as a journalist requires him to.Not really a \\"child safe\\" work, but I belive that everyone should read this at some point of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was sceptical, but became entrapped","review":"I am not a reader of super hero comics, not that Transmetropolitan protagonistic 'Spider Jerusalum' is sold to us as a hero, or even antihero, but I was caught up in the story and futuristic world.After I managed to detach Spider from Hunter Thompson, I really began to enjoy the dark slapstick craziness.

The sets and cast look great; the acting is good enough. The fault, I suppose, lies primarily with the composer: he captures some of the desperation of Blanche, but not the (faded) beauty. Apparently, he wrote this part for Renee Fleming; but, for one thing, I would like to hear it sung more softly -- with slower tempos! Maybe there is vocal beauty here that this performance fails to capture because it doesn't let the music sufficiently \\"breathe.\\" Renee Fleming has a wonderful melancholy look, which her at times almost Wagnerian vocalizing belies -- Isolde, fallen on hard times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futral sizzles, Rene burns","review":"I don't like Tennessee Williams...such dull, dreary characters. And much of Previn's music seems contrived. But the music and drama both go over the top when Futral seduces a seemingly stoic Gilfry...... the music is minimal, yet so sensuous. Futral sings so lightly, more like purring. Hot as it gets... Yet sex is not the end, only the means for control. As Futral approaches orgasmic intensity, Gilfry grins at Rene. He's got the power... and he's letting Rene know it........big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissenting View","review":"I bought this opera and I believe that the reviews below are accurate in most senses.

Unfortunately, what I got was a clunky, barely playable insult to one of my favorite DC heroes/villains. Not only is Selena Kyle unable to attack while air-borne, she can't even move when she's not on the ground. Okay, so you can swing across ceilings, but that's the extent of it. The gameplay is monotonous and the animation is poorly done, not even exceptable by South Park standards.

A triumph! If that's a bit too over the top, you might prefer the very skilfully arranged title track, or the tender Latin version of Stevie Wonder's \\"You are the Sunshine of My Life\\".Buddy's band is really cooking on this album, and Mel's in fine form with his clever 'scattology' and amazingly long final notes (check out \\"Bluesette\\"!).Trust me - you'll end up playing this over and over again.

He shows up disoriented and disshevelled, claiming to have been in a train wreck and yet... no train accidents have been reported in months. For some reason, the cops want to arrest him, and he inexplicably goes on the lam. This is one of those chase films where the character's actions and motivations don't really make much sense, and as a result it's hard to get involved in the plot.

Although obviously different from his other works in format, Kundera's insight brings clarity to life's most confusing and fundamental situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward and God","review":"The last short story in this collection is magnificent! Edward and God has it all; all of the really Big questions are examined through the eyes of a teacher in a socialist state that doesn't seem to have a place for God. What is love? What is meaningful in life? What is truth? It is all there in this very short story. What are we willing to do for love? What does it mean when someone loves you? Does love even exist? And through all of these arguments we are aroused as the young teacher tries to understand why relationships suddenly change. Quite an adventure and quite a treatise on Love. One of the best short stories ever written!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is great for my 4 year old who is just beginning to learn about addition. The illustrations are cute and the wording is so funny! We always read it more than once at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sports Reference Book","review":"When I first viewed this book in my local library, I was captivated for hours. The wealth of information that can be found in this book is excellent. I've seen some unusual games before on television, but never fully understood the basic rules and what is involved.This book explains and illustrates (very well) the basics of many professional and amateur games that are played in the world.I once used this book to create a game that would be easy to play and where no one would get hurt. This book helped, and now the young kids in my family use it make up new games. We combine the balls and rules of many games into one.If you love sports, or you are new to sports, this book will be of help to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of the Old Testament","review":"I have found this book to be very informative and accurate.

It makes a great companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate poetry, so naturally Bukowski's poetry works for me","review":"I love Bukowski's fiction, its straightforward, unadorned, yet precise diction, and its degraded, yet implacable hero(es?).Poetry, to me, has always seemed a florid waste of time, and a lazy man's game. It seems like shorthand at its best moments.But I can't get over the fact that this guy, while making fun of the form, is able to nail his little portraits with alarming consistency.Some of these, like \\"My Ivy League Friends,\\" are narrative, mean and straight.Others, still eschewing metaphor, are humming, man-shaped bells, like \\"No Help For That.\\"There are some duds, and I won't bother pointing to them because they'll be obvious when you come to them.But, I like this guy a lot. He's real, even when he does his best to avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Have Another One","review":"Reading Charles Bukowski is like being drunk. Without taking a drink. That is what it feels like to me. I'll have to consider whether any of my other favorite poets alter my consciousness that way, but at first consideration, I can't think of one who does. This is a good thing, a good drunk, a \\"speak the truth\\" type of drunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its all good, even the dead....","review":"I read any/all of Hank's poetry the same way - a couple of pieces after a couple of beers. This combination makes me come back to Hank time and time again. Somehow he is able to cut through time, cut through death, cut through propriety and society without being depressing. He makes me feel like there is honor in just being truthful and sentient.Imagine writing such simple, scuzzy stuff and knowing it was great at the same time? Here's to ya Hank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE","review":"I love reading and surprisingly I love this poetry book.

I recommend any Bukowski fans to purchase this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflective book of poetry","review":"I hate poetry, but I love Buk's poems. This book is written in a more hesitant thought out manner. It seems as if Buk got sentimental for a period and the result is a book of poetry that seems mostly retrospective. These poems seem less emotional and more calm. Yet at times his poems recount hilarious antecdotes and reveal his retrospective insights concerning them. In one poem, Bukowski comments on people complaining that his recent poem's lack of urgency. I got the mental image of Bukowski aging alone and wondering why he isn't dead yet. This is a book of non-urgent slow moving beautiful poems. To put it in simplist terms, I recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"another review","review":"Not as good as Love is a dog... but still worth reading. there are some really good poems in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"cast iron grill","review":"This is a wonderful purchase.

Its filled with content any mid-level engineer already knows or can figure out on their own. It goes into no low-level detail of the switch hardware or software design in anyway. The topic on SAN Design was written semi-technical in a sense the *ONLY* design considerations are \\"two tier\\", \\"three tier\\", \\"star\\" ... sounds like old network design concepts from a 1991 Cisco press book on LAN Switches.Go to the book store and just flip through this book, if you're familiar with networking and storage already, this book is of no use, if you're someone with absolutely zero knowledge of SANs and Brocade, get this book at a \\"dummies\\" book and don't rely on it to pass interviews per se."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from Brocade","review":"I really expected a lot more from Brocade, being they are the market leader in switches.

They mostly don't want to think for themselves or test what they're told, they just want to know what they have to memorize for the test. This book not only exposes some of the most pernicious historical myths of our contemporary culture, it also teaches the reader to think critically and care more about truth than conformity. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious polemic and waste of time","review":"Only 10 years old and it already seems outdated, this sort of peevish crankiness from spoiled academics complaining about the idiot conversations going on in their subsidized ivory towers is an affront to every inhabitant of the real world. It is astonishing the waste of intellectual energy the baby boom generation has indulged in.The only portion of the book I found slightly worth the trouble was the section on the Goddess-hype in anthropology, which allowed me to indulge my mild curiousity in the subject without having to wade into volumes of feminist cant; but if you wanted to actually be the least informed about any subject, this isn't the place to look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaches to the choir","review":"I really wanted to like this book. But as other reviewers have said, the author's own peculiar prejudices somehow escape the thresher of his otherwise well-trained mind.

Dr. Thornton commits every error of logic he criticizes other for. Intriquing though it is to think that all psychological theory is bunk, it is not true. Although it is refreshing to read someone who has carefully read Greek and Roman literature, as well as most literature before the twentieth century, I feel that one needs to have a responsible attitude towards the problems of our times. His ideas have just enough of a ring of truth about them to make them dangerously misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"As much as I respect Bruce Thornton and his friend and colleague Victor Davis Hanson as the Classicists, as much I can't stand 'em as contemporary 'political thinkers.'

It's my favorite book for quick reference and identification of ferns, clubmosses, and horsetails. The paper in this edition is more durable, but the book heavier, which is a consideration in the field.

I returned it and tried another one. I got the same restults. I tried using 5 mil and still had to put it through a couple times before working. I would not pay the money to get this unless you were only using 3 mil and didn't mind the chances of haivng to put it through a couple times.

The aluminum threads that connect the lamp bar to the base are cheaply made, and as a result it is impossible to tighten completely. After you screw it in completely, just a little more pressure and the threads will pop out causing the lamp to wobble around in the base. Every time you adjust the reading lamp the threads on the base will pop out.Also, the reading lamp is too heavy for the base, so don't even consider using this lamp on carpet. It will constantly lean towards the reading lamp a few inches off center.This isn't just a fluke, I bought two of these lamps at the same time, and they both have this problem.The lamps look really cool, but beyond that they are complete junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke off at base","review":"As another reviewer mentions this is a very unstable lamp. I have only ever moved it to vacuum underneath it and it was always wobbly due to a problem with the threading at the connecting points.

The controls are a bit weird but you get used to them. Its not as hard to play as people say it is, granted most of the time I hijack moving cars. You can grab busses and police cars (once you kill the cop of course)The game is fun, remember it is a game boy game though. Dont Think 3d graphics. Sometimes you meet up with guys and rob banks and stuff. This game is TEEN i dont advise letting people 1-8 to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most pathetic games for GBC","review":"I can't believe people are reviewing this game favorably here! Are standards THAT low?First there is the control problem. Um, ok, I love having the ability to get the player I'm controlling stuck to the point were I have to quit the game because there is no way to maneuver. Also, is was PAINFUL to try and even get into the cars.Second, the game is just BORING. Nothing like the PC game which was a lot of fun. No, I wasn't expecting the PC version, but the gameplay is plain horrible.Save your money, don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"This conversion SUCKS BIG TIME. It is very little like the PC version, which you are better off with. All physics on the cars are the same, meaning all cars go top speed, are hard to control, and all have the same armor rating.

Stick with the PC version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grand Theft Auto","review":"This game is not worth your time. Although the city in the gameboy version is the same huge city in the PC verison, the game falls way short of Grand Theft Auto's good name. The graphics are decent and no compliants from that part of the game, but the overall game play is lacking. It is quite common for you to walk down a mainstreet and not see a car for miles. The police rarely come after you. I've had four cop heads one me(means I was a bad bad boy) and been able to walk around town without a cop ever coming after me. The steering system in cars is very poor and hard to turn. When you turn your car it looks cheesy and very unrealistic.

To try and squeeze this on to GBC was very hard, and thus the translation suffers. First, actually stealing a moving car is too hard. You will occasionally find one that is parked, but it is a pain. And Second, the game lacks any of the real blood, gore, or cursing that made it stand out otherwise. However, there is still a great driving game underneath. Fast speeds, good music, and exciting missions make it always fun. There is also an arrow, which points you where you need to go. This is always very helpful. Joyriding is great, as none of the game is timed. Missions are always optional, and there are many to choose from. You get to play in three diverse cities: Liberty City, Vice City, and San Andreas. Everything made it over from the PS One great, and this is an great game. Buy this for the driving, not for the edgy content the PS One version had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor control really hurts this game","review":"Grand Theft has a refreshing plot-twist going for it (if nothing else) b/c in this game you are the criminal working your way up the outlaw ladder.Too bad about the play control.

Instead, you are confined to awkward and tedious control functions that render Grand Theft Auto virtually UNPLAYABLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game; the control is tedious","review":"GTA is a cool concept---you are the criminal trying to get a rep buy pulling jobs for the mob.

As far as I am concerning, any help is good help.The new edition adds sections on Ruby and Apache web server and a few updates on previous existing language content.One of the best things about this book is that the author synchs the content with the authoritative referenceMastering Regular Expressions. In a welcome convenience, the author provides page references to that book to point to elaboration.One section of the book I really liked (but wished was much more extensive) contained 2 pages of cookbook examples.

In my opinion, the dialogue seemed weak and unrealistic in a lot of areas, the quips fell flat, and the main character, Nick, was uninteresting. Also, as a resident of Brockport, I found the changes to locale disconcerting, and even annoying at times. While I do understand that changes are sometimes necessary, for the most part, these seem to make no sense. Perhaps another town in Monroe County would have been a better choice for this particular novel.Mr. Tomasso writes in a simplistic manner, without a real feel for chacterization or emotion (the relationship between Nick and Karis was not believable as written), and quite frankly, I'm a bit perplexed at the rave reviews I've read. If you're looking for an intense thriller that makes you think, I wouldn't recommend choosing Tenth House."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong book was sent","review":"I was expecting Two Queens at the Abbey, one of the Elsie Jeanette Oxenham books about the Abbey school, and I received instead Selma at the Abbey, a book I already have.

Shortly before he passed in December of 2010, I began an ancestral search of his ( and my mother's ) ancestry. My brother told me about this book and I am so glad I purchased it from Amazon.com.

I compared it side-by-side with the plain green tea from Lipton and there is a very noticeable difference. This variety is less harsh and bitter, more smooth and engaging. It's great when tea has a bit of a fruity taste to it (Earl Grey is the prime example) and this tea definitely pulls it off. True, it's not quite on the level of other gourmet teas (hence the 4 stars), but for the price, you would be hard-pressed to find a better value. Highly recommended for green tea aficionados who want a little something different in their traditional blend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great door stopper","review":"This is a great door stopper.

You can spend hours building a railroad, but you can't save your game. That's right, you can spend hours working to get that railroad connected from New York to Los Angeles, build up your company, and get just the manager you want.

You can pick up an old 286 and an original copy of RRT at the auction for less than the price of RRT II and you will have a lot more fun! A tip if you try and run the original RRT on newer hardware, you might have to pick MCGA or EGA on the opening screen - don't worry, it's the same graphics but some new hardware doesn't like the old VGA driver. Take it from someone who has been playing RRT since the days of the XT, the appeal of the game is in the AI, not in pretty graphics.

Dying land and desperate farmers are saved by this unlikely hero. The film is beautifully written and photographed and well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing New Zealander","review":"This film looks at biodynamic agriculture, a Rudolph Steiner-inspired system of organic farming. It primarily focuses on New Zealander Peter Proctor and his work promoting biodynamics worldwide, particularly in India. Proctor argues that modern industrial agriculture (e.g. artificial fertilizers and pesticides and genetically engineered seeds) has made soil and plants toxic, and modern farming unsustainable.Especially interesting is the obvious social changes that occur in Indian communities where Proctor has reintroduced more \\"natural\\" methods of agriculture.With increasing fossil fuel depletion predicted to make the cost of artificial fertilizers and pesticides prohibitive for the average farmer, it's great to see both first and third world countries taking up this alternative.

I grant you, this is a work of fiction, and so portrayals of characters in the book should not be taken as the way modern Pagans really are, but there are an awful lot of folks who think Harry Potter is teaching children witchcraft...At best, this is mediocre fiction.

If you are vacuuming and the phone rings or someone is at the door, you might as well lay it down because it will more than likely fall over while unattended, despite the fact that claims from the manufacturer state it can stand upright with ease.I will, without hesitation, recommend this product for someone in an apartment or a small condo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Little Vac In Town, Hands Down","review":"I love this vacuum.. what great sucking power and very light weight...I liked it so much i purchased another one 2 weeks later for my mother in law..she loved it..Just the perfect vacuum!!!!!!!!!!!!! keep up the great work Hoover..your the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for small rooms and quick vacuuming.","review":"This is a god-send product for people who want to clean up a room or two rather quickly.

Beware, the dirt cup fills up quickly reducing the suction power. You will find yourself emptying the cup and rinsing the filter often. However this process takes 5-10 minutes. The unit is light and easy to store on a hook or inside a closet. If you leave it leaning against a wall, it may slide to one side damaging the plastic casing. Please be careful. I am highly satisfied with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Stick Vacuum","review":"Great product. Plenty of power, lightweight and does the job.

We have a small apt, few rugs but mainly hard wood floors and this hoover still overheats after one room. I never really liked it from the start - hard to get into corners and although small - can be heavy and bit uneasy to keep upright. It fell over once, hitting our white wall and left a very ugly red mark (from the paint) that wont come off. Usually love Hoover but this was a huge disappointment. Wont be buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has this vacuum been all my life?!?","review":"After reading all of the reviews (as I do before buying ANYTHING), I bought this vacuum, and I'm so glad I did!! I will ditto everything good that has been said about it and add:I mainly got this vacuum for my wood and tile floors. I have 3 animals and need to keep up with the hair at least twice a week. It works really well on the floors, but what I wasn't expecting was how well it cleans my deep-pile area rug! I'm so glad I don't have to lug my heavy vacuum downstairs just for the rug anymore! I also use it to remove pet hair from my dining room chairs. It is so handy.

If you buy this vac, forget about waking up on a Saturday morning expecting to accomplish some house cleaning. I just turned the thing on and vacuumed ten square feet of my hardwood floor and it overheated. Each time it overheats, you need to let it cool down, which takes about an hour and then you have to go back, vacuum another tiny area, weep as it putters out again, wait another hour, and begin the process again. It has literally taken all week for me to vacuum my bare floors. Is there something caught in the nozzle or hose, you ask. Definitely not. I have checked more times than I can count. Hoover may have had he right idea, but this product fails miserably in my book. I give it a G!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant at an amazing price!!","review":"I was looking for a small vacuum to clean floor rugs in my small NYC apartment. I was looking for a small rechargeable model to keep the price down, although I am somewhat skeptical of the suction power of rechargeable models. I came across this model on Amazon and decided to give it a try - I figured it was cheap enough to throw away if it was no good.What I didn't expect was how good this device actually is!! Not only does it make light work of keeping my rugs clean, it perfectly vacuums hardwood and tile floors in the rest of the apartment, quickly and without the usual drop in air quality from a broom (the broom has not left the closet since I bought this). It is also easy to clean and store.At this price, it is excellent value for money.I could not recommend this more highly for anyone looking for a compact device with excellent cleaning power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible vacuum!","review":"This vacuum was trouble from the second I get it.

I have a three level house and i use this on all my hard wood floors and one area rug. i was shocked how much cat hair this thing picked up off the rug (the cats think its theirs) i actually was embarrassed by how much hair i got. it is wonderful and it is the perfect solution to those quick run arounds - i use it every couple of days to keep the tumble weeds at bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor over heats","review":"This vacuum is great EXCEPT that this is my second one and they have both had the same problem - the motor overheats and it stops working, you have to wait for it to cool and then it works again.

It is light and easy to steer. I love the power nozzle. If you've ever tried to vacuum a rug without a power nozzle you'll understand why.

I bought it so I wouldn't have to broom sweep the floors as much.I live in sandy florida by the beach and mostly have hardwood floors that I want to keep the sand off of as much as possible. The only thing I don't like is the bagless part. You sweep up all the dirt, then you spread a lot of it around in the air when you empty the cup.

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's still too early as I've only had it for a month or so, and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it's been given.We have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home, and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week.Along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with, and so far there has been no problem. I highly recommend this little guy, and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place.One suggestion though. Wonder how long it'll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model.

Amazon was terrific in arranging for a replacement however once again I was sent a vacuum with two parts instead of three. This time the parts did fit together at least but I can't help but wonder if I am receiving an older discontinued version of the vacuum.I barely used this item however the first time I used it on a heavy job it fell apart.

After that it will only turn on for the carpet setting and the only thing that happens is the brush spins. It also makes a high pitched sound now.I have never had luck with Hoover products but because of the great reviews I tried this one. It has a one-year warranty but you need to take it to a service center that will send it to Hoover. If they determine it was a manufacturer's defect it will be replaced. Not worth the trouble for a $50 vacuum.

It is nice and works well until it breaks. I bought three of them - I bought 2 last April (one for me and one for my mother who is 82). I used mine on hardwood floors to swivel around and pick up dust and pet hair. I was nice until the plastic part at the bottom cracked completely off - I tried glue and tape but it didn't work. I liked the vacuum so I bought another one last November - well, it broke in the same place in less than 2 months. I called Hoover to let them know that there was some kind of design flaw problem - they offered to send me a replacement which I thought was nice of them. I called them today to see if the replacement had been sent yet and they said that a replacement nozzle was on the way. I explained to them that the nozzle (floor part) was not broken - it was the plastic casing itself on the stick that attached to the nozzle. I couldn't make them understand.

Then I started noticing red scuff marks on all of my baseboards. The vacuum rubs on walls and leave red marks, so be careful! Then the vacuum tipped over once and the clip that holds the filter in broke.

I would not recommend this vacuum to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter clogs and motor overheats","review":"With a clean filter the vacuum does a good job on hard floor and carpet. However, the fabric filter quickly plugs with dust. Suction at the floor decreases substantially as the filter clogs which also reduces air flow across the vacuum motor. Since air flow drops so low, the motor overheats within a few minutes. I can get the vacuum to work only by washing the filter with soap and water after every use. That's really too much work so I bought a Hoover bagless vacuum as a replacement.

I've got one wool rug in the living room, and a smaller one in the dining room, maybe 200 sq ft total. The rest of my house is wood floors and ceramic tile. This little Hoover used to work pretty well, I could usually manage to do a quick whole-house vacuum, minus the rugs. Now, I can barely get two bedrooms done without it shutting down due to overheating. Takes at least a half-hour for mine to cool down, sometimes more. I do keep filters clean, it certainly runs nicely when I start, but having to take a couple of long breaks during cleaning is just unacceptable. Maybe they are only meant to last a few years, maybe keep it around for just quick pickups. But will probably just trash it and look for something else.

You don't have to turn a switch all the way at the bottom like other vacuums. It's conveniently located where you can reach it without bending down. It's also very lightweight and can reach hard-to-reach places easily. There is no bag and the filter is also very easy to clean. It will overheat but it doesn't affect the vacuum's performance.

It isn't as loud as my last stick vac and it doesn't scratch my wood floors. The first day I bought it I really put it through the paces. I was impressed with how well it cleans floors, carpets and rugs with fringe. I love the fact that you can turn off the roller to do the fringed rugs and floors. It picked up popcorn and screws easily. Sand and gravel from the kids shoes, no problem. After a rain, the floor got a little muddy from all the kids going in and out so I just turned on the brush and VOILA, the dried mud went right up.It really does stand on it's own, even on a soft cushy carpet.The only changes left to make is to lengthen the cord a bit and put a small pull-out nozzle high up on the side so I can use it for practically everything, such as dusting windowsills.

Everytime I use it I am shocked at how much it has picked up! Things I didn't even know were there! The largest items I've seen it pick up so far was a Cheerio without a problem. And my 16 month old doesn't mind the mild sound of this Vac either! I have recommended to all my family and friends with tile or wood floor, works great!

With a 1500 sq ft house, the vacuum gets a little hot in temperature, but has never failed. It's also very easy to empty and clean the canister, no bag required. Using this convenient vacuum helps our house stay clean more than just about anything else we do! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as strong","review":"This is a great little vacuum for touch ups. But not what I was looking for; it's not a small sized full vacuum. It does not get anything up that's between floor boards. But, for what it is, it's easy to assemble, easy to use. I can say that :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked!! Then, it didn't....","review":"For a vacuum, sucking is a good thing. Initially, I thought this vacuum to be all that Consumer Reports and amazon reviews said about it. For the price, this vacuum seemed well built, performed well, and was essentially the perfect vacuum for small spaces. However, up until the fourth or fifth use the vacuum motor quit working (The carpet brush still works.). I noticed the motor was running real whinny, but could not find anything obstructing its suction path. If it had one, it's like its \\"governor\\" broke and the motor burnt out. It's dead. May just have been a lemon. The area cleaned with the vacuum consists of one area rug and hard floors elsewhere in 600 sq. ft."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"so far very pleased with this product. Good suction and easy to handle. Worth the $$ for me. I have lots of dog hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Overheats","review":"The first 3 months with the vacuum were great!.....then...it started overheating and the motor would simply turn off. I assumed it was time for a new filter, but after a new filter replacement, the issue continued. Then i noticed on the side of the vacuum: \\"NOTICE: This cleaner has a device which will turn the motor off if overheating occurs. Turn switch off and unplug. Check for clogs or dirty filter. Allow to cool for 30 minutes.\\" I can now only use my vacuum for 7 minute intervals before the motor shuts off. My advice: Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little vac","review":"Very handy! Love the swivel head and it's very light weight. The filter gets things stuck to it (pet hair,lent,etc.) and has to be cleaned or \\"vacuumed\\" off. Very similar to a standard shop vac. Other than that, very powerful for it's size and gets under things with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"It\`s good, but....","review":"I was happy to use this vacuum for less 1 year, but if this one\`s nozzle would be broken or something critically happen...You\`d better buy new vacuum...There is no reason to wait 4~6 weeks to replace a broken nozzle with new one with around $30..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped working","review":"This was a handy little vacuum. But I got it at the end of December, and by May it stopped working. The nearest dealer is an hour away. I didn't us it a lot, and kept the filter clean. So I don't recommend it, since it didn't last very long. If you live near a dealer then you can get it fixed for free under warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great vaccum but short life. Not worth it.","review":"This was the second vacuum I purchased after the first one died (roller brush belt) exactly 12 mos. after purchase. For $49, I thought the cost of ownership was worth another try.So I bought another one mid-January. Died mid April. The \\"costs\\" of returning it to Amazon or getting a warranty replacement far outweigh the benefits of getting another one. Owning Hoover vacuums for ever, this poorly constructed product truly diminishes the overall brand and it's likely I'll not purchase another Hoover after this experience. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the power head got permanently jammed with hair","review":"This vacuum worked excellently, although ran a little on the hot side, until what I will describe as the \\"bearing\\" for the spinning brush in the power head got completely tangled with hair. This happened twice, the first time I was able to cut away the hair and restore the vacuum to normal operation. The second time, I disassembled the entire power head and the hair was so firmly embedded in the \\"bearing\\" that it was impossible to remove. I suspect that the friction between the hair and the bearing caused the hair to melt into the bearing itself. The vacuum should be designed so that the \\"bearing\\" is not exposed to debris.I would recommend this vacuum for light cleaning duties, but if you have a pet I would avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died After Three Uses; Do Not Buy If You Have Long Hair!!!","review":"I have a tiny studio apartment (read: not much space to be covered by a vacuum) and the only substances I needed the vacuum to consistently pick up were hair and feathers from a down comforter. This vacuum failed miserably.If you have long hair, stop reading this review now and find another vacuum immediately! My boyfriend and I both have long hair, and this vacuum could not handle it. Hair gets caught in the bristles, and the only effective technique for removal involved cutting the hair with a knife and then yanking it the rest of the way out of the bristles. Not pleasant.Another complaint: I found out the hard way that this vacuum does not like to stand upright, and I have red marks on my walls from the handle falling over to prove it.In a nutshell, DO NOT buy this vacuum!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vacuum but broke after 2 months","review":"Good vacuum, light, great for a small NYC apt. But the damn thing stopped working after 2 months. Specifically, the fan that causes the suction burned out. Not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"I thought this Flair was great when I first got it. Then after a while, it would get hot if using it a while and the thermostat would shut it off. The suction seemed to dwindle, despite replacing the filter with a new one. Eventually the lousy plastic engagement part of the head assembly wore to the point that the head would fall off.A great electric broom to start, just don't expect it to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great until it dies","review":"This is the second unit I have purchased. It works great and lasts about one year when the motor begins to overheat. I consider $50 per year worth the expense to have it around as it is used as a quick cleaning device between regular vacuuming with a larger more powerful whole-house vac. When this one dies, I will buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE WARNED IN ADVANCE","review":"I just want people to be aware! I purchased this vacuum in Nov. '08...not quite a year ago, and loved it for a month or two, seemed to be perfect for me.(I live in a one bedroom apt. with wood floor and a small area rug, so there is no heavy work here.) Then the bottom of the vacuum (literally) fell off...It whole brush/cleaning area is attached, it appears, by one thin rubber piece..and it sort of twists on....I have screwed it back on dozens of times, (not being able to afford a new one right now) and even duct taped it, only to have it fall off again. I guess there is just no way to fix it. So, sometimes a bargain turns out to not be a bargain! I gave it two stars for the two months it worked well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I don't normally get happy about cleaning items. But I love this thing. It's small and light weight for everyday quick cleaning. I have two big dogs that shed and track in tons of dirt and sand from the yard. This little vac has great suction and gets everything on my tile floors (even the grout area). It also doesn't scratch my laminate floors when the brush is turned off. Sorry, I don't have carpets to try it on. The only negative thing I can think of is the size of the head, it's about 10 inches. I'm used to the big 12 amp upright vacuums. But I hated dragging the heavy thing out when I had carpets. The weight, storage size, power and suction of this vac is perfect for tile and laminate flooring. Again, love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like everything about this vac!","review":"This vac has lots of cleaning power, the best yet for my resilient floors, works well on carpeted stairs, swivels nicely to reach odd places, and glides over the floors so very nicely on its soft wheels--- unlike other stick vacs that felt like I was scraping the floors with hard plastic. The powered nozzle is a plus.Unlike leaning a stick vac in a corner only to have it topple and crash to the floor, this vac stands nicely on its own anywhere. It has a nice sleek appearance. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for picking up cat hair","review":"With four cats in the house, the vacuum cleaner doesn't always get up everything. I was surprised and pleased to see what the Flair picks up from corners and hard-to-reach places.It would be good if the Flair had the ability to stand upright by itself when left momentarily during the cleaning cycle. It can be awkward trying to find a place to prop it up against when I don't want to return it to its hook in the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I decided to get a smaller vacuum when my husband and I moved to NYC. Our 400 square foot apartment has limited closet space so I thought it would be a good idea to pair down. My old vacuum was a eureka bagless with a hepa filter. I bought it used at a vacuum repair store for around $60.00 six years ago and it never gave me any problems.I bought the \\"flair\\" after reading all the great reviews but it has been a huge let down. There is absolutely no suction to this thing. I've gone over our rugs over and over again and there still a lot that the vacuum refuses to pick up.I would not recommend this to anyone. I didn't realize how great my old second hand vacuum was, I will find a way to carve out closet space for a real vacuum.In my view even a broom is far superior to the\\"flair\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Heavy","review":"I bought this unit hoping for a lightweight vacuum to do spur of the moment cleaning, but it is as heavy or heavier than a standard upright.I was very disappointed. It also does not perform very well. Only positive thing is that it has a fairly long cord for a portable vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoover flair bagless stick vaccum","review":"This unit will vaccum hard surface floors, but when on carpet the beater brush motot will stop turning. The small electric motor that drives the beater brush is to small and over heats and stops.

However, very poor suction after just a few months and it broke.

Buy something else, you'll regret it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product only one problem.....","review":"Beautiful, I loved it! Product was exactly as described, good quality for an awesome price, and super speedy shipment! I LOVE AMAZON! Only one problem....this vaccum has an automatic shut off feature when it gets over heated the vaccum will run but no power bar or suction you have to unplug it and wait 30 minutes. This vacuum started over heating when i used it for longer than 20 to 30 minuites within the first week that i got it. I'm dissapointed in Hoover, I have always thought Hoover was a good vacuum but they messed this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic appliance!!!","review":"I wish that I had purchased this vacuum much sooner than I did. My house has wooden floors throughout including the stairway and this vacuum is the perfect \\"broom\\". It is not too heavy and it saves me so much time and hassle; no more sneezing fits because of the dust. It picks up cat litter, leaves, and dust bunnies with no problem. It does a great job on my throw rugs and does not try to eat extension cords. I empty the cup after every use and I'm always amazed at the quantity of debris that I have collected. It's as easy to use as a broom but much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little vac with plenty of power.","review":"This is great for quick pickups when you don't have time to get out the full size vac. We have two dogs that shed and this does a great job keeping both the hardwood floors and carpet free of dog hair. We liked it so much we bought one for our daughter's dorm room too. She loves it because it is no larger than the cordless variety but picks up so much better than any cordless vac. Bought two and would do it again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vac for hard to reach areas","review":"I've had the Hoover S2220 Flair for about 2 months and have had no problems thus far. Originally bought it only for hardwood floors but also use it for carpeted stairs and other hard-to-reach areas that my main upright can't get to. The little unit has great suction - a little too much as it will latch onto small area rugs and won't let go. After reading other reviews I have been careful to always lean it against a wall or corner so it doesn't fall over. I have not experienced any overheating that others have mentioned, even after operating 20 minutes. Overall a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"The excellent suction drags unsuspected dirt and more cat fur than anticipated from Oriental carpets. Love being able to press a switch and turn on or off the brushes. Long cord. Easy to maneuver. Exactly what I wanted.UPDATE: While it worked, it was wonderful. Today, roughly a year after I purchased it, this vac has just lost its suction. It was well cared for and lightly used, but it has simply stopped. The brushes still turn, but without suction they just spit out the accumulated dust and dirt. Now I have to buy another vac, and it will not be a Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little vac ever","review":"I used to use Swifter vac before I bought this one and thought it was working great. I have 3 dogs, 2 of which shed A LOT (Siberian husky and basset hound) and this little vacuum picks up anything and everything. I am only 5'1\\" with not a lot of upper body strength and it is so powerful that when I turn it on I have to hold it tight otherwise it will jump out of my hand (so much power and tork). It is very flexible and easy to turn around the corners or get in and under tights places like shelves, cabinets, etc. I haven't seen anything that it wouldn't pick up. It is very light and the cord is long enough to clean my kitchen and dining room without transferring the plug. I use it mostly for tile/hard wood floors but it does great on carpet as well. Filter is easy to clean and I use an old toothbrush to dust it off as well. And all that for under $50!!! Overall I think it is an awesome awesome vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little vacuum","review":"Pretty, picks up the daily dog hair that accumulates. Such a hastle to get out the big vacuum.

I thought it was great the first time I used it and liked the different settings for carpet and floors. The floor setting stopped working entirely and the carpet setting became extremely weak. We have to return it and try to find something that works. I'm not sure why so many reviews are so good. Maybe we got a defective one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonder wand,","review":"I love this vacuum so much. I have had it for over a year and it is a champ! It gets into every crevice and I sometimes use it on my sofa. Mind you,I have wood floors throughout my house so don't know how it would perform on carpet, but it is a sturdy little machine( I drop it often cause it isn't the most balanced thing when upright.) Like other reviewers have stated, the cord is short but I just leave an extension cord on it at all times. If and when this dies, I will repurchase- it's perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 6 months :(","review":"This started out as a good little vacuum for our hard wood floors.

Worked ok the first few times I used it - low noise, did ok on most of my carpet, but the brushes didn't really do a phenomenal job on the white cat hair on my dark area rug. Also, the motor seemed to get very hot.Just a couple of weeks ago (mid-December) the vacuum died - it still makes noise when it is turned on, but there is no suction & the brushes don't spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick cleanup.","review":"I purchased this to do quick cleanups in the kitchen after our family of six.

This vac does extremely well on the hardwood due to its powerful motor and does well enough for touch-up jobs on the carpet and rugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt hold up","review":"I kept this vacuum in the upright postion most of the time. After many uses mainly on kitchen floor only the neck of the base area began to crack. After only 1 yr of use it broke off completely.

Do Not buy this item if you dont want to replace it year after year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for small jobs on hard floor, not carpet","review":"At first I really liked the small form factor and light weight of this vacuum. It does well on the hard floor of my kitchen, entryway, and bathroom. But the rest of my 2BD apartment is carpet and this thing will not even pick up surface lint. It also seems to overheat. Cleaning out the container well enough to keep good suction is also a real pain, but that is probably true with any bagless. Bottom line - good for spot cleaning on hard floor, nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great vac, but doesn't last long","review":"I loved this vacuum while it worked, but it only lasted about 18 months. The brush stopped turning. It was also very prone to overheating, so I'd often have to stop and let it cool down before finishing (note that I have ceramic tile floors and was vacuuming an area around 900 sq ft.).

It has very flat carpet and is only a 165 square feet room. Somehow, this vacuum managed to break in about two months of very mild use (vacuuming once a week). Now, it makes a very loud noise while it picks up very little and smells up the whole room with that typical, horrible vacuum smell. It was great for the first two months, though, I just don't possibly see why it should have done this so quickly. They do have a warranty which allows you to get it fixed in a store, but unfortunately, the store is quite far away and I have no time to take it.

I do not recommend this vacuum at all! I literally used it two times before it started to overheat. Although it is compact to put away in a closet and easy to pull out in a pinch, it is not worth it. I usually end up spoon feeding the things I want it to vacuum up right in front of it. THIS VACUUM SUCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum!","review":"There is very little that I dislike about this vacuum.

This vacuum is perfect! I can move from floor to rug with the switch of a button. The head swivels smoothly, and has a pretty low profile. I am amazed at the power of the suction! It easily pulls in dust bunnies before it even reaches them! I also use it to vacuum my stairs, and it isn't too cumbersome. Pretty light weight.

He didn't know what to look for in a vacuum. Just like the guys who designed this beauty... he never hoovers.Hoover should bring back their old, ugly, blue quick broom! The flair doesn't compare. It's nozzle is not wide enough, so it takes twice as long to vacuum. Long hair gets caught up in the roller brush, so every couple uses you have to turn it over & cut the hair out b/c it gets clogged up. Debris never drops into the cup, it sticks to the filter. I clean it out w/a toothbrush after each use. Doesn't that sound gross? It's supposed to stand up, but always falls over. I hate it, but it sure is pretty. I'm giving it to my son when he goes to college. I'm sure he'll never use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok","review":"The product works just fine on my carpet and floor. Good for the price.

When I used it all the dog hair stayed at the bottom where the rollers are. I would have to peel the hair off. After a few weeks I had my husband take it apart and he found a little piece of plastic broken off.

The Hoover Flair sucks right down and sticks tight to the carpet, and it won't glide. I can't either push or pull it. I believe if I had a loop carpet, a low \\"outdoor\\" type carpet, or a high-low looped carpet, it would work OK, but it does NOT work on my low-cut pile. I emailed Hoover, but they won't help. Sigh.

I'm so impressed I bought one for my daughter, who gives the tip on dislodging the hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spits out dirt when switching carpet-bare floor mode","review":"I bought this due to the good review on Amazon, but was not very impressed with it. It spits out dirt when switching between carpet and bare floor mode, which defeats the purpose of vacuuming. Also it seems to overheat easily and will shut off while vacuuming. It does pick up dirt well on rugs and has good suction, but is very loud and kind of heavy for a stick vac.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 2 after 14 months of light use","review":"This vacuum cleaner works decently. Nonetheless, it is very heavy to carry around and suffers from a quick loss of suction. All the hair and large dust get stuck in the brush (we have hardfloor and no pets) and reduces the efficiency of the vacuum. Similarly, the bagless system only works for large particles. All the finer particles will get trapped in the filtering membrane, requiring wet washing every 2-3 uses (as per the manual).The main flaw with this product is its robustness: after 14 month of very mild usage (we live in a small apartment) the head broke loose from the rest of the vacuum cleaner. Warranty is over so the cleaner is pretty much useless. We will not buy a Hoover vacuum cleaner again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for easy clean up","review":"Originally I was looking at cordless stick vacuums but realized they were just dust busters with a long handle. Went with this instead and I'm very pleased with it. We have all hard surface (tile and wood) floors with area rugs and I wanted something light and easy for quick clean ups instead dragging out my canister or upright. This vacuum has great suction, cleaned the edges, and the carpet setting really picks up the cat hair on the rugs. The rotating brush on the carpet setting is too powerful for light throw rugs. The suction is so good that I have to rinse the filter often because it picks up so much! Easy to empty the debris holder. Fits in a corner of the pantry and so is close at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This stick vacuum lost its zip very quickly.

I have hardwood floors, area rugs in each room & a dog that sheds. I would find myself dragging out the regular upright vacuum with all the attachments and the broom just to clean the floors. Not anymore this little guy is perfect for the bare floor and the area rugs (actually has more suction on the area rug than I was expecting). Easily glides under some of the furniture, tables, etc.I can now get the floors all vacuumed in 10 mins instead of the 20 - 25 mins it would take using the regular upright and broom. Another big plus for this vacuum is it takes up very little storage space and so lightweight......oh and you can't beat the price.Hands down Hoover vacuums are the best around and once again Hoover has delivered a quality product!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and very very easy to use","review":"I live by myself in a small apartment.

I do it in installments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me at least an hour cleaning!","review":"I don't think I've ever written a review before but I feel compelled to after using this sweeper for the first time. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats inside so between the litter and hair my floors always need attention. Usually I drag out the big vac, attachments, broom and mini vac so that I can reach around and under things without having to move a lot of furniture. Those days are over! I absolutely love the swivel head. I never thought I'd get excited over sweeping but this made doing my tiny bathroom where I keep the litter so much easier! With the brush roller it did a great job getting the hair off of a dark colored throw rug. Be careful, some rugs it will try to eat. It lays flat so you can get under things. It also will stand by itself most times. It is a dandy little sweeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Already gone through the 2nd Hoover Flair","review":"The first one lasted a little over a year with just light cleaning around the house, but the second one was even less. Probably not used even a dozen times, and already a fail. I say no more investment in these vacuums, it's like buying them and give'm away. Boo to Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STICK VACUUM","review":"I'VE HAD THIS VACUUM FOR A WHILE AND LOVE IT SO MUCH, I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER. PERFECT FOR HARD FLOORS AND AREA RUGS. REALLY GOOD SUCTION. HANDY FOR SMALL, QUICK JOBS, WHEN I DON'T WANT TO PULL OUT THE BIG VACUUM. THE ONLY NEGATIVE I CAN SAY, IS THAT THE FILTER GETS DIRTY REALLY FAST, SO I HAVE TWO OF THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased as punch!!","review":"I have had a bagless Shark for a few years now and every time I use it want to throw it out the window. It lasts about 10 minutes before it goes out and I have to wait another 15 to let it restart itself. It was my first non-bagged cleaner. It didn't matter how many times I cleaned the filters it always stopped. Anyway, that being said I was very hesitant to buy a new canister type cleaner. I have mostly hard wood & tile in my new house, and have one big area rug in the living room. The Shark would just throw things around the hardwood and stop working on the rug. This Hoover Upright Stick is the perfect solution! It works GREAT! The first time I used it I was amazed. I had forgotten how dark my color was on my rug. Hoover has always been an reliable brand and I will never stray again. Hopefully, this will be my last cleaner for a while. It is well worth the money I spent and more! My advice, don't hesitate to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took us a while to realize it wasn't really sucking anything up","review":"Doesn't suck well and gets easily clogged.

Good desighn and not lacking in power"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life and plan for low use","review":"Good power with tendency to overheat and auto shut down. The support to stand on its own is not good, and most likely will fall often. In our experience, the life of this product is less than one year with overheating becoming a frequent problem - so plan to clean when this device is working.

Maybe I ended up with a lemon, but there's several other commends on repair sites and other blogs complaining about this same problem. The brushes still run, but there's no suction at all coming from the vac. At most, I used it once a week for 10 or 15 minutes.I loved it until now, but I don't think I'll be getting another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of the Hoover Name","review":"I have had many Hoover vacs over the years and I hoped this one would be the answer for my wood floors. I use my uprights for the large rugs but need a smaller, easy to use vacuum for the wood.I read the reviews and even though they were mixed, I was optimistic....Big mistake! My complaint is that it is impossible to keep the head on the vacuum stick...It just does not fit properly.I think the suction is okay and the cup is easy to clean. That is the only reason I gave a 2-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stick vac!","review":"I vacuum my town house every two days and this vac does everything I need it to do. I vacuum all of the downstairs (approx. 1200 sq.ft) tile with several area rugs, the upstairs bathrooms and area rugs, and my carpeted stairs and this vac performs excellently throughout. It doesn't overheat, is very maneuverable, quiet, and very light in weight. The ability to turn the power nozzle on and off so easily is a great feature for switching from rug to tile and back without having to stop. The cord a good length and is easy to roll up and take off the vacuum. Keep in mind that this vacuum is not designed to clean entirely carpeted rooms. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I would like to have all of the filters be washable. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone who has lots of hard floors with rugs to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for cat hair and carpets","review":"The brush stopped rotating after about a dozen uses. Not very good if you have a cat and wall to wall carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little stick vacuum around!!!!!","review":"I LOVE this vacuum. I have 2 children so needless to say I am constantly cleaning up messes. To pull out the big vacuum every time can be a pain. I was looking for something to plug in and go but was not looking for a full size upright. This Hoover is great! The suction is amazing and you can do bare floor and carpet. Due to the low profile head you can get under the cabinets great. The filter does need to be washed occasionally but that is no big deal. I am so pleased that I purchased this and with the help of Amazon's free shipping I could not go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a few months","review":"The 1st time I used this vacuum I thought it seemed to heat up quite a bit. After about 3 months it quit running and was so hot that it actually burned my hand. It eventually started back up but shuts down after about 3 minutes of running & that is just vacuuming the wood floors. I was not even going to try to vacuum the area rug!! Needless to say I consider it a piece of junk and a waste of money. I and will have to replace it with a different brand & model but you can bet it won't be a Hoover. I do not recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR CAT OWNERS ! -^.^-","review":"No kidding, I have lots of cats and this little vacuum works better than some of the more expensive ones. Yes, you may have to empty the dirt cup more often, but it cleans the rugs/floors great. Highly, HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"This is my second purchase of the same vacuum cleaner. When part of the nozzle on the first one broke I thought I had damaged it by not being gentle enough. I purchased another one because I liked the fact that it was light, flexible and compact. My second one broke in exactly the same place. This product is delicate and not for use by anyone who intends on cleaning more than once a month. It is still under warranty but it costs me more to drop it off at the repair shop so I will have to buy a brand new vacuum. What a waste of time and money!!!I will NEVER buy this model again. It is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it powerful? Definitely. Will it break? Probably.","review":"We loved our Flair. We were willing to tolerate the loud noise it made (like a jet on takeoff) because we felt there was some correlation to suction, and truth be told, this vacuum really did a great job at cleaning up the kitchen (hardwood), especially along edges and in corners. It never seemed quite perfectly designed, as it cannot stand on its own, and must be propped up in a corner or else laid down on the ground. And the dirt cup is not what you might call large. Still, it got the job done, and looked pretty good doing it.But after just over a year of ownership and regular if not often use (3 or 4 times per week and never on carpet), the nozzle broke off at the neck. I tried Super Glue and duct tape but that only lasted a day or two. I have asked Hoover for goodwill on the warranty given the high incidence of failure on this specific part, and I will post any update here. In the meantime, I am back to a broom and dustpan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaning dust bag.","review":"Love the vacuum cleaner; just wish there was an easier way to clean the dust bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Fast shipping and very easy to put it together before making it work.

I thought it would be perfect for our small 2 bedroom apartment. Less than 2 months after buying it, it broke. Hate to be a downer after all the great reviews, but I would not recommend this vacuum.

I've consistently noticed that the vacuum cuts off after just vacuuming a small room and i have to leave it for a while before it starts back up again. its is quite powerful for such a small and light weight cleaning utility. works much better than other bag-less vacuums I've used. i like the dual mode feature for cleaning all floor types. excellent swivel head and rolling ability. it should have been able to split in half for easy fold away storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect vacuum for condo/apartment living","review":"I own a condo with wood floors and a few area rugs so this vacuum is the perfect solution to cleaning my floors with one tool. (And as I bonus, I love how slender it is, it barely takes up any room in my closet.) I haven't upgraded my vacuum cleaner in many years and it was amazing to see the advancements they've made, I love the maneuverability of this vacuum...the ability to turn and get under furniture has come a long way. Also, I have pets and this vacuum does a great job of picking up pet hair on the wood floors and area rugs. Overall, a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"Always had a stick vac for quick touch-ups without pulling out the big Miele. Looking for strong suction, light weight, and the ability to hang it on a hook behind the basement door. The Flair fir the bill perfectly. Very pleased with the quality and performance. Paid the few extra dollars for the power nozzle which seems well worth while, even though we are not able to turn the brushes on while cleaning some of our thin, handmade carpets because they get pulled into the brush. We use it on these thin rugs and all the wood and tile floors without the brush running. Overall, very pleased with this purchase.Update:Have had this vac for over a year now and love it more and more as time goes by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect...","review":"I researched all vacuums when we had 700 sq ft of exotic hardwood installed. the hoover flair had by far the best reviews so i gave it a try. it's a great vac, but i'd recommend wiping off the wheels every now and again. it picked up something on one of the wheels and made a small surface scratch. the wood i have is extremely hard, 2300 on the janka scale so i was a little disappointed. other than that it has plenty of suction to handle my yellow lab's hair and it works fine on the area rugs. bottom line is i'm happy with my purchase, but every vac has the potential to scratch hardwood flooring even if the beater bar is disengaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Doer","review":"I wanted a small and handy sweeper to use on floors that were not carpeted.

I threw my reliable bissell lightweight out after the handle broke. 3 years later! Still had good suction though. I'm very dissapointed with this purchase. To top it off i have 2 rugs in a 2 bed apartment. So not like theres lots of work to be done.

Not wanting to haul out the large vacuum, I checked Amazon, and it appeared that the Hoover S2220 would match my needs.This little powerhouse exceeds my expectations! I can zip around the room, which includes the hardwood flooring and several scatter rugs, in no time; in fact, can also do the adjacent tile floor and hallway--all in about five minutes.The power nozzle is powerful--perhaps even doing a better job on the scatter rugs than I regular canister vac. I know that some reviewers do not like to empty the cup, but I'm not finding that to be a problem. I would just recommended doing it every week or so, so that it doesn't build up.It's GREAT! No problems here--happily recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Larger Scale Cleaning","review":"I purchased this vacuum after reading great reviews here. We have 1900 sq feet of hardwood floors in our new home and I needed something that worked very well. After 2 weeks of daily use the machine has died. While using it I found that it did not pick up as much as I thought it should. I have an older large Hoover with a bare floor setting that picks up a lot better. I think it works okay for spot cleaning say in a kitchen after snack time but for larger scale hardwood vacuuming it did not measure up to the reviews at all. I hope I can get my money back from Hoover. We shall see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in first month","review":"Product was pretty awesome, lightweight and sucks up tons of stuff.However, I guess I was one of the unlucky 5%.

My apartment isn't that big and I'm not a messy person so I would have thought my once a week vacuuming wouldn't be a problem. However it only did so so on the pick up and at times I would have to go over an area more then 5 times to get everything up even though it wasn't much. Also because it took so long it would overheat and shut off so that I had to wait a while for it to cool down to finish. I emptied it after every use and cleaned the bottom out once a month but last month it died so that nothing picks up, the bottom doesn't spin and you get the noise of the vacuum without the use of it. I would recommend looking at another product because after 14 months I need to get a new vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke within the first 5 minutes!!!!","review":"I was very, very disappointed in this stick vacuum!! It started rattling and the belt broke within the 1st five minutes!!! The belt is only serviceable or replaceable by a Hoover authorized service center.

My main goal was to find something that is light and does not take too much space to store. On the plus side, it cleans much better than the cordless Pronto. On the minus side, the cord is a bit short, so I have to stop and move the plug once or twice when cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware...Unit fails after light use.","review":"I ordered this vacuum to clean a small bedroom with tiled floors. It did the job wonderfully, that is, until the motor died. I had used this vacuum 1-2 times a week for about 6 months. I was sure to clean it after each use, and I kept it dry, cool environment. I had read other reviews about the product failing after a short amount of months, but I was hoping I would have better luck since I only planned to use it on a small, tiled space...but I didn't have such luck. What good is a vacuum if it fails after a few months of light use? I would caution others to not purchase this vacuum unless they are okay with spending $45 or more for less than a years use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Broom Vacuum","review":"Good power, good cornering, light weight. What I don't like about it is the filter that you have to dump out. It makes a huge mess and I have to get my hands dirty to clean it out. It makes a high pitch noise when it get's a certain amount of dirt in it. It was not near full when I noticed the noise. I emptied it out anyway and the noise stopped. It comes and it goes. It serves it's purpose well but I rated it a three star because of the inconvienance of emptying it out the noise that it makes. If you want a broom vac with power and cleans corners well and you can overlook getting dirty and making a mess than you will not be disappointed with this vac. **UPDATE** terrible vacuum! It overheats and quits and you have to wait for it to cool off. Do not waste your money on this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than dust buster","review":"After owning many dust busters (for the convenience of having cordless) this is perfect. The cord isn't an issue, does excellent job on bare floors, no bending over, is easy to clean, very light weight and easy to store. The typical dust buster last on average 18-24 months before the battery dies. The cord could be a little longer but small inconvenience and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Suction For a Small Vac!","review":"This is an AWESOME vacuum! Buying these little versions can be a pain because you don't want to end up with a vac that does not have any suction, but this one has phenomenal power. I use it on tile, carpet, and wood flooring and it picks up everything. You can actually see the dirt get sucked into the vac before the head even rolls over it, which makes it great to use against the baseboards. Transitioning from carpet to floor is very easy as you just push a button to switch from each. It does not scratch up my wood floors. It does feel hot after a while, but I have not had any problems with it overheating and kicking off. The container is easy to empty. I highly recommend this vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a much longer cord!","review":"This is the first stick vac I've ever had, so I have nothing to compare it with. It works well on bare floors and a small area rug on the second floor of my house. I bought it in order not to have to drag my cannister vac up the stairs so often. I still have to drag it upstairs sometimes because I can reach places with it that I can't with the stick. But my only real complaint is that the cord is way too short, and I have to use a long extension cord with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working during first use!!","review":"While using this item for the first time the power motor stopped working.

It is great for picking up cat litter off of bare floors and the swivel makes is easy to maneuver. It easily gets under furniture that an ordinary vacuum would not fit under.

The cat hair sticks to it like crazy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bagless Vacuum","review":"This is a stick vacuum, but has one problem in that the \\"bagless\\" feature is dependant on a Small filter that fills very quickly and then suction almost stops. This is nothing like the old Hoover stick vacuum I had in the past and I am frankly disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome suction power for a stick","review":"I am now using this for the majority of the vacuuming in my large house. I have a regular upright that I lug around to do the rugs and still use about every 5th time I need to vacuum. This Hoover has awesome suction power and does a great job on carpets as well. It has 7 amps and replaced my old Bissel floor vac that was 2 amps. Major difference. The only thing I wish it had that I am used to is a detachable hose to get underneath the fridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover vacuum","review":"I bought this vacuum for my little studio apartment. So far, it's worked really well on both the carpeted and non-carpeted (kitchen) areas. It's a pretty lightweight item, so it might not work for more heavy duty cleaning.

No complaints, so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy, easy to use vac","review":"This handy vacuum is just what we hoped it would be. We use it daily and prefer it to our other vacs.

But, since I have a 1 bedroom apt, no kids, no pets, I settled for this little vacuum. I also didn't feel like spending $400. It's performed well on my floors and carpet thus far. My only grip, as others have mentioned, is that the cord is quite short. But I bought an extension cord and just keep it attached to the vacuum cord and wind it around when I'm done. Simple enough and the extension cord is inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Vacuum Ever","review":"The is the best vacuum ever. I can't believe how it picks up everything and it's so easy to empty. With 2 cats and a wood stove there's a lot of mess to clean up.

I previously had a cordless stick vacuum. It was terrible. Always out of charge when I needed it desperately, and never enough life to do a job of any size. This HOOVER stick is vastly better. OK, so you have to deal with a cord. Big deal. You get tremendous power, unlimited duration, and a slim, light, body that goes anywhere. I can't really think of anything better for an apartment, especially with wood floors.Update... 3/7/12... The internal motor mount cracked, and the vacuum is now defunct.

(I was shocked when it sucked up a quarter of my kitchen floor mat. Before this vacuum, i used to own a similar vacuum made by a different company, and that other vacuum could only pick up fluffy dust bunnies and light dirt). But this one gets the big chunks too.+ Flat shape of head allows it to reach underneath my furniture.Cons:- The head swivels, so it can be hard to control/maneuver the gadget to the spot that I want to go to. Maybe I'll get used to this with time.

We called the phone number on instruction sheet and recording said: for parts - go to website. Bummer, no computer. Now I had to repackage and bring back to So. Jersey. I hope I can get better service than my daughter who has no computer.UPDATE: Contacted Hoover via their site. I received an e-mail back confirming my request for the missing toggle bolt. That was on January 5, 2010 and today is February 04, 2010. We are still waiting and hoping this part is just on backorder.

I am really disappointed! First off, it's pretty loud - I thought there was something wrong with it at first. It's also heavier than I expected for a stick vacuum. I use it on hard surface floors and area rugs. It picks up great, and works well on hard flooring, but it's terrible for rugs. It picks up debris, but it can only clean about 1/2 of an 8x10 area rug before it starts to smell wierd, and then it shuts off (and yes, I do empty the collection cup regularly). I have to let it \\"rest\\" for at least an hour before it will work again.

Very unhappy with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"we tried on the carpet in the living room and on the steps and it is junk.after i used it i got down and looked and there was still a TON of dog hair.. and our house isnt that bad.it looked like it didnt even touch the steps - it wasnt flufed up at all like after our regular vaccumm.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover S2220 Flair Bagless Vacuum","review":"So far I really like this little vacuum. It's great for use on my kitchen and hallway floors and basement steps. I just use it for touch ups and in my kitchen instead of a broom. I love the suction! I have an area rug in the kitchen as well as linoleum floors. Emptying the bag is a bit messy, but it's not all that bad. I just put it down in the garbage can and clean it out. After reading the reviews I don't stand it alone because I don't want to take the chance that it will fall and break. I bought extra filters for the sides so I would have them on hand when needed. I don't use it for cleaning the whole house because that's not what it is made for. It's so nice to be able to store it with my broom and mop and to have it handy so I don't always have to lug out the big vacuum. I haven't had any problems with it over-heating and shutting off, and the cord is plenty long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only after 5 months of use it died","review":"We have a Rainbow vacuum cleaner but it's a hassle to get it when only a small job needs to be done. This little Hoover S2220 works like a dream. We have dogs and I wanted to vacuum also during the week not only on week ends and this little guy gets the job done well. It's gentle enough on our cherry redwood parquet but when I turn on the carpet switch it's strong enough to get all the doggy fur off the area rug.Edit previous review: Finally I have time to edit my review. Unfortunately only after 3 months of use the suction got worse and worse by every use and another couple of months later it just died, finito. I did everything I was supposed to do, cleaned the cup very frequently, turned the vacuum cleaner off to let it cool when it overheated (usually after 5-7 mins of use). Will not buy the same again. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Flair is ok, just ok.","review":"I bought the Hoover Flair bagless because I read all the 4 star reviews on Amazon. But the suction leaves something to be desired. It quickly becomes just a machine that moves dirt around. I'm disappointed in the power. But more importantly, no vacuum designer has yet designed a \\"good\\" mouth nozzle to get the corners & prevent things from getting stuck on the plastic edge of the nozzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died Young","review":"After much research on my part, we had high hopes for our Hoover Flair. We hoped that it would take good care of our new hardwood and porcelain tile floors and it did a pretty good job. Unfortunately, in just seven months, it DIED! Something plastic broke inside and it just wouldn't suck any more. My husband is good repairing things, but he just shook his head and said it would cost more to fix than it was worth. We have three other vacuums, a canister, an upright, and a hand-held. The Flair got used a lot for dust bunnies and corners-not too much to ask. Since our hand-held has a short hose and I can attach a wand and appropriate head, I can do the same thing with just a little more effort. Our canister can also be used for these purposes so I won't be replacing this unit anytime soon and I certainly will be paying close attention to sturdiness when I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I've owned at least 6 similar products over the years but this one is the best yet. It is a bit more expensive than the others but truly makes up for it in quality and efficiency. Dirt and crumbs disappear off hard surfaces on the first pass. The product is extremely maneuverable, getting into corners and against base moulding with ease. Though not designed to be a primary tool for vacuuming carpets, it does a great job on the fir needles and grass caught by the throw-rugs inside our doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"The first time I used this, it shut off after approx 2 minutes of using, waited 20 min and it came back on. This happened 4 times before I finished vacuuming the carpet cleaner up, which by then was burning my skin. Thanks hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for about a year","review":"This is a vacuum that is perfect for my small place, but after a year of use this vacuum is overheating and shutting down. I have to wait an hour or so for it to cool off to be able to use it again. I did read some reviews before I bought this item on how this was a problem but I didn't worry since my place is small and didn't have any carpet. Bummer...Now I have to find a replacement"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This vac is exactly what I have been looking for! I have wood and tile floors with 2 shedding dogs. I was tired of sweeping my house with a broom so I wanted something easier. This works great! It gets along the edges of the walls, is a small enough head to fit under my chair legs, and the way the vac lays down allows me to get under my couch and beds. It is very powerful and not too loud. It could use a longer cord, but other than that I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent stick vac","review":"Excellent qucik cleaning ability, Use it for carpet and hard floors. Would have given it 5 stars but you can't change the belt easily (or at least it is not worth it). I used this vac for 2 years everyday, and finally the belt began slipping. It was cheaper to buy a new one than replace the belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes when I ordered this vacuum. It had great reviews and I liked how compact it was since my storage closet is tiny. Very quickly, however, I came to be disappointed. The vacuum overheats and shuts off after only 5 minutes of vacuuming my carpets. After 15 minutes or so, I can turn it on and use it again, but it takes a long time to finish vacuuming my small apartment! It seems that the vacuum is best suited for hardwood floors since I don't have a problem with overheating when I vacuum on the wood floors. I am now searching for a new vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big vac power in a little vac package","review":"I bought this vac for our camper. It gets pretty dirty with 2 kids running in and out all day and we needed something to clean the linoleum floors as well as the carpeting. Throw in a 100lb golden retriever that sheds, and you can imagine how cruddy the camper can get. The Power Nozzle does an outstanding job cleaning the carpeting and bare floors. I am amazed at how much dog hair and dust this thing picks up.The best part? It fits into really small spaces. Ours fits under the bed. I would strongly recommend this vac for someone who has limited storage space and a small residence to keep clean. I wish I had this vac when I was in college. It is perfect for dorm rooms, studio apartments, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this vacuum","review":"This vacuum is wonderful and easy to use.

So I would say light duty cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING little thing!","review":"I just moved away from home for college and the vacuum that came with the house not only broke but was also waaayy too big for our little apartment. I was looking for something small AND effective and I found it!! This little thing is amazing! I vacuumed the kitchen floor then the living room carpet and I can't BELIEVE how much dust it managed to pick up!! It's small, surprisingly powerful and JUST what I needed... definitely recommended for anyone!Edit: I have now graduated college and purchased two of these over the past few years and both broke within a year... one was replaced, the other I didn't even bother to get fixed. It'll just break again. Beautiful vacuum but go for something that works better and lasts longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it twice","review":"Used this twice and then it simply stopped working - it simply would not turn on. I would have returned it, but it was outside the Amazon return period. Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"luckily, i didn't expect much.","review":"I purchased two of these, one for my apartment and one as a gift for my brother-in-law. Mine lasted for about 6 months before it just stopped working mid-vacuum session. I think the problem with mine is overheating. It works for about 5 minutes then stops but i am able to start it up the next day but only for a couple of minutes. My bro-in-laws stopped working even before mine. We both have small apartments (mine with short office-like carpet and tile, his with hardwood floors and one large wool carpet)and neither of us have pets. I was hoping we would get at least a year out of the vacuum, but unfortunately, was let down. I will say that the suction and pick up, initially, is great and the vacuum cleans very very well. In the end, if you are looking to buy, spend the extra money and buy something more dependable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Hoover stick vacuum plus the filter!","review":"We recently donated our large, expensive, heavy vacuum and downsized to a very light,easy to use and easy to clean Hoover stick vacuum frm Amazon.com and we love it!

The \\"bare floors\\" setting is pathetic (just blows the dust around -- doesn't pick it up), so I had to use the \\"carpet\\" setting most of the time, and even that strongest setting leaves lots of hair and junk behind. What a disappointment! And this isn't the first modern vac that I've wasted money on. What is it with the vacuum manufacturers these days, anyway? Has technology actually gone BACKWARD in time?? My mom's vac from 40 years ago was soooo much more effective than this piece of junk! And by the way, this is NOT a \\"freestanding\\" vac -- you definitely have to firmly lean it against something to keep it from flopping over. I'm giving it 2 stars only because it's fairly attractive, but ... it's junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!!!!","review":"I have loved this vacuum for both my laminate flooring and carpet. It is so easy to use and light weight. I have 2 small children so after each meal it is wonderful to run under the table. My carpets look great too. This is a great purchase and very easy to empty each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheats ALL the time!","review":"I agree with many of the reviews: light, decent suction for its size and cost, decent length cord for a smallish apartment. However, my gripes are that ever since the weather has gotten warmer, this vacuum overheats constantly! (As the manual says, when it overheats, the machine automatically shuts down. You have to let it cool for 30 min. before turning it back on.) It'll shut down after five minutes of continuous vacuuming! Also, my other gripe is that the red finish rubs off easily on the white walls in my apt. If the vacuum accidentally falls over and hits the wall, expect a bright red mark. For what it's worth, it's so-so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great little vacuum","review":"great vacuum. powerful and light. unlike a previous reviewer, i DO use it on my entire house with no problems and i have a 2000 sq. ft. house. i put away my heavy upright and will only use it if i feel like i need more power for a better cleaning, but so far i haven't needed it and don't really see that happening any time soon. very, very happy with this product. oh, but.....it doesn't stand up on its own well at all, so be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great...then fizzled...","review":"I've had this vac for about a year. It started out wonderful, but in a few months it would run very hot and then just stop working. It has a hard time completing a room. I only have hardwood floors, so I'm not sure why it fizzles so easily. I would not recommend. I am buying a new vac that can handle an entire room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought the Hoover S2220 Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle because I was tired of having to drag my Dyson up and down stairs and wanted something that would hang neatly in the pantry for basic pick ups. It was fabulous. Initially. Within a few months it was constantly overheated and spent more time cooling off than picking up. I've long since replaced it with a Miele and that's still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"lot of noise and overheating","review":"After having this vacuum for about 6 months I was at first satisfied but not so much now. I have a 2 bedroom apartment with hardwood in the living room and carpet in the bedrooms. This vacuum overheats and cuts off before I can finish the 2nd bedroom. It takes forever to cut back on. It makes so much noise I thought something was wrong with it until I read other users complaining as well. The beater brush has to be constantly de-tangled of the carpet fibers which get caught in it. Cleaning the dust cup is an absolutely nasty affair and has to be done after vacuuming each room. As for the positives...it does clean relatively well when it is working."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased the Hoover vacuum and was very happy at first. It picks up dirt remarkably; however, I returned the first one I ordered because the cord was not secure with the outlet. Each time I moved the cord it would stop working as it was not securely plugged into outlet.The second one I received worked great for about a week and then the switch broke. I could not vacuum in the hard wood mode.The vacuum also gets very hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and resources","review":"Vacuum overheats and shuts off after a couple of minutes, takes 30-45 minutes to cool down before it will start again. I took it to the only nearby service center, about 15 miles away. I explained the problem and they actually said \\"these are not designed to be used as vacuum cleaners.\\" WTF? They also said the warranty only covers defective parts and they would have to charge me to look at it and determine if any parts were defective. BS!Now all of the materials, energy, and human effort that went into manufacturing and shipping this defective product are a total waste. This useless product will just end up in a landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly weak, prone to clogs and broke completely after a year","review":"I have hardwood floors so I got this to keep a 9' x 6' rug free of cat hair. It did a rather mediocre job of this to begin with (which wasn't all that shocking at this price), has had a string of mechanical problems (clogs really easily, I must've disassembled the thing to entirely to clean it every month or two) and died completely yesterday after a year of very light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vac was a bust - lasted a month","review":"This vac was most promising. It had one switch for two features - brush up for floor and down for carpet. Both worked well for the time that it worked, and the head did a lot of swiveling, which made pick-up that much easier. The bagless feature was nice and it emptied easily. As an aside, I realized how much I missed a crevice attachment, for the tops of moldings et al.Alas, one month to the day, the floor switch ceased operation and it was brush down or nothing. Very disappointed - I won't get another but will probably upgrade to something better made - with a crevice tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovely but won't stand up for long","review":"I loved this vacuum for about 2 months, and put up with it falling all over the place. However this became the major flaw with it - it should be able to stand upright but never did - to the extend that it would fall over and eventually it broke from the impact - I am very gentle with my posessions - however this vacuum, however gentle you were with it - ended up broken and the part that was broken couldn't be replaced. Only getting 2 months out of the vacuum (only using it once a week) doesn't seem like value for money or quality to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good small vacuum cleaner","review":"This is a good vacuum. I bought it merely based on the great reviews and it was a best seller at Amazon. I wasn't disappointed. The vacuum is compact and quiet. It vacuums very well. I really like the unique ball joint head which allows you to twist the handle and get under tables easier. It's a nice touch. Not a whole lot more to say, its a great vacuum for the price. I use it on hardward floors and thicker carpet, no problems with either.Assembly was SUPER easy. It literally comes in three pieces that snap together. A caveman could do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for all surfaces & Lightweight","review":"I was looking for something inexpensive, light weight, and able to quickly clean bare floors and carpet. This fit the bill. After purchasing I realized that the other reviewers weren't crazy... it really does get the job done! I can run this through every room in the house for a quick clean up. My parents also take it with them in their Airstream camper, as it's the perfect size!I gave it 4 stars, because it isn't incredibly stable upright, it tends to fall over. And I don't like having to empty the canister. But the pros of this product, along with the great price, make this a purchase that I'd make again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in fewer than 30 days","review":"Like others I am disappointed with this purchase. It worked great and I loved it for the first three weeks, then out of the blue it stopped working. I was vacuuming some hardwood floors and the machine suddenly became kind of quiet. I turned it over and noticed that although the suction was still working, the roller was no longer turning. Without the roller it doesn't pick up much of anything. This may be caused by a problem with the belt or it may be something more serious. The owner's manual says that owners cannot change the belt so either way I would have to take it to a Hoover repair center. I can only imagine that costs more than I paid for it, plus the time and hassle involved makes it not worthwhile to me. I liked this vacuum, but it's not worth $60 for less than one month's use."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this stick 14 months ago to clean hardwood floors of a new townhouse. Guess what? It just stopped working (just out of it's 1-year warranty). The head brush no longer moves, and in looking at the Hoover manual that it came with, they don't give belt replacement info. The manual says to \\"...take it to a Hoover Dealer for service\\". What a joke-- I'd spend more on service than I spent on the vacuum. My advice-- spend the money and buy a more reliable vacuum. I loved the lightweight system originally, now I'm using the vacuum I've had-- a Panasonic upright for 17 year, and no service ( and I laughed at myself for buying a Panasonic vacuum... hmmm). It's not the greatest for hardwoods, but at least it works. What's happened to America that we manufacture things that break in a year?! I will NEVER buy another Hoover EVER-- Hoover should be ashamed to manufacture such an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent product for those who are happy with a 6 month life expectancy","review":"This product is as sneaky as many other Hoover products. Great specifications, neat appearance, fine performance and then complete failure in 6 months. If the product is relatively inexpensive, it isn't practical to get Hoover to honor the warranty because the shipping is always on the customer. I am clearly not a fast learner insofar as vacuums are concerned because this the 3rd Hoover that has failed me.Fortunately for me I purchased from Amazon and was quite fairly treated by their customer service dept."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had it for a year...it didn't last...it's in the trash now.","review":"I bought it exactly one year ago and it's been giving me problems for the last 4 months.

But for $50 what can you expect? Now it doesn't work at all. I had Amazon overnight me the Dyson DC-15.

I had an ancient electric broom that did a better job than the newer piece of junk I had. The ancient one was on it's last leg, I needed a new one big time for in-between vaccums. So I found a website or three that let me read reviews & do comparisons. I chose this one based on everything I read & the price. If you want to know how well it works.... I HAVE A GERMAN SHEPARD...

This certainly tells me that it's a powerful little thing and the small, convenient size is perfect for the RV. I may have to check into a larger Hoover for my house because this one is so efficient.

The suction on this little vac is GREAT even on my area rugs. I have hardwoods with a few area rugs and I have Berber on my stairs and tile bathrooms and it does a great job on all four surfaces. Granted it does best on the wood/tile floors but that is its main purpose. It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and fairly easy to clean out. It is easy to switch to carpet mode. And my hardwood floors have not been scratched at all as some reviewers state. Maybe they are doing their hardwoods on the carpet mode and I could see where the bristles on the brush would scratch but not in bare floor mode. The main downfall is the short cord, I just have to plug it in for each room. I do not have a huge house (1440 sq. feet) so overheating has not been a problem. For the price and the convenience I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I bought this for my daughter, who has lots of hardwood and one roomsize rug in her downstairs. She has a large family and needs convenient easy to use cleaning tools. I read the reviews and thought this would be perfect. The first time I used it at her house, it quit working on the hardwood setting. The carpet setting continued to work, but not the setting we really needed.

After several months, the carpet switch no longer works, so it can only be used for bare floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and easy to use. A surprise!","review":"I really wasn't expecting to be much impressed with this vacuum. I have had stick vacuums before and they were OK, but that's about all.

It's lightweight and the cord is pretty long.You don't have to bend all crazy to wind the cord up.Con:It can stand upright but if you're not paying attention, it tends to tip over quite easily.It seems like it could overheat if on the \\"carpet\\" setting for too long but I don't leave it on long enough to find out what happens afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"reviews I read before buying this stick vac were helpful and accurate","review":"The reviews I read before I bought this stick vac were of great help.

It is quiet, 2 speeds and a nozzle for using on carpet. I have a Persian and a dog and it picks up all the hair. The only thing that would be better is to have bags, but I still give it 5 stars. Great for short pickups but a heavier vac is still needed. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheats too quickly (on carpet)","review":"This is a decent, inexpensive vaccuum. However, I don't believe it can be used to clean carpets. We have a tiny living room and it overheats WAY too quickly when we flick the power nozzle on.

Motor breaks down in less than a year","review":"While looking for a light weight practical, efficient, vacuum cleaner I saw all the rave reviews on this one and bought one. It seemed great once I used it a few times so I bought another for the upstairs. Well, a few months later while vacuuming for about five minutes it stopped working no more suction and the motor sounded strange. It worked the next day but only for a bit then nothing. The second went the same way as the first blowing out by overheating itself or I don't know what. I have ceramic floors, always cleaned filters before using, and never had to vacuum more than ten minutes so really there was no reason for this overheating or motor blowing out unless it's just plain cheap and bad engineering. So, my advice is get something that may be more costly but at least will last in the end.

I purchased it for my 1600 square foot house which has mostly hardwood with some ceramic tile and carpet. I have a dog that sheds constantly and this does a better job on the hardwood, ceramic and area rugs than the much more expensive Electrolux I have been using. It picked up dog hair that I couldn't even see. Not sure it's as good on the carpeting but it does fine for quick cleanups. It is lightweight, easy to manuever and does a great job! I would highly recommend it for anyone who has hardwood or ceramic floors. If you have a lot of carpet, you might want something that is more designed for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 weeks!","review":"I should have listened to others reviews regarding long term use.

The dirt compartment is simple to remove and empty. I am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"I ordered this vacuum for my apartment about a year and a half ago. It does the job it's meant to do - picking up dirt and dust from wood floors, as well as cleaning throw rugs and area rugs. Be sure to heed the instructions of emptying the dirt compartment after each use. I also suggest turning the bottom part over every few uses and making sure nothing is tangled in the brush, such as hair. I have long hair and it didn't dawn on me until after many months of use to do this. I have now moved to a house but I still use this vacuum mainly for quickly cleaning the kitchen and entryway at the end of the day, or at least multiple times per week. It's compact, easy to store and easy to use. It won't last forever - I recently had to superglue the wires on the inside canister around which the dirt and dust collect (see the second consumer image on the Amazon page; it's not mine but that's the piece I'm referring to), which only lasted short term - but for a $50 vacuum, I really can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets The Job Done!!!","review":"Very happy with this vacuum! I am also glad I selected the S2220 model with the brush heads so I can go from bare floors to carpeting with just the push of a button. I use it mainly on my hardwood floors which I also have in the kitchen. It picks up everything underneath the kitchen cupboards which is what I really bought it for. It lays nearly flat so you can get under pieces of furniture easily. Also love that it is bagless and easy to dump the dirt!! I gave it 4 stars because it could use a longer cord so I can vacuum more than one room at a time.

I work and am on call 24 hours a day, according to my calculations I earn approx. 80-90 dollars a day, patrol on foot over 50 miles a week and and react to daily rockets hitting our Base.. When this vacuum broke I didnt try to to repair it but, smashed it into a hundred pieces and used a two dollar broom to sweep it up... Thank You Amazon for selling me a fragile and expensive piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover lightweight vacuum","review":"This Hoover S2220 bagless upright stick vacuum is excellent. This was really worth the money I paid for it. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated this","review":"First of all, this Hoover Flair is unweildy and not light weight. I used it only once and the front plastic cup mechanism that locks it into place did not work. The vacuum pulled yarns out of 2 4x6 area rugs. You cannot use this on a rug that has any kind of embroidery as it will tear it up even on the 'bare floor' setting. Hair, fur, yarns and such get caught up in the brush roller quickly and you have to manually remove them. On the 'floor' setting the vaccum did not pick up kitty litter, though the suction seems strong. The Hoover Flair is VERY VERY loud!! I am returning this vaccum immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Stick Vacuum","review":"I am a prior user of the EuroPro Stick Broom which performed well, but durability was a real problem. The motor overheated prematurely and was very disappointing. As a new user of the Hoover Flair Upright Stick Vacuum, I am pleased that it stands up by itself and has a longer cord. Disappointed that it recommends cleaning filter after every use. Size and weight are both very satisfactory. I had hoped for the wheels to be larger and more rubber-like rather than a hard plastic. I think I will like the Hoover much better than the EuroPro, but need more experience with it. Time will tell!Big Stick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle","review":"This is a great little portable vacuum with suprising power and manuverability.

It is great for picking up spilt cereal (cheerios), crumbs, cat hair, dog hair, etc. I use it on my hard wood floors and area rugs. Works really great. Manuevers around real well too. The only drawback is having to empty the container. But it really isn't that big of a deal. I would highly recommend this vacuum to anyone who has pets and small kids and wants to keep there house tidy after every meal!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a good buy","review":"I bought this vacuum while I was shopping for an upright, but needed something to do quick cleans of the kitchen and entry way instead of sweeping every day- and this vac is good for that. Don't buy it as a primary vacuum unless you have a really small place and it's not carpeted, but for everyday quick once overs to keep the floors picked up it works great- easy to use, pretty quiet and manuvers well. It's great to do the small hallway/entry way-type throw rugs and is good to keep pet hair from accumulating in all those common areas where it seems to multiply overnight. Also nice to run by the litter box and catch all the stray litter before it spreads all over the house. I have only had this for a couple months, but so far I am pleased with it- well worth the 55 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small vacuum for quick and easy cleanups","review":"Based on the all the great reviews of this product, I purchased it about a month ago and it has been great.For the price, it is an extremely powerful, portable, and effective vaccuum -- on both hardwood and carpet. The amount of dust/hair/other dirt that was sucked up off my carpet was quite impressive.On hardwood the vacuum is very effective as well, although its weakness seems to be with \\"larger\\" pea-sized items which often just get pushed by the front of the vacuum because there isn't enough space under the front lip of the vacuum for it to get sucked up.Filter cleaning is very easy -- same as your typical hand vac/Dustbuster. Just empty the canister, and shake off the filter. Very easy to wash off the filter to get it completely clean. Just be sure to let it dry out before using again.All in all, very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent stick vacuum--with a few changes it could be great!","review":"I've had this vacuum for 1 month and I really like it. I love the thin swivel head--it makes it easy to get into corners and under the kitchen table. On/off switch located in a good spot, bagless compartment easy to empty. Picks up tons of pet hair which is why I got it.Bad Points: Doesn't pick up larger items very well, like small beads, pieces of dog food and froot loop size cereal. The previous reviews were right about the cord--TOO SHORT. Even for my tiny kitchen, it pulls out of the wall several times while I'm using it. That's frustrating. And it doesn't stand on its own. You have to stand it against something and hope it doesn't fall over. It did overheat once--I think I had used it to do the kitchen (hardwood) and the living room (carpet) and it wasn't very happy about it. Had to cool for several hours before it was usable again. But all in all its been good. I would think about buying cordless next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Consistent with a lot of other comments, this item lasted a little over a year. The beater brush started slipping and making a horrible noise. I opened it and discovered the belt was loose. After much searching, I found a replacement belt and installed it. The beater runs fine, but it still makes a terrible noise. Now it has begun losing suction. I washed the filter and it still doesn't work as well as it did when I bought it. It's good for a quick pick up, but don't expect to run it more than a few minutes at a time. I have also had trouble with it overheating and cutting off. Overall, a very disappointing product. I'm shopping for a new one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY-Worked well first few times but died thereafter!!","review":"So I purchased the Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum with Powered Nozzle after reading the reviews on Amazon. I live in a 2Br condo and didn't need a super heavy vacuum for my place. The reviews looked impressive and so did the price, so I went ahead and bought this. The first few times were great- it is light weight, picks up pet hair, easy to maneuver. However, lately (only using it for 5-6 times), it has started turning off on its own. If you leave it on for a minute- it over heats and turns off. You need to wait for another 20 minutes before it runs again. I have tried emptying the dust cup etc but that doesn't solve the problem. Its a big waste of money!! Whats the point of light slick vacuum which doesn't work?! I would say it doesn't even do light pick up cleaning, its just badly designed and I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it. Spend an extra $20 and get a better sturdy machine.

I was completely bummed out. I had the old Hoover Quick Broom that my husband purchased in 1986. It worked until April 2007. I was sure that this new updated version would be even better.

I purchased this after reading so many great reviews and have not been disappointed. I love the fact that it cleans carpets as well as hard woods and I'm always surprised by how much is in the dirt container when I empty it. I also love that it stands up on its own as my old one did not. The only things I don't like are 1) the head is not quite as wide as my last one so I'm sure I spend a bit more time covering an area and 2) the head is thicker vertically so it doesn't fit very well between my cabinets and floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have gotten a bad one.","review":"Bought the vac on 01/25/08 and it didn't last past 03/15/08.

I guess it's \\"Buyer Beware\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vac","review":"I bought one for my apartment last year and have been very happy with it. It's very lightweight (you can even hang it on a hook in the closet) and it does a great job cleaing my hardwood floors with the tons of cat hair that my two cats shed. I only have 1 large area rug and so far it has never over-heated. I was amazed at the amount of suction it had on the rug and it easily cleaned black cat hair off of the light colored rug. Emptying it is a snap, although I tend to take the cup out outside of my window over my air-conditioner so that the dust doesn't get all over the place.I was so pleased with it that I recently bought a second one for the basement of my house (so that I didn't have to keep lugging my larger, heavier vacuum up and down the stairs). This area has a lot more carpeting and I am constantly tracking dirt, etc. in from outside. It works just fine here too. It has turned vacuuming, which I normally hate to do, into a much easier and more pleasant task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy this one again","review":"This stick vac had many positive reviews, but it hasn't been great for me. It's fine for hardwood, but it does very poorly on my rugs. Even after going over certain areas repeatedly, there are many things it never picks up. I also have to regularly turn it upside down and pull out clumps of dust, fibers, etc. that clog that \\"mouth\\" of the vacuum. And when I flip the switch from \\"bare floors\\" to \\"carpet,\\" it spits out clumps of dust, hair, etc. onto the rugs that I have to pick up by hand. I realize stick vacuums aren't for heavy-duty cleaning, and this is the only one I've owned, so perhaps this is on par with your typical stick vacuum. And maybe the types of rugs I have just aren't a good fit for this vacuum, but I wouldn't purchase it again or recommend it to anyone else. I'm looking to replace it with something that can do floors and rugs equally well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good vacuum","review":"I bought this vacuum in July, 2008. I wanted something light weight, bagless and works on both hardwood floor and carpet. I have hardwood floor for the whole house with area rugs in every room. I noticed the vacuum would be overheat and stopped working after 10 minutes of carpet vacuuming. It lasted longer with hardwood floor. I think it's the power nozzle for carpet cleaning that is easily over heated. I don't mind the engine shuts off by itself because I don't want the vacuum burned. Anyway, it's broken couple days ago by the neck between the suction head and the dust container. I am very disappointed and will not recommend it to anyone. I am buying a Bissell 82H1 which cost a bit more. I hope it will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 3 months","review":"I was so thrilled with how easy this lightweight vacuum worked on both my tile floors and carpeting that I was going to rave about it and give it 5 stars when I first got it. I never had time to sit down and write the review and I am glad I didn't. Since I started using it, the plastic part you wrap the cord around cracked and broke right off, then the motor started running very loud, then the vacuum lost suction, and today it just completely died- and it's only 3 months old! It seems like a great buy, but I think it would be better to invest a little more money and get something that is more sturdy and will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"The Hoover Flair is the best little vacuum for picking up just about anything, including cat litter on carpet and hard flooring, which is a real problem. That's the good news. It is the most frustrating appliance I've ever had and would never purchase another. About the time you get started vacuuming it oveheats and stops. I'm not talking about vacuuming your entire house, I'm referring to about 3 minutes (if your lucky) then it stops all together. Since it's an overheating problem you have to wait at least 30-minutes before trying to vacuum again. If Hoover would solve this problem they'd have a fantastic product, but under these circumstances I would never advise anyone to waste their money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong, but overheats quickly!","review":"This vacuum is very easy to use and maneuvers well around furniture, etc. However, it's run time seems to be about 10 minutes and then it quickly overheats. Once it's overheated, it's quite a while before it cools down enough to finish a job. I used this vacuum in my RV on one camping trip and I couldn't vacuum even half the RV without it overheating. On the plus side, it did a nice job picking up the dog hair and debris ... until it overheated. Unfortunately, by the time we discovered this vacuum's shortcomings, it was past the return window. The downside of shopping online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this vacuum less than 2 years ago. I only used it occasionally on hardwoods and for area rugs. It worked good for awhile, but then a few days ago the mode button only would work on Carpet mode and then the suction is barely noticeable. The main reason I have this vacuum is for the hardwoods and I can't even get it to work on that mode anymore!So not worth it to only have less than 2 years! I am on the hunt for a new one that won't die so quickly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"6 1/2 months (2x a month) and it doesn't work right anymore","review":"Like everyone else, I loved the Flair because it was lightweight, stood alone, and worked on both carpet and bare floor, the latter of which I have a lot of. Several weeks ago, it stopped vacuuming on the bare floor level (but, strangely, is still working on the carpet level, maybe because I don't have much). I trusted the good reviews and thought the bad reviews were just isolated instances. My bad! As they say, you get what you pay for, but shouldn't it last more than 13 times? (It also overheats and then just cuts out for a while, as others have noticed.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy little vacuum","review":"This vacuum is much heavier than my regular vacuum, an Oreck. I bought it to clean bare floors, thinking it would have more suction than cordless vacuums. Well, it certainly does and picks up on bare floors well, but hit a throw rug and it has too much suction to vacuum it. Since I have lots of floor mats on bare floors, by the sink, the doors, etc., I can't use it.

Now 5 months later it suddenly stopped working on the \\"floor\\" setting. The \\"carpet\\" mode still functions, but I don't know for how long.

I love that I only use one item for clean ups. I have 2 toddlers and that guarantees the house is messy almost all the time. With this little vac, I was able to do quick clean ups.

The game is exceptionally hard in one player mode as you have two charcters who you have to toggle between. The game is both strategic and action oriented. You can blast the enemy with your machine gunner or use the sniper to pick them off from a distance. The game takes some effort to learn, but is well worth it. One of the nice features on two player is that if your partner dies, the screen becomes full-screen for the remaining player.

A system! Most organizing books are full of specific suggestions for organizing specific items or tasks. These can be very helpful for those of us who need some ideas to get our creative juices flowing. But what do you do when you need to organize something for which you haven't found an idea listed in a book? You buy a copy of Organizing from the Inside Out. Julie Morgenstern has provided a basic formula of organization which can be applied to any specific situation you encounter. She walks the reader through the organization process, step-by-step. She also points out common errors - both technical errors (going about it the wrong way) and psychological obstacles (reasons we really don't want to get organized) - and offers suggestions for correcting them. If you only buy one book on organization, make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going Beneath The [Cluttered] Surface","review":"At first I didn't like the premise of this book -- I wanted to get working and have a clean, organized home office, not think about the \\"purpose\\" of the rooms/areas.

Eventually, I go back to my old habits and move on to something else.This book taught me that you need to make it easy on yourself. When you lose your keys constantly, you need to make a place for them as soon as you walk in the house. If you hate mopping your floors all of the time, then make a nice place for shoes right by the back door. The premise is good... I need to re-read this book and motivate myself to work on other areas of my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible of Organizers","review":"Truly the best book ever on organizing.

Her approach is very effective. For once, there is a clearly defined goal for spending the time getting it together once and for all. She provides the reason why as well as tips to get you there. I feel like I have a new mind set. My husband and children are thrilled with the changes in our home. We can actually enjoy our space and get it \\"equalized\\", cleaned up, in a short time. My 6 year old was able to go through the steps with me and figure out how to organize her room to fit her needs and personality. It is wonderful! She is able to clean up without a fuss and can do it quickly. Her friends are able to see the system she is using and can easily help her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why aren't you organized?","review":"The analysis section of Morgenstern's book stuck with me and it's why I like this book; why aren't you organized? Space issues? Perfectionist-fear-of-failure? Or is your system too organized and is it just impossible to maintain? After you go through this part of the book, the rest is common sense, but it does provide A PLAN, and a plan is key to getting anything done.The plan is more or less:1. Sort2. Purge3. Assign a home4. Containerize5. EqualizeMany other organization books have exactly the same steps. But the difference here is in knowing what failed you before you start out, and the idea of finding things you might need (an extra clothes rod in your closet, crates for files you aren't using but want to store, etc) before you embark on the clean-up. If you have a really hard time divesting yourself of \\"stuff\\", you might need another book on how to get out of the clutter habit, but this one is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"I bought this book back in January. Over the next couple of weeks I gradually used Julie's system to organise the cupboards and rooms throughout my house. 5 months later all the areas I organised are still clean and tidy!

Morgenstern also demonstrates how organizing can help increase productivity, reduce stress, and help one feel better about one's self. Organizing From the Inside Out says the key to staying organized is to recognize the behavior patterns that lead to disorganization and the psychological reasons for staying unorganized. Recognizing these patterns and the psychology behind them is worth the read even if it makes the reader squirm a bit.

The research involved in finding out the details of her early life etc. was a major undertaking. Clara was in many ways a contradiction and he makes that clear. Her life began in hell and she rose above it. Most of the people she had to deal with were more interested in how they could use her to their benefit. She started as a young girl who had no idea of what was \`normal', became a \`famous' actress treated poorly by the studios and all who envied her and wanted to steal from her success, yet in the end she was a kind compassionate LADY who wanted a \`normal' life. She cared deeply for people and was VERY concerned about what went on in this country and the rest of the world. To put it in perspective, I knew Clara in her later years and even stayed at her house for extended periods as my grandmother was her nurse/companion/confidant. David Stenn's book deals fairly and compassionately with her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"** Don't waste your money **","review":"The best thing this book has going for it is the Bibliography - because if you read that you will be enlightened as to some other books which you would be far better off investing in.

For the really interested reader, House of Boughs by Marjoie Henderson and Elizabeth Wilkinson is THE book.

Good support and nice shape - I'm very picky about having the girls where they belong (I did have the straps shortened though as I do on most bras since I'm petite). The Le Mystere Tisha bra had firmer support with virtually no bounce, but wasn't near as comfortable.I never noticed this bra throughout the day as I do with most - it felt very natural on and I was never anxious to take it off at the end of the day.

We are all poisoning ourselves and most of our aches, pains, and fatigue will disappear if we follow their dexocification program.At least the authors don't claim that their detox program will cure everyone of everything, merely claiming that most people will feel far better following their program.The book talks about scientific basis without citing scientific studies.

Hung as shown, it will NOT keep out much rain. I have added my own \\"clips\\" so it will now stay on and have plugged the big hole in the top.

I haven't gone through the CD booklet in detail yet to get a rough translation of the lyrics, but you really don't need to understand what they're saying; the music is that infectious.

Please don't accept a mediocre 'uninformed' review about the tempos & rhythms here - George was a prankster himself and Gibbons is recreating this aspect of his personality probably better than anyone else could - explore this CD (and check out the reviews on Vol. 1 which better reflect 'what' to expect w/ the entire series) - enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Authentic\\"? George Gershwin?","review":"I was instantly dissapointed in the mechanical, yet inaccurate rhythms. His interpretation of piano roll performances is not accurate because the beat is not even. In his non-piano roll performances, there is still a lot of unevenness, and it is hard to hear the beat. In those wonderful Gershwin syncopations that trick you, he is tricked and doesn't maintain the proper rhythm. The \\"American in Paris\\" is perhaps the most interesting, and shows the most artistic playing, although it still lacks subtlety. I would have prefered to hear the actual piano rolls as mechanical as they are, or other old recordings, and have a better idea of what was really happening in the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only three, but really good three","review":"This collection from phaidon, give as a good study of three projects with detailed plans and good pictures.

It took a little while to figure out where it was leaking and we finally figured out there was a leak in one of the side seams, in the top section, so it seemed fine as long as it was only half full but as soon as we filled it all the way it was leaking nonstop. Had to return it and hesitant to buy another and risk the same problem, but I really did like the look, capacity and the portability so I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, NO, NO!","review":"First of all, this thing is huge.. be prepared. The top was screwed down so hard that it took 2 people to open it the 1st time. After the initial opening, it still was difficult to both open and close. The final problem finished it off for me.

It is packed full of postcard information compiled from experienced dealers and collectors.As a beginning postcard collector, you will need to fully study this guide and understand the way the material is categorized before you use it at any PC Collector Shows & Auctions.

Mashburn's catalog of collectible postcards is as fun as reading an old Sears catalog and as informative as an encyclopedia. The author should have offered better clarification of certain postcard types, such as \\"linens\\" (what do they feel like?) and \\"real photos\\" (are they originals without any reproductions?). Mashburn should have kept the definitions more explicit and basic for beginners, but this is a trap into which all experts fall. Overall, this is a great intro to collecting postcards.

My mother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimers and this has helped me to understand what she is going through. I've completed the book, but still turn back to parts as it serves as a handbook.

Realy a great way to deal with the heartache and action Episode III's sure to bring, and move us along into the rebellion era. because here's something to think about there are 18 years between episode III and IV....is Obi-wan at the end of Revenge the same man we see as \\"old man\\" Ben in episode IV? what can 18 years of grief, frustration, and fear look like for a Jedi. and maybe most importantly for the fans...how does Obi-Wan learn to become one with the force in A New Hope?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book for all Star Wars Fans!","review":"I thought that this was a very well done book! Jude Watson gives a special insight to Obi-Wan's life on Tatooine. When you read the beginning, you can almost feel how Obi-Wan feels about losing everyone he knew and loved. I liked how she brought back some of the characters from the other books. I never would have thought of some of them again if she hadn't. I think that this book would make a lot more sense it you read Jedi Quest and Jedi Apprentice first. Or at least Jedi Quest, that way you know one of the main characters better. Malorum reminds me of Xanatos and Granta Omega, I can't wait to find out who he is!! And I also liked when a certain bounty hunter arives! This is a great book, and you probably will hardly be able to wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You should read this book!!","review":"I LOVE this book!

It had a cool storyline and I do like getting to hear more about what happened with Obi-Wan between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. I also like reading about what happened with the other Jedi who escaped order 66. My only \\"complaint\\" isn't really a complaint, that is that the book is below my reading level and a little short for my taste.

Not surprisingly, all of the composers were active in the 20th century, and some of them are still with us in the 21st.Since the saxophone is more commonly used as a jazz instrument than it is as a symphonic one, its inclusion gives these performances a jazz quality that would not otherwise be present, and, as such, adds a certain modicum of excitement to this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain Riding Techniques: A Guide to Wet Weather","review":"This book certainly wasn't what I expected.

Some Chinese military leaders set in motion a devious plan centered in Hong Kong. The only thing in their way, the USS Thomas Jefferson and Carrier Battle Group 14. Douglass did a superb job keeping you guessing as to the Chicom's real motives until the last couple chapters. Loved the different ways they tried to pull off the plan. And on top of that, a super typhoon is brewing in the Pacific. Some awesome fighter combat scenes thrown in as well. Great drama! Good character development, especially among F-14 jocks Lobo and Bird Dog. Both trying to bury some nasty ghosts in their pasts and prove their are worthy to be top notch Tomcat drivers again.

However, unlike that book which is at the same time accessible and profound, this book is repetitive and trite. The entire point of the conversation (it's in question and answer format) is that within everyone is a \\"blessed divine energy\\" that is only accessed when we allow ourselves to experience feelings and needs, both our own and other people's, without judgement or evaluation. There are better explorations of how to do this in Rosenberg's other books. I can't help but 'judge' that this book is geared toward the new age crowd that likes to have practical advice sugar coated in mystical language, as if simply calling something \\"blessed\\" and \\"divine\\" somehow automatically elevates both the message and the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't know what is spirituality then read it :)","review":"I got curious about this book since I had read the basic book from Rosenberg and had felt it so transforming that ther should be something more inside his teachings. And this book on spirituality revealed it. In fact by practicing NVC we can create a better world and it helps to unveil the compassion and love that we all have and share.

When you do a quest you mainly only got 10,000 gold. (goes by really quickly.) The dungeons don't repop guys so you need to keep restarting the game (server if you are in mplayer).

Denis Wick and the London Wind Orchestra take Grainger's music and express it in the fullest capacity possible. Irish Tune from County Derry has never had a better recording made. Molly on the Shore and Shepherd's Hey are played masterfully and flawlessly. And A Lincolnshire Posy is represented in its full glory. Along with these songs is also the music of Poulenc and Milhaud. Both are played beautifully by the Orchestra and fully express the musical quality that the two composers had imagined. This CD is a definite great buy along with the military band music of Holst and Vaughan Williams, which is also performed by Denis Wick and the London Wind Orchestra. Any wind band lover should consider these two CDs essential to their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great on paper, Last only a few months","review":"I purchased this to save on desktop space.

I got it for new year with my own gameboy. Ok what I like about this game is that you can pick up some thing and throw it. I also like the 3D stuff like chase Dory or chase the turtle that said '' hey dude ''. Also it starts out simple like first level, going to school. Second level, going out to find your classmates and returning them to the sting ray guy. But the best part of this game is I one time just typed in something in the cheat code place, and without knowing, I got too the last level. What I don't like about this game is that it is too hard.

They give the sense that, as long as you can use the word \\"dystopia\\" in your review, the book must be good.I respectfully dissent. There's not a single character you care about. The alternate reality never seemed realistic or to have an internal logic. Burgess is a good writer, and shows a few nice flashes in his use of language, but even these are few and far between. There's very little here that shines any light on the issues of today. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good book, Burgess is truly admirable man.","review":"This book shows a not so unique image of the future, but that's what makes it realistic. Even though that was not Burgess' point, it still gives an eerie idea of societies dark and horrific side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cautionary Tale","review":"The Wanting Seed is a cautionary tale along the lines of 1984 or The Handmaid's Tale. The novelist's objective is to get the reader to suspend disbelief, but I'm not sure Burgess completely achieves that here. His description of a British authoritarian society changing is a little too fantastic, but his characters do redeem the book. I enjoyed this, but unlike another reviewer, I think A Clockwork Orange is a better effort, though that novel does require the reader work a little harder than here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation","review":"This book provides a great foundation for those who plan and preside over the Liturgy.

This easel was very, very heavy; it was unwieldy, and the stand opened and closed with great difficulty. The easel arrived with a crack and chip out of the heavy grey plastic. I returned it immediately and chose not to replace it. Thankfully Amazon has a good return system. Unfortunately I had also purchased the carrying case they recommended for it. That came from a store affiliated with Amazon and not from Amazon directly. It arrived before the easel and unfortunately I had thrown away the original packing box; in any case, the postage both ways would have made it virtually unreturnable.

Heck, I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.I love GTA.

I rented this game just to see if they fixed all the problems with gta1 on ps and also to see if it compared to the pc version at all. But it didn't. I literally played it for 2 minutes and turned it off. It bites! It's probably the worst playstation game I've ever played! The opening cinematics makes you think that the game is all cool but then when you actually play it it's garbage.

Buy the PC version instead.Thoughts: I wish I'd known they were so different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping a barrier...","review":"...These movies don't even come close to 'Baraka'. The images are of less quality and do not draw you in. The 'background music' has become a barrier between the images you see and the feelings they could have created. Instead of showing the images with the natural sounds that go with them, there's a feeling of disconnect as the eyes see one thing, but the ears hear other, unrelated, audio 'clues'.Even though the director is Francis Ford Coppola, do not be fooled in expecting high quality. There is a strong impression he made the movie during his lunch hour while concentrating on another film.Both movies suffer from the same visual/audio disconnect. If you want to spent the same amount of money in this category, but two 'Baraka' movies and give one to a dear friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantastic waste","review":"The idea is great and there is a lot that could have been done with it.

When I first saw Koyaanisqatsi on television I was amazed, surprised. I had never seen anything like this before. The beautiful pictures and the intriguing music absorbed me. The contrasts are many and make the film interesting till the last scene. This movie I can watch over and over again and the music is a master piece on its own. However as said before the movie goes together with the music and makes it a true work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coherency","review":"The theme suggested by Koyaanisqatsi is remarkably visible in the stream of imagery, making the documentary commenatary very informative and suggestive. Koyaanisqatsi held my attention, and presented itself not only as a work of art, but also as an informing work of art. Powaqqatsi did not appear so readily accessible in a thematic way. I found the imagery, though provoking and immediate, to be an unfocused narrative. What is the message? The title suggests a theme, but the train of images fails to synthesize a statement initiated in the title. Of course life is in transition. How does that interest me? As a single viewer, I wasn't as interested in the Powaqqatsi video as I was in the Koyaanisqatsi imagery. Creatures of the world, including humans, are parasitic? Perhaps the videographers should have included some vegetarian \\"fare\\" (offering a solution to our animal natures). Finally, Phillip Glass's stimulating soundscapes, poignant and haunting, make both documentaries worth the bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd's that make one think","review":"Every time I view these dvd's there is something that I see and it makes one think and use our minds rather than just watching it ..I can watch these over and over and get a new message from the two each time,just wonderful to be using the mind in this manner..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"The only shortcoming of the masterpiece epic \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" on DVD is technical: the tape-to-DVD transfer is quite noisy: it's evident in some shots and colors where the shimmering \\"noise\\" detracts slightly from the visuals. Nevertheless this is a groundbreaking film, and seeing it 21 years after its cinematic release, yah it blows me (and anyone else who sees it)away.So hey GR howzaboot a complete remastering, on par with the excellent soundtrack remaster?

It just shows strange and fun stuff in either super slow motion or hyper-speed - I have no qualms about purchasing this and enjoying the visual experience over and over again. I did have a Laser disc copy of it many years ago, it was damaged and not replaceable until now. I anxiously await the release of the DVD.Excellent visuals and excellent music. It's worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"The first time I saw Baraka, I fell in love with it. Mesmerising, haunting, beautifully filmed and a great soundtrack. I thought it was a one of a kind till I heard about Koyaanisqatsi. Reading all the reviews I purchased this together with Powaqqatsi. What a dissapointment! both these films fall drastically short of Baraka. I found the music nausiating and the photography irritating. I really don't know what all the other reviewers are on about. I guess it proves that we are all so different"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep-inducing, obvious, repetitive","review":"Granted, Koyaanisqatsi had a certain freshness and art-house novelty when it was first released, and the cinematography (which was better realized in Baraka, and accompanied by better music) is worthwhile, but the unspeakably obvious latter-day Luddite point is hammered home in the first 20 minutes. Many of the images have poetry, yes, but you can't make an epic poem of a haiku. Powaqqatsi ranks several notches below its predecessor, and is scarcely worth even a first viewing. The remastered dolby digital sound is great--if only it revealed anything worth hearing after five minutes. I can't fathom why anyone would want to watch either film more than once. I know of no one who has seen either who didn't prefer Ron Fricke's (director of photography for both of these films) Baraka instead. No wonder he didn't return for Reggio's final installment of the trilogy, Naqoyqatsi. He prefers his sleep aids in the over-the-counter format."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\"","review":"Nothing about the tape was as advertised: date, condition, use.

One shows the how man works and the other how man uses the planet. I wanted to like these but I found the constant image changing and music aggravating. They are very interesting and have good messages but I can't stand the constant sensory bombardment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to be released on DVD Video","review":"Wonderful composition.

I don't know why I waited so long, since I thought his first book was astonishing. Finally, I read this one, not expecting too much from it, based solely on the subject matter. I figured as a single guy, I would not be able to relate very much. I was wrong. It is such a joy to read Mr. Bayard's writing. He leaves me constantly in awe as he describes people and objects with wit and a very keen eye. And the story, too, was very much a surprise. Nice job, Mr. Bayard! You have joined the ranks of my favorite authors, beside the likes of Jim Oliver and Peter Cameron. Can't wait for your next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but Fool's Errand was Terrific","review":"This was my second Bayard read. \\"Fool's Errand,\\" my first was a book I could not put down - loved it; \\"Endangered Species\\" did not quite \\"do it\\" for me the same way. Here's why: Bayard's characters are all to real for me as a former Washingtonian... I sometimes think he's writing about folks I know (maybe so?), and the main character in this book is more like someone I would try to avoid at a cocktail party! So I put the book down halfway through, then came back and finished it a couple of weeks later. I suppose that means Bayard has once again mastered very identifiable and real-to-me characters! I hope to see more from this writer.

On live you can cruise the city, circuit race, and play a destruction game and other things. The graphics look to PS2 and are not to nice. Also there are no licensed cars, but they still look cool. The menu screen is very difficult to find all of your options. I also have midtown madness 3 and it is much better because of the graphics and more online options and licensed cars. But Midnight Club 2 also has three cities including Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Paris. There are alot of nice jumps on this game which make it alot of fun. The option of riding motor bikes make the game alot better. I would recomend you getting this game if you like raceing games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game!","review":"Great game with tons of neat things to do like speeding in a sports car to ripping it up in a motorcycle all while racing against othe cars or motorcycles or both, being chased by cops, and trying to dodge the traffic and other obstacles!I recommend this game to anyone looking for a great racing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINX!!!","review":"This game is a big dissapointment and a huge waste of money. I bought this because I heard it was good and I can't stand it. The only reason I played it at all was because I spent $50 on it and couldn't return it. I love racing games, so it's pretty hard for me not to like a car game. All these other people are probably giving it a good rating because they just got it and played it for 5 mins. or don't even have it at all. If your looking for a really good racing game, go with Midtown Madness 3. That games alot better and plus it's made by Microsoft. You'll have a much better time with that, I promise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best racing game I have ever played!!!","review":"I bought this game being very optomistic.I havnt really liked racing games that much,but this game changed it all.The gameplay is so in depth.The A.I. is magnificent,if you are lost and dont know wich street to turn on the other cars will lead you right to it.The nos is another one of the many eccelnt aspects of this very very eccelent racing game.So if you are stuck between wich games to buy i would recomened this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"MidnightClub2- 5*****","review":"MidnightClub2 is an awesome game. It is sooo realistic, you can land on roofs and rome around. You can use noss and get up to speeds of 200 mph. And if you just want to play it safe and rome around town slowly and calmly, the stop lights actually work. And its not any violent fighting game either."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"I thought that this game would be a great game.I played it a lot and realized that Midtown Madness 3is a much better game for the XBOX.

Other telescoping items can be turned to secure them. These legs collapse with any movement or in certain positions. I'm trying to think of a way to make them not slip closed so easily, such as an anti-WD40 spray. Maybe just some dirt and scratching?Seriously, I would love it fine if I could get a feeling of security once positioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for your Christmas collection!","review":"My parents first bought this collection when it was in record form--it was one of our family's favorite albums and we played it constantly throughout the Christmas season. When the record started to wear out, we couldn't find a copy in CD form in the United States. Not to be deprived of such beautiful music, my brother finally found a small music store in Washington, DC that special-ordered it from England.Although most of the carols on this disc are well-known, the new arrangements for orchestra and chorus produce fresh and inspiring interpretations of these deservedly well-loved songs. The Scottish National Orchestra and Chorus' performances are exquisite. Even Christmas cynics will be moved by this collection--buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best orchestra/chorus Christmas albums ever","review":"I concur with the reviewer from the San Francisco area. I purchased this from the Musical Heritage Society a number of years ago and have been awaiting its appearance on CD. Thank you ASV for reissuing one of the best Christmas Albums ever.The arrangements of these carols are stunning and listeners will be pleased that they stray from the beaten path too often taken by large ensembles doing this type of material. Listeners I think will also agree that the playing and singing are excellent. The album has just the right mix of vitality and reverance befitting the spirit of the season.This albums deserves a spot on record shelves and in listeners' hearts along with the Bernstein/Mormon Tabernacle \\"The Joy of Christmas\\" and Ormandy's \\"The Glorious Sound of Christmas.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job!","review":"I've been looking for a piano CD like this for a long time. It has all my favorite solo piano classics on it. Its well done and extremely well played. What piano did you use?

Thanx for this great romantic piano album, keep on playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"audio program","review":"well, i thoguht i was ordering the dvd's at first, but it ended up I really need the audio program for the class i'm taking. the cd's seem to work fine so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Book","review":"The use of audio by the Language teacher at our school to help the student hear the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lamn tunes!","review":"I've always liked Robert Lamn, his songs, his singing, and he has always been a core member of Chicago. His first solo album (\\"Skinny Boy\\") was a little weak by today's standards, and it's interesting to see how he developed as a songwriter and performer over the years. This is an excellent album with some really good tunes on it. His later album \\"Subtlety and Passion\\" is even better than this one, but listened back-to-back, S&P is a lot more polished and commercial, which makes this album more of a gem. They are all out of print now, so if you can find one I suggest you grab it while you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good material, needs acoustic drums & brass","review":"Upon listening to the tracks on this CD I must say that some of the music really has potential. I could have had alot more feeling and drive. Meaning, the synthetic percussion and brass lines really cheapen the overall product. Any serious music listener is going to be disappointed upon hearing these uncanny sounds. Robert can certainly afford to hire a top call drummer and brass section. The horn sounds in \\"Sacrifical Culture\\" are practically laughable in some sections. In other areas, it almost pulls it off, but doesn't quite make it. The drum sounds are remniscent of the little Casio keyboards of the '80s with a drum patch. Come on, do it right! The music deserves it and I believe the listeners would benefit as well. On the good side, the singing of Phoebe Snow is entrancing with that soulful sound and style. \\"Watching the Time Go By\\" is a nice walk back in time with a nostalgic edge. So, please hire a drummer and brass section for the next record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I never thought it could get worse than \\"Life Is Good In My Neighborhood\\" but it is. But because I am a Chicago fan and have every CD that they and each member of the band has put out, I purchased it. Unfortunately, I will never listen to it again. Bill Champlin's solo project are far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Killing Time","review":"The only decent song is the \\"Time\\" song. Can't even remember the full name as it is not that great. The rest of the CD is just plain bad. I expected a lot more from Lamm. I am a big Chicago fan, but this just shows Lamm isn't much without the band to hone quality arrangements and trombonist James Pankow writing a killer horn arrangement. It appears that Lamm is just killing time with this wasted effort. It has pretty much turned me off of any Robert Lamm solo work.Don't buy this CD!!!-- Buy some old Chicago instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different altogether!","review":"This sucks! Okay, I guess I should say more, but I won't. I love Chicago and even Cetera and Champlin's solo work. But this sucks! I will never, ever listen to it again. I normally write more thorough reviews, but I will only put as much thought into my review as Robert put into this pathetic effort. Come to think of it, I AM out of clay targets."},{"rating":"1","title":"TheSquare.com","review":"I was quite confused by this book.

I figured 1/32 scale was small, but didn't expect \\"micro\\". I did expect a little more detail to make up for its small size, but that was too much I suppose. Next time I want to buy a model, I will go to a hobby store where I can see it first.

They were cheap and you can't open the doors or hood and they have no engines. However,I bought them just to paint in different color schemes and allow me to see, firsthand, my ideas before spending the time and expense on my real car. So for that purpose they were perfect.Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that glows with nostalgic warmth","review":"Some of the lesser known music by Eric Coates can be heard on this recommendable CD. Indeed, this is a world premiere recording of his 1930 suite \\"The Seven Dwarfs\\" and a first complete recording of his 1932 suite \\"The Jester at the Wedding\\". If the light-hearted, colourful music characterized the spirit of the 1930s, it now positively glows with nostalgic warmth.A third suite, entitled \\"Four Centuries\\" dates from 1941. Coates represents each of the four last centuries with an appropriate dance. The 20th Century dance is peppered with saxophone additions and syncopated rhythms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anime!","review":"I picked this up in hope that it would show me some simple anime techniques, IE chibi etc, but it's not only badly drawn and poorly explained, it's also nothing like anime. Do not get this book, it also teaches nothing. Get How to draw Manga, or for younger kids, The Art Of Creating and Drawing anime women/action series's."},{"rating":"1","title":"anime?!","review":"I just to a glips this book and I look at it and thought \\"anime?!\\" the answer was no. It was to cartoony.Yes it's a could book to draw cartoons but not anime. For instance look at Salior moon, Rayearth or Yu-gi-oh then look at this book do the look a like? If you want to learn real anime don't get this book you could get better ones for less. THIS IS A NOTE IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING ANY OF HIS MANGA MANIA BOOKS when you see the great art on the front it isn't his he hires people to do a whole chunk of the book and the front and back of the book for him then like only a small amount is his work and on the front of the book it says the book was by him. What did he do besides put no-anime charaters in it?! That's what I'm still trying to find out.Back to this book if you can see the front of the book doesn't look good on the cover. If the covers bad isn't the book going to be the same? So If you want to learn anime I recemendbooks that at least look like anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"too kiddish","review":"in my opinion, this is too kiddish for anyone who wants to become serious.

I mean don't even waste your time or money with this book, better yet go find it at your local library. I love to draw manga and anime and when I flipped through this book me and my friends, we were pissed off because it's an embarrassment. So not beginners or anyone above that.

I myself am an artist having taken Art AP for two years (this year is my second :P) and sold a number of pieces while still in high school so I do know what I am talking about. I paint realistic watercolors mostly (I love Alan Lee's art) but I do enjoying drawing manga let us face it, its fun. However, manga art can be extremely creative and individual if you just learn the basics and then let your own artistic skills and creativity developed a unique style. Books such as this one that put children in a box and teach them to draw cookie-cutter manga should be burned Fahrenheit 451 style. Instead, for the aspiring young cartoonist a broad guide likes how to Draw Manga vol.1 and let your mind run wild from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighted Pen","review":"The previous reviewer must have lost her pocket-clip pen cap. Looking at the image above you will see that the black button is somewhat far from the writing tip. This is for a reason--the designers made it so the accompanying cap, when placed onto the back of the pen, will hold down the button for your light output. If one does lose the cap a fat rubber band or other can be wrapped around to hold the button in when in use.I bought several of these pens for my aging parents and they both love them!I cannot give this item 5 stars because the supplied ink reservoir is very small--not standard length--and will run dry rather quickly if/when one uses this pen frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised. Useless!","review":"I need a pen that writes in the dark, after several failed purchases, I was excited to finally find a pen that actually writes in the dark. When I received it the first thing you notice is how big, ugly and industrial/medical looking the pen is. Beyond that, the pen lights up all right, but you have to hold down the heavy button for the light to work. You don't just turn it on and start writing. To make this even more unusable the button is located at the top of the pen and not at the bottom. So in order to write with the light on, you have to hold the pen at the top and keep your hand pressed on the heavy to push button. Making it virtually useless. My hunt for a pen that writes in the dark continues, but I won't be making any more \\"blind\\" purchases from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pen","review":"This pen is great for writing in the dark. As noted by the 2nd reviewer, putting the cap over the non-writing end keeps the light on. I've tried other pens that did not work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Good Music","review":"I have always felt it difficult to explain *why* I like a particular album by a particular group. Something about music is to me beyond explanation. It moves the soul, moves the passions, and brings a smile to your face; yet it defies explanation. Nevertheless, I know good music when I hear it, and this was good music.One thing I can say is that I have heard neo-Irish and Celtic groups who, in my opinion, completely ruin the music. They add all these strange electronic effects, and mix the ancient music with a few too many electric guitars and such. Cherish the Ladies is not a group in that category. They understand traditional music, and how to use modern instruments to enhance it rather than destroying it.It's just good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-designed album","review":"This album has an excellent mix of instrumental pieces and vocal songs. It alternates tunes with an upbeat tempo and tunes that are slower, so that one does not get tired while listening to the entire album straight through.This is my first purchase of an album by Cherish the Ladies, and I am extremely pleased. They are obviously top-rate musicians. Anyone who wants to get a flavor of Irish music, I'd recommend this as an excellent first album.My favor song is John of Dreams. It uses both a male and female singer, and the entrancing play of the flute echoes the sweetly-sad melody of the singers. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd by a 15 year old","review":"mandy moore has some really great songs like \\"candy\\",\\"walk me home\\",\\"not too young\\",\\"so real\\", and \\"quit breaking my heart\\",but the rest were not so great. i don't get why she put in \\"telephone\\" for anyway. it's not even a song and it's a few seconds long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mandy, britney, they are all the same","review":"aall right, i know it's been said a billion times before, but i am going to say it again. Mandy Moore is just like Britney Spears, they have talent, but not much of it. It's like, they record all their songs once and then lip sync the songs from then on and to me, that does not say TALENT.Mandy Moore looks anorexic and Britney(sorry guys) is all feke. that thing she said about a \\"growth spirt\\" was complete bull. they both will be forgotten soon and I will never have to look at them again. i hope my review has swayed your opinion about teen pop singers, except for Christina Aguilera because man can that girl sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE VOICE","review":"Everybody is saying \\"Give her a break, she's only 15!\\" Pleeeease!!! For everybody who knows about Rachael Lampa, the 15 year old Christian Pop singer, doesn't have a nasily voice, in fact a voice that was compared to Celine Dion and Mariah Carey!! Whoever said she can sing better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson, you're wrong!!!!! First of all Christina and Jessica have both a huge range and can hold their voice for at least 20 seconds at miniunm. Britney can hold her voice for 10 seconds at max and have a higher range than Mandy. At least Rachael knows what she is singing about. When I saw Mandy sing on Craig Kilborn and she bombed. She tried singing acoustic to \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" and she sounded like she was 2 years old. The whole album is songs with no meaning. Candy has a good beat, not lyrics or a good voice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not try'in to be mean, but So Real deserves one star","review":"When i first put So Real into my CD player, the first thing I noticed was the lack of effort put into the CD. It really seemed as if Mandy strolled into the record studio, and some people wrote some songs for her in a hurry, and after an hour she had a CD. Thats the problem with a lot of artists, they don't put any quality time and effort into their songs. I'm sorry to add to the bunches and bunches of low ratings, but we are all correct in saying that this CD is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy is anything but \\"So Real\\"","review":"Mandy does have a certain charm and innocence that might make her seem pretty sweet and all, but the fact remains that THIS CD STINKS. I think that I could come up with better songs than the ones they used. I it really wouldn't kill them to make at least one song about something besides love. I don't buy it. Mandy is 15 and really spacey and I just don't believe she is feeling the emotions that are in her lyrics. I real performer has to feel the music and understand it but Mandy just sort of struggles to hit the notes and is more worried about her cameos on MTV. I find it ironic that this CD is called \\"So Real\\" cause it is anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worser than the dirtiest of trash","review":"Mandy Moore is a poor man's Britney Spears.

I can't believe that there are people who actually think Mandy is making music! Gee wiz! if you like music instead of bad sounding noise, then this cd isn't for you!

Stop the ear noise!","review":"This CD is the worst 13.99 I have ever spent! Not only does Mandy have no genuine talent. I don't think she could sing her way out of a karaoke bar. It seems as though she is attempting to emulate pop divas like Britney, and Christina but Mandy forget it. Mandy's CD is just another attempt to make a few bucks. Her \\"hit\\" Candy does make you want to tap your toes but it's playing power is not there. After the second time of hearing it I am already tired. As for the rest of the CD I had to fight back the yawns and droopy eyes. This CD lacks any imagination, funk, and spirit. Do all of our ears a favor and don't play ear noise like Mandy Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANDY'S VOICE IS LIKE CANDY","review":"MANDY'S VOICE IS LIKE CANDY: IT MAKES YOU SICK AND ROTS YOUR TEETH! NO, SERIOUSLY, HER VOICE REALLY DID MAKE ME SICK. THE ONLY REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS CD AT ALL IS BECAUSE I LIKED THE SONG CANDY. HER VOICE SOUNDS LIKE A WACKED-OUT VERSION OF BRITTANEY SPEARS, AND COMPARED TO WHAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUTTING ABOUT HER VOICE, THATS A COMPLIMENT! ALL HER SONGS HAVE REALLY DUMB LYRICS, EXAMPLE: I WANT YOU TO LOCK ME IN YOUR HEART AND THROW AWAY THE KEY, SHOW ME LOVE THE WAY ITS SUPPOSED TO BE. THIS GIRL'S ONLY FIFTEEN!

And she's supposed to be FIFTEEN? She looks about thirty. Also, if she's fifteen, then what the hell is she doing driving a car? Also, her voice is all computerized, it displays no original talent whatsoever. It's just another one of those teeny bopper acts that makes her manager tons of money, and she doesn't even care about what she does. The only reason she has become so popular is through all the publicity that she gets from MTV. They love her for some reason, but she's just trying to outdo Britney Spears, and it seems like everyone is trying to do that now. Pretty soon, she'll be gone with all those other people like Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera who really need to get a life and find something that they're actually good at, not just flaunting themselves on TV or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they call this music?","review":"Well well well, little diva-wannabes are just popping up everywhere. First, this girl needs to learn to lip-sing. Bad enough, she cant sing, she cant even move her mouth to the music, that right there shows a lack of talent. How old is she, 15? Shes trying to be another Britney, and believe me the world can do without another Britney. Her voice is fake and her songs have no meaning. I swear, just when i stopped hearing \\"Candy\\" 50 times a day, she goes and releases another song. THIS CD IS MORE USEFUL AS A FRISBEE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Mandy sounds immature on all her love me for me songs on her debut album 'So Real'. I don't recommend this album, and her single 'Candy' is way over rated because she's trying so much to sound like a Britney hit. On \\"What You Wants\\", Mandy tries to deliver R&B, and yet she hasn't master the skill. Young artists like 15 year old Mandy need more vocal lessons because even Jennifer Love Hewitt's debut album was embarassingly better. I rather much recommend a female teen artist that parts from the Britney and Christina's bubble gum style, try Billie's debut album \\"Honey To The B\\". You don't know what your missing out on."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SECOND BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD!","review":"This is the best CD! The best tracks are So Real, What you Want, and Candy. They have a great rhythm and are great songs to dance to. This is in my top 5 all-time favorite albums and is possibly the greatest album of 1999! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY ORDER THIS CD AND BUY A FEW EXTRAS FOR GIFTS. This CD has tons of different styles of music, with Quit Breaking my Heart like Britney Spears' music and What you Want being of the Spice Girls' style. This album is great for anyone on your list who loves music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another talentless \\"singer\\"","review":"Yet another talentless singer to hit the market. Adding to the frog voiced world of Britney, here comes Mandy Moore. These girls are not musicians. Real musicians write their own music and are actually able to sing. Real musicians have dedicated years to music, sat exams, slogged over scales and warm ups and taken music at school or university. They should become famous, because they actually have talent. If you are keen to hear teenage singers, try Charlotte Church. Hopefully, she will bring some music culture with her enchanting voice into this world. If you want to listen to decent music played by wonderful musicians, buy the Corrs CD. Don't waste your time with Mandy or Britney. If they can become famous, then anyone can. I would rate this CD lower, but I can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but real...","review":"Mandy's album has to be the most amazing collection of garbage ever placed on silicon. Poor girl. She doesn't seem to realize that she can't sing, and is little more than a toy of her writers and record company owners. The meaningless drivel smattered on these tracks is disgusting. What the hell is \\"missing you like candy?\\" Uh, is that a compliment or...what? Where is the content to this music? Where is the music?

This CD is decent.Okay. I bought this CD because I liked \\"Candy.\\" Most of the songs on this album are filler songs, as is typical of a debut CD, but \\"So Real,\\" and \\"Love You for Always\\" are really good.Overall, Mandy is a great singer.

Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another Britney ya'll know it","review":"Oh my gosh peoples Mandy has NO talent at all... she can't SING or DANCE just like britney.

The restof the songs on this CD however, all sucked...Most of the songs on SOREAL are pretty lame and rather embarrassing..Mandy reminds me of thatlame Girl-Group, Dream because the girls of Dream are like, the sameages as Mandy Moore. I really do hope you will reconsider buying thisalbum because it will be very disappointing. Now, if you like thesongs, \\"Candy\\" and \\"Walk Me Home\\", then Irecommend the singles for those two songs. Otherwise, don't botherbuying SO REAL...If you wanna buy music by one of the teen \\"PopPrincess\\", then I suggest going with CDs by the talents ofChristina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson.Bottom Line: A realdisappointment and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you thinking?","review":"How is there any way that you people can say that any of these girls (Brittney, Christina, Jessica, Mandy) are \\"pop divas?\\" These girls are all show and no talent; Mandy Moore is what, 11 years old? She looks and sounds like she hasn't even hit puberty. Her voice is no different from any of these talentless girls. Actually, Christina can actually belt out those songs of hers, but she still shouldn't be considered a \\"diva.\\" These girls aren't even old enough to vote, let alone be \\"divas.\\" Get over Mandy Moore; she's going to be quickly forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has all the talent gone?","review":"Listening to this CD, I was astounded at the lack of talent Mandy had. Her voice is just plain awful! and her attitude on her videos is so phony and SO-UNREAL. The tracks on the CD lack the punch of Britney and Christina and Jessica, and her voice is by far the worst of any artist I've heard. I don't know how on earth she got to become a performer, cause she lacks any ounce of talent for singing. Mandy, maybe you should model, but your singing career is the joke of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I hope Mandy Moore reads this one day.Now, this is my opinion and I am entitled to it aight?Mandy Moore lacks much vocal talent and I am surprised she made it, especially on Sony. Mandy, you are lucky to have that record company, I know more than 200,000,000 other people that are more talented that you and your album. Your voice is annoying sometimes and I think you DO have fans that WILL support you, but the rest of the people just think your voice, your talents are minimal! I know this may hurt your feelings but I STILL CANNOT believe you made it! I think maybe some of the material weren't for your voice and it wasn't right! Sorry! But your album is horrible, I am not saying you should be a Christina Aguilera or a Mariah Carey but go home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, confident competition for Britney!","review":"Immediately appealing, frothy, fun, pop debut from striking teen starlet Mandy Moore. Excellent, youthful production and infectious, Britney-like songs. Mandy's voice is fresh and focused. If you like Candy, then there's a lot more where that one came from. Infact, there's one good song after another. Extremely enjoyable and accessible to all pop fans, though I must admit, as a 26 year old, I find the project a touch too teen-oriented. Don't get me wrong though, I love it! PS does anyone else remember the original version of Let me be the one? It took me a while to think about it but I'm sure it was done by 80's British popstars Five Star. PS2 Mandy -GO GIRL! Give Britney a ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks","review":"this cd totaly sucks i mean this girl can't even sing i bought her cd cause i liked the song candy but man the rest of the songs suck really bad if you wanna get a good but i mean good cd i suggest you buy the backstreet boys new millennium cd cause now that was music and i mean good music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"This is terrible. Moore is to Korn as Spears is to Limp Bizkit. I tell you...the people who deserve respect are the recording engineers who turn this into gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype","review":"Although I was looking forward to hearing Mandy's CD, I was greatly disappointed. She lacks the vocal skills of Jessica Simpson/Christina Aguilera, and her songs aren't as catchy as those by Britney Spears. The only good/catchy songs on the CD are Candy and So Real. Basically, this is one of those albums where you go out and buy it because you like a song that you heard on the radio and then find out that that one song is the only song worth listening to. Don't waste your money. If you're into Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, then I suggest Jessica Simpson rather than Mandy Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Mandy, WHY?","review":"Okay, so I liked Mandy's style and I thought she was cute, so I bought this album. Lets' just say it was totally dissapointing. All of the songs are sugary-sweet pop and there is not one that doesn't mention the words \\"i love you\\", or something similar. The only good thing is the great pictures of Mandy inside. Why not check out Britney Spears' \\"Baby, One More Time\\", or Christina Aguilera's \\"Christina Aguilera\\" if you want a real sophomore album!So Real-2/5Candy-1/5What You Want-5/5Walk me Home-3/5Lock me in Your Heart-5/5Telephone (Interlude)-4/5Quit Breaking my Heart-2/5Let Me be the One-3/5Not too Young-1/5Love Shot-5/5I Like it-1/5Love Yu for Always-2/5Quit Breaking my Heart (reprise)-1/5AVERAGE RATING-2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK CD","review":"The only really good song here is \\"Lock Me in Your Heart\\". Some other songs are all right, but none of the other ones are really too great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy, you are sweeter than \\"Candy!\\"","review":"Mandy Moore is a great 15 year old girl who sings with great talent. Some peaple think she is trying to be like Britney but she is better! The best songs are So Real, Candy What you Want, and Walk Me Home! I think she is perfect for Britney lovers. I bought this beacause my friend told me to listen to samples. I like the cool backround voices such as in So Real when she says,\\" Just can't let ya go.\\" And in Lock me in your Heart when she says,\\" Take me baby.\\" I love this kinda pop and think Mandy makes slow songs sound good! You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath taking!","review":"This is amazing! i have heard many of the newcomers, but she is full of amazing talent! Mandy Moore is an amazing vocalist, with incredible talent. I have purchased her CD single \\"Candy\\" and can't wait to blast this CD in my headphones! I love this CD! Lots of praise well deserved goes out to Mandy Moore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEJA VU? (ROBYN)","review":"When I first heard \\"Candy\\" on the radio, I TRULY thought it was Robyn (the sadly forgotten Swedish singer) pouring her heart out! However, when I heard it was some other girl named \\"Mandy Moore?\\" I was completely disgusted! Then when I heard it again, I could finally hear the difference...and the conclusion is Mandy Moore does have an OK voice for a 15 year old. However, she needs to distinguish herself by not trying too hard to sound deep and contrived (like Christina Aguilera). I am sorry to say that she is not worth the money folks...save it for a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"Ok, what does this little girl know about love? Her CD came out when she was 14, which means she created it at age 13. What could a 13 year-old possibly know about love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy seems cool but not cool enough for this album!","review":"Mandy seems really cool and nice and all from all the interviews and stuff. She's someone that you'll be great friends with and you can't be shy around her but when it comes to singing, I think she's a bit too young for it. Don't get me wrong- the songs on the album are awesome but she's only 15, so her voice is a bit weak. We'll have to see in about a couple years to see if she's good enough for this album. Someone with a stronger set of pipes like Jessica Simpson or Christina Aguilera will do better. It'll be a great gift for a friend and good for playing for parties but it won't be something that'll be on the charts for long. Mandy should come back in a year or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Pop \\"star\\"","review":"What I think of Mandy Moore and her CD is fairly simple; she's the worst pop \\"star\\" in the industry today. She tries to act like Britanny Spears(she even looks like her). Her voice is just another phony, annoying, girly voice that barely even sings to songs like \\"Candy\\" that she didn't even write. Mandy Moore is just another untalented pop female today. It really gets annoying when people like her and Brittany Spears are considered God when they don't do anything but display the most phony, untalented personalities that someone else is paying them to do! Mandy Moore doesn't even deserve this review. SO if you like another pop bimbo with stupid whinning songs than Mandy's the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give her a break? SHE CAN'T SING!","review":"Excuse me... To all you people out there who are saying, \\"Give Mandy a break! She's only 15!\\": the main point here that she can't sing, 15 or not 15. It's so obvious, and even more obvious in the song \\"Quit Breaking my Heart, that her voice has been digitally remastered in the recording studio. This CD isn't good, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggg!","review":"I got this CD for my birthday and I was so excited to listen to it. When all of my guests left i put it on. I listened to every song on it and was in tears after it was over. I hated it so much. I couldn't stand it. All it sounded like was really bad singing that still sounded bad after tons and tons of computer enhancement. BIG PUBLICITY STUNT! She thinks that she will become big like Mariah Carey or someone. I am asking please do not get this CD. You will regret it. I took it back that night and got another CD. I ask you again please do not buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"can I give it a 0 star?","review":"Just 1 advice to all you teeny bop fans out there: Save your money! It's a waste to spend your allowance money on bad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too hot.","review":"Well, first it's important to remember that even though this CD is not so good, Mandy came back later with two new CDs and proved that she could do better. But this CD:Is really just not good. She was fourteen when she recorded some of these songs and it really shows, in fact it more than shows 'cause there are time when she sounds even younger. The songs couldn't be more generic, nothing funky, different, daring...no, these words didn't exist to whoever it was that produced these worn-out tracks.I don't hate it, but if you were to listen to something like Cry (which can be found on her third and newest album, Mandy Moore) and than listen to something like Lock Me in Your Heart (the fifth track on this CD). The better song would be painfully obvious.If you have her other two CDs than it's not completely pointless to buy this. But, if you're just looking for a Mandy Moore CD pick another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why are all the young teens without a life starting to sing about their problems.

Or I will explode!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Queen's Debut Falls Flat","review":"I really never liked this album. I got it last year, and I just never really got into it.1.

I hate it. 3/103.What You Want- What was she thinking? 4/104.Walk Me Home- This is a pretty decent song.... 9/105.Lock Me In Your Heart- COOL! 10/106.

Most of these songs are simmilar to eachother, but thats not bad because they are good. \\"Candy\\" and \\"so real\\" are the best. If you want a young artists Cd i would recomend Britney before this, but i definatley think its worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"First off this CD has a lot of great songs! Candy, I'll admit is sugary-sweet but I love it anyway! My favorite song is Too Young. It has agreat message for teenage girls and is sang wonderfully. This CD has ballads, pop tunes with a twist of r&b, and is just a total over-all great deal. I highly recommend it and rate it 5 stars because it has great songs, with someone who can sing beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak voice, weak songs","review":"I'm under the assumption that all the reviews saying \\"Mandy is better than Britney. . . she's such a great singer\\" were written by teenaged bubblegum blowers who don't know the difference between talent and studio hype. I'm sorry, but neither Britney Spears or Mandy Moore are particularly talented, nor are their songs particularly memorable. After having listened to this CD, I truly would like to know what all the hype is about. This girl has an average voice, and her songs are just plain cheesy and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Save Your Money","review":"Mandy Moore was only fourteen or so when she recorded this album, and her voice hadn't matured yet. So what you get is this sort of whiny sound, but demi-sexual lyrics. The lyrics are okay, but really, her voice ruins it all. Some of her songs are just annoying to listen to, such as \\"Not Too Young\\", \\"Love Shot\\", \\"I Like It\\" ... almost half of the songs on her album seem to be filler songs. If I were you, I'd save my money and get her latest album, \\"Mandy Moore\\". Her voice is not as annoying and her lyrics are even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice songs....poor vocals","review":"mandy has nice songs on her album....but it seems like she's trying too hard to copy the other pop princesses (christina, britney etc) her vocals aren't that great too...but like i said...nice songs...ps-does anyone notice how weird her lips move when she sings in her mtvs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album bites!","review":"Mandy Moore has basically no more talent than anyone else I know, and is just the product of some record label. Save yourself from this junk; buy Macy Gray's new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Britney Spears...and that's saying something!","review":"Ugh! This girl makes Britney Spears sound like Mariah Carey. Her voice is HORRIBLE. Still, the teenies love it, I guess. As said on MTV.com, \\"Critiqing Mandy Moore is a little like critiquing the weather. It's something that HAS to happen, like it or not.\\" Could not have said it better myself. Why junk like this sells is beyond me. All it is really is a childish, little-girl voice singing along to stupid tunes with even stupider lyrics. \\"I'm missin you like candy\\"? What's that all about? If you want young female pop singers who can SING, I reccomend Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera."},{"rating":"1","title":"cloned...again","review":"What is the music industry coming to? The pop industry has mutated into some sort of machine churning out cloned teenaged girls, each able to smile seductively and look good in Tommy Hilfiger. And unfortunately for Mandy, that's about all she can do. Unlike Spears, Moore cannot dance as evidenced by her video \\"Candy\\". And unlike her powerful vocal counterparts Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson, Moore sounds tinny and weak. Her tender age is most likely a factor in her vocal weakness, however, she can barely even manage emoting on her hit pop ditty \\"Candy\\". If she can barely manage fluff, I doubt she can manage anything the likes of Houston or Carey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Annoying","review":"This CD is kind of annoying because her voice is not good at all. She sounds way better on her later albums than on this one. Her voice is very whiny here. The lyrics are also nothing special. This is just like any other pop album of the time but with a worse voice than some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another pop princess wannabe...","review":"And they say the BOY pop market is bad. I love pop, especially 'boy bands' (except BoyZone, 5ive, and this other one they're all OK) it just has to have a bit of an edge. Britney Spears is the only (and Janet Jackson) really talented girl singer out there. Christina Augruleria is just... um... a Britney wanna be. 3LW just needs to leave. They sound like little whiny babies.And now... mandy Moore. A girl singing about stuff she'll never expiereince because she's going to be chased around my thousands of harmonial boys screaming about the size of her chest. And she can't sing. My sisters have both 3LW and Mandy Moore's CD's, unfortanutately; and I have to listent o them. The only decent song is I Wanna Be With You and I think I was only attracted ti the title because of the BSb did a song called I Wanna Be With You but it was completely different and upbeat.

I liked the CD very much and for 15 that is how all girls her age should sound. So I say that everyone stops dissing her I think that she should be congradulated for what she's done. I don't think you should be sending mean reviews. I think you should Send it to the one you like instead of dissing other artists. They give it all they've got to get this far. So send it to a artist you like if thats ok. Thank you and this cd is the bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is AWFUL!","review":"This is possibly the worst CD I have ever heard. First of all, Mandy Moore's voice is completely computerized. Anyone who thinks she realy sounds like that is wrong. Secondly, the songs are so annoying. They are repetitive and fake sounding.

If you want to see what i mean, listen to Telephone(Interlude)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy Moore deserves good reviews","review":"I think Mandy Moore is a great new artist. despite what many people say i think she has a lot of talent. I read almost all the reviews and i thought they were horrible. People were cutting her up so bad. She's a human being, a very talented human being. I am 14 years old, and i wish to persue an acting career, and i am now scared of the reality of all the people out there who look down on celebrities. Mandy's CD is very, very good i love \\"candy\\" and \\"walk me home\\" Mandy, don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. She is a beautiful young artist who im sure will be at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Mandy, ur not there yet...","review":"I listned to Mandy Moore's CD So Real. It was a smart thing to do, too because I figured that before I bought it, I should listen first. The only reason I was going to buy it was b/c I liked Candy. Well, none of her other songs have the umph that Candy has and they are too \\"raw\\" - I feel like not enough time was put into them to make them good. Her voice is alright... it isn't exactly the BEST. Her videos are annoying and her attitude is fake... I know that has nothing to do with the CD, but it gives some background on the artist. Unless her next CD proves me wrong, I don't think she has the ability to be a major celebrity... Sorry Mandy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad","review":"For a new artist like Mandy Moore, this CD is okay but slightly dissapointing. The songs individually sound nice, but the themes are generally the same : like like like and love love love... In addition, the texture of her voice sounds the same in all tracks, like one song repeated over and over. And the album does get really boring after awhile. I initially bought this CD because I was in love with the song \\"Candy\\" when I heard it on TRL. However it's unneccessary to buy the entire CD when there're more worthy places to spend the money, namely Britney Spears's \\"Baby One More Time\\" and Christina Aguilera's self-titled album. These two artists' voices do not sound as shallow as Mandy Moore's. Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.Leaves a bad taste in your mouth.","review":"Britney spears has a diamond album.She's rich.but shes missing something........A VOICE!I HATE it when a untalented kid with blond hair wants to do Pop music.there are sooo many.Naming them would be overwhelming.Now,as if we need another,Mandy morre appears.There is no way I could ever welcome her music with opened arms.I hate her anoying voice.I thought britney spears was bad.wow.the album does,however,have a nice variety of beats.Thats really the only good thing about the CD.Open your eyes,people,and see the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"nope.","review":"Mandy Moore cannot sing. She whines her way through the album in a very Britneyesque fashion and it hurts to listen to just one song. I've heard her live and on the cd, and in both cases I have been blown away by the LACK of talent in this girl. She must have some pretty good connections to the music industry if she's come this far doing so badly. Go listen to Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson if you want to listen to talent. This cd will be stashed right above the Britney Spears album--in my trashcan."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHH! Stop the Madness!","review":"What happened to music these days? It is mind-boggling how an untalented creation of record companies can become a star (if you want to call her that). Nobody can honestly tell me they think she has a great voice. Maybe she can sing OK for a 15 year old, but that is why 15 year olds don't sing professionally! To me Mandy is a puppet controlled by her managers or whatever, and she could never ever be a real strong female performer. I hope she goes away soon...for the sake of the music industry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We got another one!","review":"Yes, we got another pretty pop princess. Only she's...no wait, Mandy Moore is exactly like every other teen star that's out there now. The songs show no signs of orignality, and her voice is less than stellar. If you like these foumulatic singers like Britney and Christina and Jessica, you'll probably like Mandy."},{"rating":"1","title":"yea yea yea we've heard this before","review":"We've heard it before. Can we say Britney Spears 3 years younger? I am the same age as Mandy, and I just can't believe she has had this much publicity...Most of the songs sound the same, and Mandy has NO range in her vocals. She sings all her songs in a VERY high soprano voice, and it almost hurts your ears. I swear. Mandy should stay in school rather than pursue this 'singing' career, cuz judging from her interviews, there's not much up there. She's just another pretty face. If you are in the mood to hear some young female talent, may I suggest Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson. Now those girls can sing, and they don't say 'like' and 'um' every other word."},{"rating":"2","title":"mandys cd is, sweet as candy","review":"mandy moore has a sweet soulful voice and talent that is SO REAL . she is not just a britney spears replica . mandy knows how to sing and can do in in a classy way not a trashy way ,and she proves that in her cd. i recommend this cd to everyone , i love this cd because its something i can pop in and sing along to .mandy moore is on tour with the backstreet boys and if shes good enough for bsb you know she is GREAT !"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM...GREAT ARTIST","review":"In case you all didn't know, I've written SEVERAL reviews for Mandy Moore, but apparently,SOMEBODY hasn't been posting THEM UP! Anyways, what I said in my previous two reviews is mainly this: Mandy Moore is an EXTREMELY talented singer. I mean, the girl knows how to sing beautifully. Whether it's Pop, R&B, or ballads she's singing, her voice is graceful and refreshing. And her album brings a whole new different EDGE to Pop. I must admit, that this is the very first CD in which I've liked all the songs. And out of all the eleven songs, eight of them are my favorite. I just can't take it off my cd player. Mandy's music is very unique and upbeat. And her ballads aren't a bit corny. I mean, I'm really into teen female singers, so it also has to do with a person's taste and choice in music. But I guarantee, if anybody's really into pop music, then they'll absolutely love SO REAL. Try it and see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, For Her First Time","review":"I have to admit, I was kinda disappointed that most of the songs had to do with 'love'. Songs such as 'Quit Breaking My Heart', 'Lock Me In Your Heart', 'Love Shot', and 'Love You For Always' are OK songs, if you like songs having to do with love.However, the best songs, in my opinion, are...So Real, Candy, What You Want, and Not Too Young.Candy is a VERY good song, and this CD comes with the 'Candy' music video. Just put the CD into your comp., and it should automatically start the 'CD Extra'.This CD overall is very good, no bad language, and is well worth the money. With THIS CD, you don't have to keep on skipping DUMB songs, you can just play this CD all the way through.Hope This review was helpful.

I saw her on MTV's Snowed in and she sang to her own recording. All she did was sing a few chords here and there and walk around the dancers while they did some real dancing. She even dances worse than she sings. Brittney had the dance moves and could sing a bit and Christina can sing really well but neeeds some dance lessons. And Mandy can't do either! She is completly fake. Mandy Moore is all cheap luck. All she is, is a little girl who lived in Orlando all her life with a pretty little face in the right place at the right time.

I am not capable of stomaching another artificial singer who doesn't write her/his own songs, has the producers making machine-based and heartless \\"music\\" for them, and then ends up with a multi-platinum album. It's lightweight pop by a teenage girl who happens to sing just like Robyn.(Remember her, no?) It's about time that we, the intelligent teenagers out there, started buying albums by musicians that make music that will actually last more than 5 months, like Tram, Daft Punk, or Vast (if radio would play them). At least the 80's pop scene had Depeche Mode & New Order.But other than that, the album's fanastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.","review":"I must say, Mandy Moore is a half decent singer, but we do have better vocalists here in France.

I will say that Christina Aguilera is by far the most impressive out of the bunch and Jessica Simpson has some potential, but the rest of the bunch, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore and Hoku are a complete waste of time and an embarrassment to music. I know that the only reason Mandy Moore got a record deal is because of everybody's favorite \\"Non-talented Teen Queen,\\" Britney Spears, who paved the way for this crew of blond babes by using her sexy image to sell millions of records. Now there are all of these blond bimbettes with no talent, trying to get on the Britney bandwagon. All I have to say is that Mandy, you better have your fun now, because I do believe that no one will even remember you in another three years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy will be forgotten in about 2 months","review":"It is the year 2015, and me and my son are at a garage sale.

I can't imagine how bad the rest of the songs are on that CD!\\" My son then asks me \\"It is only a dollar, can I buy it anyway just for fun\\" and i say \\"well, it is definitely not worht a dollar, but it will come out of your allowance!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy Moore RULES!","review":"Mandy Moore has the awesomest CD EVER!

It's one of those cd's that you'll find in the thrift store 10 years later. Maybe if Mandy and her manager and whoever else worked on this cd would have put a little more effort in I would be giving this cd 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunatly, They didn't. My favorite song was Candy(although her voice was digitally remastered and all it was good!) My advice for you is to listen to the samples and find out whether it's good for you. If it isn't good try out Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson. If you didn't like it you won't like Briteny Spears so don't even think of getting that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandys year 2004","review":"They say if you have nothing nice to say then dont say it. I wont about this Cd. Although Mandy is very pretty and talented she should get more experience in singing and in a couple years, I say she will be right on the top.

But it is not a good debut album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unoriginal and dissapionting album","review":"When I bought So Real, I debated between it and a few other albums like Macy Gray's and a few others. Foe some reason, I chose Mandy's and I really regreted it. It was a big disappointment, and I said \\"Why couldn't I have bought Macy Gray's CD\\". You see, Mandy's album followed the same routine as every other sucessful girl singer, and Macy Gray's was really original and each song was carefully thought out and made. I think Mandy is doing so poorly as a singer is because her songs are unoriginal and uncreative. Briitney and Christina already have really good pop songs and stuff, so why listen to Mandy's not-so-good pop songs? I don't know reall, but all I can tell you is that this album is uncreative, and the songs just don't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!

Well, yes she is young and is blonde and makes pop music but her CD is just awesome! She sings great tracks which want to make you get up and dance and has a strong voice. She can dance pretty well as well. Britney+Christina=Mandy. You've gotta buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Junk","review":"Well, this album totally pales in comparison to either of Britney Spears' works. It is just trash. That \\"Candy\\" song is annoying and stupid. I mean, hello! She's telling a guy she'll love him forever when she's 15! Doesn't this seem wrong to anyone else? ...This album is [bad] and you won't be sorry you avoided it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Moore Mandy......please!","review":"I really think that this is one of the worst CD's I have ever decided to buy. I have pretty good taste in music, and I can't believe that I had such bad judgement to buy this CD. Her voice sounds like she just ran a marathon. The songwriting is also very very bad. I mean, she can't even carry a tune and she just doesnt have as cool and punchy songs as Christina and Britney. They must have made this CD over night or something, cause it is the most uncreative, boring, and worst written CD's I've ever had. I'm sorry to be so harsh but it's true. I've decided to put the CD in an old microwave and watch the sparks fly (it is pretty cool to watch by the way! )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Britney","review":"Mandy Moore can be summed up in one word - another Britney. But she can't even dance as well or sing as well. (And Britney is bad, so that's a horrible 'compliment') If you want a teenage girl who can actually sing and dance, and is not made of plastic like Britney, just go buy a Christina Aguleira or Jessica Simpson CD. Mandy is the same as Britney - sings weak, dances bad, and will end up made of plastic by the time she is Britney's age. (Britney already is). So, if you want my advice, go for Christina or Jessica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh","review":"I will be blunt... this album is bad beyond bad. mandy has very little talent, and the songs are so bad they seem like they are written by a two year old. sure! Buy this album if you like bad songs and really bad singing on the part of Mandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy Moore Rockz!","review":"I've read alot of those negative comments about this CD and I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this CD, but I took the chance and got it anyways. The people who dissed Mandy Moore, boy you are SO WRONG! This album contains great songs, I mean, not only Candy, but most of the other songs are very upbeat and fresh! If you are NOT into pop/R&B music, you probably won't like Mandy Moore's style. But I suggest all of you to give Mandy a chance, check out her CD and see for yourself! You can't count on all those negative comments to judge Mandy -- CHECK OUT THE CD AND SEE FOR YOURSELF! It's rockz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy is a waste of my time and money.","review":"I cant beleive I was so stupid and musically un-enlightened to buy this CD. I actually thought that Candy was pretty cool, and that i should buy the CD. Big Mistake. So Real was the worst 13 bucks I've ever spent, and I really wish I could have downloaded Candy or something cause it is the only thing that the allbum has going for it. Every thing elase on the album was bad songwriting (and singing) and I hope that Mandy's fake personality and awful singing go away soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy Moore is the disgrace of the pop world","review":"You heard it right, this album just plain bites. Every song on this album is just \\"stuffing\\", which is a really bad song that they think up in one minute to put between the good songs. Well, every song is stuffing in this album. When I first played through the CD, I kept waiting for a really good single to pop out at me (besides Candy), and before I knew it, the CD was over. Not a single song caught my ear, they we're REALLY REALLY LAME AND BORING. Sorry Mandy, but your debut CD is the disgrace of the pop era!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting album but not good in songwriting","review":"Mandy Moore is cute but that isn't saving grace. Candy is a fairly good song but I think that her tone control is lacking. I suggest that she could be a female rapper instead. I would think that she ought to be a hard-core b-girl and fare better as that because she has really instrumental and melodic flow but her tone is off. I suggest that Columbia House ought to move her to def jam because that's what she's best at definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly disappointing CD","review":"OK, I think the music world is already full of girl soloist, and Mandy is NOT a welcome addition. Her CD is a clumsy creation by pop producers, and don't get me started on how annoying and dull her voice is. It is amazing how a dumb, pretty blonde with a bad voice can walk into a record studio and her own CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"THis is One of Those Times Where 'DUMB BLONDE' Applies!","review":"I liked Britney when she came out. I like Christina, Mariah and Jessica but Mandy Moore's CD is the lamest thing I have ever heard. Its a rediculous collection of unorigional music, an insecure teeneybopper who wouldn't know a well produced song if it slugged her in her perfect face! I am not jealous of her- I'm younger than her and still prbably smarter. She should be a cheerleader- her voice is certainly loud enough, or a model. She is pretty. But that voice is obnoxios. My dog could produce a cooler CD than Mandy could. Don't get this CD. Why waste money on some teen who obviously has helium in her head?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy is OK, but her CD isn't","review":"OK, we've seen this way to many times: Pretty girl gets record contract, pretty girl gets a single to launch her career, pretty girl makes a music video of it, pretty girl releases her CD, and pretty girl becomes annoying and overrated. This is Mandy I'm talking about. There is really nothing at all great about Mandy Moore. Her singing is adequate at best, so is her dancing, and her songs are OK, but none of them have hit written all over them. The other girl-pop stars all have something really good about them that makes them special (Britney with her cool songs and moves, and Christina with her awesome voice). Mandy really isn't anything special at all, and her CD is rather boring, nothing we haven't heard before."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY REALLY BITES!!!","review":"OMG I can't stand this girl. I really don't know why either! Just something about her and her songs that just bug the hell outta me! Thats just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"By Mandy Moore's own admission, this was a poor album. A few of the singles are catchy, so save your money and buy them instead of the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start for a young star on the rise...","review":"Mandy's first CD is a wonderful venture for such a young girl.Sure, some of the songs are pretty dorky, but who cares? They sound great...and Mandy has such a cute little voice.I love \\"Lock Me In Your Heart\\", \\"Not Too Young\\", and \\"Quit Breaking My Heart\\". I mean, the other songs are good, but these are just...more my style! Hehe.I definitely recommend this to everyone reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufactured...to the Max","review":"Sorry Mandy, but I really didn't like this CD. It was her first, and her CD's have definitely gotten better as her career progresses, but \\"So Real\\"'s sound definitely didn't come across as very real to me! It was a very manufactured-sounding CD. \\"Candy\\" was a pretty good song, and I liked \\"What You Want\\" a lot, but the rest of the songs either didn't have a good beat to them or the lyrics were less than memorable.If you haven't already purchased this CD, I would say skip it and buy Mandy's new album instead. You'll get a lot better music for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Real - The Real Deal","review":"Really, you should buy this. Anyone can enjoy this album and it's filled with slow meaningful ballads (love you for always) and upbeat songs that you can dance to (so real). It was released two years ago, and Mandy's voice has matured and sounds much better. Remember that Mandy's new album \\"MANDY MOORE\\" will be ... with the new hit single \\"IN MY POCKET.\\" To learn more info on this album, visit... mandy's epic records site ... expect a new side of mandy you've never seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm scared to see what's coming out next.....","review":"Okay,you have got to be kidding! What's next? Sparky the singing spaniel? I bet he'll have more talent then this new generation of \\"no talent\\" powderpuffs. Britney, Jessica, and Mandy? The record industry has this blonde motif going on and I hope that Mandy Moore is the last of them. I have an excellent ear for music and I'm sorry but these girls are singing the blues....on a sour note......EEEEEEEEk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy and her CD are \\"So Un-Real\\"","review":"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with this CD and I was upset I spent my money on it. Mandy is just another pretty face created by greedy music executive. Her singing shows no genuine talent. It seems as though the Music World is trying to crank out a bunch of pop divas and forgets that it is all about the music. Mandy's CD is just another attempt to make a few bucks. Although her \\"hit\\" Candy may be somewhat catchy, it has become overplayed and annoying. Mandy and her music execs should concentrate on the music, and not worry about giving her as much TV time and exposure as they can. In conclusion, I feel that Mandy will only exist on MTV and TRL, and will never be a true musician. My advice- stick with Britney, Christina, and Jessica and forget about this new routine diva."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not 'Candy' to your ears.....","review":"Mandy Moore is well, in one word, Britney. Not a compliment. Mandy can't sing very well, or dance either! If you want some actual great singers, try Christina Aguleira or Jessica Simpson. The have really wonderful voices. Mandy, well, she just sounds like Britney. Britney and Mandy don't have much talent, but Christina and Jessica do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I don't know what to say. I just felt that I had to add to my brothers' and sisters' one star ratings. Commercial trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another overrated, talentless attempt to make money","review":"When I first heard this CD, my first thoughts were, \\"What is this?\\" It was anything but pleasing to my ears and I was extremely happy when it was done. This CD contains nothing more than manufactured songs that aren't sung very well, if in fact you can call that singing. I'll admit she does have some talent, but not enough to be able to have an album and sell it. People just got caught up in the hype and bought this album. My advice is not to buy this album and save your money for some girls who can really sing, like Christina, Jessica, or Britney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather typical, isn't it?","review":"Sometimes, you get tired of a few things. For me, teen-pop is going overboard and this proves the case with Mandy moore's latest CD. Its doesn't quite miss but it doesn't quite hit either. The material is rather typical and some songs seems and sound too similar. She has a somewhat vague potential but this will never work out into anything if only she varies her music. The album isn't quite that bad but it isn't terribly good either"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like bad music and superficial singers, this is 4 U!","review":"Mandy Moore's songs aren't good. I frankly have no respect for her at all, the way she dresses is just one of the reasons. PLUS, all the girl does is dance and lip sync! I mean, can you call that talent! If her songs were OKAY sounding, then MAYBE you could overlook the lack of orginality of the whole CD, but they aren't! It's just fake, and she keeps on adding this fake emphasis to her voice which is not cool. But hey, if you like superficial musicians, knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God this will probably be her last CD","review":"The only reason why mandy popular other than her one catchy tune is because of her looks. Since when do looks confinscate for singing abilty? Her voice is just plain whiny. In a few months, her fans will deny ever being fans. If you want a young, female singer with TALENT, then I suggest both Christina Aguilera, Britney and Jessica Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard better voices on Kareoke night!","review":"Please, please, please save your money on this one. Mandy Moore is a no talent waste. She gets by completely on her looks alone. I rate this album \\"0\\" stars if that is possible. She should spend more time with school work and to make her self better so some day when she needs to earn a living doing something productive she has the skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick and wrong","review":"todays world is sad where a singer with no talent can use her looks and use her record company to hype it up till you see her on every MTV special. the songs have no meanings to them they leave no message and have no point. people who buy this cd need to figure out that what mtv says is not always true and that there is other music in the world that is not played on that channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't music, it is noise!","review":"Mandy Moore has no TRUE talent. I consider this a fact, not an opinion. All you have to do is compare her with others. She has no range (fact) because she can't go both high and low with the same strength of voice. The voice itself is nasal. She might as well be holding her nose. I just can't say enough to express how annoying it is that someone with so little talent can succeed in such a large business. She'd better enjoy it while it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst kind of pop music","review":"This is the kind of album that really hurts legit pop acts. The song Candy is more or less catchy and well written, but the \\"artist\\" is terrible. Mandy can not sing any better than most people I know. Her voice is very weak in the first place- she has a limited range that is very evident during the high parts, and when you add to that the fact that her voice just SOUNDS unappealing, well, the album is a recipe for disaster.But I am sure she won't go away too soon, which is unfortunate since people like Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey at least have vocal talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally filler music","review":"Do you guys know what filler music is? Well, it is the songs that go into a CD with the good songs to get a complete CD. Basically it is the bad stuff between the good songs. I know that almost every CD has \\"filler\\" music, bt Mandy's CD is totally filler music. Candy is the only OK song, but all of the other ones there are jus there to make a complete CD for Candy. If you like Candy, buy the single for god's sakes and save some money. Otherwise you will annoy yourself to death with all of the filler music on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to give it a chance... I really did","review":"I bought Mandy's disc last week. I wanted to find out if she really was as good or bad as people made her out to be. I was sorely disappointed in this cd. Her voice lacks any depth and it seems her back up singers do most of the actual singing. After listening to the first three tracks, I thought the cd might be somewhat decent in terms of song writing, but \\"Quit Breking My Heart\\" and the corny \\"Telephone(Interlude)\\" proved me wrong. Perhaps the disc could have been better if Mandy's singing voice would have been better. It relies on canned beats and synthesizers to do most of the work. Overall, I would not recommend buying this cd if you are looking for a mature listening experience or even a singer with talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs! My favorite song is \\"Not To Young\\"! Mandy Moore is a very talented singer and I hope she goes on to make a lot more CDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan of Pop!","review":"I though like Oh great here we have some other garbage. But after a few days of hearing it on TRL I started to like her and bought the CD. She really impressed me. I mean she's not Backstreet Boys or Britney Spears. You know who she is? She's Mandy Moore with a #1 single Candy. I really recomend it to pop lovers. LA-LA-LA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an all around fun album","review":"I'm a fan of pop music so I decided to pick up a copy of Mandy Moore's \\"So Real\\". That was a really good decision on my part because her album is full of fun songs, the lyrics are clean, and for the most part, the album has a variety of different sounds ranging from R&B style beats to slow ballads. If you are a fan of pop music I recomend this album. A few of the songs I enjoyed most were Candy, What You Want, Lock Me In Your Heart, and Not Too Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Funky, and Cool","review":"Mandy Moore's album includes fun, cool, dance music for anyone, anywhere, at any time. The fast songs are great to dance to and sing along with, the slow ones are also sweet to listen to. The lyrics are well written, and the music is, well, just great! If you're into the pop scene these days, like Britney, Christina, or Jessica, I suggest you get this. If not, you'll probably still like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is SO REAL, and not to mention, SO GOOD!","review":"this cd ROX! my fav songs are So Real, Candy, Walk Me Home, and Not Too Young. I think she has talent, and she isn't a fake like Britney! She (Mandy) can actually SING! i LUV Not Too Young 'cuz when i'm mad at my parents i can blast and it makes me feel better *try it*"},{"rating":"1","title":"where do i start....","review":"Mandy, Mandy, Mandy. I'd say don't quit your day job, but you're not even the legal age to work. Her voice is obviously undeveloped, either that or she just sings really, really bad. The songs on this cd are either a) boring b) annoying c) almost completely computerized or d) all of the above. The whole time I listened to \\"So Real\\" I found myself wishing \\"Baby One More Time\\" was in my discman, and that really says a lot.I don't blame her for trying to cash in on the success of other girl pop acts, but this cd is NOT worth your money. Buy the candy single, and the one for \\"Walk Me Home\\" too- let's just leave it at that, 'kay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next time Mandy","review":"Don't get me wrong...I like Mandy. But in spite of that, I had to give her a one. The songs very very badly written... I don't know how else to say it. So Real came out too prematurely, they didn't take the time to perfect it and find a few new songs as fresh and cool as Candy. Oh and Mandy, hun, you could really use a few voice lessons. But you do have some time to improve, being 15 and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"For one pop fan to another, this album is lame","review":"This is just plain bad music, and shows how record companies won't even take an extra minute to find some good new songs. If you want a real CD, buy Macy Gray and Jessica Simpson's albums, they are awesome. If you like Candy, buy the single, but not this. Oh Yeah, and her voice is absolutely HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good for Christina and Jessica followers","review":"This CD is pretty good (and that is the best I can do since Mandy goes against anything I have ever liked in music). I do not like Britney Spears or Christina Agui--I'm not even going to try to spell that--or Jessica Simpson(I am not saying you shouldn't either--just making a point)but for me to remotely like something of this type, says something for the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GURL IS SWEETER THAN CANDY!","review":"When I first heard the song \\"Candy\\" I thought \\"what a Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears wannabe!\\"But then the song really grew on me!This debut album is so far from being trash(as one reviewer had said) and it deserves to get all the publicity it gets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good First Album. . .","review":"I really like this album although it is totally pop music Mandy Moore has a talent and hopefully her next albums will show more of it.Song Ratings1.So real 3/52.Candy 4.5/53.What You Want 5/54.Walk Me Home 5/55.Lock Me In Your Heart 4/56.Telephone(interlude)1/57.Quit Breaking My Heart 4/58.Let Me Be The One 3.5/59.Not Too Young 4/510.Love Shot 4/511.I Like It 2/512.Love You For Always 3/513.Quit Breaking My Heart (reprise) 5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Save your money on this one folks. I would save it for britney's new album. So Real just tries too hard to copy her and does a really bad job of it too. Not as catchy as Britney's songs, but Mandy did work hard. Maybe her next album will have better song writing I hope because she has potential!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teen Hype","review":"Candy sounds catchy but it has too close a resemblance to Robyn's Show Me Love. The overall album is so-so, and definitely forgettable. The album doesn't sound original or distinctive. Moreover, she's only 15. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP! Singing and performing a teen girl's way to wealth and popularity, who doesn't possess REAL singing talent, doesn't serve a positive model for teenagers out there. It's sabotaging the quality of music entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy should be seen, not heard","review":"OK, I admit that Mandy is pretty good-looking, but her voice, for lack of a better word, was hidious. She is just a face, and I expect her career to end after Candy is retired from TRL. Mandy, if you're reading this, stay in school and forget this joke of a singing career. We'll all forget your name in a month or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Some Work!","review":"Mandy Moore has a good voice and personally I like the song Candy but the rest of them are to muck like all other songs.

But, man, she's HOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"time and place for Mandy Moore","review":"I am enjoying this wave of pop divas! I love to listen to this when I'm doing something fun or energetic. What some people don't realize is that she's not trying to be Joni Mitchell or Sheryl Crow. This is just a person singing about what a 15 year old knows about. If you want something to make you think, try Mitchell or Crow. If you wanna share the good times, give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy is GREAT","review":"Mandy Moore is probably one of my favorite singers. She is absolutely NOT like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera. MUCH MUCH BETTER! The best songs on this sound track is \\"Too Young\\" and \\"I Like It\\". I listen to this CD every chance I get! She rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars isn't good enough....more like TEN!","review":"This is the most AWESOME CD in the world. I mean it.

But the choir that sang,\\"Oooh, I like it.\\" was annoying! )LOVE YOU FOR ALWAYS-9.9Well, that's it. I hope that you enjoy the CD. And don't buy it if you like Korn or heavy metal music. You will NOT like it. 'Bye!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy is a waste of your money","review":"Why oh why did I decide to but Mandy Moore's \\"So Real\\". It was the most boring and uncreative piece of trash I have ever bought. Hardly any of the songs caught my attention. The whole rest of the album was the most boring and stupid music I ever did hear (listen to Telephone(Interlude) and you'll know what I mean. Mandy needs to find a new line of work, casue she's a bad performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm already sick of Mandy","review":"Every single time I decide to watch MTV, I see Mandy Moore trying to get a little more TV time. That's because she is at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to female soloists. She cannot sing (I don't care what people say otherwise, but her voice is sad), and she only appeals to a small small range of female girls. There have been plenty of girl soloists in history who come out with a song and then sell a few albums and then disappear. Don't expect Mandy to be around for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"come back in about 5 years. or 10 even.","review":"a 15-year-old girl with an undeveloped voice, entering the harsh realm of bubble-gum-pop. haha. the lyrics that mandy sings are a little raunchy for a 15-year-old, not to mention forgetable. of course, she doesn't write her own music, has not one ounce of originality in her. just suffers alongside a certain implant-boosting singer of her genere and kinda moans to some words. i'm sorry if i'm coming across as a little harsh, but i think mandy needs to come back when she is a little older. definetly not the next brittany spears, maybe she will become the next celin dion or something. personnaly, i think it would be really cool if she found a bunch of guys who would play guitars for her and became a more children-friendly courtney love. but, if the music world insists...if you persist to this genere of bubble-gum pop, please buy yourself a christina aguilara cd. at least the girl has a voice, even if rubbing people is a little out of hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good...","review":"Wow! I have this CD, all I can say is 'Britney who? ' I luv these songs... Actually, I have 'I Wanna Be With You' not 'So Real', but they're basically the same songs, right?

The only thing that matters in music is, well MUSIC!! She has really cute songs like \\"Candy\\", which is really a great dance song, and the video really goes with the song. \\"So Real\\" has kind of a Millenium beat to it, and is a pretty cool song. Walk me Home is the greatest song on the album. The song has great lyrics, and a great beat to it. The other songs are okay, but these three are my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This cd was good. It would have gotten 5 stars but there weresome very bad songs.

Anyway, this cd was good overall. (edit)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy Moore can't sing","review":"At first when I heard Mandy Moore sing I was like not bad! Then I saw her at the MTV Snowed in thing,and she was awful!She must be lip singing in that video \\"Candy\\" because her live performance was pitiful. Her back up singers took over and she was choking on every other word. When she tries to sing with so called \\"soul\\" her face scruches up and she looks like a prune or someone who can't sing who is trying to get a good sound out using all her strength. Don't be fooled by her lip singing videos people. They need to give her back up singers a album instead of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it a lot","review":"I liked this cd alot. It was good.So what if it was like Britney Spears. Many people like pop music like I do. Hopefully she makes more cds that are good just like this one. I cant wait. This is a cool cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"When I bought this CD, it was only for \\"Candy.\\" But now after listening to it, I like every song. My favorite songs are \\"So Real\\", \\"What You Want\\", \\"Quit Breaking My Heart\\", and \\"Love Shot.\\" I love every other song too. If you like \\"Candy\\" because of the beat and because of Mandy's amazing voice, get this CD! You won't regret it. And to people who think she's a Britney Spears clone--she's not! her voice is stronger and can go higher than Britney's. Go MANDY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Sorry but This is Disgusting!","review":"Now trust me, I looooove Jessica Simpson, Christina, Mariah, and Destiny's Child so I'm 'sposed to like Mandy. right? WRONG! This is pop TRASH! Her voice is hideous and songs so incredibly unorigional. I even like a few Britney songs but Mandy is the most idiotic teeney-bopper I've ever heard in my entire life! Her voice isn't even 'too seewt'. Its just disgusting.The only song that is okay is candy but this is just sad! I usually love all those teeneybopper songs but Mandy is the ditziest blond I've ever seen! PLEASE spare your precious ears and buy another CD like Mariah, Jessica or Christina and even better, Celine Dion- the mother of songs. I know the other reviews speak against me but I'm never wrong when it comes to music. I'm open minded. I mean who can like Christina Aguilera and Frank Sinatra at the same time?

First of all, this is not \\"the greatest cd out there.\\" You honestly think a little girl who can't sing really bad songs will have a good cd? And as for the songs having \\"feelings\\", well remember that other people wrote those feelings for her! They aren't real. And as for people who don't like Mandy not knowing good music when they hear it.. on the contrary. Anyone who gave this CD 5 wouldn't know good music if it bit them in the #$(. Did it occur to you that maybe all these one-star ratings aren't from mean people, but maybe from people who actually realize how bad it is. This cd deserves a one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRRRRRRRIIIIIIBLLLLEEEEE","review":"this cd is soooo bad, i like her knew song wanna be with you. THATS 1 song that she has made. thats pathetic. my cat can sing better then her..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG mistake","review":"I bought this CD thinking there would be songs as good as Candy and as good as Britney's songs. But all the rest were boring. I could tell they tried to make some more good songs, but they were all really bad and so was the singing. Three thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Sweet Failure","review":"I agree with the girl who wanted to put the CD in her microwave! This CD is more fun destroying then listening to people you gotta trust me on this one! Her voice is uncomparable to Christina Aguilera and other great artists, and the tune can only really be enjoyed by people not yet in middle school! Two words.....Buy Macy Gray!!! If you're reading this, sorry Mandy. Look into a career alternative! McDonalds is hiring!!! :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy doesn't have what it takes","review":"I thought this CD might be OK cause Candy is cool, but i was wrong. None of the songs have as much punch as Britney and Christina and none of the songs are as catchy. She is one of the fakest phoniest people on MTV and since her \\"hit\\" single Candy is already off TRL without retiring, I think we won't be seeing her very much longer. I hope that soon people realize that she really can't sing, or dance, or even act like a real person. She doesn't have what it takes to be a real pop singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"Why did I buy that CD? Can you say Britney III? Or can you say EEEEKKK? Candy is O.K., but she should learn to sing, I mean really. I mean take some lessons so your voice doesn't sound like my dad in the morning! Then you can try to write lyrics i.e. hey baby baby baby yeah. HA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Real was very disappointing","review":"When Candy first came out, I had very high hopes for Mandy, and I decided to buy her cd. I have to say that it was very disappointing. I really wish that more work had been put into the songs, and I wish Mandy had taken just a few more voice lessons. I like Mandy, but unfortunately her cd is now stuffed away somewhere and I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. If you are planning on buying So Real, I suggest you save your money for Jessica Simpson or Macy Gray. They both have really great voices and a lot of effort was put into their songs (unlike Mandy's). I am sorry to give only one star, but I really feel that So Real could have been made a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, not another one....","review":"I cannot not like an album consisting of the word heart in 3 different tracks in one time, it shows unoriginality and that's what this is. It's bad enough we have Britney and Britney Ver. 2.0, we don't need another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How on earth did this record get made?","review":"I can't believe that the record companies actually let this album be produced. It is the most dull and uncreative CDs I ever heard! Mandy is embarrasing the pop world with her AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL voice. The songs written for her also bite. I guess these days all it takes is good-looks to get a record deal, because that is all Mandy is...a face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy gives pop a bad name.","review":"Many people make fun of pop divas for having bad voices and pretty faces, but I think Britnry and Christina have exellent voices and deserve more credit. Mandy, on the other hand, gives pop a bad name. Her shrill, disgusting voice adds to the stereoetype that pop divas cannot sing. She really has little to no talent. The songwriting is very bad on her CD. After track 2, the CD pretty much bites, and there are absolutely no other good singles she has to build her career on. Mandy: your CD and your voice are a sick, sick joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HOT LATIN SKA REVIVAL ROCK STEADY ALBUM","review":"This is a well produced live album. If you like UB40, you'll love this disc. The tunes are catchy. The lead singer is great, and the backup band includes a great horn section."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIQUE ENTRY IN THE ICHI SERIES","review":"I have about 20 Zatoichi movies, and this one is quite a departure.It's far darker and grittier than the others. Less humor, but more drama and trauma. But, fear not, the expected carnage; red geysers, flying body parts.Starting with Ichi accidently contributing to a grandmother's death, going through torture and deaths (beatings, sex abuse, suicide) of children, vividly abused prostitutes, to Ichi's torture and subsequent violent revenge, it stands apart.Even the music and editing seem experimental. Very 70's. I suspect actor/director/producer Katsu Shintaro was trying to be Michelangelo Antonioni (BLOW UP) or Richard Lester (HELP!).For Z-collectors, this may be a must. For newcomers, maybe it's a bit harsh.I knocked off a star because although it was a noble departure/experiment, itoften went a bit too far. I look forward to reading others' opinion on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? How did it get derailed?","review":"Dark, gritty, bloody, with sex scenes and torture. Not a very nice film. Which is kind of weird to say about a series of movies filled with death and sword-fighting. But this movie misses any humor - it is as serious as you can get and not become something from PBS.Zatoichi causes the death of a woman by accident and has to find her daughter to try to...well, do what? Ask forgiveness? Make up for her mother's death? This is Zatoichi in the gutter and something that really makes you wonder how the character can even live with himself after aall the events.The film work itself, and the acting, is very good - it is just the subject and plot that makes the viewer feel unclean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too Stable","review":"Unfortunately, the base is not very stable, and you can only use the magnetic letters that go with it.

I was not familiar with Thunderhawk until I found this album by way of a spiritual healer who said that Thunderhawk created this music to help people who suffered PTSD from war find peaceful sleep. The music is beautiful and relaxing, causing me to feel great peace and oneness.

They are always on welfare here on the mainland and on foodstamps on the island. That is why the U.S. should not allow Puerto Rico to become a state. They're too dependent.\\"Little did I know about \\"neo-colonialism\\", nor the economic 'development' in Puerto Rico under the direction of the U.S. government. After reading this book, I felt enlightened and, naturally, rather enraged with history. I have read books on all aspects of my culture, while keeping an eye on the economic and political aspects.Though more and more Puerto Ricans on the island are in favor of statehood, I feel it is important for them to know the history of the island under all the colonial powers (whether Spain or the U.S.).I thank Ronald Fernandez for all the factual information that he gave. He has opened up my eyes.Que viva Puerto Rico!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work","review":"This book is a great daily reader. The author is the Father of Self Improvement.

The chapters, while somewhat lengthy, cover the information slowly and in-depth. Computer geeks like myself can pick up this book and get a solid background in SQL without a class or instruction (though this is a textbook for some local classes).The computer software is a 60 day trial of various SQL tools including SYBase. So many programs were loaded during the typical install it became difficult to decipher which ones were to be used with the text.There were some editing errors in the book, unusual for a 4th edition and a textbook. So far, none have be of any consequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have if you are starting with SQL","review":"I am a professional DBA. I started learning SQL with this book in one of its early revisions and found it to be invaluable. In fact, there is a copy sitting on my desk as I write this. I don't us it much any more, but is is an old friend that I still open once in a while.It is presented in a very instructional format, more like a tutorial than a reference. Well worth the price if you are starting out and want to learn the basics. If you are trying to save a little money, the previous version is a good investment - it's not outdated - and includes most of what this revision does. I think this is probably the best starter book I've come across.Not as useful for advanced DBA's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Although some of these stories may not be politically correct, they do bring up some teaching moments about how the world has changed for the better, and what wrong thinking and behavior is.

It is great and very sharp. I can finish the class project in 1/4 of the time. If you do a lot of cutting buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes coupon cutting a breeze!!!!!","review":"Very sharp blade and precise cutting. The cutter is lightweight but stays in place on the counter while cutting. I like that it has a safety lock for the handle when you are not using it.

The graphics aren't the best but hey no game is perfect, but the gameplay is so awsome! most of these moves are actually possible to do! And i know that alot of you skaters out there are looking for a realalistic skateboarding game well here ya go this game is hard it's a challenge not impossible it's a chalange to do big tricks and doing the big tricks most of em are still possible i highly recomend this game to any one who wants a realaistic skateboarding game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrasher","review":"As a skater, i kind of get tired of tony hawk's crazy unreal skating.This is the perfect solution. The tricks are all real, this is all real skating. Have you ever tryed doing a nice little kickflip fs board, on a handrail in tony hawk? What happens? You're on and your off, no time to enjoy it. But no this game. This game is awesome. I played the demo, and rented the game and absolutly loved it. I was looking for it on ebay for the longest time but i think I'm just going to buy it off here. Great game and i recomend it to everyone skater who is bored of the nonsense of Pro Skater."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the average Sk8ting games.","review":"I first played the demo which was messed up because every time when you fell, you would be on the ground for ever! The controls are very hard to get used to. For example when you do a hardflip you have to hold diagonally up right and press triangle. You might so what? Well while you are holding up right you are skating diagonal so you can't do a hardflip into a grind unless you do it turning. Thats just 1 example. One more I got to tell you is that the skateboards look plane fake.

The characters in this game can't skate, they hardly get any air2. Controls are hard3. I have to unplug the controller to pause the game (pressing start will start some kind of police chase)4. When I wipeout, it shows it in slow motion which is really anoying5. lame soundtrackif u want a good game then get one of the tony hawk pro skater games, whoever chooses this the best over tony hawk, they must have a monkey controling their brain"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a cool game","review":"this is a realistic game with cool names of the charecters and losts of tight tricks. You can ollie on to a building and grind down and cloths line, and also break into a bank, and, my fav. you can trasfer over a subway! Also get new levels in charecter mode. Cool combos like and 180 varialflip into a switch crooked grind and a switch kickflip into a backside grab. You can even wallride over a gap. If you love skating you'll love this game. Oh yeah, you can get sponsered by cool companys and become pro at the end! Its really hard though, but that makes it more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money","review":"Thrasher:Skate and Destroy is trying to be the Gran Turismo of the skateboarding world.

The designers of this game probably thought people would like a game in which you have 2 or 3 attacks and has horrible graphics, and what is with that cheesy voice. On the horrible graphics thing here is an example I walked straght into quicksand thinking it was just some strange dirt There were a few ups to the game thogh like the being able to get earthworm Kim after beating the game on you're as smart as a superhero with 1000 marbles a door will open up behind doc and touch earthworm kim but she is almost as bad as the game itself! Some of the concepts are stupid such as having to ride on a pig when fighting psycrow.

When I rented the game to see what it was like I nearly shed a tear. My favorite cow loving, lawyer fearing worm is back where he should be-on top. Although the graphics are not on par with N64 titles such as Star Wars: Episode I Racer and Donkey Kong 64, I looked past it to find a fantastic action shooter with some nifty puzzles and twisted sense of humor. The mission oriented gameplay also livened things up a bit in Jim's sick noggin.

Bad graphics, bad plot, classic moves and gameplay gone, it was not made by the same comepany who made the first two, and it ended up when it was done to only seem like a good idea! This is another great game that got killed when it was trasfered to 3D (Bubsy 3D anyone?), and just lacks more thought. Now this doesn't mean there's no hope for another Earthworm Jim game, Sonic had a few dissaster's in the 3D world on Saturn until SEGA learned to use the classic moves and feel to a Sonic game, so Jim might have a chance. But I think he should make one more 2D game before entering the 3D world again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is nothing special.","review":"I find the TV show on cartoon network to have a charm and some laughs about it, but these girls work better as a 15 minute show, this movie with it's over-long sound track, very chessey dialoge, and no story really makes it nothing more then a high budget video game. Stay with the cartoon show instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The TV episodes are much better!","review":"OK, the animation has been upgraded some. Fine. But then what? Why create a summary of what the PPG are all about, when there have been several seasons aired on TV already? I don't think the PPG attract a much wider audience just because they make a movie of it. The result is that most fans sit there and yawn while experiencing bad re-makes of scenes already made in the TV episodes. The humor isn't as good in the movie either, the whole impression I get is that the whole concept has been polished by \\"specialists\\" who believe that they know what should appeal to a mainstream audience. However, what I believe appeals to adult PPG fans is the mix of cute little kindergarten girls who beat evil people as bad as one can without getting a PG13 rating, combined with a semi-adult sense of humor. Kind of a version of the South Park humor, but without the edges and the pee&poo jokes. Which is too bad, if you ask me. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to a PPG freak like me","review":"I watched this the day it came out. There are a numberof reasons why it was disappointing to me...1)The Dexter short at the beginning2)Only 1 villain and plot3)Cheezy humor suitable for either a 2-year old ora highly sheltered adult.Also, I got really tired of the constant nighttime scenes....

I love the show, so I thought the movie would be really cool. Well, it turns out that the movie was not that great. It's good because of the Powerpuff Girls' loving attitudes and coolness, but bad because it turns very gloomy, and you get tired of the constant, same ol' fighting over and over again. You're better off watching a new episode, because this movie was very lame. The only villain that was fought was Mojo Jojo. There was action, but it was boring and tiring. The same stuff. Not exciting. The movie was pretty depressing, and there is more color and joy in regular episodes. I prefer watching a 5 episode video of them. So, please take my advice... STAY HOME AND WATCH TV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe we would all be better off without the chemical X...","review":"The Powerpuff Girls show is pretty funny, and I was hoping that the movie would be just as funny.

The fact that this movie is not avaliable in it's original wide screen format is truly disgusting.If you didn't see it in the theater then I guess you can watch this DVD and be blissfully unaware of all the footage you're missing. But to me, it's ruined. I got this DVD as a present, watched it once and was so annoyed by the butchering of the film I haven't watched it since.So, even though I'd give the movie itself five stars I had to give the DVD two.

Clocking in at just over an hour, \\"The Powerpuff Girls Movie\\" plays like an extended episode of the hit cartoon, but with more mayhem and slightly better animation. This is the origin story of the Powerpuff Girls, three children made of sugar, spice, everything nice and Chemical X. But the scheming Mojo Jojo has nasty plans for the girls, who have uncanny superpowers. This is a film that is sure to delight all ages, but will appeal more to preadolescent kids.

I was ready to have a good time, but the powerpuff's let me down. How could this happen?Unfortunately the story is a prequel to the show detailing how the girls came to be and why they decided to fight crime. Why is that bad? Well the audinece it's most likely to see the movie watches the show regularly, and the show has already told us many of these details. So I wound up sitting there waiting for something to surprise me, to offer something that I didn't already know. Not only did that never happen, but I was subjected to 10 minutes of Bubbles crying! Fight scens dragged on and on as did a game of tag. it's like the writers couldn't think of wnything good so they just let the girls run amonk for 6 minutes. The whole movie just felt like an over-long episode.

Everything taht goes along with the powerpuff girls is true. However, the fact that the proffessor takes 100% credit for creating the powerpuff girls is wrong. The proffesor was trying to make A perfect little girl, not super heroes. Mojo is the one who added the checmical X, not the professor. This little fib that the professor takes 100% credit has been going around for too long. It's time that everybody heard the truth.

As a casual observer catching snippets of Power Puff cartoons, I thought they were a little rough but assumed there was some underlying moral to put the violence in context (turns out there isn't). People have vigoriously defended the Power Puff Girls as depicting \\"powerful girls\\". I searched fruitlessly for any inkling of a \\"powerful girl\\" role model and came up empty handed.There is NO redeming value to this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"**** wide-screen, **** powerpuffs, **** craig mccracken","review":"for those who don't know the director and love to send him E-mail on how stupid of a movie this was and the series all together. cartoon network are showing a **gameboy special censor** marthon of this stupid pile of **censor again**.i can not understand why they would make this movie and then make a marthon of this just so kids can grown-up liking volience.I have son named gameboy.he hated how boring it was.

I consider it one of the best cartoons on american television, and even though I'm 18 I absolutely love pretty much any cartoon. That said, I was sorely disappointed by the movie. While the show is fast paced, humorous and light-hearted, I felt the movie was slow and spent far too much time trying to flesh out a very simple back story that anyone who's seen the opening credits of the TV show already knows. The movie was very dark, too, not nearly as colorful and bright as the TV show.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of Mojo Jojo, my favorite villain, who features prominently in this movie and actually lives up to and maybe even surpasses his TV appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie ruined","review":"This movie is really great, but they felt the need to butcher it on the dvd for some reason. I encourage any one who reads this to write a complaint to the WB and ask for a widescreen version of the Powerpuff Girls Movie. If enough people are vocal about it, then they just might actually do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No widescreen! Arrrrgh!","review":"I had every intention of buying this movie, until I found out it was fullscreen only. I suspect many people who would have otherwise bought this DVD will be skipping it because of the lack of widescreen. Sorry, Warner, but you blew it, big-time. Maybe next time you'll give people what they want: a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animation for the Whole Family","review":"This DVD was my first exposure to The Powerpuff Girls and I was pleasantly surprised to find that, with the exception of the music (which is adequate but uninspired), it compares favorably with Warner Brothers' classic cartoons.

Don't miss the interviews with the \\"cast\\"--they're hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so cool!","review":"Okay, I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of the show, but I went with a couple of friends today. One of my frineds is blonde, the other is a red head, and I'm a brunette. We're sometimes called the powerpuff girls. Anywho, we could not stop laughing at this movie. It was so good, which i didn't expect (especially the TAG scene!) The laughing and the giggling, the excessive crying by Bubbles, it was great. Some advice, if you love monkeys- see this movie. There aare a ton of them. Go Mojo Jojo!See this movie! Lots of action, not jsut for kids. And NOT sugar, spice, everything nice, and Chemical X - action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome movie, why full-screen only?","review":"The movie's a joy but I expect to be able to buy movies that perserve the aspect ratio of the film. DTS would have been nice as well. With a running time of only 73 minutes, all of these features could have been put on the same disc.Warner Brothers/AOL/Time Warner - I'm sorry this movie wasn't a big money maker. It really should have done better. But that's no excuse to short shrift DVD buyers. If you can put out an anamorphic widescreen edition, I'll change my rating to 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"marketing at it's worst","review":"it is fairly well known that many fans of the show are not little kids.

No widescreen release at all?There are so many dark and foreboding things said about our society when --despite the fact it was a major motion picture release, despite the fact that it was run in theaters just earlier this very year, and despite the fact that the original feature was produced in widescreen-- there is no widescreen DVD release offered to the viewers that do happen to care very deeply about these things!...deep breath... count to 10...I'm sorry, I'm just too emotionally disturbed to go on and on and on and on at this time.

However, I didn't get the same warm fuzzy feeling from the other Pixar movies like Toy Story or Finding Nemo. I couldn't relate with most of the characters in the movie, especially with Linguini. I'd still keep a copy around the house as reference to a well-put-together-animation movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ratatouille is a Cute Movie","review":"We got this DVD last night and watched it after dinner with our 5 year old. We did not see the movie in the theater and were excited to watch it.... actually we purchased it for christmas... but that didn't last. Our 5 year old was excited about the movie. The movie is very cute but I found myself wandering away from the movie and not caring if I was missing parts of it. Our 5 year old watched it but seemed that he would have been just as happy watching one of our other movies. So... while the movie is cute, and there are scenes that are funny, the story lags in places. I did enjoy the movie, and plan to watch the whole thing next time.... but I wish there was less running around the kitchen and maybe more story. Very cute and kids will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixar magic!","review":"Pixar is amazing, not only does their animation blow away everyone else, the characters and plot lines are deeper and more compelling. Great fun with some real poignant moments. I had to warm up to a movie about a rat, I have this thing about rats, but in a way the movie plays up to this fear and eventually you will find yourself wrapped up in this film. It is funny, wonderful and enchanting. Oh yeah, the kids loved it too! It is the \\"hot\\" film right now, their fav, the INCREDIBLES and NEMO used to hold this estemmed perch. That ole Pixar magic strikes again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ratatouille The Movie on DVD","review":"What can I say! Just a GREAT GREAT MOVIE! I took my four year old daughter to see this movie and we were totally entertained.

Remy could be compared to a black person, a latino, a woman, or a gay or lesbian person. All of these groups have caught well more than their fair share of racism in western civilization. Enough is Enough! Ratatouille also takes a stab at nepotism; the restaurant owner's son didn't have a CLUE!!! Fortunately, Remy was able to channel his spirit and save the whole place. I especially liked the scene where Remy's dad brought the whole family to save the day when the chips were down (and they locked that nasty health inspector in the deep freezer!!) That said, we can learn a lot from our rat friends (as scientists have been doing for years.) Besides, if we blow up the planet like some of the IDIOT POLITICIANS have been threatening to do, the rats will probably be the only ones left, anyhow.

There's a great message here that our children are missing out on sometimes: it takes action to do something great (simply being born and taking up space doesn't make you special).

To me, this shouldn't even be called a DVD, because the ARccOS DVD protection inserts \\"bad sectors\\" all over the DVD, This means that some DVD players, including mine, freeze up periodically during loading, playing, etc, and cause headaches trying to view the movie.

We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months. We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze.

The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive.

The kids will love it, but this ain't adult viewing material, unless you have to watch with the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy","review":"Nice gift for children and/or chefs. Has all the elements of a good story with a updated twist. Puts in a kind word for rats and victims of stereotype. Also puts in a good word for a wonderful recipe, ratatouille."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"If you're looking for a good Disney/Pixar movie to add to your collection then this movie has to be one of them. I know some people think, ewwww a rat that can cook. First off, its only a movie and its animated. It's a very funny movie and if you love animation, then this is a movie to get. Very funny and the extras are very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give \\"Ratatouille\\" the Oscar!","review":"A delightful animated film about gourmet cooking with an ambitious rat the star, showing that even the lowliest creatures can have good taste and creativity - at least in our imaginations. It was fun, dramatic and charming. All ages can enjoy the action and the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"foodie fun","review":"An adorable tale about being able to do whatever you set your mind to, and about being true to yourself and those around you. The kids loved it, thought it was hilarious, and I loved that it reinforced some good morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"This is such a good movie! You can't help but to love a rat who likes to cook, the irony is just awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diamond in the rough","review":"I will admit that I wrote this movie off when it first came to theaters thinking it was just a weird looking movie. Many years and a whole lot of crow later, Ratatouille has turned into one of my favorite Pixar films! Simply put it is a wonderful underdog story. Definitely underRATed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney did it again","review":"I love this movie. It's rather gross to see all the rats fall from the ceiling and pixar makes it so realistic. Great story though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things aren't always as they seem","review":"This is another animated movie with messages for all ages. My 3-year-old granddaughter asked me to watch it with her, but I had to rent the movie to see the whole show.The anthropomorphic rats brought class and value to the restaurant business in the end. The message to pursue dreams...and bring others along...is the stuff of the entrepreneurial spirit.This is a delightful story that causes us to set aside first impressions and consider values for what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids will love","review":"our kids love this movie and watch it over and over again.

Pixar pumps out hit after hit.This combo pack offers great flexability to watch in awesome HD at home and still have a copy to take on the road for the kids to watch.The Blu Ray is stunning in HD. On ign.com they rate the scene when Remy first eyes up Paris as one of Pixars top 10 scene's on Blu Ray.I would have to agree. The colors are vibrant and spot on. I didn't notice any blurring or defects in the quality of the Disc.If you don't have this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack in your collection you are missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Funny and Sweet","review":"This movie is fun for the whole family.

Others have had this problem (see other reviews). Disney should reissue this DVD. Major problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This movie is not really clever and I did not enjoy it. Comedy and stupidity are two very different things, and I would classify Ratatouille as the latter. Definitely would not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)","review":"Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) is an amazing animated movie from the Walt Disney Pictures. The basic storyline is about a rat who has a dream to become a great chef. On his journey to become a great chef he meets the hapless kitchen-boy Linguini and the adventure begins. The animation is fantastic and the music is right on. The new short animated extra is hilarious and also educational at the same time. I love it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and unexpected storyline","review":"Rat movies are always seem to make good storytelling; having previously purchased Flushed Away and Despereaux, I did not know what to expect from this one, since they are all very different plotlines. The movie is fun from the very beginning and can even qualify as an action movie. I found Ratatouille to be an excellent buddy, as well as a great family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"The animation is beautiful, but that's it for this movie. My 10 y.o. daughter wanted to leave the theater in the middle of the movie. The characters and plot are not compelling. The restaraunt critic is funny, but he comes in for about 5 minutes at the end. Save your time and money, or just watch The Icredibles again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow cooking","review":"This film has paper thin stereotyped characters that move slowly and painfully through an adult themed plot. My children of 4 and 6 walked out of the theatre because it was so boring. There are no surprises as you can pretty much guess what is going to happen next. While they may have been attempting the ultimate fish out of water story the simple fact that rats in your kitchen is a disgusting concept. There are a lot of better films for your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, kids wont really get it","review":"This is an adult movie. What I mean by that is children wouldnt understand the point of this film. I mean come on, culinary art? Why would that even interest kids? It didnt even interest me and I'm 24. It wasn't funny or cute it was just odd. Of course the computer work on this is fantastic, but that is where it stops. I do not understand why so many people love this film. I was utterly bored and dissinterested in it from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!!","review":"I love this movie! It is one of my most favorite animated movies, perhaps top of the list. The story telling is so charming! Makes me happy every time I see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is just as good as we thought it would be","review":"We've been waiting for a long time to see this movie on DVD.My family of three generations sat together to watch it, and we loved it all.It is just as good as we thought it would be.So much fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"I agree with the main statement of 'if you're able to get over your initial gag reflexes of rats cooking then this is the movie for you.' I think I was doing good until climax of the film and there is literally hundreds or thousands of rats cooking and what not. At that point, I couldn't stop shaking my head. But as far as Remy and his non-cooking companion, I found the duo charming. Pixar is the king of what they do and for that I will always be a returning viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine film I would feel safe showing children","review":"First understand that I am a lover of classic disney films such as: Peter Pan, Jungle Book, Old Yeller, Snow White, Bambi, and many others. I am probably more sceptical of recent Disney releases than most of my cohorts, so this movie had to earn 4 stars from me. It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).My version of this movie comes with two short films. One is the history of the rat, which is actually very educational and informative. The other short is moderately entertaining but nothing I feel deserves more than a passing comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show...if you can handle rodents.","review":"Once you get over the fact that rats have taken over the kitchen, this is a highly enjoyable and splendidly written movie. It might be going to far to compare this movie to a good meal, but the analogy works: lots of familiar ingredients, a few unexpected suprises, and overall the viewer is left completely satisfied. Just the right amount of sweetness in the dessert. Odds are good that you will like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Bought for my niece, because we couldn't find it in store.

It was hard getting past rats cooking (despite story line addressing the cleanliness issue) but the story has heart, the animation is typical Brad Bird spectacular (he tells story through animated movement of his characters). Great for kids and adults alike and if you enjoy food/cooking, this one will really be great for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Very good movie. Didnt want to see it at first, because i thought it was a kids movie. but when i saw it i got sucked in and really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joy of Cooking!","review":"I love films about the bliss of life, and food films fall in that category. But the film has to explore the reason why of it all as well. Ratatouille gave me everything I enjoy about food films and a bit more. Bliss is hard to find in a life time ~it just is. And if you find it, it usually comes wrapped in a package marked ~ Do it with all your heart! The characters in this animation reach with all their hearts ~ Even when they aren't completely sure what they're reaching for, they reach all the same. I place Ratatouille right up there with Babette's Feast. When you are born to cook, you are born to cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart warming movie","review":"MY children loved the movie at the theatre, and now they can love it in the comfort of home.

I also bought \\"Cars\\", which was also a hoot. I'm glad this movie won a Global award, and would also deserve to win an Oscar. That would make an excellent menu on the table. \\"Of course you're hungry; you didn't buy this movie!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for the whole family","review":"If you loved all of the previous Pixar releases, add this one to the list.

Great kids' movie and great for the whole family. would reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ratatouille [Blu-ray]","review":"I love this show! 1st I watched it w/ my nieces & friend's kids (they LOVE it btw ;) but then, I've found myself watching it w/o them!

This show IMO, is different from ALL other kids shows in that the main theme is \\"leveling\\" w/ kids rather than trying to tell them that they can b/do something that they can't ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Based on the ads, I'd expected this film to focus on the rat character. Instead, after a good start, it focused heavily on the 'human' characters, thereby losing much of its charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PIXAR MOVIE YET!","review":"I thought Monsters Inc. was spectacular, but this movie really put me over the edge. I was blown away and my expectations were exceeded. The depth of personality and expression presented by all the characters is amazing and captivating. It really sucks you in to the movie. I love the CG work, just amazing candy to the eye. I would watch this movie again and again. The cuteness of Remy, Emile, and Linguini is hard to resist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rataouille Has Charm, But It Is'nt Enough","review":"Ratatouille is the Pixar movie which I thought would bring back the magic of Pixar which the studio seems to have lost after Cars, which I consider their worst film yet. Ratatouille has its moments of humor, emotion and beautiful visuals, but the film still lacks. The characters just arent engrossing enough. Perhaps the fact that Pixar tries to mix two different worlds of characters causes this confusion. Not only is the film giving us a glimse of the world of hungry rodents, but we also get a look at the human world. This leaves the characters litte time to develop and leaves things hanging out there with no real closure. Overall a poor attempt by Pixar, yet it's something which is worth watching once, but worth buying? I dont think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pic, but story is terrible","review":"1080p pic is great, however this movie could not keep my full attention nor my wife and our 3 year old daughter.

The best I have seen in a long time","review":"This was another win for Disney Pixar. The one thing that must be said is that this film is family safe for all. The trendy hollywood thing to do these days to be cute is to sneak adult humour into childrens films ... none of that here. This makes Ratatoulle not just a entertaining film, but a great family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie, great price","review":"As with most animated films, this really is more for adults than children. Why do they need to include a scene of a woman trying to shoot her man and then after the struggle for the gun they kiss?! It wasn't needed. Other than that and one swearing scene from the bad guy head chef, it's a lot of fun. Defintely purchase w/ Amazon. Barnes and Noble prices (in store) are twice as much.

The fact that it was developed in South Africa might mean that maybe it's designed for people without much in the way of a fuel supply. It uses 8-10 charcoal briquets which is not a lot of fire. I tried to cook a couple of 1-1/2-inch-thick swordfish steaks and some vegetables. The veggies kept sliding off the nonstick grilling plate, which was annoying. I tried it with and without the dome (cover). I finally gave up after an hour (including a half hour to let the briquets get hot per the instructions) and took everything into the house and finished it on the stove.

Their response was that they do not have these parts available, and the rep suggested that I go to a hardware or home improvement store and buy some \\"bump-its\\" or levelling things.

I don't like that at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great paper cutter","review":"I have bought many cheap paper trimmers telling myself that I don't use one enough to justify a more expensive one. Every one of the cheap trimmers that I have purchased have been a disappointment and more importantly have not done a very good job of cutting paper. I finally said to myself enough and did some research and tried a number of different trimmers and, for the money, this one is everything you need in a paper trimmer. It does a great job of cutting one or more pages and does an equally good job no matter if the paper is really thin newsprint or thick card stock. My only regret is that I didn't just buy this one in the first place and save myself all of the money I spent on the less expensive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SQUARE","review":"I needed to replace a paper cutter which lasted 25+ years. I should have read the three star review which mention it doesn't cut straight. This is a nice looking and heavy made paper cutter. My first problem was it's top heavy, when you lift the cutting arm it the whole paper cutter tips back. So you have to hold the front bed of the paper cutter down as you lift the arm. Ok but it does cut so no deal breaker . After using for a few days I notice it wasn't cutting square. I stuck a metal square on it and the top edge where you place the edge of the paper against isn't even straight. The top edge has a bow in it at the 2 inch mark. Placing the metal square its off 3/16 of an inch across the 12\\" top edge. Another poorly made in China to Swingline specifications piece of of junk.. No quality control. Returning right now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Home Paper Cutter","review":"Bought this for my home office. Granted it's probably considered old fashioned, but it works great!

I also like the fact that it's small enough to fit on the desk, for quick access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every cut is crooked","review":"This was a huge waste of money. Regardless of if the paper is sitting flush against the top straight edge, the paper cuts unevenly (at a slant) with the bottom portion longer than the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great paper cutter","review":"After a lot of research into various types of paper cutters, I decided on this one based on previous reviews and the price. I was in the market for a paper cutter to make straight cuts for wedding invitations. This paper cutter could only cut the heavy cardstock I used if I stacked no more than two pages, but it was a clean cut each time.The two page stacks may not seem like much, but given the thickness of the paper used, I could not imagine anything short of a commercial paper cutter able to do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible setup","review":"I am both a teacher and scrapbooker, and have used many cutters in my time. This cutter has a terrible setup! Instead of inches marked throughout, it has cm for the top quarter of the cutter, then inches begin. It makes it difficult to line anything up for straight cuts. Also, The arm of the cutter is a little too far from the base. If you aren't careful, it has the tendency to bend cardstock on the edges when you cut it. I'm currently trying to return mine, and would not recommend it for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a lemon","review":"The assembly at the top of the cutter was not straight, forcing me to try and hold the paper still with my hand while using the printed guides. Also, the blade did not cut the full 15\\". About 13.5\\" into the cut and it started to bend and mangle the paper. Maybe I got a bad one, but I'm not trying another one to find out. For the record I was cutting single sheets of photo paper -- Canson Baryta Photographique. Perhaps the 15\\" blade would be more effective on thinner paper, but that's not why I needed a cutter.Two stars because the thing actually cuts very nicely -- just not square to the brace or the full 15 inches. Obviously I sent mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts square and cleanly","review":"I'm very happy with this paper cutter. I sent the first one back because the way it was assembled, paper was not cutting square even though it was lined up with the guides. The second one they sent me is great - check yours out when you get it. The blade is sharp and cuts through 2 layers of paperboard or a few pieces of cardstock cleanly. The 'table' is divided by 2 sets of grid guidelines, one in inches and one in metric - I would like it better if it just had one or the other so a paper could be aligned top to bottom on one guideline. Aside from that, I really find this to be a great cutter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Trimmer","review":"Great deal....good price and delivered fast and in tact. Works like a charm. Would recommend to all teachers and households that need a pro trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't fit under some doors","review":"What could there be about a rubber door stop that wouldn't work? Well, the thin end of this one is too thick to go under some doors. Without at least a bit of it already underneath the door, the door will just push it out of the way because it's not wedged under the door. Actually, the picture shows that it is thick, but I didn't pay enough attention before ordering. At $9, I will probably return it. I bought it for use when traveling for added security at night, but I'm afraid the door clearances will be too small for this door stop to be useable with the door closed. If you have enough clearance to get it started under the door (open or closed), it would probably work fine. It seems to be heavy rubber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alright, almost as good as Gotti","review":"This is a good picture alright, Although I would have preferedto have done the casting my self, However I disagree with Michael Cellio regarding Abe Vigoda from the godfather who's playing Big Paul Castellano, I think he's the perfect guy for the role. But Tom Sizemore and Nicholas Turturro could have a number of replacers though. But I am a big fan of mob movies and cant judge this picture to hard, my final words are: \\"It was good but not as good as Gotti with Armand Assante\\".

Also some of the jokes might be refered to as immature or sophmoric, which of course I love.Anyway, there is an overall intellectual concept to this movie which is all illustrated by the paintings of Sandow Birk: War is stupid!!! and this parody is a magnificent way of illustrating this message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I couldn't even finish this book it was so bad. I was looking for an in-depth view of someone's experiences at MBA school. Instead, it was a novel so loosely based on fact that it's gives you a totally inaccurate view of the MBA. It states that Tuck gets 10,000+ applications for 200 places and this is false. It states that the Harvard MBA is offered in an 18 month accelerated format starting in January. This is totally false.Judged as a purely fictional account bearing no resemblance to reality and judged as a work of fantasy, it also falls terribly short. It's written in the oh-my-gosh-as-if style that you would expect from a 15 year old girl circa the mid 1990's and is so annoying that it's difficult to read. It's painful reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insignificant and Ridiculous","review":"This is perhaps the most insignificant and ridiculous book I have ever read.

I fell in love with Maria, even though she was so different from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can finish reading it in 11 minutes","review":"Someone had recommended this book to me because I had lived in Geneva. It felt more like an essay for a creative writing course than a novel. I can't remember the last time I've read something so superficial.Neither the setting nor the characters had enough texture to be credible or even compelling. The setting felt like any city on a lake. If Geneva was word searched and replaced with Chicago or Toronto, no one would notice. The characters are just as generic. Coelho describes the love interest as \\"handsome and successful\\" and the people at a party as \\"smart and charming.\\" They lack the subtle details that make them come alive. Their insights into romance were weak.The least believable part of the book was the postscript where the author claims to have visited Switzerland on a book tour and met a few people who inspired the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Coelho's books by far (surpasses The Alchemist)","review":"I am an avid reader of Paulo Coelho; his books are enlightening and inspirational to say the least. Eleven Minutes is by FAR the best one he has written thus far. This passionate book can be explicit at times, only because it has to be if it intends to effectively examine love, sex and relationships. Mainly, it explores the nature of love and lust, and the important difference between the two. While reading Eleven Minutes, I found myself laughing and crying with each passing moment. At the very last page, I felt completely fufilled and wise- as though everything I needed to know about love was expressed or at the very least touched upon in this book. READ THIS BOOK if you are interested in knowing what true love really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Summer Reading!","review":"Its the most easy-to-gasp and the simplest among those many feel-good books that I've read. Definitely a must read! Anyone of any age can relate. This book is about a young girl from a Brazilian village Maria, Maria's first innocent brushed with love leave her heart-broken, convincing her at a tender age that \\"love is a terrible thing that will make you suffer.\\" When a chance meeting in Rio takes her to Geneva, she dreams of finding fame and fortune. Instead, she ends up working as a prostitute. Drifting farther and farther away from love, she develops a fascination with sex. But her despairing view of love will be put to the test when she meets a handsome young painter and must choose between pursuing a path of darkness - sexual pleasure for its own sake - or risking everything to find her own \\"inner light\\" and the possibility of a \\"sacred\\" sex in the context of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"feels like he's writing for young adults","review":"This is my second book by Paulo Coelho. I first read the Alchemist and I bought this book before I realized it was the same author. Based on reading these two books, I have to say that this guy writes as though his audience is young adults. The writing is flat and simplistic. If you like reading YA books, then you might like this. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"No intelectual challenge","review":"I was very disappointed, this being the first and probably the last book by Coelho that I am trying.Although I can understand where his success comes from, this is not my cup of tea.I like books that challenge the intellect, that leave you thinking long afterwards.This book is like a telenovella subject, not a very inspired or inspiring one.But, if you are looking for a fast read,some romance spiced with some sex scenes and sex philosophy, this is the book for you.The only thing that saves it from being a total bore are some scarce humoristical scenes and observations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced and wasteful","review":"As someone who has been a Paulo Coelho fan, this book is a disappointment. If you do like Paulo's books, please avoid this particular one.Once you read the book, you get the feeling that the story is quite pointless. Yeah, sure it illuminates the life of a prostitute and circumstances surrounding the same (with some restraint I might add) but fails to deliver any insight into life or its meaning.Paulo's strength - his ability to take the 'helicopter' view into all things in life is tested and does not stand up. While he does make an effort to look for \\"sacred sex\\" and introduces S&M;, it is quite apparent that he is not convinced himself.In a sense, you are left with the sensation of seeing a very expensive car grind to a halt at a cheap motel where the protagonists step out for their eleven minutes.Avoid this novel - it is a series of disconnected events which don't really mean much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"Eleven Minutes is not my favorite Paulo Coelho book. This is the story about a girl who fell into prostitution because she was poor and vulnerable and like everyone else in the world, looking for a better life. She fell into the trap.

Coelho, writes about a 11 years old girl's sex life as if he were a girl himself! Then when this Maria is only 15, she discovers what Masturbation means and the way she does it and the way she feels when she masturbates, is vivibly described by Coelho - the writer I admired a lot.It's not a child pornography novel - that's what I like to think about it - but it surely must be when the sex life of an 11 and 15 yrs old girl is so vividly described.I definitely quit reading \\"Eleven minutes\\" for the reasons above and I was so grateful I have borrowed this book from the library and not spend my hard-earned money in a rude novel like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I cannot comprehend what is great about this author or his books.

Having said all that, the mediocrity of this album is SHOCKING, to the say the least. This sounds like fusion for fusion's sake. The different instruments and melodies just don't blend well. Parts of this album are downright cacophonic. Listening to this album is akin to eating vanilla ice-cream topped with chopped garlic. Recycling is good for the environment, but someone should tell L.Subramaniam that recycling music is not only boring, but is also unethical.

I had purchased a very expensive hair brush a couple of years ago that was touted as being gentle, but I like this one better. I have shoulder-length fine and thin hair, and this hair brush glides right through with ease. My scalp has always been very tender, and I'm getting used to the feeling of it -- it's not as soft as I had hoped, but I still like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on long hair and sensitive heads...","review":"After trying dozens of brushes, this is the only one that detangles, is gentle on the scalp, and lasts for years.

If you are in the mood for someone who knows how to push alot of valves in not a lot of time, then this CD is perfect for you. It is full of it!

The tone is un-focused and at times comes accross as un-melodic. What's with the breaks in the line in The Swan?? Changing octave mid-phrase is ridiculous. Many of the pieces simply don't stand up to scrutiny.Through history there aren't many tuba players I'd want to hear play a recital; Fletcher, Bobo and Jacobs come to mind.Consider what the most recent recording generation of tubists are putting out and it's another Solar System. Do yourself a favour and check out Mssrs Szentpali, Baadsvic, Sheridan and-so-on to see where the tuba's at these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"virtuoso\\"? I think not.","review":"While Kevin may be able to play most of the notes, there is very little music in those notes. Kevin needs to take a few music lessons from Pat Sheridan or Sam Pilafian. Music is an ART form, not a TECHNICAL form. Just because you can play the notes doesn't make you a \\"virtuoso\\".Spend your money on a Jim Self, Pat Sheridan, Sam Pilifian or ystein Baadsvik CD and listen to some true Master Virtousos. Not a wannabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtuoso Tuba, Kevin Morgan","review":"In comparison to the other professional tubists available on CD, this horrible waste of effort and money. Runs are not clear and precise, tone is lacking. Get something worthy of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-grade junk","review":"I wasn't expecting high literature when I got this book, but I still found it trashy and disappointing.The biggest problem with this novel is the battles. They're all one-sided, over very quickly, repetitive, and uninteresting. The Rebels always inflict massive damage while taking minimal losses, and every enemy is always in fear of them.What potential there is for moral relativism in having the main character rule harshly is squandered by having everyone else act much, much, worse. And don't even get me started on the far-right politics of it.Still, this book can be good for passing a bit of time if you can turn off your brain and just let it flow. Otherwise, don't bother picking it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"a light and easy summer read that i definitely reccomend!","review":"i read this book second time around this summer, and fell in love with it again. its great to read a book that has both side, but actually written by a male and a female, and not by one author trying to figure out how each sex would react. for someone that is into a deep and heavy read then its not for you, i think its a light hearted read and one that will make u smile, and relate to yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story!","review":"I voed this book...I just felt like amy, and I feel that Jack is as well described....I just red it in 24 hours...and it was amazing!...I liked everyone of the chapters...nothing to do with Bridget Jones...this is ( I hope) real life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic outlook of the dating scene in the 90s!","review":"Jack the lad meets Johnny Depp is Jack Rossiter.

The \\"he said/she said\\" style keeps you always guessing how the other person will react. We've all been in \\"Jack and Amy\\" situations before, and this reminds us that there is a happy ending out there somewhere waiting for each of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to read two sides of the same story!!!!","review":"I picked up this book on a wim in a book shop, and i have to say i thought it was worth the money!!! It was a really good to be able to read both characters thoughts and feelings on the same event and it made a welcome event from all the heavy emotional books i had been reading. I was itching for them to \\"Come together\\" in the end. Proves love isn't all plain sailing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap thrills, no twists","review":"This was a page turner.

Also the book jacket is ghastly, but I did get to the last page, so all in all not terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A creative approach to modern relationship","review":"I liked the idea of alternating narrators with the passing of each chapter. This is a good summer read and unfortunately nothing more. If you have nothing else better to do and would like to have a an occasional smile and smirk then read this book. However, if you are looking for something to remember, this is not your best choice. The characters are a bit shallow, the plot is mediocre and the relationship described is nothing out of the ordinary, just like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"He said/She said","review":"There are few books that are written with both the male and female point of view. Well, at least not a book as honest as this one. It was interesting to read about a man like Jack. Is he a typical male? He certainly seemed to be. And I could definitely relate to poor Amy. Were there mixed signals in their relationship? There certainly were. There were so many realistic views on dating in a big city that I felt as though the book was written about my life. Single life isn't easy, is it? A lot of people would agree with me on this one. Men and women should definitely read this entertaining and touching novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dot to dot drivelling","review":"The kindest thing you can say about this book is that it's probably reads better if English isn't your first language. The vision of British youth this presents makes me cringe... and there's going to be a sequel??!! badly written, unadventurously plotted, maladroitly constructed: slack, in a word."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't see yourself in this book, you're a hermit","review":"I bought this because I was sick of being hooked on Terry Pratchett, Colin Dexter, John Grisham so I went for something off the wall.

A great book about a relationship, but the only bad thing was that it was pretty predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Love Story","review":"This book was such a fun read! It was a light and very sweet love story. The characters were very believable. They were both flawed. I loved the \\"he said/she said\\" aspect of the book. It was nice, for once, to hear the man's thoughts on love and commitment. Also, the journey he made from not being ready to commit to falling in love was very endearing and insightful. Their thoughts on the situations were hilarious. This pair of writers should definatley think about collaborating again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of many...","review":"I picked this book up a few years ago, based only on the information given on the back cover. Definately one of the best purchases I have ever made. This book was my introduction to the \\"chicklet\\" genre and I have never looked back. I laughed out loud at the dialouge between the two main characters...so typical, but so REAL. It is written by one male author and one female author...he writing the main male character chapters and she picking up where he left off, from the female point of view.(The authors got married after writing this book) It's true to life dialouge goes in to the thoughts and lives of both characters on their journey into courtship. Hilarious at times, and maddening at others, this book is a true find. Perfect read for females that have \\"had it\\" with men, and equally as perfect for them.

We are then thrown headlong into some nonsensical story about some lottery ticket and metal-head hijinx. To get a good feel for this movie, think \\"Jackass\\" but low brow.

I've owned the \\"Rite of Strings\\" CD for a couple of years and find it quite unique and enjoyable. The music is very complex both in composition and execution. That is, you wonder how 3 guys can produce all this complex sound. I recently purchased this DVD and have watched it with great delight several times. Seeing the music performed is quite illuminating. I have a new, great appreaciation for Al DiMeola! For all you guitarists, this is a must-see performance! His Ovation guitar has the most beautiful, clear, bright sound and his playing is unbelievable. The sound quality of the DVD is fantastic and the camera work contributes significantly. In fact, I would rate the camera work on this DVD at the top of my list. You are treated to up close fingerwork as well as shots showing the interplay between the performers. This performance DVD will blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rite Of Strings Live !!!","review":"Great show at montreux featuring music from the Rite Of Strings which was an excellent album in my opinion.

Aside from his technical wizardry, Kottke is also a master song or \\"tune\\" writer. His albums are always full of energy and never dull. You'll find yourself humming a melody from one of his tunes all day long. This is a nice return to just raw guitar with no effects, overdubs, other instruments etc. I love his vocal tracks and would have liked one or two here but weve got plenty of albums with vocals. Check out his reworking of 3/4 North (originally from A Shout Towards Noon) - it will leave you speachless.Ive seen him live 4 or 5 times now and he is actually better live than on record. His odd sense of humor, self-effacing personality and gift for telling some of the most bizarre and hilarious stories make his shows unforgettable.Other favorite albums from Kottke:- 6 & 12 String Guitar- My Fathers Face- A Shout Towards NoonI would recommend, however, buying all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leo's Back to Basics Masterpiece","review":"I've been buying Leo Kottke albums since the early 70's and have been disappointed by some of his experimental works.

(See other reviewer's comment about poor performance in floor tile though; I haven't tried it but might be a warning to heed.) A reciprocating saw would have broken tiles or pulled them off the wall.I hate doing anything with pre-exiting tile; Glad to have this bit and tool in the arsenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"only good for thin tiles","review":"Be warned. This cutting bit is good at cutting only thin ceramic tiles such as ceramic wall or counter tiles, not the typical thicker floor tiles. The cutting metallurgy appears to be a harden steel-alloy instead of embedded diamond or silicon-carbide. Consequently, if you use it to cut many tiles, the bit won't last. As the quality of the metallurgy is inferior than those made with molydenum-vanadium alloy, this bit is priced accordingly less. Note the packaging does not tout any claims as to special alloy. Unless your ceramic tiles are soft, you may find yourself buying several cutting bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The London Cello Sound","review":"I bought the London Viola Sound and London Violin Sound a while ago, and I've found both of them phenomenal.

The music is awsome. Techno meets Metal. A cross between MINISTRY and FRONTLINE ASSEMBLY. If you're mad at humanity buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Sax Ballad CD","review":"Ordinarily, gathering an artist's ballads on a single CD produces a bland repitition. But with the Ben Webster, who became a Total Master of the tenor sax ballad, you end up with a masterpiece. The numbers were carefully selected and sequenced from 5 great Verve CDs. They seem to all be from the most recent meticulously remastered versions, revealing every nuance of Ben's delicate phrasing. An absolute jewel that should appeal to those who don't even ordinarily care for jazz. For those who do, I strongly recommend, as a companion,Ben Webster's Finest Hourfor a nice survey of Ben's entire career with only one redundant tune from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"item discontenued buy the mk2 or the mix up will cost you 50$","review":"i initialy ordered the novation 25 SL2 because that one was more $$ thinking it was the better one, but it was dicontenued so they sent me the mk2 which amazon had listed for about 50$$ less than 399.99$$ i thought instead of sending it back and reperchusing the mk2 they would just reinbers me the difrance and call it that. but neither amazon or anyone stood up and took responsability for the price difrance. they should at least be on the same page but their are not but they kude at least take down the add, but havent yet. its my understanding that amazon should not be selling either of these items for the price that they are listed when in fact is false. so just beware and buy the mk2 or you gona loose 50$ like i did..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another effort to get us to buy the same songs over and over","review":"Gee, this cd has five songs on it that were already released on Decade of Decadance, a \\"re-mix\\" of Hooligan's Holiday, and live version of Dr. Feelgood.

Camera takes a small bite and rejects the still neaarly full batteries) you are forced to use the recarge type.

Her changing levels of tone and speed keep the dialogue realistic, and Austen's beautiful character descriptions are only heightened. There is one 9-17 minute excerpt from each of Jane's major works: P&P, S&S, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, Emma. Between each of the readings are lovely samples of music from the Victorian era. A lovely mix of music and literature. When the music begins, one may envision the lovers discussed in the previous reading dancing to the tune in a candlelit ballroom, right out of the book. Since it is only one disc, and it is so varied in style (from the snakelike scene between Elizabeth Bennett and Lady Catherine to the romance between Anne and Frederick), it is great to keep in the car for a short trip, or for a quick fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best walkman I've ever owned or used.","review":"I love the am/fm tuner with digital display and tuning capabilities.

Once folded up (4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long) it fits very nicely under my couch.It is fairly easy to fold up/unfold but it could be easier which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. There are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked, 2 curved handle bars need to be removed (simple twist knobs), and one stabilizer bar undone (simple twist knob) to fold this unit down.

For those of us who miss the lovesick ballads of Crowded house songs such as Second Chance and Someone will strike a heart-chord.

There was NO mystery in this book. There was no real direction to the story. It seems that Hautman added numerous filler stories because his main concept was so weak. The characters were barely believable and incredibly stupid. The main character was so pathetic. Hautman has no idea how to write a woman's character. This story seems to have been written for an adult market in a child-like fashion. It had no twists or turns in the plot and the ending just stopped. You know when you read a really good novel and you have that feeling of contentment, like you were glad you took the time to read the book. Well, after reading \\"THE PROP\\", I felt like I wasted my time. The book got tossed it into the trash where it belonged. Reading should be fun and entertaining - this book didn't come close to being fun or entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight From the Heart","review":"Although this film is recorded in Hindi with English subtitles, it was easy to follow the story line.

I'd highly recommend this film to any fan of Bollywood"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUBTITLES","review":"Ok, first off... I have seen bits of this movie before and was finally sold when I saw the song \\"Dholi Taro Dhol Baaje\\" video on Youtube. So I ordered the DVD and when I sat down to watch the DVD... THE SUBTITLES WERE WAAAAAAY OFF. Lyrics from songs overlapped with the characters lines, the subtitles gave away the punch line before the characters said them or the dramatic music marked them... Its so sad, I've read others reviews about the DVD and everyone seems fine with their copy, did I get a defect? Well, maybe amazon can help me out with it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Bollywood fare but English voice-over does not work.","review":"The movie is typical Bollywood fare. It is enjoyable, but nothing special.My only complaint is that you cannot play the movie in the English version--even though it is a choice offered in the setup. However, the English subtitles do work so English speakers can understand the movie.(Of course, the songs are not in English or with English subtitles--as I expected. No disappointment there. Songs don't translate very well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I have a shelf full of Hindi romances, and this is the only one I could not sit through to the end. The acting is wooden, the music is mediocre and the plot is the worst masala of melodramatic plot twists I have ever seen. Everything is just stiff and unimaginative, in every aspect.I've seen Ash act well in other films, so let's blame the director for this mess. (I've never seen Salman in anything I liked, so we'll blame him for that.)There are so many other great Hindi romance films to choose from, I wouldn't avise wasting your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon didn't ship what the website says","review":"I expected the movie to be the widescreen edition, but it was the fullscreen edition.I received this movie several months ago, but only just realized that it was Amazon's mistake, not mine.

A better rental than a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is too long, makes little sense (songs are about flying a kite and a lemon) and must be intended for young children. The music is OK, very Indian, and I see lip sync problems.The plot is typical, and the sets elaborate. I hope nobody believes this is really India. It is overdone with choreography too obvious. This movie is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I'm new to Indian movies - rather than repeat the previous review, or recap the storyline, which is already listed here - I'll just say I really loved this movie. There was a lot of emotion in it - and something I'm really enjoying about the Indian movies is that they don't seem to feel the need to sell sex to sell a good story. Not so much as an on screen kiss, but you feel more emotion and heartbreak from these characters than you do from most any Hollywood movie. Definitely a great movie!! (And the musical numbers were really spiffy!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Aishwarya's Best","review":"This was my second bollywood movie. After viewing Devdas, I was dying to see more Aishwarya movies. Hum dil de chuke sanam was fabulous! I highly recommend it. The sets, costumes and dance numbers are some of the best.

Admittedly, there is maybe only a better one (in French, hard to find).

I know of various european books that actually were inspired by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me back my equations!","review":"This book reminds me of Stephen Hawking's \`\`A Brief History of Time'', in that it consciously and conspicuously omits mathematical symbolism beyond high-school level. IMHO, this is a mistake, as it renders the material opaque, thereby serving neither the amateur nor the professional. Although it's almost heresy to say so, Emperor Hawking's book had no clothes.Although I have some knowledge of mathematics and quantum mechanics, the tiresome translations of concise expressions into long-winded textual explanations left me confused and bored. I feel that the lay person will also skim over them as completely as if they had been the original formulae.That said, the material is important, as is expressing these concepts to a broader audience. The book is well-organised, and deserves more work. I humbly request a second, edited edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing","review":"Mathematics was invented for a reason, and the avoidance of even simple mathematics makes this book near unintelligible. Further, the habit of versing quantum theory in terms of genetics, real and imagined, further separates the subject mater from the reader; and giving Feynman credit for how probability amplitudes add would probably not please him at all. Give this one a wide berth and read instead 'The quest for the quantum computer' by Julian Brown which is everything this book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"One of the most glib and inaccessible treatments of the subject I've encountered. You're much better off with something like Julian Brown's \\"Minds, Machines, and the Multiverse\\" or Feynman's own lectures on computation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very ordinary effort","review":"This book does not take you through quantum computing in any logical way. The author does not explain where he is going with his lengthy examples in each section. Instead he tends to launch into hard to follow, artificially concocted examples with little rationale and then move to the next topic without a conclusion or a reason for why he put the reader through such boring experience. The discussion of the Bohr - Einstein debate told me nothing of what the debate was about and there are many references to the EPR without any real explanation of what was in it. There must be a better way to understand this subject else I will have to conclude that Einstein was right and God really does play dice. Give this book a miss... it is simply not worth the effort. Even my one star is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feynman Processor","review":"Gerard's book, is somewhat aimed at an audience well above its actual content.

I think I will keep both varieties on hand since they serve different functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"It is a really good concept for a book - two boys spending the summer in Japan and if some of the ideas had been expanded, Crossing Pacific could have been a very interesting book. But instead it just skims over the surface, with no details to really interest the reader. There are no conflicts between Lincoln and his host family - they manage to speak impecable English. He teaches them American slang and practices kempo. There is no development of Mitsuo's interest in baseball or how they can all speak English so well. It might be interesting for younger students looking for a quick read, but if you want more details about a summer spent in Japan, look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For little kids only","review":"I bought this game for my 5 year old and she loves it.It is a very simple game that lets you win almost every time.If you want to get a game that will teach a first time gamer how to play video games this is it.The level she enjoys the most is where elmo rides a jet ski as he looks for the number.I wouldnt recomend this for a kid over 10,its just to simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Lose With Elmo :-)","review":"Although I did see some Negative reviews before purchasing this for my 3yr old grandson, I knew he loved Elmo so I took a chance.

You want crazy songwriting? You want complete madness? You want brutality? Listen to THIS cd! They're completely amazing, and definitely know how to drive emotions in their song writing. The first song is just incredible, and I also find track 4 to be probably one of my all time favorite songs. If you haven't seen them live, you haven't seen a REAL band live! They are insane!

It's a one of a kind. Willian's book brought to light many of the subtle and whimsical details inherent in the film and compelled me to view it more than once this holiday season.

My friend bought this CD(for reasons beyond my comprehension), and we wound up throwing it in my cat's litterbox two days later. The arrangements are, without exception, bland and forgettable. The band members and I were raised in the same community, and the notion that these individuals are expressing \\"blue collar lyrical concerns\\" is not only utterly laughable, it also completely destroys the credibility of any of the TKO records reviews ever published. The truth is that the band members are all from the ultra-affluent, ultra-white community of Hillsborough, Ca., and their parents' average income is easily in the multi-millions. If you can honestly tell yourself that this album is worth listening to, you are not only musically inept, you have also been fooled by a bunch of rich phonies.

But when you play the cd there's no escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Original","review":"The premise is quite unlike anything I've seen before in a movie. It reminds me of a Pinter play more than it does any movie I've seen. The subject matter is presented in a slow and contemplative fashion. The characters are strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"convincing","review":"The movie was very convincing. The dilemas the characters were feeling and the positions they found themselves in, due to their different views of life/work are real, and the questions they raise are relevant. The movie doesn't deal with life and death questions, but fulfillment, father-son relationship, adaptation or compromise are matters more familiar to most of the viewers. The movie can be even regarded as dark humorred, the irony of destiny rules over the tragedies of the characters.I enjoyed it and recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well but in the end dissappoints","review":"The idea for this movie is just great - and during the initial discovery and handling of the mistake, the film really holds you.

I was surprised to find in the liner notes that studio musicians were used for certain parts (I didn't know there were only three members of the band)--they did a great job though.

Awful !","review":"The songs are very bad, stupid, no real melodies, stupid lyrics but what is more important it is very irritating because of the awful background: He has what seems to be 2-3 men singing in support (underlining the lyrics, responding to it) and it is awful. The other review says \\"most of them have call-and-response vocals between Louis and band\\".

If this is your situation (but you haven't opened it) then STOP and return it! I would've rather played Final Fight for the Super Nintendo! At least in that game you can see what is going on clearly. This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. There is really no strategy, there is TONS of backtracking to parts of levels you thought you'd beat, but then more enemies just appear, and the game just isn't any fun. Also, it was pretty dumb to not make the game for any more than one player at a time, with multiplayer this horrible game might at least be bearable for five minutes. I'm almost ashamed to own this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Dynamite Cop instead","review":"This game has absolutly no fun factor. You'll play it once and then throw it away. The graphics are an example of sega rushing to make a game during the early days of Dreamcast.There are only 3 characters and their moves a very weak. The magican isn't even able to cast any spells.

It gets boring after about 5 minutes. Even the intro was terrible. The story line was stupid, and all in all, I'd give this game a big zero. The graphics are decent, but the boredom and useless factor weigh against anything relevant. If you would like to check it out anyway, I'd recommend you rent it first. Who knows, a few people may enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque, stumbling main characters.","review":"Ugh. Not only is the point of view confusing, but the main characters stumble around and don't want to go in the direction you want them to.

First and formost, if i wanted to get a dizzy spell, i could just as easily run outside and spun in circles and saved myself about 50 dollars. Then you have to listen to the same old music over and over and over (get the point?). And lets not even get into the fun factor of this game. This is one of the first games i've ever played where i took it back only hours afterward. Some might say that i should have given it more time. Trust me. It didn't deserve the small amount of time i gave it.

The richness of her vocals, her phrasing, the emotion that shimmers not saturates - nothing short of divine.This was my first recording by Miss Vaughan and the reason I chose it over all the others was the inclusion of \\"Dreamsville\\" which is one of my all time favorite songs. This version is now my all time favorite rendition.The sound quality is excellent and there are lots of goodies to choose from - a whopping 16 songs - but other highlights include: \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" and \\"Body and Soul\\" and \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\" and..... oh, they're all wonderful.I, too, am a bit baffled by the choice of cover. Why not a picture of the lovely Sarah? hmmm....odd, just odd.Anyway, I highly recommend this CD to Sarah Vaughan fans, those who love classic songs magnificently sung, and anyone who wants to kick back and escape to Dreamsville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"Can get the very same product at Ocean State Job Lot for $8.00!!!

Parts broke before we got the thing assembled-which by the way with children \\"helping\\" took two hours. Once assembled the kids had a great time until it started falling apart. Not a toy to put up and then store easily; more than likely you will put it up once and then never bring it out again.I plan on returning it and trying again with another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"This took me hours to put together and continuously fell apart every time my son tried to use. It was very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exercise in Frustration","review":"This toy cannot be constructed intuitively. One must painstakingly follow the directions to get a working marble run. It took me hours to assemble and I'm good at these sorts of things. The green vertical pieces are easy to mix up which means you have to take it all apart if you get one piece in the wrong place because it is 1/4\\" shorter than another. Do not attempt to put together with any \\"help\\" from your child (and what is the point, then?). Although the description says ages 6 and up, I'm pretty sure the box has it labeled as 8 and up.

The idea was good but the quality of materials were bad. My 4year son played 10min after I built it for him and things started to fall off. It took full two hours to build. I glued certain parts again and still not working as we expected. It is in a garbage can now. This is how I wasted my $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to Spend a few hours","review":"Pros:1. fun to construct, especially if you can keep your child interested2. if you or your child like rub-goldberg devices, you will enjoy watching the operation of this one.3. I believe there may be some flexibilty to re-build the system in your own custom wayCons:1. Not sure how much \\"replay value\\" it will have2. Obviously construction is lego quality plastic, except with moving parts, so it will break easily3. custom rebuild ability may not be to the level of a lego set, unless you had at least one additional setOverall this one was a winner. Initially, when I first opened the box, it was overwhelming, as there are literally hundreds of parts, all requiring assembly. The instructions are great, but it still takes minimum 3 hours to construct. I started it one evening, then got my 5 yr old daughter to help me pick out the pieces and finished the next day. That was some good quality time, which is what I was after all along."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 types of parts missing... a no go","review":"Bought for my son's birthday.

One of the worst toys we have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun!","review":"I put this together with my 7year old son in a couple of hours. He couldn't have done it himself but it was afun project for us to do together. It's only been up for a couple days but he is really enjoying playing with it.

This toy took atleast 6 hours to assemble (could not be completed in one sitting), and when we finally finished it, it did not work! The gears were too tight or sticky to allow the ball to roll! I have never been so frustrated in my life! I'm tempted to bring it out on the roof and drop it so it can smash into millions of pieces. Please do not waste your time and money on this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to assemble, fun to watch in action","review":"This is a stimulating, fun parent-child project. Our Lego-loving seven-year-old grandson couldn't have constructed it by himself, but did enjoy working with his father and/or grandfather. Great lessons are to be learned: sorting pieces, following diagram instructions (like Legos), orienting each piece properly for assembly. And once assembled, the thing is captivating! Nine marbles go up the rotary elevator on pushbutton (battery) command, and then run through a complex set of shoots, slots, and one scoop that rises and drops to pass the marble along. Gratifyingly noisy, not yet annoying. Fun for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Shines!","review":"The 5 stars are for Ella's contribution to this album. Here she is folks -the one and only singin' and swingin' and havin' a ball - and you will too! Right from the getgo with This Can't Be Love, Ella gets you in the mood to feel you're right there at Newport 50 years ago...50 years...amazing! Ella caps off a great set that includes Too Close For Comfort, Lullaby of Birdland and Body and Soul, with a fantastic interpretation of Airmail Special, a true tour-de-force of incredible timing, perfect pitch and brilliant inventiveness. Others have had a stab at this number, but this is the original - and the best!I'm afraid, Billie and Carmen had to take a backseat to Ella at this concert. Billie sounds tired, and almost comes to a near stop during What a Little Moonlight Will Do, and the usually polished Carmen McRae just sounds distracted and under rehearsed.No, this is Ella's album - a brilliant, blazing, and joyous performance from the best jazz singer in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"sharp AC AF-S85FX","review":"I will have to agree with the previous review.

They replay multiple of the same fights over and over just with a different soundtrack. If you've never seen a real fight in your life then this may appeal to you. These are mainly scuffles more than brawls. Everyone is so tangled together all the time no one can even throw a punch. There may be one or two \\"decent fights\\" and that's it. Even those fights are usually one sided. One guy chasing another around the parking lot. If you must buy this movie, DO NOT SPEND 40 DOLLARS ON THIS! ITS OUTRAGEOUS THAT THEY COULD CHARGE THIS!

Pass on this album. If you want, just go look up the words, the music does nothing but ruin them, when they are decent.If you look at most of eLi's reviews, people give his albums 5 stars because of his personality, or because they know him and he's such a swell guy. First of all, he's not, and second of all, if they were honestly grading these albums on their merit alone they could not in good conscious give these albums 5 stars.The music is horribly simplistic to the point of insanity.

The Crash was first and foremost a financial event but Klein does not really address finance other than to survey what people thought. I get no feel for what may have caused the Crash nor do I walk away feeling educated about the period. It has all been done better before, namely Galbraith and F.L. Allen in their own way. Historians need to know more finance before tackling this topic which is why Klein does not succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authoritative, Cogent, and Readable","review":"Rainbow's End, by Maury Klein, will not cheer you up, but it is the best history of the stock market crash of 1929 I've ever read.

If you prefer Billie Holiday backed by a quartet or piano as opposed to a full-scale orchestra, then this is for you. What makes this a treat is Billie's singing, which is o-so sublime. Her voice is clear, full, and flushed with melancholic phrasing, with none of the harsh tone or roughness that was to creep up in time. Put this CD in your player and be prepared to be transported to a dimly-lit cabaret room in the early '40s, serenaded by Billie's warm, sensual vocals. Some of the songs are cornerstones of the American pop catalog (i.e. I'll be Seeing You, Embraceable You...) that have been covered by other artists such as Sinatra, but Billie makes these songs entirely her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxed and mellow","review":"Famous detour between Holiday's \\"Columbia\\" and \\"Decca\\" recordings, \\"Commodore\\" dared to record/release \\"Strange Fruit\\" and here is the rest.Besides that famous protest song,the rest is as usual ultra-mellow and relaxed but not so different from what Lady did with \\"Columbia\\" - she floats through set of standards (and even re-records her own \\"I Cover The Waterfront\\") backed by small combo and is in sparkling form.If you don't know better,you would think these are her famous small-band \\"Columbia\\" recordings.The very next moment she would switch to \\"Decca\\" and sing with strings and backing chorus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Farrah fantastic","review":"Could Farrah have ever done wrong??

I talked to HP about it (after the warranty had run out) and they sent me a fancy roller-conditioning gizmo evidently designed specifically for this recognized problem. The gizmo inserts into paper tray and, through activation of a corresponding program, actually *sands* the roller wheels. A small pile of rubber accumulates on the gizmo which you then remove and clean. This *fix* works for a few days and then the paper feed problem returns. I don't use this *fix* much because the agressive abrasive would soon reduce the rubber rollers to nubs.

It does not offer sufficient examples that are tangible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It says nothing about Customer Value","review":"I thought this book was about Customer Value - an impression given by its subtitle \\"Creating Customer Value for Market Leadership\\". In fact you have to wade through 170 pages to get a chapter on Customer Value and that makes little attempt to define Customer Value or analyse the structure of value. Instead, and throughout the book, we are left with a random collection of fatuous vignettes and glib statements.And that pretty much sums up the book - shallow case studies, blindingly obvious statements and senior school level comments on business strategy: \\"It's profitable to have a vision\\". The book lacks any sort of academic rigour, not to mention a coherent structure. Also, published in 1998, the book is horrendously out of date.So we have over 300 pages filled with utterly pointless outdated nonsense. You will learn nothing about Customer Value here - avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"This frame's going back","review":"I bought Mustek for 60, which is a good deal for 7in. But the resolution is rather low, only 480 by 340. Photos are quite pixelated. More disappointing is the contrast. The whole frame looks kind of grayish. I guess the problem is the black is not truly the black.The other problem is the design. The memory card slots are quite deep in the back. It's hard to pull cards out once fully pushed in. And it doesn't recognize the card sometime. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for the price","review":"I wanted to buy a unique gift for my family for Christmas, and after reading several reviews, I decided to get this picture frame. I admit that the resolution is not the best, but it was not to expensive so the price was worth it. It did not come with a remote, but do you really need one for the picture frame anyway! If you want to leave the display at a 4.3 ratio, you really do not have to edit the photos, but if you want to change the ratio to 16.9, you will have to edit the pictures. That is not a problem for me, but for others it could be an issue. I follwed the directions of decreasing the width to 77%, and than change the pixels to 480x342. The only thing that I was dissapointed that it does not play mp3s during the slideshow. That would have been a nice feature.

It has a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a good addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7\\" frame. This one is just right for my wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"The product performs exactly how I expected it to for the price.

I've got pictures that came directly from a 6 megapixel camera on the card I put in this thing and it looks like they came from a .5 MP camera.

I copied all the pics off the card, installed some new ones and they won't play. Tried a different type of card - went from SD to CF and they don't read at all. Then tried the usb / thumb / jump drive and they don't read at all. Tried the SD card again and now it jumps into a directory thing that I can't get out of.

It had acceptable picture quality for the price and I felt it was a good value. But product degraded over the first 100 days. Week 5 a single green line appeared on the right side of the screen, at day 60, 3 more appeared. An email and phone message call to Support recieved no reply (would only accept message no chance to talk to a human). Day 101 the entire right third of the frame died. I have call 3 more times and left 3 more message over the last month without response. My recommendation is to spend a little more money and purchase from an extablished name. I cannot recommend this product of manufacturer. One addtional note, the website I purchase it from said it had a 1 year warrenty. Inside the box was a note which stated the warrenty period had been reduced to 90 days. Not a good indication of quality. I should have realized a possible issue at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product information","review":"Product description says the frame comes with a \\"credit card sized remote...\\", what remote??? No remote here! You have to do all the adjustments, set up and volume control using the itty bitty buttons on the back of the frame which is VERY frustrating for grandparents receiving this as a present. You have to leave the USB stick or memory card in or have it plugged into the computer - you cannot \\"upload\\" images onto it. It looks really lovely with a USB stick sticking out of the side 24/7. Also, it MUST be plugged in - it does not take batteries which was another bit convienently left out of the product specs. The image quality is only great when you are standing FAR away!

I wasn't expecting much due to its price last year and it worked like a charm up till a few weeks ago, when it would occasionally shut itself off. That became more and more frequent until today when it will power up, display the first picture, the display will degrade and go green and pixelated and then it shuts off. Over and over again. Time for the trash bin.Regardless of the price (unless it was free), something like this has to last longer than 11 months. Judging from the reviews, I won't be buying a replacement frame from Mustek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price & current technology","review":"For full info, read a longer, more thoughtful review, everything about this product has already been said twice. But I thought this was a great buy for the price. Other reviewers are correct, the actual resolution is 480x342, not whatever the specs in the Amazon description (or even the instructions that came with the product.) This means that it is an even better deal. This also means that the frame displays at a resolution which is just about the same aspect ratio as most digital cameras. Therefore, without much work, your pictures will fill up most of the screen (without black bars or being stretched or squished one way more than the other).The only negative: It can not play mp3's at the same time as it displays pictures. While it is playing an MP3 it displays a graphic equalizer & a file listing. That is too bad, otherwise it would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustek Digital Frame","review":"Very clear pictures.

A mix of tender ballads, classic Jarreau \\"groovy funkiness,\\" and pure virtuoso vocalizing make this album well worth both the cash and the wait. GRP has grabbed up AL and here's hoping that they 1)continue to allow him the freedom to explore his music and 2) continue to pair him to winning producers and collaborators. The album is his best studio work in a long time. My favorite cuts (its only been 10 or so listenings) are \\"Last Night\\" and \\"Puddit,\\" but anyone who heard \\"Tomorrow Today\\" in concert last summer knows that it is classic Jarreau (which sometimes also includes Al's infamously odd lyric choices; first time I've ever heard anyone sing the phrase \\"think tank\\").

This is my favorite recording since \\"Breaking Away\\" He has the same type of groove on this CD. I've seen a lot made of the duet with Vanessa Williams on \\"God's Gift to the World\\" but the cut that makes this CD for me is \\"Something That You Said\\". Al uses his incredible singing gift and adds some songwriting prowess to take an instrumental song that I already loved and put words to it. If you know \\"A Remark You Made\\" off the Weather Report \\"Heavy Weather\\" album, you'll know that Al has outdone himself on this song. A must listen, it is absolutely fabulous. Al's other composition, \\"Flame\\" is also great. I'm glad Al is back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"I have been a jazz enthusiast since I was 15.

This new CD carries me back a little bit to those good old days. There are great tracks like \\"Tomorrow today\\", \\"Flame\\", \\"Something you said\\", but it's a pitty though with so many great drummers you have in America (such as Steve Gadd) 7 out of the 11 tracks have \\"drum programming\\".

Don't let the fact that the title says \\"Windows NT\\" discourage you from getting this book. There is a lot of useful information in this book that is still standard practice for scripting in Server 2003. Probably one of the few and only outdated commands in the book is the AT command that was replaced by SCHTASK. Even then, the author goes into detail on how these different commands work and how to use them in your work environment to you benefit. I recommend this book as a learning tool and as a reference for my fellow scripting brethren."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only one of it's kind!","review":"If you ever find yourself working at the command prompt in NT, this is the book you'll reach for over and over again. In my work, I do alot of file transfers, bulk loads of databases and test script development. I constantly use the Command Reference section in this book for command syntax and command line parameter options as well as it's examples.This was the only book on the topic I could find and I wasn't disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Vanlint","review":"This is a must have book for the serious NT professional. Without wanting to repeat what everyone else has said...Why would you buy it? - when moving from machine to machine, business to business you need to know that you can quickly perform the tasks you need. By learning the NT command line, you have POWER at your fingertips which combined with the NT res kit will make your life much easier.This book is never stays still for more than a day or two. I am constantly referring to it as I increase the number of scripts I use."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Reilly, beware!","review":"The degree of loving detail that Mr. Hill has lavished upon the spastically designed NT command shell cannot be underestimated. This book takes Redmond's hobbled monstrosity and makes it dance, even showing you how you can hack it to act if it were a real language (functions with local variables and return values, etc.)! Indispensable not only for sysadmins, but for anyone who needs to write a script for Win32 and can't count on Perl being installed on the machine. A real treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is out of date!","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews which I usually trust.This book is way out of date, this type of scripting has been well super-seded by Windows Scripting Host, or even Kix scripting.

I read through many books on him and found this one the most helpful. Because the book is compiled of essays from a large variety of writers, the overall effect of the book is well-balanced: neither overly romanticized nor overly critical. Unlike some other denser texts, this set of essays contains lots of supportive information, but also reads very well, with many ancedotes, wit, and interesting theses and points presented by the writers. A wonderful tribute to a wonderful man that is certainly worth the read for anyone wanting to know more about Havel and the Czechoslovak people's inspiring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for Gameboy Color","review":"The plug I received didn't fit in the hole for the Gameboy Color's AC Adapter.

The mixing is abysmal and I found the whole disc to be a poorly thought out mess with no redeeming tracks.

Overated.","review":"As a highly successful college coach, I have discovered that it's really not necessary to scheme against the blitz. Really, if one executes the gameplan that one scripts several months before the game, there is no need to adjust.Screens and quick slants are dangerous plays to run. The best way to beat the blitz is to keep the QB stationary, so that he is able to execute the keen gameplan of 3 yard outs.Another good way to beat the blitz is to have the receivers run very long, complicated hitch patterns that will confuse the DB.Besides that, there is no need to bring in extra blockes, audible, misdirect, tunnel screen, flare, quick slant, rollout, or do anything else.I believe that my astounding record of wins per season stands as a testiment to my ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This first 20% of this workbook was unusable due to writing the answers in it in ink.

They give the reader a peek inside the photographer's heads and reveal what was really going on while the work was being created. The portfolios are interesting and the photographs well done. Some of the images are striking. I found it useful to view the work presented as \\"portfolios\\". This book is a good teaching tool if you are or want to put your own portfolios together.

It has been a little challenging for the young ones, however, we don't have to skip too many cards to get to one they understand, and it really brings out their talents and skills, in a really fun environment! This game has brought out lots of support for family members, and is helping the kids feel comfortable with themselves, and to not be afraid to be themselves and act silly with the rest of us!A very unique set. The mover pieces are just so cool!!Even the price tag, for you bargain shoppers, is quiet good.

I only knew about the New Deal & FDR. This book is wonderful. It gives a more colorful perspective on the first half of the twentieth than a textbook could ever and what's ironic is it doesn't talk about the New Deal as much as my US History teacher did. From this book, I've learned more what America was like and who were the truly big movers and shakers, and it wasn't always the president! If you like history and you want to read something from someone who actually lived through the \\"big change\\" (and want to read something less formal that a textbook and chuckle about situations of the past), I truly recommend this book.

Much of what is written in the book repeats itself, and since the \\"names and names of the ships were changed,\\" it leaves you to wonder if it even happened at all. It all sounds exaggerated, to the point where you stop taking it seriously. Having been overseas during the Gulf War, I can tell you there is NO WAY two Merchant Seamen could have found Army uniforms and a jeep and snuck off the piers. Some of his stories are real, but it's about 60/40 with the fiction.

At last there is a really good book that will let you know just what you are getting into. Rawlins captures the essence of his past decade in the merchant marine, and sheds much light on the lives of the merchant seamen cast of characters that sail aboard the merchant fleets and all that that entails. We are talking about some really strange adventures here, on land and at sea. For Rawlins is an intelligent keen-eyed observer who learned early on to keep his wits about him at all times, especially as those around him were losing theirs, sometimes wondering about just what he had gotten himself into after signing on aboard different ships. It is an amazing tale to tell as Rawlins tries to set the record straight about the merchant marine and the mysterious world of merchant shipping. He has a way with words that catches the irony of it all and does so with good style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish. Waste of $$$","review":"Jumbled, disconnected, rambling. Badly written. Not very coherent . You can get a general sense of being in the merchant marine out of it but somehow it just disappoints. One \\"chapter\\" is just a quote from another book. Another \\"chapter\\" is a collection of short (1 or 2 sentence) anecdotes/sea tales, many of which are fabrications or jokes. Not a serious attempt at literature and not even a very good exposition of life as a mariner. For the price it is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The picture is wrong, these have Adirondack chairs on them, but they still do a good job at insulating your drink","review":"I knew that these said that they were Blue Adirondack Chair Tervis Tumblers, but I couldn't find any on Amazon which had a picture of a dog when I bought these and since these had a picture of a dog I was hoping that I would get one with a dog not a chair on them. No such luck, they are blue Adirondack chairs. They still look nice though. These do a great job at keeping your cup from sweating and they're pretty good at insulating your drink too. I really like the large size, it lets me use giant Tovolo 2\\" ice cubes in them. They do still fit in the top rack of my dishwasher though.

Also the lights do brighten the screen but again, unless your looking straight on the lights will leave \\"hot spots\\" on your screen. \\"Hot spots\\" is when light reflects off the screen and makes it difficult to see.

Let one example suffice. Research from Science (7 June,1996) is characterized by the authors in the following manner; \\"A recent study of the effects of ... pesticides on estrogen-sensitive cells in test tubes, for example, found that the pesticides were 1,000 times more potent in combination than individually.\\"The research in question was formally retracted by its authors in Science, on 25 July 1997. The episode was widely discussed and led to an ethics investigation by Tulane University. Toxic Deception was published in 1999. That news of this development took two years to reach the authors stretches plausibility. Moreover, the same environmental foundation (W. Alton Jones) which funded the retracted study likewise supported the publication of Toxic Deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched screen first DAY!!!","review":"This watch is very nice looking but the screen is plastic so it scratched from day 1 and makes the watch basically useless, avoid buying this crappy watch and save money on a glass screen watch, im very disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went directly into the trash after 1st use","review":"You can't see it from the picture on the box, but the nozzles are not circular cylinders, but more in the shape of a cruciform screwdriver (a prism in + shape).

Also the nozzles are painful when inserted and removed because of their shape, and scratch the fragile skin down there. The material is the cheapest, flimsiest plastic possible.

These nozzles are shaped like vaginal douche syringes. I don't know how they would work for that, but they certainly won't work well as rectal syringes because of their ribbed shape. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the reviewers who pointed this out. I wish I had saved my money. The best rectal syringe I've found is an emptied out Fleets bottle.

It is a shame that President Bush tried to pin the rising cost of medical care on so-called \\"frivolous lawsuits\\", when in fact the insurance companies keep costs high by insisting on unreasonable profits even when company executives make poor business decisions.

Just like I still buy Tommy & Vince cds today. In some aspects the cd was great at the time. I do agree it was dark and heavier, which I liked. Sometimes you take what you can get. I did like John Corabi on the album. It just didn't sound Motley vocally. Personally they should re-do it with Vince. If you're a Crue fan then you should have it. It still has Tommy, Mick and Nikki on it! I listen to it maybe twice a month along with the others. Worth the skeptics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John, please come back!","review":"To open, I have been a Crue fan from the beginning. These days I prefer the more cerebral side (is there one?) of hard rock/ heavy metal, and this album fits that bill. For those of you not familiar with John Corabi outside of this work, check out \\"The Scream (1991)\\" and the two \\"Union\\" albums with Bruce Kulick on guitar. John sounds awesome on this album, and Mick Mars' guitar walls of sound, riffs and solos stand out against any work he has done prior and since. John's accoustic and rhythm gutitar work is also fantastic on this album. I think this was the last album with Tommy Lee, and he shines also in keeping a thundering beat. Just buy the album, you will NOT be disappointed. It is a shame that John could not stick with the group, as he adds a true rock and roll vision with \\"soul\\" and \\"class\\" that the Crue really never had with Vince.

I have to note that the band was not the same after 2Pac left the group to go with Dre. But even without Pac's sociopathic vocals at the helm, the Crue Showed that they relly had what it took to survive in the 90's. THEN, after this album, they went and got some shmuck named Vince Neil for their \\"Generation Swine\\" album. That album SUCKED!!!! Even Tommy Lee's burdgeoning career as an unwilling adult film star wasn't enough to boost album sales. And let's face it: that Vince guy was really no match for 2Pac. I mean, how could they hope to top such killer anthems such as \\"Smokin blunts in the boyz room\\" and \\"Shoutin at the Devil with California Love\\" Oh well. I hear the new 2Pac-less Crue is on the road with that Vince guy. And Tommy's back on Drums!!! That should give the tour five stars alone!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of Motley Crue!","review":"This album was the end of Motley Crue.

Krishnamurti's challenge is to find yourself rather than follow someone else's path.This may seem rather scary. There's no shortage of churches and groups that will willingly take you in and instruct you in your thinking and doing. And you will emerge thinking another person's thoughts, doing as another thinks you should do.J. Krishnamurti is unique in his writings. Sure, you will find a little inconsistency, and he will even admit to this. He does not claim to know it all. But he does know how to inspire one to search for that which is within and to do so indepently.You will not find immediate answers in Krishnamurti's writing. The answers are to be found in yourself. But this book along with his others will give you the impetus.And this is probably the best \\"first\\" book of his to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste","review":"This book is filled with unsupportable psycho dribble.

The production on the album is terrible and her signature flow is almost nonexistent. Even her lyrics are wack on this album. One of the freestyles she did was horrendous and I'm wondering how it made the album. Then I started wondering how much time was actually put into the final product. The first three songs are the only good songs: Sippin & Spinnin, Zoned Out, and Scared, The rest are throwaway tracks. Hopefully this is only a bump in the road for Lady Gangsta Boo, cause she has the potential to release great albums. Not recommended. 1.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Box O' Soap","review":"Soap is good - Packaging isn't. If you order this, beware when you open it.

It doesn't even remotely sound like Styx! (No wonder, because Tommy and JY stole leadership of Styx from Dennis!) Not even Dennis' songs can save this dreck. Not one good song on this album. If anyone is thinking about buying this, don't Buy either of Styx's Greatest Hits CDs or ANY of their albums, anything but this trash. The fact that Tommy and Dennis weren't getting along well at the time this dreck was recorded makes this album all the more painful to listen to. If the current lineup of Styx releases a studio album, I'm not buying it, because Styx is NOT like Van Halen."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"This band was great when I was a kid, I worshiped them, oh how they have lost their way. Time to put the axes down boys. If you want to hear some brilliant Styx, get yourself, \\"Equinox\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"The Grand Illusion\\". The music is as passionate as it is intricate. There was plenty of notes and words to hang onto then. Where did the magic go? We all get old I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate To Say It, But I Think Styx' Time Has Passed","review":"I have been a longtime fan of Styx and was happy to hear that the four surviving members of the \\"classic\\" lineup were putting together a CD of entirely new material for the first time in over 15 years.I had \\"Great Expectations\\" (a track on the CD), but they were hardly met. I feel like it is a compilation of three solo albums (Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young) instead of a group effort. DeYoung peppers the CD with mostly sappy ballads again, which has become his Styx trademark since the success of Babe in the late 70s. I think Tommy Shaw's work is the most disappointing because he has nothing memorable on this CD, the first time that has ever happened IMHO. I wondered if he used songs that didn't make the cut on his solo CD last year. And James Young's tunes are louder filler, which has usually been the case during Styx' career.So as a 20+ year fan of the group (since Grand Illusion), I hate to say it, but they shouldn't have bothered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Styx proves that Real Rock is what its all about!","review":"Styx turns in a very good peformance on this CD. This is more a Tommy Shaw CD than any other, and rightfully so. Truly a rockin' set. If you remember Styx from the 70's and early 80's, this CD of all new music is a must for your collection. Real Rock and New music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for old and new STYX fans alike.","review":"While the band has aged a bit,the voices have matured and grown with time. Admittedly one or two of the songs sound like the band is trying to alter their classic sound to the lesser rock being created today. But overall the songs are dramatic and moving with a range of songs from Hard Rock to the tearful ballads of old. Well worth the investment.

I have listened through twice and look forward to many more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"BNW full of sound!","review":"Has to be one of the best recordings of a super group coming back together after so many years since their last recording.

There really isn't a bad song and I love the variety.

Then I had the pleasure of a 10 day road trip to Alaska. So I had plenty of time to listen and found it to be a great traveling companion. The diversity of musical styles made it seem like I was listening to numerous different CD's. That to me always seemed to be the magic of Styx-to be able to entertain on various different levels without offending anyone(except for music critics). So congratulations to the band for a job extremely well done!

While there's still time should become a major hit, It is one of Dennis De Youngs best songs to date and should start picking up the steem on this Styx train.Folks the Styx train is rolling!

Well, he's right--this record is very inconsistent and reflects the fragmented way it was written and recorded. The only songs where Styx remotely sounds like a unit are \\"BNW\\", \\"Everything is Cool\\", and \\"Best New Face\\". The rest are split into Tommy and Dennis tracks with the obligatory one James Young song, and it's pretty clear which of these writers are lazing around on past habits and which have kept making new rock music. I mean, which track from Hunchback will Dennis mine next for the band, \\"Hey Quasimodo\\"?In any case, this disc gets changed after \\"Heavy Water\\" pretty much every time I play it, and most of the time \\"Fallen Angel\\" gets skipped too. Five stars to Styx for finishing the new record and clearly making many fans happy. But a more realistic 2 stars for the actual quality of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has the genius gone?","review":"What happened to their \\"come sail away\\", \\"fooling yourself\\", \\"blue collar man\\", \\"boat on the river\\", \\"half penny...\\", \\"rockin the ...\\", etc.? What happened to the covers? Where has their talent gone? They became as monotonous as the music from this decade. I am an old fan of them, but I'll keep listening their old records, or even Glen Burtnik solo projects. What happened with Glen?, I prefer Tommy, but Glen wasn't bad. Styx is going like Supertramp, from great to bad.I write this because I expected so much from my favorite band, but got nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Really 2 1/2 stars) Great music, horrible lyrics","review":"I am a long time fan whose favorite Styx album is \\"Paradise Theater\\". In 1980, there was no other album that really matter. In fact I still listen to it today. Now, in 1999, Styx has released \\"Brave New World\\". It is the first album in 16 years that Tommy Shaw has appeared on. As I read the lyrics I cringed. I put on the CD and enjoyed the music but cringed even more when I heard these horribly trite and dated lyrics. Imagine if the Backstreet Boys had been a rock band rather than a dance pop band with the same type of lyrics and then you will understand. The songs that Tommy Shaw and James Young sings on are the best. Dennis DeYoung's songs are somewhat sappily embarrasing. \\"Goodbye Roseland\\" sounds like it belongs in a Broadway play and not on a rock album. If I were 10 years old ago again (when \\"Paradise Theater\\" came out) I probably would have loved this album but now that I am 29 I can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH THE WAIT","review":"STYX HAS REURNED WITH A DYNAMITE SELECTION TO CHOOSE FROM.

The songs didn't sound like real Styx but rather, leftover solo project songs.Dennis de Young is usually my favorite Styx member but this time, he was incredibly sappy and boring.Tommy Shaw's efforts were contrived and passe.As what another reviewer stated, stick a fork in them, they're dead. Hopefully they will work together and produce a true Styx album.I am giving this album one star because there is no zero rating. I am only keeping this album because I am a loyal Styx fan but I would not recommend this to anyone; Styx fan or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CD 20 years too late","review":"In order to create Styx music, your mind needs to be in the early 80's. We have grown too cynical in our mentality now, but Styx still sings with the spirit of grandiosity that seems misinformed and naive. Dennis deYoung sounds like he wants to make you stand up and salute the flag. These people are supposed to be rockers. The lyrics are all about girls, wishful thinking and abstract characters. The songs are a good effort, but they're old hits that were created late. I can't imagine anyone who can live daily with attitude that permeates this style of music. To me it's like bringing back the dead and putting a lot of makeup on it; no matter how good of a job you do, I think it's not right. I absolutely do love the old STYX, though, and in those times it felt more sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give less than one star I would...","review":"You can tell Tommy Shaw and Dennis DeYoung don't get along by listening to this sorry half-effort. There is ONE song on this thing (\\"Everything Is Cool\\") that sounds like a decent STYX effort. Otherwise, it sounds like a mix of Dennis' and Tommy's cast-off solo material. Some of the DeYoung stuff harkens back to the days of \\"Kilroy Was Here\\" and \\"Music Time.\\" Is he really that out of touch! \\"Hip Hop-Cracy?\\" C'mon! The Tommy Shaw tune \\"Just Fell In\\" is cute, but doesn't belong on a STYX album. His others are average at best. I was a big-time STYX fan as a kid, and it saddens me to see them burn out like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Being a Styx fan for a number of years I was excited to see the remaining members of the group reunite for another studio album. However, after hearing this sub-par effort from the Styx makes me wish they would have forgone the effort and stuck to their day jobs.With pointless lyrics and musical arrangements that put you to sleep it is safe to say that the magic that this band once had has gone the way of the dodo.This is a perfect example that sometimes living in the past is not such a bad thing. If you feel the need to hear Styx wipe off your turntable and listen to some of the old classics.\\"Brave New World\\" makes their single \\"Music Time\\" sound like Beethoven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I like my STYX on the hard side. I think Equinox, Crystal Ball, Grand Illusion, and Pieces of Eight all have some of the greatest rock music ever released. Then Cornerstone came out. Well it's all been downhill from there. Even the first four albums released on Wooden Nickel are far better than Brave New World. This album is horrible. Not even a hint of the old Styx. There are a few classic rock bands still putting out great music, I wish Styx was one of them. This band still rocks in concert though. Oh my god I am actually hearing some good guitar riffs....Everthing is Cool. One good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we give zero stars?","review":"Awful, awful, awful. Disconnected, non-STYX sounding, way too many bad songs, no cohesion..need I say more? Was a major disappointment sales-wise, had no hits. After you listen to it you will know why.

There's nothing memorable at all here."},{"rating":"1","title":"people shouldn't get to review before theyve heard it","review":"stop cheaters, this is my cancel vote.

When I heard they were releasing a new album I almost started salivating with anticipation but when I finally heard it my mouth went as dry as the sahara desert. I could not believe how trite and insipid it was. The songwriting alone represents a major comedown in standards. Not one of the tracts on this album is at all memorable.In the past,we could always depend on James Young and Tommy Shaw to dish out the rock, (remember tracks like RENEGADE-MISS AMERICA-BLUE COLLAR MAN?)but not any more. Alas another great band sacrifices their guts and glory and opts for total,banal commercialism. WHAT A WASTE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Styx Fan - Disappointed","review":"I'm a big fan, I've got all the STYX releases. I listened to this CD today and must say it's the worst STYX release to date. The only song that I like is the title track \\"BRAVE NEW WORLD\\". This song is the only song that truly sounds like Styx. The ballad by Dennis DeYoung \\"While there still Time\\" isn't bad, but it does'nt kick into high gear like most Styx ballads. The rest of the songs have brief glimpses of someting, but i'm not sure what. I think the 1990 release \\"EDGE Of THE CENTURY\\" is a far better CD. Please understand Styx fans, I truly love this band. This CD simply is a poor release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for almost all of Tommy Shaw's material.","review":"True Styx fan's will be terribly disappointed. There are only three songs on the whole CD that I would even classify as Styx music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, diverse, classic Styx!","review":"These musicians have paid attention, and they have grown, particularly Tommy Shaw. What you'll hear on Brave New World is a collection of songs from musicians who've grown up, seen the world at it's worst, and decided to make the best of it anyway. Styx has never been a critics' favorite, and nothing will change this time, I'm sure. Styx has always been a fans' band, and the fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Copies","review":"Brave New World shows Styx is back in top form.

Now, a whopping 16 years later, Styx tries in vain to sound like a rockin' ageless band, but only ends up sounding like an overblown bar band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's face it, they're done...","review":"I'm a big styx fan and profoundly enjoy many bands in the classic rock genre. But, let's face it, this new album just doesn't cut it. Like some of the other reviews have said, the band is old. While I agree, they used to make excellent music, they are simply past their prime at this point. I'm sorry, but I don't like any of the songs on this latest compilation. I give it a 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"The River STYX Leads to another crappy album","review":"While listening to wasted piece of plastic, I thought more good could come from producing latex condoms than what was put on this CD. Tommy Shaw tries way too hard to rock with his take on so many political issues no one cares about anymore. Quit bitching and moaning about society and write songs about what make rocks and roll exciting: sex and drugs.On another note, Gowen, Sucherman, and Burtnik should form their own identies and continue on without the likes of sappy DeYoung, predictable Shaw, and the aging J.Y."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I bought this album thinking that the lush rich cohesive sound that has been known as STYX would once again be prevalent in 1999. Unfortunately, this is hardly the case here. Unfocused mish-mash is the best way to categorize it. It definetly falls into two camps - Dennis DeYoung's 5 songs are the strength of the album with Fallen Angel, While There's Still Time, and Goodbye To Roseland sounding liek traditional STYX. Tommy Shaw and JY's songs could have been cut down by two thirds. What a bunch of filler junk! The STYX harmonies are almost non-existent and the sound is just God awful. My dog starts howling when he hears some of these songs. Witness, Just Fell In, What Have they Done for You, Number One, and Brave New World Reprise, and Heavy Water all should have been left on the cutting room floor. This album is STYX's equivalent of Dan Marino's last game (A 62-7 drubbing). What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definietly not the Styx I grew to love with hits like 'Time On My Hands'","review":"Not what I expected but it didnt surprise me.

Dennis DeYoung has always been the bands musical director, but on this (his last album with the band) the rest of the guys ignored him entirely and produced thier own material.The final result is a very mixed and (to be frank) lousy album.There are a couple of good tracks on it, but I'd only recommend it to collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I am really disappointed by styx's latest cd Brave new world. I am a fan of the group and I own most of their albums. I was very excited when Return to Paradise was released. However, Brave New world was a fiasco. Let's hope the next one is much better. Javierjijena@yahoo.com (from Argentina)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Rockin' Album from Styx!","review":"Although my favorites are still all the Styx classics, I'm adding this album to the top of my list. Dennis DeYoung's voice has finally mellowed and his ballads are quite enjoyable as always. Tommy Shaw is coming off his 7 Deadly Zens album, and much of his work shows bleed-over from his solo work. James Young's heavy metal guitar force brings Styx's great '70s and '80s sounds into the '90s. Overall, this is a great addition to your collection. If you're waiting for a refreshing update to your CD collection, add this title. It grows on you day by day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough!","review":"If someone would have told me five years ago that the best Styx album was yet to come, I would have thought they were crazy. But, with \\"Brave New World\\" I believe that Styx is better than ever! I will admit that it did take a couple of listens to get used to it, but now it never leaves my CD changer. In my opinion, this CD is just as good, if not better, than \\"Pieces Of Eight\\" \\"The Grand Illusion\\" and definatley better than \\"Paradise Theatre\\". I am looking forward to MANY more albums from these guys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Dear, STYX is returning tonight","review":"\\"BRAVE NEW WORLD\\" has me disappointed. What the album lacks is more musicanship from Dennis DeYoung. The new STYX record is guitar driven on the tracks Tommy Shaw and James Young wrote. An arrangement or two should have included a solo by Dennis on organ and such. The music is tight. Dennis's playing could have been brought forth more, not just on his own compositions. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is my favorite new DeYoung tune. \\"High Crimes. . .\\" would not be out of place in his Hunchback musical(different lyrics). The STYX harmonies are here, especially on \\"Everything Is Cool\\". This CD will gain STYX new fans as did \\"Cornerstone\\" twenty years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait!","review":"Stygians, you asked for it and the \\"classic\\" line-up returned and delivered. Tunes like \\"Heavy Water\\" (a James Young/Tommy Shaw monster) and the first release \\"Everything Is Cool\\", spearhead the musical assualt we've waited 16 years for. \\"Best New Face\\" and \\"What Have They Done To You\\" are the sounds we've longed to hear. Two words: They're Back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Styx is back","review":"I've been waiting for 16 years for the new Styx album. My patience was not disappointed. While all new, the sound is vintage Styx. Songs like \\"Everything Is Cool\\" and \\"Number One\\" are fresh sounding and should receive much airplay. \\"What Have They Done To You\\" is another great track, reminding me of \\"Snowblind\\", with JY and Tommy teaming up. \\"I Will Be Your Witness\\" should be a hit single. \\"High Crimes & Misdemeanors\\" is a comment on hip-hop cracy from those in power. \\"Brave New World\\" is another great track. \\"Goodbye To Roseland\\" shows Dennis at his finest. What a voice. Overall, I just love this album and would recommend it to anyone, Styx fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of these reviews are TOO biased.","review":"Styx is my all time favorite band but I will try and give this a fair review.This is neither their best album, nor is it their worst. The sound is definately Styx. In fact I am listening to it as I type and it really reminds me more of the old (Pre Tommy) Styx.I am a little dissapointed by the cover art. One of the things I loved about Styx was the mystery in their covers. Trying to figure out the symbolism. I spent hours looking at the Grand llusion album cover.In the end, if you are a big Styx fan... this is a must for your collection. If you just liked Styx's biggest hit albums then you may not care for it too much.Lets hope we here a lot more about Styx in the near future.Best Darv"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocals-Vocals-Vocals","review":"After finally finding a copy of the new record (3 stores sold out of them where I live) I could not stop listening, What a joy to hear voices like this still exist in Rock and Roll.

I really enjoy I Will Be Your Witness, Brave New World, While There's Still Time, Everything is Cool and Heavy Water. Guess I've always been more of a Tommy and JY fan than DDY.

Jordan was a jerk who in the last chapter manages to somehow become Prince Charming, Curt did nothing for Libby, and Libby acted like a helpless little girl when Jordan was around. She's a paralegal, for heavens sakes! Another thing, why do they say \\"prophylactics\\"? when was the last time that word was used? It's a condom people.

I don't have anything against formula romances (I love Betty Neels), but this formula is tired.

The problem is with the character Powell. How can a guy be so blind about a female. I like the fact that Libby is a strong female character. In this book, it seems the roles of who usually warns who is switched. Grier is the chief, and he is hanging out with Tippy. The book said, that someone kidnapped her.

I needed to fix the slow bootup of Windows XP and there is hardly anything mentioned in this book about it. The negative tone of voice and his opinon of how to do things in XP do not help the book either. He seems to not like Microsoft products very well so he critizes how they made Windows XP with extra effects, just for marketing purposes when they are quite interesting to me and I'm sure others too. The spelling errors aren't too good either and it shows how little time he put into proof reading it before it was published, thus showing how little he cared. His knowledge is questionable now too since he is careless on the spelling mistakes and grammar errors too. I knew I should have bought the Microsoft Windows XP Inside/Out.

This was when the band consisted of Ben Dobson on vocals, Todd Clary on vocals and guitar, Ben Harper on guitar, Sean Mackin(goes by Wellman on this album) on violin, LP Parsons III on drums, and Warren Cooke on bass. For many of you, 3 of those names are foreign. When Ben D. and Todd left the band, Ryan joined and that was the band until Warren left after making the Underdog EP. But back to the main purpose of this. This album is alot different from what you maybe be used to hearing from Yellowcard. The music is harder. It's not as upbeat as their albums once Ryan joined the band in 2000. But for it's category or being a hard rock kind of album, it's a great album. I'd recommend for you to get it. It is also a great album to have because it shows a measurement of how far they have came since 1998.

Unfortunately, many did it in a clumsy way... and I am sure that I often do, too. But I appreciate those people that tried.

A first it was a bit dull but then it starts to pick up. Mike tells the stories of the people he meets along the way and a bit of their lives. I have to admit that it was interesting to read about others and how it seemed to me, that the people that had the least amount to give, were usually the first ones to help out and give to help others.In the end it is sort of a feel good book in that it you realize there is still kindness in people to help others when needed.

This confirms my belief that most people are good folks and want to help out when they can even when some are not in the 'privileged' group. He certainly seemed to find quite a few dealing with major problems of their own. This was a quick, enjoyable read. There is much to be said for presenting yourself as a 'clean cut' individual as Mike McIntyre did in 'The Kindness of Strangers'. He tremendously improved his odds of receiving help. I was disappointed that the writer's experience in NC, was not much better.

There were scary moments as you might predict, but there were also priceless moments that must have made the trip worthwhile for the author. I don't think I could ever do this myself. I like this book because of the unpredictability--you never knew what he would encounter the next day. It leaves you thinking about what's really important in life and about how technology and just day-to-day schedules have disconnected us from fellow human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astonishing journey into the heart and soul of America.","review":"So, you think you're broke? Imagine setting out to cross America on foot, with nothing in your wallet...in fact, no wallet. Relying entirely on \\"the kindness of strangers.\\" This is the challenge that journalist/author Mike McIntyre set for himself, and his adventures into the heart (and soul) ofAmerica are recorded in this highly addictive and uplifting book. With sharp, concise writing, McIntyre describes his encounters with various people who helped him, and draws strength from their simple acts of kindness and grace. The book is a quick read, and makes a terrific gift, particularly since it's a friendly-sized paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sorry to Say...Boring","review":"I was intrigued by this book, but each chapter was less engaging than the one before. The descriptions of potentially interesting characters were one dimensional. I didn't even feel like I got to know the author any better through the story. This was a waste of my free prime book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up lifting must read","review":"I have purchased numerous copies of this book to give to friends. After recently rediscovering book and reading for 5th time I was checking amazon to see if Mike McIntyre has any other titles. I felt compeled to write a review. In light of the recent World Trade center attack I really need something that confirmed my belief that good people are all around us. It really lifted me out of my gloom. A++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel books don't come any better","review":"I was in a trance from page one right through the epilogue. The author had the guts to do what so many of us are terrified of doing--to leave our lives for a couple of months, to step away and challenge our biggest fears. He describes his experience in a straightforward, no-punches-pulled manner that puts the reader right into his shoes. The reader sees \\"the real America\\"--a believable America, sees Life sliced right open, sees himself or herself vicariously exposed. The book shows heart, humor, whimsy, commitment, strength, vulnerability. A moving tale. A gift. I'd give it six stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"One of the best books I have had the pleasure to read. This is an amazingly talented writer. He is honest. Brutally honest. His words may not always be what you want to hear, but they are his real thoughts and feelings as they come to him. Once I started this book, I could not put it down, I was so sad when the end came.Since I am disabled and cant travel much, this book traveled for me. He is such a talented writer that I felt I was there with him. This book has given me hope in the human spirit. It has renewed my faith in this country and has helped me to see' that people are not always what they seem.Bravo!Thank you for writing this book and taking us along will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!","review":"Duck on a Bike is a really great book. It is about a duck that gets a wild idea and he gets on a bike and starts riding it. Duck rides around the farm. He sees a bunch of animals who thinks he's wonderful, and such a show off, and I'm better and stuff like that. Around the end of the book a bunch of kids rode on bikes to the farm and went inside. All of the animals started staring at the bikes. They all got on a bike. They all got the same crazy idea. \\"Lets get on the bikes\\". So they all rode around and around on the bikes. This is so awesome. David Shannon's pictures of the animals are so wonderfully expressed. My favorite expression is the horse. Is because you can tell the expression with out even looking at the words. I would tell you more but then you wouldn't be reading the book because I would of told you the whole book. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is a really great book that you won't ever forget.

This, however, is one of my favorite books to read aloud. I have a great opportunity to practice dramatic voices; I can be a superior acting horse, an arrogant cat, and a worshipful mouse. The illustrations are sensational. I wish I could find more books that are this much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, terrible book quality","review":"I purchased this storybook as a gift for my nephew after reading and loving the hardcover version with my own kids. This negative review is for the quality of this paperback edition. The paper and cover are extremely low quality--very flimsy. My copy arrived with a strange stain (almost like a coffee stain) inside the front cover, and the pages were all bent and wavy, as though the book was several years old and had been read quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this book for all children, but it's more than worth it to pay the few dollars extra for the hardback version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom","review":"Great book.

Duck on a Bike a delightful story about a dare-devil duck who sets off an bike riding adventure. On his journey around the farm, he greets other animas who in turn get jealous of his biking skills. In the end, all of the animals get a chance to join in on the fun!As an elementary school teacher, I highly recommend this book for children of all ages. The story is engaging and the illustrations capture the joy of the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"I saw this doll in Barbie collector magazine and she was pretty but then I saw her at Target and knew I had to add her to my collection.

She is a must have for Barbie lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"unpersuasive apostasy","review":"This book is a clear example of the materialist or pantheist apostasy that is growing in liberal theology. I would recommend instead reading Moreland's Beyond Death: Exploring the Evidence for Immortality, or tougher books like Swinburne's Evolution of the Soul or Taliaferro's Consciousness and the Mind of God. All these books defend a Christian view that will be a beter alternative for Christian theologians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful story of unjustice and cruelty","review":"Anna Rodriguez's story is one that truly describes the oppresive conditions inside Castro's jails, as you read this book, you will realize that there is a certain paradox in the way totalitarian regimes treat its disidents. In this book the prevailing ideology is Communism. In Jacobo Timmerman's \\"Prisoner without name, Cell without number,\\" the ideology is fascism. So the problem is not necessarily one ideology versus another. The problem is a totalitarian state of the extreme left or right which will use all its might to stifle its citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Research AP-397, Banana Plugs","review":"Work very well, the sound is grate, abut 2 min to install.I'm very happy and will recommend this product to any one looking for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse collection","review":"Overall, the CD is a lot of fun to listen. The opening song, Dance Band, is a great rendition of the events leading to the sinking of the Titanic - this is a must hear song. Dance Band has some very unique songs. The songs are diverse. This is no formula album. All songs (stories) tell a good story. The most sensitive song is \\"I Wonder What Happened to Him\\". \\"One Light in a Dark Valley\\" is Harry's attempt at the old 'negro spiritual'. It comes off very well and the ending is great if you like multi-part spiritual music. Harry fans will love this album. I wouldn't recommend it for those who aren't real familiar with Harry's music. I would suggest Greatest Stories Live as a Harry starter album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine delineation of mid-seventies America","review":"If ever one album spoke to the disillusioned folk generation, this one is it. From the allegory of the Titanic (the \\"unsinkable\\" USA) brought to its demise by \\"The iceberg on the starboard bow\\" to the rejuvenation of the dream in \\"There Only Was One Choice\\", this album speaks to anyone who ever felt that he could, should and must make a difference. And yet there is a lightness to all the tracks that keeps the feel from being preachy.Stopping along the way in the results of the sexual revolution (My Old Lady) and the loneliness of street life (Mercenaries) this album is finely crafted and brilliantly engineered. While it may not be a good Chapin starter album, it still ranks as his finest, and a great listen for anyone who remembers the sense of loss prevalent in post-Watergate America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Chapin Masterpiece","review":"I agree with the others on this one. Probably not the best choice for a Chapin starter album, but possibly his best album overall. This is the one album that truly conveys Harry's message. \\"There Only Was One Choice\\" is a 14-minute masterpiece that sums up The Book of Chapin to perfection. 'We Grew Up A Little Bit' is an awesome reflection of the strive-to-get-ahead work ethic. While not as deep as much of his other works, I really like 'Country Dreams'. But one of my favorite all-time Chapin pieces, one that I didn't fully appreciate for years, is 'Mercenaries'. Who else but Harry could write such a meaningful song about prostitutes and soldiers? Amazing collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain bin pickup","review":"After the reviews and samples, then seeing it so cheap, I gave Vince a whirl. Not a ball of fire or unlike anything else you have ever heard but not disappointed at all either. I find myself going back for more. Deserves a shot with better production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"After reading the 4 other reviews, and a review in the February 2000 issue of Guitar Player magazine, I was expecting a treat. Alas, I was sorely disappointed. The playing is average, at best, but the singing & song writing is even worse. This CD lacks any resemblence of soul or feeling. Tommy Castro does the blues/funk thing so much better.As for the claim that this is the best new guitarist since Clapton...well, I guess that reviewer doesn't listen to much blues. Put the price of this CD towards the recently released Luther Allison double CD, \\"Live in Chicargo\\" for an example of how blues should be played....with emotion, feeling and TONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blues?","review":"I bought this on a whim because it was on one of those Amazon blues lists and the artists listed agreed with my taste, but this one's a dog, no soul, no tone,weak vocals & guitar playing,too many effects for a blues player."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard worse, but alot better","review":"This albulm proves you can't believe everything you read.

He's a tremendous entertainer. He loves his work and it shows, the love of his music also comes out in his new Cd .

Don't waste your precious time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ImmorTalist Manifesto","review":"I have never read such derivative, kitchy, self-serving, cash-cow milking drivel in my entire life.

It is about poorly thought-out conspiracy theories explaining why the government and power players want you to get old and die. Furthermore, it does not contain ANY information about longevity sciences. It is a marketing tool to convince the reader to buy into the author's \\"Elixxir Program\\" to stay young-looking. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"He must be kidding!","review":"The book would only be a few pages long except that the author continually repeats himself. He claims to be fifty years old but will not reveal his true name so his age is impossible to verify.

No, preserving youth and health and life is my end, my highest good\\".His lack of interest in \\"hoarding filthy lucre\\" presumably explains why you can \\"Watch what the Master Coach eats, how he eats\\" for a mere $1,500, or \\"Change your age-Increasing and life-shortening Eating Habits for good!\\" for a paltry $69,995.Good grief. Are you beginning to get a sense of this guy's agenda?If you are drawn to a spiritual guide who boasts that \\"In the lovemaking department, I'm better than a pornographer's dream. I can get it up anytime, and keep it up 'forever.'\\" then perhaps he's the man for you.Otherwise, save yourself $69,985 and read Dr Walford's sane and sensible book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! Provocative! Trenchant!","review":"If you read just one book in this new year, or in the next ten, let The Immortalist Manifesto be the one. It just might save your life! Having read too many lightweight books claiming to be It, I believe this is IT - The Big Book we've been waiting for. It can - and this is no exaggeration - literally change the world as we know it.The Vatican and The Religious Right - \\"Mortalist\\" Religion - will hate this book! It could put them out of business.Be forewarned. This is not a polite book. It is in your face, and its arguments take no prisoners. It gives a new paradigm for our \\"Post-Mortalist Era.\\" Unlike other books which only criticizes \\"Extreme Market Capitalism\\" or \\"Globalization,\\" this book offers an exciting alternative vision.Written in deliberately plain, minimalist English, its analytical and polemical power packs a revolutionary punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up & Save Yourself","review":"The idealist society the author portrays can only be found in \\"paradise\\". It seems that he does not realize that our ultimate goal is to transcend societal and personal hardships by maturing and enduring, acquiring as much knowledge as we can, and then shedding gour earthly shells. He most definitely will not realize his \\"utopia\\" until he moves to the next level of consciousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense","review":"Just do a Google search and look at Elixxir's website. The contents therein should be enough to convince you how ridiculous this book is as well. Anyone who will rent you his \\"presence\\" for an evening for $1,500 (or how about a year for $1,000,000!!!) is a charlatan of the highest order. Gee, you mean I can ask Elixxir anything I want and watch him eat for only $1,500?! Give me a break.This is the only item I've reviewed on Amazon that truly deserves 0 stars. Unfortunately that isn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book contains essentially nothing new. It's a long, high school level essay making a series of disconnected, entirely obvious points about the merits of trying to live longer. A large element of the book deals with ethics. Here's the problem. The author himself is one of the least ethical writers I have ever encountered. Because he was spurned by Roy Walford when he tried to get Walford to help him promote his book, the author went on a rampage to discredit Walford and everything connected to Walford. He is even posting fake \\"reviews\\", under fake identities, of Lisa Walford's and Brian Delaney's new book, The Longevity Diet, trying to get people to buy his book instead. And this is someone who wants me to buy his book about ethics? My recommendation: don't buy this book, try to write your own instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuffing The Ballot Box","review":"I find it quite interesting that nearly all of the positive reviews of this book sound as though they were written by the same hand.

The insatiable and compulsive heart of capitalism is a function of our fear of Death and our yearning for Immortality [p. 165].\\"Yes, that's arguably true. But does this insight rise to the level of highlight-on-a-page goosebumps? Maybe so. And if you'd like more, you can travel to Sweden and spend a day with Elixxir himself: \\"Get a day-pass into The Elixxir Worldview.. . . $5,000 (excluding expenses for activities, which the student pays for; day starts later in the day as The Master Coach is not a morning person; weekdays only).\\" Sounds pretty capitalistic to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for the mindless","review":"Some of the most stupid drivel that you can read.

Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"better go with a different book","review":"The intro to this book states: \\"This book is not intended to and does not dispense dietary, medical, or financial advice.If you are looking for dietary or medical advice, maybe go with a book by a doctor or scientist.I cannot recommend this book to anyone. The Manifesto style writing is repetitive, and lacking details or scientific evidence. The author states that scientific evidence supports his diet, but the book does not mention what he eats, other than \\"Low calorie, low fat\\".

I stumbled upon \\"How to be a pirate\\", second in the series. It has as much humor as the first book, that means a lot! All the original characters are in the book, including a few new people and dragons. I reccommend this book to all people. If you haven't read the first book in the series \\"How to train your dragon\\" then you should read that first. There are also pictures through-out the book.

This is absolutely my favorite book of all time, one that I have re-read over and over for the past ten years. The love Varian has for Jana is the stuff women dream about and for me that is the whole point of a romance novel, to be taken out of reality for a few hours. Janelle Taylor is a fabulous author who creates memorable characters you remember even long after the book is finished.I would also recommend the sequel Stardust and Shadows which is just as good. Beware of the love scenes, as another reader said they are not for the faint of heart :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Madness","review":"There's a reason this thing is out of print. The characters are shallow caricatures of stereotypes. The writing is poor and the plot predictable. There is a romance, and there is lust, which is really what the book is about. It's just done so badly that it becomes more amusing then anything else. But what truly offended me about this book was it's science fiction designation. Space ships, zap guns and humans in alien suits don't make a story SF."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hideous book, but....","review":"If you are looking for a trashy porn novel with sex scenes that read like a play-by-play from a game of twister with tripple-jointed aliens, this could well be the book for you. The author seems to have moral sensibilities not too unlike those of John Norman of \\"Gor\\" series fame, as evidenced by the following quote: \\"He shuddered to think he might never have discovered or experienced this if Jana hadn't entered his life, if they hadn't yielded to the chemistry between them, if he hadn't purchased her at the auction.\\" While an abysmal book, Moondust and Madness makes a great party game: Open up to a random page and start reading until you crack up. I think the record was half a page, when we played this game in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disturbing","review":"It disturbs me to think that a woman wrote this book.

The book focuses on creative thinking, which is a nice change from the much-adopted discipline of analysing largely the \\"rational\\" parts of the mind.The main premise of the book is that creativity is enabled by a feedback loop in the brain, whereby what we see is interpreted very basically and that information fed back to the sections of the brain dealing with vision. This enhances what we perceive as important in the object and also makes seemingly simple things like vision very subjective.The book does tend to be a little too broad and all over the place at times but there's still a unified organisation. There are plenty of diagrams and references to culture and mysticism in terms of the function of the brain.

One Of The Most Underappreciated Movies Ever","review":"Arguably the best Horror/Science Fiction hybrid ever made. The survivors of a sinking ship find refuge on an abandoned oil rig that appears to have been used for alot more than drilling, with all manner of esoteric scientific equipment on board. A fine premise to start with, but it's where \\"Proteus\\" goes from there that takes this well beyond anything I ever expected. Apparantly a relatively low-budget film, but it certainly doesn't look like it - tremendous production and craftsmanship on every level, with great acting and a truly terrifying creature both in physical and psychological terms. Directed by \\"Hellraiser\\" special effects creator Bob Keen, with a small appearance by Doug Bradley, this is every bit as good as the best of the Hellraisers. Essential for any fan of the \\"Pitch Black\\"/\\"Riddick\\" series, \\"Aliens\\", \\"Species\\", the \\"Resident Evil\\"s (the movies or the games), \\"Dark City\\" or \\"The Abyss\\". Exceptional!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Carnosaur, now this. H.A.Knight must be annoyed.","review":"This is the adaptation of a Harry Adam Knight novel called 'Slimer'. The book is a superbly tense and gripping tale. That's why I found the film no more than yet another disgustingly wasted licence.The plot involves a group of shipwrecked people who come across a seemingly deserted oil-rig. They soon meet up with a scientist and find the rig was once used as a genetic research base and that their most unpleasant creation is stll around.Only very loosely tied to the plot of the book. The characters are boring and cliched and the monster looks like a cut-price Jaws on legs. Even the appearance of Doug Bradley (Pinhead in Hellraiser) can't help save this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"good college textbook, should be cut to 900 pages","review":"Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has nothing to do with accounting.

Entire page of 964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with the subject but the extra pages makes you think you got something for the high priced book.

Also note that the cap on the machine doesn't seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too much.Keep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later. It's best on a stand 3-4 feet off the ground.Overall build quality is very nice.

It worked well. however was disappointed that you can only fog about once every 5-10 minutes as the fogger needs to reheat to work repeatably. The fog plume will fill a bedroom or living room but that is about it. Hence, will not fill a large room with enough fog unless you continually push and hold down on the remote control fog button.... waiting every 5 minutes too!!! This is NOT good if you are a DJ trying to mix... too distracting. pros: it works as advertised but only for small rooms cons: needs to cycle and need to hold down button to generate fog. Will likely keep and just add another perhaps 700 model or more expensive unit now that I know what foggers are capable of.... I was shown a nice demo of a $300 machine in the store: filled a huge room with fog in like a minute!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great","review":"I used this for a haunted house I set up in my garage.

I don't know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but I have another can of juice I bought to use later.

I use mine primarily as a lighting effect tool. I have no intention of filling up school gyms with fog when I DJ, I just want enough to let the lights blow peoples' minds. I've used this fogger for 2 events so far, no problems. I do find that I have to fire it more often than I would a 700 or 1000 watt fogger, but that's pretty obvious. I did NOT use the included fluid... I went straight to Froggy's and bought some Backwood Bay. I haven't had any problems with clogs or anything yet as well. I would LOVE if the rocker didn't have to be pressed the entire time while emitting fog, I wish it was more of an on/off switch.

Since the book is written in short, paragraph-long sections, one can jump all around, which is really how to read it. If you do you may glean numerous insights. Though prone to being pretty pretentious, Sherman has thought deeply about his work as a musician, pianist and teacher. He understands how mere technique does not make an artist, how simply hours of practice does not make a great pianist, and how music competitions are death to performers: in other words, things that need to be said! Sherman is able to convey these insights, and a patient, intelligent reader should be able to get beyond his admittedly weak style as a writer and make many discoveries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarks that miss the mark","review":"I like Sherman's approach to music and agree with him on much of his critique of modern music-making and culture. It is a pity, then, that his good points are lost in a seemingly endless series of brief remarks without structure. I'm sure this book would rate 5 stars if it was rewritten into a series of essays; the current format lacks the framework needed to make his observations cogent."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much written - yet so little said !","review":"Regrettably, I feel I cannot justify this book taking up ANY room on my bookshelf. Then I thought of giving it away, but I wouldn't do that to anybody I know.What was he thinking ? Only years of academic study would equip you with enough prentension to understand what he is trying to get at - is he trying to make a point ? I kept reading, hoping for something enlightening, without result.My advise is - Don't waste your time or money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It feel that Mr. Sherman is capable of better writing than this rather dubious collection of cerebral flatus. I get the impression that he is trying to prove how clever he is, whilst simultaneously trying to make the reader feel inadequate. The content of his musings range from remarkably insightful to pretentious claptrap. Reading the book is like panning for gold, you have to sort through a great deal of aggregate to find a little gold dust - but it is there if you have the patience.I am not familiar with the author's piano work, but as a student of the instrument I can tell his has considerable knowledge of the subject. His writing however would benefit from a dose of pragmatism, reduction of pretension and condescension.On the whole much is promised but little is delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating? Pretentious? Dull? All of the above?","review":"This book offers proof that you can't just throw together your journal jottings and expect to make a readable work.

I am an avid reader with a college education, so my trouble is not illiteracy. It is the format of the book - a rolling description of what happened on stage at one of his seminars. It is written like a play with stage direction. The dialogue might have made sense if the author had left out unimportant fill like \\"um...am I supposed to be using empathy now or how I usually speak?\\" I could barely follow it, and after a handful of attempts found myself frustrated because I believe there is some good material somewhere in there!

The game is very standard. simple backgrounds, yet fitting for the martial arts genre. Many different styles of fighters with certain distinguishing stances and strikes. when you begin play, you fight a couple characters, and the game seems alright, untill you kill a few more and it's over. NO story line with the fighters you have, no real point except the fighting, very sad. I looked past that expecting the fighter designer to raise up where the regular game seemed to drop off. When you begin to create your own fighter you soon realize that you can only use the characters that already exist, so the chance of variety is quickly killed off. The idea is very good, and it could have been done alot better. Making a fighter is very long and complex, definately not for the average gamer. Overall: Too much work for such little result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to me","review":"Ok I can understand the merit of these bad reviews, but I think your being overly critical.

Plain and simple. I felt the so called \\"professional critic\\" missed the boat on this game entirely.

I knew before I bought this that the audio and the video were not synced up; however, I thought that I would get 30 minutes of raw live footage of the MC5. WRONG! This DVD has maybe five minutes of live footage of the MC5 that has been annoyingly sped up, slowed down, colorized, looped, etc. This is absolutely and totally worthless. Just when you think Music Video Distribution can't sink any lower something like this comes out. Is this John Sinclair's attempt to destroy the legacy of the MC5 or cash in on the legacy of the MC5 at any cost?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some tantilizing live footage....BUT...","review":"There are enough spectacular glimpses of the MC5 performing (and also what I believe to be the entire \\"video single\\" that Elektra released to promote \\"Kick Out the Jams\\") to more than justify the purchase of this DVD, but the repetition of non-band clips, the annoyingly dated Joshua-light-show-style psychedelia, and way too much accent on the political and philosophical cult of John Sinclair quickly gets old. Lets all hope that Wayne and Michael and Dennis (the surviving members of the band) will someday allow the release of \\"A True Testimonial,\\" a truly reverent and lasting documentary of the MC5's history with more and better concert performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"MC5: MTV-style","review":"First off I enjoy Leni's photos and always will. Her film making talents were OK as home movies, but this mish-mash with some 3 or 4 different bootleg recordings is a bit much. At best there are about 12 minutes of the 5 here, but with reverses, color drops and posterizations she was able to milk it out for about a half hour. A simple one shot run through with commentary by the remaining members would be fine. The sound is the best we can ever hope to get as well, but a single source would have been sufficient. The bonus feature with John is a bit embarrassing. If that's how he wants to be remembered, fine. I've seen him doing poetry readings and talked with him on occasion but this is sad.

The directions are simple enough: Spray the stain, let it soak for at least a minute, wipe up with a damp (and clean) cloth. While I will give this product some credit for lifting a portion of the color out, it still doesn't remove the stain. As they say in the law enforement vernacular, the evidence remains.So if it's complete stain removal you're after, PROFESSIONAL (yeah, okay) RESOLVE SPOT & STAIN CARPET CLEANER is going to come up short. But in all fairness, I've yet to find any carpet cleaner on the market that effectively removes stains. I guess I'm just too messy. Hand me that cranberry juice.--D.

I assumed from everyone's trust in Resolve branded products for their low prices and good performance, I bought this to clean out the stain. This was definitely no sloution for me. Only the slightly colored stains would come out. Everything else was still red-orange and even noticeable in the dark. I have bought generic Albertsons carpet solution on the stain and it worked wonderfully. This proves this Resolve product needs to be redone.

I've been a trance/dance fan for 10 years and there is no CD I turn to more than George Acosta's Awake. Matt Darey's Euphoria is the only rival I can think of for absolute climax power. If you want your trance to rock you from start to finish then this is the CD for you. It's both beautiful and hard at the same time with a great mix of heavy beats to go along with floating melodies. Awake is a journey that can't be broken up into track analysis. The CD has to be experienced as a whole and true fans won't want to hear it any other way. Awake is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as I heard him","review":"I've heard George Acosta spin at the Shadowlounge in Miami. Trust me, his recent release \\"Awake\\" and his previous mix \\"Members of the X\\" are no way close to what he can actually do live.

The music is very melodic and dreamy, the beats SWEET and sassy. The cd includes many hot trance anthems including ATB and Goureyella, remixed by Acosta. The music is energizing but at the same time relaxing. The cd is over before you know it, leaving you craving for more! George Acosta is a very talented DJ.

This album is very repetitive, and becomes boring after the first 5-6 songs. Not to mention that I have heard all of the songs on this album before. This type of Trance tends to be a quest to see how many different patterns and rhythms one synthesizer voice can be used. Also on this album is the cheesiest breakbeat that I have ever heard. Haven't you people ever heard of Sasha?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much noise!","review":"This CD is one of the worst I have ever picked up. I would not recommend this CD to ANYONE.

I was surprised by the more serious ones, but I do feel they are a great progression for his voice. What I didn't like were the plethora of cutesy quizzes. After the third one, I felt they lost the attraction Ford probably meant, and they became tedious. Overall though, the collection is still vivacious and brilliant, but it does seem to lack a bit of that spunky skewering that he's most known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing--both dull and stagnant","review":"I have been a fan of Michael Thomas Ford's previous three Queer Life books, and was incredibly disappointed by this latest offering. Rarely have I read a book and felt that an author had nothing to say, but that an anxious agent was forcing him to write anyway. That's the exact feeling I got from this. In addition to a lot of amateurish fillers along the line of a Cosmo Quiz (Are you a Drama Queen? Are you a Leather Man?), Ford whines and drones with no significant insight into either his own life or the lives of gay men in general (I mean, really, does the fact that a lot of gay men diet really break new ground?). The book does offer a few solid stories, but readers looking forward to Ford's latest will be sorely disappointed. It lacks both the humor and wit of his earlier works, and really is one of the most strained and forced pieces of writing I've read in years. When funny ain't funny it's deadly, and most of this book is funny that ain't funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ordered black and you sent me BLUE","review":"I love these pen refills.

He's always in with changes in the music scene, often leading the way. This album is no different. He's using bass and beats from the house and trance scene with lyrics and arrangments only Bowie could pull off.Don't look for Ziggy Stardust here, or even his pop classic style from Let's Dance. No this is something totally different, and that's what makes it great.You should like this album if you like truely progressive rock like Queen, Pink Floyd, and of course David Bowie, but are willing to be very open minded. The sound is more like a lighter side of Nine Inch Nails or heavy dance mixes. Of course it's hard to ever describe a Bowie album, so listen to the samples. Then if you even have a guess that you might like this, get the CD, it will be way better then you imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Bowie album of the past 25 years","review":"Every time a journalist blabs about the latest Bowie album they inevitably say it's his best since the glory days of \\"Scary Monsters\\". Enough of that. \\"Earthling\\" is Bowie's best album of the past 25 years. It's consistent all the way through and it hasn't been stuffed with filler tracks to pump up the playing time.

In the age of industrial music and sampling, Bowie followed suit with this Techno driven effort. Receiving some of the strongest critical reviews in years, Earthling incorporated experiments in British Jungle and Drum 'n' Bass. The singles were released via the internet and included Telling Lies, Little Wonder, and Deadman Walking. The track I'm Afraid of Americans was used in the film Showgirls and was remixed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails for single release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Club/Techno Music...eck!!!","review":"Like many other people that have reviewed this album I'm an avid Bowie fan and find something to enjoy in most all of his albums. But I detest club/techno music as much as I detest rap music. Had I read the one negitive review regarding this album I may have saved myself six dollars. You can add all the distorded power chords you want to these songs but it essentially comes down to the mechanical sound of a drum machine and synthizers. The year was 1997 and U2 tried a similar experiment with 'Pop' and failed as well. You can't fault Bowie for continualy trying to re-invent himself but this was an experiment I could have lived without.Alas all is not lost, there are a few highlights here 'Seven Years in Tibet' and 'I'm Afraid of Americans' are good examples of what can happen when Techno/Pop/Rock are morphed into one song.

The only saving grace is Rod actually sings Tonight's the Night live--to a recorded backing track with Britt Ekland even doing her French thing backstage live. That is semi-interesting. So if you wanna pay $12 for one song--go for it. But it's a quick four minutes. NOT RECOMMENDED. All Rod fans looking for good live footage should get LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL, VH1 Storytellers, and/or the 1984 Rod Stewart Concert Video. Vagabond Heart is also passable.

Even @ the reduced price of $34.54 per pair, it's more of the same MADE IN CHINA stuff; when set up, they wobble on the long axis, which might be a safety issue and when folded, they're difficult to carry when the legs keep folding open... poor tolerances. Sorry, but I wouldn't buy another pair of these even if they were $20 per. If you expect quality and work for the money you spend, find a Tote-A-Horse sawhorse dealer (Fulton Corp) and buy something MADE IN USA.

In detail. I have no idea where this information was obtained, but I seriously doubt it holds true. This was the worst book I have read on him. Maybe he was bisexual, maybe he wasn't. And while, yes, it is fine to discuss it briefly, this seemed to overtake the entire book.

I went to his hometown last July and I met several people who knew him personally. When asked, \\"What was Jimmy like?\\" One woman said, \\"Jimmy was all boy.\\" I think that answered my question. Meeting people who knew him, and seeing his hometown you could almost feel him there. It's time that people need to stop trying to profit from this poor guy by saying he's gay. It's crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Terrible book............","review":"A true Dean fan knows that this book has nothing by degrading information........I wasted money on this book......There are too many good books on Dean.Don't waste your time or money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash, Lurid trash!","review":"This book is disgusting.It makes James out to be nothing more than a cheap , gay slut. Its whole agenda is to paint James Dean as a closeted homosexual who used women as a cover. It disputes his relationships with Pier Angeli and Liz Sheridan. He had very deep real relationships with both women. Yes, James was bisexual, but he was not gay. He liked women very much. If you want to know about the real James, avoid this book.The one good thing about the book I can say is that it has several beautiful pictures of James."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lurid, badly-written biography of mysterious cultural icon","review":"This book can best be described as \\"lurid,\\" with a sort of \\"oh, wow\\" attitude. It venerates Dean at the same time that it wants to cut him down to a common street hustler. Alexander is a terrible writer. His style is choppy and he often uses the wrong everyday word. Also, some of his facts are wrong, such as having Dean and friends hitchhike to Indiana via Des Moines. Not even a badly-educated actor would do that! The reader will find this startling at times but not very informative"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the usual subjective perception and creative projection","review":"Jimmy biographies often say as much about the writer as they do about their subject. Books by women with whom he had affairs often suggest he was primarily straight; books by gay men often suggest he was essentially gay. The fact of the matter is, he had an equal number of sexual relationships with men and women so if we're to be intellectually honest, we have to say he was bisexual. Anything beyond that is personal projection and that type of projection is in evidence a lot in this book. Unless you've read a LOT of biographies (as I have over thirty-five years of Dean fandom), it would be hard to know where Jimmy leaves off and the author's sexual fantasies begin. But it's not nearly as badly written as some other similar biographies are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid and frank...this book pulls no punches!","review":"The graphic deatail of Dean's sexual encounters accounts for only 3 pages of this 300+ page book. It is not the \\"smut\\" others claim it to be as this author explores these encounters in detail as oppesed to some of his contemporaries who gloss over Dean's known male lovers in one or two sentences. If one wants a truly vivid account of how Dean lived, how difficult his childhood was at times and how his life came to a tragic end this book is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent","review":"Yes, this biography is numbingly obsessed with James Dean's sexuality, but it's also terribly written and edited.It's full of redundancies, horribly constructed sentences, narrative strands that are left hanging, and amateurish reporting. (Although the author tries to overcompensate with an excessively detailed, boring account of the days leading up to Dean's fatal car crash.)Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful Thinking","review":"As a dedicated Dean fan since the age of 5, having read many pieces about the actor, including this one, I would say that this book is very slanted towards the author's POV. Also, having known a fair number of performers personally, it is fair to say that many people in the world of show business are rather flexible regarding sex. As far as Dean's preference, nothing has been proven by this cut & paste job. Anyway, what's the big deal about it? Would it have made him a better man or actor if he had been gay or straight? It just looks like the author is saying, \\"Yay for us!\\" If the author would reflect on the glories of being gay, is he proud of the fact that the Rev. DeWeerd was a sexual predator & pedophile?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Alexander's just dared to write about a taboo","review":"Everyone James Dean fan knows he was'nt straight, whether youlike it or not. Paul Alexander was just the first who dared to focuson it. Indeed, this book is from the first line to the last one consecrated to the sexual life of 'Jimmy', and is getting a bit/too embarrassing in some passages. But as Dean is worldwide one of the biggest and most popular icons of the 20th century, it's just an evidence that this book had to be written once. Jimmy WAS gay or at least bisexual. If there are even books published about the dresses princess Diana wore, it's just normal that there is written about Dean's sexuality. In general, Paul Alexander's book is very popular written, but I think we may believe the sources he quotes literally..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A honest look at the man not the icon.","review":"The James Dean most of the world new was so far from the real man. That truth is this books strongest point.For years in the interest of keeping Dean's legacy \\"marketable\\" much his life was kept in the dark. Through the conservative 50's and until realitivly recently, basic elements such as Dean's homosexuality remaind unspoken.Ironicly many of these truths credit Dean with being a true Rebel, and not simply a two dimentional screen icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexander the not-so-great","review":"I've read several James Dean books and this is by far the worst book on the actor I've ever read in terms of its content and style. It seems to me that the author was on a mission to \\"prove\\" that James Dean was gay. However, there's a lot of conjecture in the book, making his work highly suspect. People who KNEW James Dean considered Dean experimental or bisexual. The emphasis and vulgar description on Dean's purported homosexual affairs is written like a trashy gay novel. Much of the rest of the information in this book is common knowledge to any Dean fan.For great books on James Dean's life, I recommend John Gilmore's \\"Live Fast-Die Young: My Life With James Dean\\" and Jay Hyams \\"James Dean: Little Boy Lost\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read","review":"This is a horrible biography of James Dean.

If you keep that in mind, you will enjoy it.I admit I saw Yumiko Shako in \\"The Princess Blade\\" before I bought Godzilla, so I was hoping for at least one bikini scene. Maybe next time.The movie moves along pretty quickly without a lot of baloney.

The most streamlined and most Godzilla-like Mecha-Godzilla ever. But it's a little too much like godzilla X Megaguirus. Still, It's good, but not as good as Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S.Get this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Godzilla film!","review":"I read a number of the reviews for this movie and none of them mention how different this movie is from the many that came before it. It has a very human aspect to it, the plot does not just begin with Godzilla or some other monster showing up and subsequent events. It shows the evolution of Mechagodzilla's creation and all those involved from scientists to pilots. And for the first time we have a Godzilla movie where a woman soldier takes center stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a die hard fan, but was disappointed with this film. The storyline seemed way too contrived, especially between the female lead and the doctor who has an interest in her. I've seen better fight scenes in the previous 2 films. There were times when Godzilla just stood there while he was blasted with lasers and missles.Most of the special effects were pretty good, but there were some real boners too. For instance, they added a black and white computer animated sequence of the 1954 Godzilla. This scene is just a couple of seconds long, but very poorly done.I am a huge fan of the 1993 Godzilla vs. Mecha-Godzilla film and thought that this entry was a lot less entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"This movie is not the best.

Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla went right back to the same formula as other Godzilla movies....poor story, poor special effects, and overall uninteresting. It blows me away how a movie like GMK can do so many things never seen before in a Godzilla movie (like awesome special effects, unique camera shots, a unique story that really moved), and then this one to be such a disappointment....nothing I haven't seen before. This is the first in a trilogy featuring MechaGodzilla.....let's hope the next two are better.If you are a Godzilla fan, you must own it, but don't rush out to get it. If you're not a Godzilla fan....purchase GMK, in my opinion, the ultimate Godzilla movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy crap...","review":"This movie is so cool, I need a freakin' poet to decribe how totally awsome this Godzilla movie is!!!

This film is seriously bad. The FX are terrible and, overall, outdated. The acting, storyline, dialogue, plot and characters are silly and shallow. A good Godzilla movie can definately be done with great realistic FX, decent story and characters, why do they keep on making this trash?

Overall: MEDIOCRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Godzilla shows up, the government builds Mechagodzilla (here called Kiryu for some reason), and they fight. The subpar special effects, dull plot, slow pacing, and forgettable characters make this a dud. The new Mechagodzilla is visually unimpressive and does not move the way a giant robot would, unlike the superior 1993 version, which actually looked metallic. The concept of Kiryu being built around the bones of the 1954 Godzilla was interesting, but not explored to any real depth. While the Kiryu-gone-wild sequence is well-done, everything else about the film is utterly inept. Why did Toho keep bringing back Masaaki Tezuka to direct these films?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to match the gamera hesei series......At last!!!!","review":"When I saw gxmg last month, I was convinced that this was the best godzilla movie I had seen.Everything was damn perfect,the story,the plot,the special effects,the score(although I was kind of dissapointed at the fact that there wasn't any of Akira Ifukube's music in it).Yumiko Shaku did an outstanding performance as Akane(the main star in the movie,apart from Kiryu and godzilla)and the special effects were almost as good as the ones from the gamera hesei series.It wasn't as dramatic as GMK but there was certainly a lot more action.The story was the best in all of the godzilla movies.One of my favorite scenes is when Kiryu starts attacking everything on sigth when he hears godzilla's roar.This is the kind of movie that will satisfy all godzilla fans and leave them looking forward to seeing godzilla:Tokyo S.O.S.A must see movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After being very disappointed with \\"GMK\\", I was excited to hear that Godzilla X Mechagodzilla was supposed to be very different from GMK, much darker, and using the familiar Godzilla suit.I think I'm starting to understand that Japan loves bad CG. That's the only explanation I can think of. So many shots look like they were composited using Photoshop. The battles are boring. The acting is surprisingly the only thing worth talking about.The DVD has no Godzilla-related extras. Only trailers for other strange badly CG'd Japanese movies.Unless you like bad japanese-style CG, you should avoid this Godzilla title and stick with stuff from the 90's.

Beam Piper.He would have done much better to actually read them: Piper, for one, wrote much, much better alternate history than this stuff, and as for Heinlein, his juveniles never talked down to his readers like Turtledove does.Don't buy this book: borrow it from a library, if you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't There a Zero Star Rating?","review":"If there were, I would certainly use it in this instance. Thankfully I didn't purchase this book but picked it up at the library, or I'd be angry rather than merely bemoaning the time I spent speed-reading this flat book. Turtledove used the Many Anvils of Fur Revulsion, Slave Hating, and Taste Judging to bludgeon any interest a reader may have had in the story. I kept checking the book jacket to see if I may have inadvertently missed a \\"Young Adult\\" icon. (There was none.) I, like another reviewer, simply didn't care whether Jeremy and Amanda made it out and back to their hometimeline or even if their parents were alive. I was half hoping the book would end with them stuck in the Roman Empire - would have served them right!

Let me preface by saying I did not know this was for young adults. However, with a good book, that should not matter. Gunpowder Empire follows the Solter family who spend their summers on the frontier of the Roman Empire trading items such as Swiss Army knives for grain. Jeremy and Amanda are the teen-age children who get left in charge when their parents must return to the present for an emergency. Of course they get stuck there and are unable to communicate with anyone from home. Various problems present themselves and are neatly fixed by the end of the book.

Piper's Paratime Patrol-related books (especially Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen) I hoped for something similar from Turtledove. Alas, I found I just didn't care enough about the characters to look forward to reading what was coming up next in their story. Turtledove seems to try to make them interesting but there are plot eccentricities that jar. Why would anyone sell gaudy wrist-watches and Swiss Army knives in a Roman time line that also has developed a hyper-bureaucracy that keeps track of every little thing that stands out from the bland norm? Or take payment only in grain when buyers offer gold? Or \\"go for a walk\\" when there's a Lithuanian army coming to invest the town?Turtledove could stand a refresher re-reading Piper, or, for authors whose characters I care about: Connie Willis whose plague-year story \\"Doomsday Book\\" is searing and wonderful; and Lois Bujold whose Miles Vorkosigan stories are, well, great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably bad","review":"Harry Turtledove has carved out a niche writing alternative history novels, most of which suffer from serious sprawl but still retain interest from his attention to likely timelines. This novel, which is apparently intended as a Young Adult SF, is not only poorly thought-out, but stupifyingly dull. The central characters are irritating and the \\"alternate\\" world that Turtledove has sketched out is far less interesting than a straightforward historical novel would have been, much less as the logical extension of an alternative history. I can't imagine it holding the attention of any young reader, even one ravenous for science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior High material","review":"This story represents a lot of hard work for the author but it's not much of an adult reader.

The story description was enough to get me interested and the story concept seemed pretty good. I can't believe that it was written by Turtledove. There was never any suspense on where the story was going or where it would end up, the characters were a little superficial. Though the story is not similar, for some reason I was reminded of \\"Farmer in the Sky\\" by Heinlein which I read a long time ago. The story was simple and pretty boring.

I can't tell you how disappointed I was. This cologne also comes with no shrink wrap or factory seal so it has an apprearance of being used.

I must say, the pictures were of a so-so quality, but other than that, this camera really sucks. The auto features are rather lacking in quality, but then again, I really dislike using auto, so it may just be me. Then, I compared the general feel of it to my old Ricoh KR-5, and this camera feels, well, junky. It is overly heavy, and not because of sturdy construction. Canon, Minolta and Ricoh are constructed sturdily, not this one. This has what I would describe as a flimsy feel, and when used in manual mode, well, the camera does not feel up to par when compared to every other brand, model, and make out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon","review":"The best thing about Nikon is not the body itself.

Watching the concert closely, it almost seems like the sound doesn't seem to be quite in sync at times with what you are seeing. And I have no idea what the purpose of the drummer wearing underwear and lipstick for the duration of the concert, and taping his eyes and mouth shut for \\"Rock Steady\\" adds to the concert.

This book -- and, for that matter, the whole series of Ms. Phillip's \\"design\\" books -- relies on the gullibility of the nouveau rich masses to whom they apparently represent the quintessence of \\"good taste.\\" Better to look to some of Linda Dannenberg and Guy Bouchet's handsome photographic imagery of the \\"real thing\\" if you're searching for some true insights into what elements are integral to the often understated but always correct esthetics of French design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secrets of French Design","review":"Great coffee table book; A quick read for decorators who are new to French design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets of French Design by B.

I have a few of the FLA CDs and the other side projects as well. This disc kinda fits right in between other FLA and Delerium. It is a lot like the Cryogenic Studios release which I like slightly better than this one. Within Implode, it is easy to spot out samples of Fatboy Slim, Billy Corgan, and NIN. A lot like the Crystal Method stuff in FLAvour. Therefore, as a whole it isn't the best, but one of the best. Hardwired and Neural Implant may never be topped though."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like good music, than get this cd.","review":"This CD contains songs that remind you of the last 3 or 4 cd's all mixed into one. Song 5 sounds as if it were left off of Millenium. This is a must have to all of the FLA fans out there. I like the direction that BILL LEEB is taking the band in, even without R. Fulber. GET IT. Personal favorites include song 5 and song 7. I liked the last CD (Flavour of the Weak) but it was a little too much techno, this is not the same. CULLOM CORNELIUS"},{"rating":"2","title":"FLA at their Best","review":"This is an excellent album , as if you didn't notice that yet.It is very sad to see that not many people listen to Industrial any more, I am in an Industrial band and not to many people are into it, but anyway I love this band it's my #1 favorite!Why does everyone not like the lyrics? I think theyre O.K."},{"rating":"2","title":"My second taste of FLA","review":"FLA was for a long time at the forefront of electronica/ambient industrial beats before Peterson, Leeb & Fulber created new sounds from old cloth with their side projects the two that made it were Noise Unit and Delerium. FLA however has been around since 1989 when Fulber and Leeb came together and mixed many albums since then. With age and experience and their many side projects they have fulfilled many fans delight.This album 'Implode' is my second taste of FLA, having purchased this album through amazon from the reviews. It is not a bad album at all but my one complaint is that it runs out of steam after song 6. Hence the 4 stars only. In saying this the first 5 songs are monumental successes and will tantalize any fan of strong industrial and electronica themes. Many of the early on songs like Prophecy, Falling and Synthetic Forms are soft dance rhythms.I enjoyed the first part of this album and I am now a fan of FLA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a movie with missing scenes...","review":"I understand that this is a fast, difficult game at times and that is why, when you actually break down and buy a strategy guide (which I'm loathe to do in the first place) you expect it to be really right on. I encountered three places in the game (incidently, more than half of the times I looked something up in the guide) where I was baffled even with the guide. It either gave no detail or skipped over the problem entirely. For all I know, this was intentional but when you shell out the duccats for a guide, you expect some degree of competancy from the people writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"The book starts with the short flashbacks of the boy,through his childhood and the story slides mysteriously in the dark shades of his memories in istanbul,the darkest city ever in this book.The whole story is comprehensive enough to gaze at the beauty of this ancient sparkling city,the author tries to immaculate the readers and he does..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring Book Award","review":"This book was our latest book group selection. Sounded like it SHOULD have been good, but it was so boring I couldn't finish, and I don't give up easily. Perhaps his other work is better, but I don't think I'll ever find out, being too scared off by this one. One longs for the directness of vintage Elmore Leonard--like GET TO THE POINT. Thin little plot and endless circuitous passages unfolding in an unnecessarily confusing way. You don't even get much feeling about Istanbul, perhaps the saddest thing of all. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"What can I say? I hate to swim upstream against all the readers who loved the book, but what the heck, I didn't. I've gone back and reread the reviews, trying to determine if it was me, or if the emperor isn't wearing clothes. I still haven't made the determination, but will take the blame, chalking it up to a mismatch of expections.I'm traveling to Turkey and wanted a novel to acquaint me with its people and culture. The story line, the mystery of a missing wife and columnist in Istanbul, seemed like an interesting vehicle. The story line though, is way, way down the list on the author's agenda, an agenda that seems to be headed with baring his (and presumably the Turkish) soul. Its a surealistic therapy session of stories within stories - dense, dark, complex, repetitious, and for me, a tedious exercise.The novel was simply too much work for minimal reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfull","review":"I have recently finished Orhan Pamuk's Black book, and I have read itin original. This is the fourth Pamuk book I have read (I liked his other works too), and I undestand (and I also agree) why they refer this book as \\"Pamuk's masterpiece\\". The book gives glimpses of Itanbul's life in 60-70's, it blends modernizm with sufi thinking, and it has references to comtemporary political discussions in turkey, struggle of turkish identity between east and west, etc. The book has so many details, which makes it sometimes a difficult, but definetely an enjoyable read. Especially Chapter 2, \\"the day bosphourus's dries up\\", is my favorite part, which I have read numerous times, and everytime I read it, I noticed a new detail.Sure, this book is not a thriller, and some people can, and will find it boring. However, as one master once said \\"this book is like wine, and everybody drinks water\\".I strongly suggest it, if you like literature you will enjoy it. It is among my favorites now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A puzzling English translation.","review":"I suspect a far richer story awaits the fortunate reader of Turkish. I was knocked sideways by the \\"Douglas Fairbanks\\" reference and never felt I could trust the translator again. I am curious to know if others, able to read both the original and English versions might offer me additional insights? The story is interesting, some of the musings are exquisite and the rambling around Istanbul at all hours is delicious. That being said, is she [Guneli Gun] putting her own words [or lack thereof] into this author's writing? Her repetition of odd words, such as \\"geezer\\" led me to believe her English vocabulary is archaic. In an attempt to solve this additional mystery of The Black Book, I will read her own published work, trying to assume her writing style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating poetry","review":"I read each page of this book twice, to come back again and to read it for a third time. It is one of the most beautiful prose I have ever read.As he describes so well, Orhan Pamuk is a \\"picturesque writer\\" and the poetry in his imagery so devastating. There is so much melancholy and a deep sense of tragedy in this piece that it is beyond my imagination.I had already read Snow and his memoire Istanbul. But \\"The Black Book\\" is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzz......","review":"Unless you have particular interest in Istanbul or modern philosphy this book is a waste of your time. Or maybe there's something particularly beautiful about the writing that is lost in translation? I just didn't get it.My Name is Red, another of Pamuk's books is wonderful. I kept reading this one expecting the same magic but was left disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bore","review":"Halfway through this book I had an incredible urge to hurl it at the wall. But I paid for it, so I forced myself to finish it. I was sorry that I forced myself. It was depressing. I don't understand how people can rave about this book. A history and geography lesson of Istanbul would have been much more interesting. Pamuk abandoned the usual formula of entertaining the reader, instead creating some sort of literary experiment. I hated it. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more than 1 reading","review":"This is the only book that I've ever started reading again immediately after I finished it. Now on my 3rd reading & experiencing the book in still new ways.There's a very interesting afterword by the translator at the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Dazzling, Lively, Smart!!!!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. This book does not only talk about the modern Turkish life in Istanbul, but moreover, the human psychology and the human mind. I have been so much effected by this book that it kept coming back to me until I analyzed my life through Pamuk's eyes. Everyone must read this book!!!! Absolutely great. Pamuk's genius can be read between the lines. He is a young Turkish talent that we should all pay attention to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excelent book for history lovers.","review":"This is an astonishing book. Turkish speakers should immediately read Dr. Murat Belge's Guide of Istanbul (Istanbul Gezi Rehberi, Tarih Vakfi yayini.) after reading the Black Book. I believe this will be a very useful and complimentary reading and will definitely help the reader discover the magical world of Pamuk, where one loves to get lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting to see Pamuk's style 20 years ago-late 1980's","review":"I have read the Maureen Freely translation from 2006 which promised to make Pamuk's early novel less opaque than the original English translation. Glad I did not attempt the first one because this more recent one was quite difficult to muddle through. It is interersting to see Pamuk's earlier fascination with themes that have run through later works: innocence (I think naivete' might be a more precise translation), losing self in time, a preoccupation with an unattainable love in the person of a cousin who is more a reflection of self than a separate person.I loved reading Snow, The Museum of Innocence and My Name is Red.This novel left me behind: too obscure, not enough plot, too confusing as to the blending of characters/persona, not enough courtesy to the reader who is trying to go along on this ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting ...","review":"Sometimes you feel crying, sometimes exciting. You change your time and make a trip to post-modern Istanbul underground roads and pubs. You listen stories about life, death, love and mistism. Enjoy it please and share it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this book - unless ...","review":"... you like books that are dense, dark, confusing, modernist (post or otherwise), deep, ... you get the picture.The entire book, though wrapped around a very thinly set up mystery, is about the philosophical conundrum of how can people be just themselves. Is it possible? Is it desirable? What would such a life be like?This is not for light reading; and it's not a page turner. One of Pamuk's early works, it has moments of amazingly good writing - followed by moments of boring, inessential details. Overall, the former outweighed the latter making for an interesting if not too entertaining a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"He will not be able to write anything better than this","review":"I will keep reading his works, like everyone else but The Black Book is not reachable and I am afraid he knows it too. Orhan Pamuk is the new king of novel despite of the plain fact I mantioned above.It will be a graet joy to compare this genious' new works with his masterpiece, The Black Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lay the seat back and crank it up!","review":"This song is in my top 5 hip hop tunes of all times.

I am currently in the process of trying to acquire one of these cameras because it has really piqued my interest in photography. It has been great looking at getting it because it has the most lens availability and compatibility of all the cameras I have looked at and it looks like it is more durable than canon so I plan to get one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great camera by a great camera company","review":"I have to admit that I am biased. I only ever use Nikon products. I have an F3 and an 80008. I purchased the N70 for the built in flash feature (so I wouldn't have to lug around my SB-24) and to have one nice do it all camera to take on vacations, etc. without having to take my whole camera bag with F3 or 80008 bodies. Well, I've shot a wedding, a trip to Spain, and, well, you get the idea. Haven't even needed to pickup the other two. The nice thing about the N70 over the N60 (which is also a great camera) is that the N70 still has the synch port. I wouldn't, of course, trade my F3 or 80008 for studio work or other stuff, but for one compact camera for taking on trips, etc. this camera is great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't a professional's camera like the F3 or F4 or N90, but this camera is fantastic and more than enough camera for most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary writer","review":"Quite a marvellous, dark, troubling, insightful, beautiful read. Some of the personal stories in this novel are also in his book of short stories 'Five by Endo' and are just as absorbing as part of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching but limited","review":"I enjoyed the book, but thought it was limited to \\"forms\\" rather than \\"meanings\\". For example, Numada does find peace by setting a bird free, a bird who he feels died taking his place, but if this was such a spiritual journey, Numada should have looked beyond the bird and discovered the Maker of the bird(whoever He might be). Otsu on the other hand is the only one who knows what his purpose in life is and is faithfull to his purpose, and although from Mishiko's point of view, his life is miserable, Otsu does attain his goal(I don't want to give away the ending, but I think Otsu would be with Mother Theresa now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"God as Onion","review":"Endo introduces five Japanese who intersect on their respective pilgrimages to India. Typical of the international traveling Japanese, these individuals--except for one-- arrive together in the all too familiar \\"tour group.\\" Yet, each has an individual quest and offers differing examinations to the question of \\"why I am.\\" The book begins with individual chapters which introduce each of the pilgrims prior to their journey to India. When the scene shifts to India, the story takes on a quality akin to a \\"travel piece\\" that one might find in a magazine--it reaches that level of realism--that life does not always wrap up nicely. Endo's symbolism also leaves me wondering: what does it mean if God is an Onion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books","review":"I bought this set as a present to my girlfriend, because she never read any of the books.Even though I read the first 4 books a dozen times already, I caught myself of reading it again, this time in English.The paperback books are of a very good quality, very light and in a nice collector's box.A must have for anyone who loves fantasy books.Also a must read for anyone who doubts. It's great child-books, but me, as an adult, love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Pages","review":"We bought this book set in October 2009 for our son. He started reading them last week and managed to read the first four books in 3 days. Then came the Lost Colony... and the Lost Pages. Twenty three pages are missing from p278 to 311, then further it jumped from 342 back to 311. Frustrating my son was, and was using vocabulary not included in this book set (I hope since I did not read it).I'm afraid he will just have to imagine the missing part...Amazon is not to be blamed for this and I did not see in the reviews anybody having experience this. Just bad luck! We're going to try to find a copy here in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which might be challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"My younger sister told me that if I like Harry Potter then I would also like Artemis Fowl.She was right.Artemis is a boy genius turned criminal mastermind who goes on a quest to steal fairy gold from beneath the soil of Ireland. And it's one of the funniest books I've read in a long time. Snappy humor and sarcastic remarks from several of the characters had me laughing out loud on the train like a crazy person. It's a quick read, something you could get through in an afternoon if you had nothing going on.Perhaps the best thing about Artemis Fowl is that it's fantasy for the masses. Yes, it has faries, goblins, and centaurs, but it also has your typical Hollywood fare of bodyguards, big guns, and kidnapping. It's an excellent choice if you're persuading someone to try a fantasy novel for the first time.The only downside is the occasional lack of description, but in the grand scheme of the book it's very minor.Overall, Artemis Fowl is hilarious and entertaining. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl \\"the best\\"","review":"This book is my favorite book of all time. It gives a different perspective of fairies, I used to think fairies as magical and mystical creatures that belongs to the unknown. But, after reading Artemis Fowl, I think of fairies as people, the fact they have magic is very normal. Colfer have a unique talent for making it real and I won't doubt for a second that fairies live below ground. Also, how can you not love Artemis? A criminal mastermind trying to take over the world? (so to speak, he is trying to make money more than taking over the world). How can anyone not love Artemis Fowl the Second?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great incomplete anime series....Jult Warfell","review":"Shigurui has a lot of blood, guts ,story, betrayal, deception, loyalty, nudity, sex, homosexual urges, ronan, confusion and so on.

It felt as if he added a love interest for Yancey towards the end of the novel as an accidental afterthought. Basil is still as lost as a goose in a snowstorm. This story was so weak, that I'm glad that I borrowed a copy. It really wasn't worth spending money on! If E. Lynn doesn't get any better, he's off my list!

The kind of book you read on a weekend with a pint of Ben & Jerry and a bottle of Stoli. Harris hooks you with characters that are two dimensional at best, but they offer glimmers of redemption beyond their \\"spoiled brat\\" facades. My only kaveat is the same I've had with Harris' other books, the dialogue just seems so unnatural or forced, like a tepid prime time soap. But, that aside I read this in a day (like his others) because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.

I have no problem with the story line itself; I just didn't care for the ending. I wish more would have taken place between the characters. Like Basil somehow catching up with that wicked \\"AVA\\".

Becuase I have read his previous books, I feel that picking up \\"Any Way the Wind Blows\\" has been like catching up with an old friend.I am pleased to say that Harris's books have brought some closure to the pain and suffering of Yancy and Basil. But it has also brought up new questions of the future of our be loved main characters.For now, it seems that there will be a new book. One that I am hoping to read and love.If this is your first time reading this saga, you'll love the joys, pains and life-like situations written in this fantasy.

I don't concider myself to be a shrew about everything, because I pretty much like the stuff I buy, but I really didn't do too well this time with this one. I think I got through the first five pages; that was pretty good for me. The last page that I stopped on, said something about a guy dropping his napkin on the floor, and bent down poking his behind up in another guy's face that he liked, while knowing that the guy wasn't interested.

Although I liked this book, I was looking for moreintrigue and a more electricfying ending. I wish that he would not have revealed Yancey and Basil's stalkers so that it would leave us wondering and waiting for the next novel.

This book however was EXCELLENT! It got into consequences of our action and what goes around comes around. Often in life we do things to people that we simply know we shouldn't do and don't think about the consequences to us or them. This book demonstrates that. Finally some resolution for Yancey and Basil. This book gives me some hope to the ability of people to change. Not to mention is there some forshadowing at the end with mention of an all time favorite character???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach book.","review":"If you love E.

Then everything is wrapped up in a preachy little bow, very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this novel in 5 hours FLAT!","review":"Once again, E.

His complex characters and plot twists had me spinning. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed this time around. I found myself talking out loud saying \\"Oh no SHE didn't, Oh no HE didn't, and Lord have mercy!\\" I felt that the tender moments were very touching and the harsher scenes were powerful and painfully realistic. Harris's imagination never ceases to amaze me. I want to tell more about it but I don't want to spoil it for everyone. Take it from a true E.

Basil was the guy that you loved to hate he and Yancey came a long way and that was a good thing. As for Ava & Bart well let just say what goes around come around and we all get ours in the end. I was also glad to see that Raymond showed in this book and was there when Basil needed him despite there pass.While reading this book I also got a feeling that we have not heard from or seen the last of Basil or his friend Raymond I hope that I am right, I would love to see Basil and Raymond living in New York together and friends and how this effect Raymond and Trent relationship.All and All this was a excellent read like the rest of his book and I can't wait for his 2 new coming out in 2002.If you haven't got it get it is well worth you time.As for Mr. E Lynn. Harris (Do your thing boy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, funny, & light reading","review":"I truly enjoyed this novel's lighthearted story, much, much more than Not a Day Goes By. Basil was his usual self and the other characters were just as interesting. This novel is a page turner full of Harris' well known scandelous events. However, if you want something deep, enriching, and/or life changing this is not the book for you. Yet if you want some non thought provoking entertainment that will leave you with a smile, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I purchased this book on July 10th and I finished it in two days. This book is awesome!! I have read all of his books and I fell right into place when I started reading. I really really enjoyed it and recommend it to all the readers of America. E. Lynn Harris is off the hook as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is as shallow as its main characters, Basil, Yancey and Bart. It just wasn't up to the standard Mr. Harris set in his previous books. The storyline was weak, we are to believe noone knows who Yancey's song is about. She is a major star in the making, noone can figure it out? She was previously engaged to Basil, a major athlete, not some anonymous working stiff! Granted, thier engagement might have slipped by the \\"mainstream\\" media but it would not have slipped past Ebony and Jet. Please!!!The ending was most disappointing, everything wrapped up in a nice little bow. All these very flawed people needed was someone to cry with. Not Jesus or longterm couseling.In the end, it seemed like Mr. Harris was just satisfying a contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from \\"Anyway The Wind Blows\\"","review":"These characters were too shallow for me. From Basil, to Yancy to Ava, there's no one to root for in this book. This was nothing more than a cheesey soap opera. I believe in fantasy and escapism, as long as there is some trace of reality. I've been with E. Lynn since the beginning. His books have been on a steady decline. Where's the passion, sensitivity and character development that was paramount in his other works? He didn't give us one reason to care about any of these people. It was a quick, juicy read, but not much substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will set a world's record in reading","review":"I SWEAR. I read this book in two and a half days. I just couldn't put it down. One recommendation though. You must read, \\"Not A Day Goes By\\" first; or you will be totally lost with the story. I'm still worried about Yancy Braxton still going through her split-personality lifestyle regarding being a diva. And I'm glad that Basil will be finally deciding on choosing a side instead of flipping back and forth. But then again, I could be wrong. That's why I hope that Mr. Harris decides to write a third installment of this wonderful story. And being a native New Yorker; I enjoyed the in-depth descriptions of the goings on of the characters around the city."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book But Not The Authors Best","review":"I liked this book, I didn't love it though. It was a quick read because it was hard to put down but when you finished you feel a little cheated. There is something missing, the characters weren't completely fleshed out, and the ending was wrapped up too quickly and too happily. The book starts where 'Not A Day Goes By' ended with Yancey and Basil living their seperate successful lives, but throw Bart Dunbar into the mix and lives are thrown into chaos. I am eager for the sequel because this book did have few loose ends that I would like to see get wrapped up and hopefully the sequel will have more scenes with Raymond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me to thinking","review":"Awhile ago, i promised i would never read another E. Lynn Harris novel, due to the fact that all the homosexual sex scences were more that i wanted to experience. But after searching the library for so long, and finding nothing i decided to try this. And this was a wonderful book! The characters are developed and have you thinking, \\"don't i know someone like this\\" and things focused on in this book are things i'm pretty sure are happening all around. though some things could have been more in depth, like the relationship btw. Basil and Bart. I still overall give it a high rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The usual bunch of unlikable characters","review":"This book features the usual bunch of unlikable characters from E. Lynn Harris' previous best seller, \\"Not a day goes by.\\" Although you may think that's not possible, he has also introduced a few more characters who are even more unlikable. It was easy to read, but contained no surprises. Take it to the beach, or on your next vacation. It might help to keep you from making some choices you could regret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Dramatic, Touching, Page-Turner!!!","review":"I just completed E.Lynn Harris' newest novel, Any Way the Wind Blows and I must say it was all that. I couldn't put the book down. Basil never disappoints E.Lynn fans and that Yancey Braxton is too much but, the ultimate players in this book were Ava Parker Middlebrooks and Bart Paul Dunbar. Adding Bart to the mix made Basil look like a drop in the bucket. I couldn't figure this guy out for nothing and the things he says and does are enough to scare anyone near or far. Ava is the same she-devil, we've come to know, love and hate all in one breath. E.Lynn is a master in his own right. No one can do it better. I was left wanting more and more. The book was magical and in my book is another bestseller. Any Way The Wind Blows will have you on edge and have you believing that the wind can and will blow any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Way the Wind Blows","review":"Mr. Harris has done it again. This book is a must have. He keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love to read but his books are the only ones I can read in one day. You will not be able to put this one down. He has brought back some old characters and added some new ones. I suggest that if you have read the other books you have to add this to the collection. I can't wait for the next one. Thank you Mr. Harris for another great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much name dropping","review":"I am one of those ELH fans, that was there from the very beginning. After reading \\"invisible life\\" I was hooked. But now I will not waste my hard earn dollars on anymore of his books. I know ELH fans are wondering what happened to the characters that we've come to love (i.e Raymond, Jared). It's a good think i borrowed this book. The name dropping in this book, got on my nerves, monica this, brandy that, Dammit this is FICTION. I can read ebony or jet and get the same info. I didn't feel a thing for any of the characters in the book, mama-drama Ava, oh please! what played out, over the top soap opera, did he find her from. This book was silly to say the least. It lacked his usual wit and depth. I enjoy reading books by AA authors but the whole gay/bisexual thing is played out. Do not insult our intelligence by thinking todays readers will buy just anything. We need substance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE'S NO DIVA...","review":"The best thing about this book is that someone lent it to me so I didn't have to shell out money for it or I'd be more outraged, if for no other reason than the apparently unedited and overused expressions like \\"diva,\\" \\"stank\\" and \\"proudly.\\" Who's editing this book anyway?!Equally annoying was the fact that the author made no effort to loop new readers into why or how Basil has these incriminating tapes of Ava. Let's just toss in MORE confusion, shall we.Obviously Harris can write, as evidenced by his ability to hook the reader and keep the plot churning. The question then becomes why write pulp? As a reader I feel insulted that this incredibly superficial, black Jackie Collins [like] book blathers on about three protagonists with no redeeming features whatsoever until--miraculously--they all undergo transformations in the last thirty pages. As if reversals that pat ever really work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of steam","review":"I must say that I have to agree with many like myself who feel that this plot/characters have been beaten to death. I have often thought about some of Harris' depictions of blacks, which only seem to have honey or brown sugar coated complexions, butI guess if you wanted to refute that one could throw in Nicole. I have not finished reading this book. I'm 3/4 through it, but I just don't have the same zeal as before when reading previous material. I think it's true--there is way too much name dropping, etc. I have no emotional ties to any of the characters other than Raymond. Basil is an old has-been who in my eyes has not evolved one bit. Don't get me wrong, the portions of the book that I read, I completed in hours, but it's the substance. Invisible Life and Just As I Am are the benchmarks in my view, and this one doesn't even hit the markor come anywhere close. If you got some time to kill it's an ok book.D+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't learn how to dance from this video","review":"There is no way that a person without a prior dance knowledge can learn how to dance with Fatima.

I was not even able to get to the end of the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I was expecting this video to provide a fun dance workout, but it turned out to be some difficult to follow dance moves interspersed with music video. The three parts to the Aaliyah video dance were interupted with so much music video, that there was no continuous dance to do. It seemed like calling this a dance lesson was a gimmick to sell a music video.The fact that her right is the viewer's left is frustrating and you can't always see her feet. It would be worth taking the time to learn the moves and steps if there was the payoff of a continuous dance at the end but no such luck. Too many stops and starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Dance moves are quite good but for the beginner would be hard to follow the steps.Fatima's instructional video is fast and not detailed.Camera angle would be helpful but not on this tape. She expects you to learn on her pace.For those of you who have trouble rewinding your tape on your VCR, this is not what I would recommend.Don't waste your money on this tape unless you are a quick learner.It's pretty sad to have this tape released without asking themselves if they were going too fast or not on this video.I bought this tape hoping to learn new dance on my clubbing but this is not what I expected. This dance is meant for bigger space and not one of those crowded clubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Purchase","review":"This video is ok if you are just going on the hype of the Backstreet Boys & Aaliyah. The teaching is horrible. She doesn't have a clue on what is right from left, when it comes to teaching (mirror for the audience), which is an error that makes the entire video confusing. One would think, as a professional choreographer for such major artist, these minor details should have been planned carefully before making the tape (Hmmmm)."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU MUST GROOVE WITH THE GROOVALOOS","review":"I bought this tape, watched it once and was done.

Anyhow, I read the earlier reviews about this video \\"Go Fatima, Learn to dance\\" and their was one when a cheerleader said she thought it was so hard. Okay I'm sorry, I dance...who doesn't, but I never took classes and I'm not a gifted dancer, but this video was pretty easy. The best thing to do, is watch the whole video first and then do it. It was so fun, I did break a sweat and it doesn't feel like a workout cause it's so much fun. To know that you can do the dance routine feels really cool. It's not incredibly easy but trust me, if you can move you're feet you can do this video. Fatima is a great choreographer, and yeah her left is your right but trust me you'll get it.

It is broken down into three segments.The first segment teaches you about 30 seconds (literally) of Aaliyah's video, \\"Are You That Somebody.\\" She breaks it down in three parts, teaching you about 7-10 seconds of dance at a time. The second segment teaches you about 30 seconds from the Back Street Boy's video, \\"Backstreet's Back\\" with the same format and the last segment teaches you about a minute of her own steps to which you can add your own flavor.The entire video is 40 minutes but once you learn all the steps, your total \\"workout\\" routine lasts about 2 minutes. You learn some great steps that I'm sure you could incorporate into some hot moves in the clubs, but if you're looking for a workout video, this isn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You cannot learn from this video","review":"Rewind button or not, it is very hard to follow.

When the narrator forces her way into the interrogation she mainly yells and slaps which results in immediate confessions.

I can't see how someone compared these tunes to BOB DYLAN as they are lyricaly not much above average, however they definately grow on you and the whole CD impresses more after every listen. I liked it so much that I ordered 2 more UHRICH cd's. I was very sceptical when I ordered this CD ( lots for sale and very low price ) but am very pleasently surprised. If you bought this to get some HENDRIX flavours, you'd be dissapointed and I guess that explains the price and number of the 2nd hand CD's.

I kinda forgot about Dave until last year when I met the guy who played drums on that tour and is currently the drummer for Styx. We talked at length about Dave and what a great player he was. I started looking for current music from Dave and found this. Figured I would take a shot based on the solid reviews I read here. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Weak song writing,pallid vocal performance and simply no punch on this record. Sure Dave is a great player...but there are simply no HOOKS or infectious grooves on this CD.

I'm not complaining. Although the general consensus seems to be that the plot is unoriginal, I beg to differ. There were simply too many twists and turns in the plot for it to be a duplicate of something else. Maybe I don't know much about Wall Street, but Stephen Frey developed some very convincing situations, making the story believable-enough for me. To the other harsh reviewers out there: Give Mr. Frey a break! If you want a totally realistic/believable storyline, maybe you should stop reading now. There's not much else to say about the book, money, greed, power, politics, it's all in there. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Frey book yet","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Unlike Frey's last one, this one has a very good pace to it and the story is enthralling from beginning to end.Some of his characters are very down and dirty and I certainly would not want to be working with most of these but they are certainly needed to hold the story together and they do this wonderfully.The only negative is that Frey tends to downplay the women in his books - Oliver's wife and mistress are good examples of this. Let's get some stronger women roles throughout his books.Overall, this is the best one yet! I can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Frey fan and liked this book.","review":"Having read several of Frey's book, I ordered this one based on this site's description.

One thing I keep asking myself is, \\"In our financial world, do things like this really happen?\\" In lieu of the Enron and WorldCom Group fiascoes having been recently brought to light, the convolutions brought forth in this book truly seem possible.\\"The Insider\\" is full of can't put the book down, page turning suspense.

I bought a doll for playing, not for show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thanksgiving Album","review":"\\"Home to Thanksgiving\\" is a good collection of mostly A Capella hymns and carols for Thanksgiving, with a harp and piano here and there. It is essentially a compilation of music from various albums on the Harmonia Mundi label.The CD's mood ranges from happiness of thanksgiving and harvest to a more somber mood of days past and things forgotten. The A Capella and solo voices more effectively convey the feeling of each piece than an orchestra or pipe organ accompaniment could manage. To simplify, there is nothing like the human voice to bring out the full emotion of music, consisting of shape-note singing, solos, medieval chants and rounds. Musical instruments make only brief appearances.Although not in a jewel case, the CD is enclosed in a well-made jacket with a booklet (printed on high-quality glossy paper) containing full lyrics and Abraham Lincoln's Thanksgiving proclamation from October 1863.This CD will bring out the true meaning of Thanksgiving in all its forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Adult Swim CD, and not worth getting.","review":"If, like me, you are trying to find the song used in the first season of Adult Swim (the \\"pool music\\"), which searching the internet claims it was a remix of Tito Puente's Mambo Gallego by D-Code, this is not it.Still I gave this CD a listen. It is a light Jazz CD put out by what looks like some young men from Holland. It is however, very light. It is full of easy listening jazz cliches, which are best in an elevator or phone system.So if your looking for the Adult Swim theme music or some nice easy jazz, either way you're better off looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big treat for Gene fans","review":"I think this video to be a big treat for Gene fans. Especially,paformances with Benny Goodman are really atractive.In Gene's own band,I think that his musicianship tend to be overcome by showmanship,but as a sideman,I think Gene played with a fabulous musical sense and inspired the tunes and musicians that he backed for with vitality that makes you feel like stompin' to the beats.You will feel it in those numbers of this video such as \\"China Boy\\"\\"The Shiek of Araby\\"(both played by the members of original Benny Goodman Trio.What a nice combination of Teddy Wilson's bass line with Gene's drumming!!),\\"After You've Gone\\"(played with Benny and Mel Powell at the piano.Mel plays very fine swing-style piano and Gene shows traditional snare-drum-backing.Awfully Good!!) and \\"Sing Sing Sing\\"(Joyful without reservation.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Reviewer Needs to Understand...","review":"The amount of video footage available of Gene Krupa is very sparse.

If all you have ever done with money is go to work to earn it and then spend it without care to your future, then you do need this book because you won't understand a real book on money management or investing. Ms. Orman offers only a general overview of how to manage money. The information in this book is not enough, but is a good start for a novice.However, most people don't want to know the truth. Here's the secret found in 629 pages: all you need to do is eliminate all credit card debt, spend less than you earn, and invest the difference on a regular schedule in a few no load equity index and bond mutual funds. Pretty darn simple. If you need a book to motivate you then so be it. For anyone beyond novice level, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Boring Big Book","review":"This is best used as a paperweight or to keep the door ajar. It is so sad to see Suze on TV pitching this tome when the air time could be used for much better uses. Who wants to read question after question. I got through the first 10 questions and I was almost asleep. Suze says that there are 2502 questions and these numbers add up to nine. Nine is an important number in Suze's life so she says and this is so silly and foolish that all I could do was to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still don't have the book I paid for","review":"Product never arrived.Disappointing.I give it one star because I have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Will Offend Men !!!!!!!!!","review":"Overall this is an OK book, with pretty good information. It poses financial questions that Suze then answers. The problem is that in 99% of the situations i.e. divorce, prenuptual agreements, or any other situation where the relationship does not work out, IT'S THE MAN'S FAULT. I am about 3/4's of the way through the book and I feel like I'm being insulted on almost every page.A prenuptual, a will in trust, or any other legal document is always to protect the woman. If you are a male you will definetly be offended by this book.

The truth? Ms. Orman doesn't have the courage of her own convictions to admit that her buy-n-hold, dollar-cost averaging ways hurt investors terribly. Rather than ackwowledge her inadequate advice regarding how to avioid the bulk of a bear market (i.e., having an approach to selling), she places the blame on us. We were too greedy. We should have been allocating to assets other than stocks... and then we wouldn't have been hurt so bad. No, Ms. Orman. Nobody will be on a road to wealth with a 7%-8% compounding rate of return with asset allocation. And nobody should invest in stock assets without a discipline for selling. That's how wealthy investors avoided the bear, and continued along a road less traveled."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Suze gives all the advice of a first year financial representative.

Once again Suze has written a book that everyone can understand. She has a unique ability to write about complicated financial information in a way that is less intimidating than most financial authors.

This book really is a great resource for everyone, no matter what stage of life they are in."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expert on a little about a lot","review":"This book could also be called PERSONAL FINANCE for BEGINNERS and be just as suitable. It's basically a regurgitation of any basic personal finance information you can find for free anywhere on the Internet. Just search things like \\"Getting a Mortgage,\\" \\"Managing Debt,\\" \\"Saving for Retirement\\", etc. and you'll find near word-for-word similarities to this book.The problem with Suze Orman is that she isn't in the personal finance business. She's in the Suze Orman business. That means her time and resources are spent promoting herself, not staying up to date on industry news. The result is her information is sometimes completely out of date and in the worst case, factually inaccurate. She spends nearly 10 pages villifying annuities based on information from 10 years ago.Don't waste your money!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very thorough!!!","review":"I am very impressed with Suze Orman. Ms.Orman is a generalist in a world of specialist. She realizes what it takes and what investors need in order to succeed. She doesn't mince words and has a hard no nonsense attitude.I am a futures broker, investor, and author for the past 11 years. In that time I have realized that although I invest in speculative investments and portion of my portfolio must be maintained conservatively. Unfortunately, stockbrokers and futures brokers, in general, aren't as fiscally responsible as they should be. That is why I recommend this book to them and to you.In this book no question goes unasked or unanswered. Whether she writes all of her books now or uses ghostwriters is immaterial to the overall valuable service and information that Ms.Orman provides.You'll definitely benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book : too little , no linux , too proprietary","review":"This book is best avoided.Around 1/3rd of the book is elementary introductory stuff about NT and Unix. The rest is about proprietary versions of Unix and various items of commercial software.

It has a worthless discussion of the X Windowing system at a level that moved me to tears of disgust.Amazingly, Linux has just a few lines.

Ms. Baxtresser's tone is rich in colors and her expression is exquisite. The pianist does a superb job both supporting the soloist but also ensuring that his part is heard. The entire production is more about a duo partnership rather than a first and second player-a philosophy I've personally heard Ms. Baxtresser discuss in a seminar.Although the works are relatively known to the average classical listener, every work really sets conventions about modern music on its head. All the works fit in together.The liner notes are well written, neither too technical/musicological or too general.It's too bad that more of her recordings are not available because I'd buy them in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT, AGAIN?!!","review":"Each of these titles has already been released on DVD at least once, if not twice.

They release those WAY-overpriced, cheaply-packaged Warner Archives DVD-Rs that are usually not remastered and with absolutely no extra features whatsoever and expect us fans to shell out the bucks and be satisfied with that.

I, personally cannot relate to Lonnie Jackson as many other readers may be able to. But being a male athlete is pretty much the only way I am able to relate to this book. On that note, I happened to enjoy this book very much.Hoops takes place during the summer, instead of the regular basketball season, giving Lonnie one less thing to worry about. I think Myers did a great job including all of Loonie's friends that he plays basketball with as well as his love life. One thing that Myers could have wrote more about is Lonnie's relationship with his mother.The ending of the book did disappoint me a little bit though. If I was able to change one thing in the book, it would be the ending. But the conclusion of the book only made Lonnie stronger, which is a job well done by Myers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoops by Walter Dean Myers","review":"Hoops by Walter Dean Myers is a really good book about not only basketball, but also about what most high schoolers go through, drugs, sex, and violence. Lonnie, a basketball player with a given talent and a -want- to go to the NBA. He enters a tournement where college scouts will be everywhere. His coach for the tounement is Cal Jones, a former NBA player who was suspended becuase he was caught shaving points for money. When the championship comes around Cal is made a deal to keep Lonnie out of the game so these gamblers can make alot of money. When the clock ticks down, Cal has to make the decision whether to let Lonnie have a chance in the spotlight or money. Hoops by Walter dean Myers is a very good book that is one of my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothin but Net","review":"In the book, Hoops, a boy portrays a life living in Harlem. He finds basketball is his only savior. Walter Dean Myers wrote this book in 3rd person and the main character, Lonnie is telling the story. When he finds a basketball tournament to enter in with his older friends, he is off. Walter Dean Myers is an excellent book writer and you need to read Hoops to find out for yourself. This book is great because I like basketball and I relate to Lonnie. Lonnie is a problem child like me and he has older friends like me. If you like basketball then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love For The Game","review":"Hoops, a novel written by Walter Dean Myers is a novel about a boy who expresses his love for the game of basketball.

I didn't find the book too interesting until the final game. (which is in the last 1 or 2 chapters)I don't think someone should read the book unless they know a lot of basketball terms. I also think that boys will probably like this book more than girls. Simply, because it deals with a BOY that wants to make it to the NBA. I didn't enjoy this book too well, but maybe you will!

I couldn't relate to it that much.I'm not sure if anyone would enjoy this book unless they talk like that. It wasn't just the slang, it was the whole writting. Everthing just ran together when I read it. I really couldn't tell what the setting was. I think it was in the streets of New york or some place like that.The plot in this story is that Lonnie is trying to make the NBA while that is going on he starts to like his friends sister mary-ann.I recommend this book to guys mostly cause they might understand the point of view of Lonnie cause hes a guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Point Of View","review":"This Book Was Not That Interesting To Me Because They Made Basketball Seem So Whack That I Got Bored Of It.I Think That This Book Was Kind Of Weird.I Didnt UnderStand This Book For Nothing Because I Was Always Absent So I Cant Really Judge This Book Like That But When I Was Here I Didnt Like The Story Beacause It Was Boring.I Think That This Book Is Stupid And Dumb.I Think That This Book Is For Boys.I Wasted My Time Reading This Book But I Had To Read It Was School.I Dont Know What To Tell You If U Need To Know About The Book Read It YourSelf Because EveryBody Has There Own Opinions And Some People Like The Book And Some Dont Like The Book.I Think That I Wont Read This Book Ever Again Just Because I Dont Like It And Because Its Boring And Supid.I Rather Read A Little Kids Novel For Real.Sorry For Those That Think The Book Is Good Its Just My Point Of View U Feel Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoops","review":"Hoops by Walter Dean Myers is a good book .

Lonnie is part of a basketball team were he is the best player on the team . If lonnie keeps working at it and doesn't let money get to him, as his coach Cal say's he thinks Lonnie can make it to the NBA.In the book Lonnie also goes through similar things as other teenage boys go through like problems with his mom and some with his girl .

This book is all about tapping into our own selves and our ability to repair and heal, connecting mind, body, spirit. There is discussion of our immune system, and ceratin issues such as multiple sclerosis and othes are mentioned here and there but its not a book about illnesses at all - its a book about healing and using our own selves, our inner selves to heal us. The exercises reinforce the philospohy, most are stretches/yoga moves, but there are also meditations - all are straight forward.

The empty plot is relieved by some wild sex scenes standard for this series of films, but even they are ruined by our snapshot taking pilot (Jay Richardson) who wants to sell the photos as souveniers for ten dollars each.

Nicole Sheridan never has been one of my favorites anyway, but she's probably the best-looking thing in this and she gets little on-screen nude time.It's typical Retromedia aside from that, with a lot of dumb jokes and forced sexual situations--although not as much full nudity as you'll probably want. Jay Richardson is here and always is a treat.Included with this DVD is the flip-side \\"Bikini Airways\\" and it's actually a much better picture. Amazing really...it's just two years older than \\"Chain Gang\\" but Belinda Gavin looks 10 years younger and 10 times better here. And Loni Lynn is just flipping hot.So, without the second feature I'd probably give this three stars, but it's worth a buy with the included bonus feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Missing Piece of the Puzzle","review":"Wow! This book is fantastic!I spent years in recovery from substance abuse ignoring or minimizing my mood disorder. And never understood why I was clean, sober and miserable. And unfortunately many of the well-meaning people in A.A. and gave me some incorrect information. \\"You're having a dry drunk\\", \\"Medication is a crutch,\\" \\"You need to work the steps harder\\".Even after I realized that there was another illness that I was powerless over, it took me years to begin to understand how the two illnesses were entwined. This book has proved an essential tool in my recovery. It is laid out much like the Big Book of AA and focusses on recovery through the 12 Steps and Fellowship.Many of us have even gotten together to form a group of Dual Recovery Anonomous - where we study The Dual Disorders Recovery Book. We're still active in AA but have gotten so much out the extra information and guidance provided by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Mary Mulari winner!","review":"Mary Mulari could easily be called the 'first lady' of garment machine applique and Appliques with Style is an excellent example of why she deserves this title. Not only are her applique design top rate but her directions are very good. They are clear and easy to follow, easy enough for a beginner to machine applique. Mary discusses not only what materials and equipment you will need, she has a wonderful chapter on machine stitches beyond the basic satin stitch. Mary's books are always full of illustrations and Appliques with Style also has several pages of color photos in Mary's Applique Design Gallery. If you are a beginner to machine applique or just wanting some new designs and ideas, Appliques with Style will not disappoint you! It is an excellent first book or an addition to any sewer's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd in the series","review":"Do you wonder what was going on in the Galatic Empire, after the slaughter of the Jedi, and before Star Wars a New Hope introduced us to Luke, Han & Leia? This series provides at least some of the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING = this is a Kids book. Not a normal star wars novel!","review":"WARNING = this is a Kids book. Not a normal star wars novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Book","review":"Jude Watson paints such a vivid picture in your mind. It picks up right where #2 left off Ferus is standing in the rain staring at the Jedi Temple. You feel every emotion Ferus is going through. When he and Trever are going throw the Temple it is heartbreaking. Ferus is still looking for another Jedi which leads him far down below where other of Palpatine's enemies have fled too. You get a very good idea how things are in this new Empire. A better picture of the relationship between Vader and Malorum. When you get to the last page of the book your dying to get a hold of the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Book","review":"Dewey is not exactly light reading, and this little book is pretty heavy. But it's also vitally important in understanding how kids learn. I'm a college coach, but I took much away from Dewey's principle of authentic learning. This is standard reading for any educator, but I'd press coaches, mentors and anyone else involved with improving young lives to read this. Dewey is so classic is almost cliche...but there's good reason for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Edition!!","review":"Do not buy this \\"readaclassic.com\\" edition. It is TERRIBLE. There are a ridiculous amount of typesetting errors, dropped words, missing characters, etc. They didn't even place the diagrams in the correct place.Honestly, it appears that they did a quick Optical Character Recognition from the scanned Google book, then didn't actually check. Terrible! They should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst publisher! Buy book from different publisher","review":"This publisher did not do a punctuation check. For example, on page 38, the quotation punctuation is spaced too far apart from the words and are angled incorrectly (confusing the reader at times). Another example, at the end of a question mark the punctuation (a question mark) starts the next line of the paragraph, instead of it being attached to the last word of the question sentence! These are two examples found on page 38, but the book is littered with these kinds of errors.The same texts from a different publisher don't have these mistakes, so it's not Dewey's 'old-fashioned' writing that's the problem. Dewey's writing is at times hard to follow, and the lack of proper punctuation really distracts a reader. I wish I would've bought Dewey's writings from a different publisher. This one is printed by ReadaClassic.com--I'll never buy a book from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you a Devo fan? Get this!!!","review":"My ten-year-old daughter and I were at this show at the Phoenix. We have both been to many, many concerts since then and we both still remember this as one of the best we have ever seen. The band's energy was so high and their performance so tight, the audience was so intelligent and so into them... you just can't pass this up, even though it's an older video and not as pristine as newer shows captured with newer equipment. You won't be sorry - you gotta have this Devo performance!! Top-level!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny.","review":"One cam is out of focus the whole time, but the rest is tight. Great set by Devo at the top of their collective game. Long live Booji Boy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor video quality; great show","review":"This is the Spud Boys at their peak. The video is strictly VHS-quality, but the sound is good and the performance is outstanding.DEVO was no novelty act. They wrote great songs and they were tight and hard rockin' on stage. I highly recommend this DVD. Only the low video quality keeps me from giving it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music that falls between the cracks","review":"Quantz is hard to qualify as either Baroque or Classical; the instrumentation and ornamentation is clearly Baroque, but the musical ideas and their expression strongly point towards the Classical. I tend to discount music by those born after 1685, but in breaking through the time-hono(u)red boundaries of Baroque forms, Quantz composed music full of energy and inventiveness. This recording--as are all of Wentz'--is fantastic."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function N(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-3f44172a"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/49.md","filePath":"guide/49.md"}'),j={name:"guide/49.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
