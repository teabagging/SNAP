Then after a commercial break, the main episode would begin, with some credits overlayed during the opening scenes. With this set, they have changed the sequence. Now the theme song opens every episode, followed by the teaser. This means they had to move the overlayed credits to the teaser. Even worse, they changed the typography! Instead of the Northern Exposure font, they changed it some generic block font. This totally upsets the continuity and visual flavor of the show.

Anyone who knows anything about this series knows how integral the original music is to the overall effect and quality of the material. It's an absolute crying shame that this corner had to be cut. Beware anyone who is thinking about buying this set of OVERPRICED dvd's. Shame on you Universal!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not me!!","review":"Shame on Universal! When you re-release the second season with all the original music, i will purchase it. Until then, i urge everybody to stop buying these sets to send a message!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY NORTHERN EXPOSRE ON DVD","review":"I am completely surprised at how crappy Universal Studios did in making the second season. A lot of the original songs are edited out, the disks aren't even marked with the episodes. I thought after them screwing up on the first season they would atleast try on the second season, but I was wrong. If you love Northern Exposure like I do then you will be very unhappy with the second season. It is a waste of money & Universal Studios should be ashamed of themselves for cheating us loyal Northern Exposure fans. I will not buy anymore seasons until Universal Studios fixes the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just lacking","review":"First review written but here goes. I WAS TICKED!!! Currently in Iraq and DVD's are our lives here since there is nothing else to do. I remembered how I enjoyed the show and noticed that they always had reruns on TV. Well it's because they only have 8 shows the first season. That's 2 shows per side of 2 disks. It's like your constantly turning over disks and looking for something else. I thought I missed something on the menu and there were more shows. But alas I was jipped. I do enjoy that they put the reviews on the items here so you can get an honest idea of what your getting. This movie is overpriced as is and not worth the buy. I liked the shows but the price and the way you buy are sold the shows on the disks is a rip. HOpe it helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"I hate to captialize on what has already been said but, please, 7 episodes? Again? And full price. I find it egregious that Universal did not combine Seasons 1 and 2 into one parka wrapped DVD. It is flagrant corporate greed. Big business sticking it to the common person. And then to skimp on quality by double sided DVDs--and pathetic documentation.While I am an avid NE fanatic--and have them all on video tape from A&E; reruns--I will wait to purchase the DVDs from the \\"USED\\" bins at my local music/video store. And while I am certainly not condoning theft--it is no wonder that people are copying and sharing audio/video files via the internet and shareware copy programs. while I know it is against the law and therefore wrong--how different is it really from what the companies like Universal are doing to us? In a moral universe of objective law, both such activity would be prohibited. Becasue both are about stealing. And I KNOW Chris Stevens would agree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles","review":"All popular TV series box sets come with Subtitle options.

Hopefully this will go away with Season 3. I wish Universal would take some tips from the Seinfeld release on delivering quality at a reasonable price.

This is a wonderful show..please Universal...show it the respect it warrants.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"I totally agree not having the original music takes away from the feel of the show, our DVD's will only play the first episode on each side and then will NOT go to the 2nd, so this was poorly made.

But couldn't they have left off the puffy jacket, which makes it a pain to store so I took it off anyway, and made it a little cheaper? There were not very many episodes and the second season is even shorter. $42 is kind of pricey for such a short season. I have not yet bought it and will either hold out for a second hand copy or a box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This *IS* the complete second season... but still overpriced","review":"Do a search for the episode list and you will discover that there in fact *WERE* only 7 episodes in the second season. Universal isn't \\"hiding\\" some second-season episodes from us out of corporate greed; I shudder to think, though, what they're going to charge us for the first full season of the show, season three, which has 23 episodes... $40 for 7 episodes, $150 for 23? (Now *that's* corporate greed!) Still, season two is a great season with some great episodes (War and Peace, the Big Kiss, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voting With Your Dollars","review":"Clearly I'm a NE fan or I would not be in this space. I, and many others, were so smitten by it that we dutifully recorded every episode. After purchasing and viewing the first season set, I must concur in every way with Amanda Johnson's comments. The price is nothing short of ludicrous for what one receives. You will be lucky if the two discs play correctly. No, it cannot be ascribed to my equipment - I have some very high quality players. Even the good Amazon discount cannot make such extreme profiteering palatable. If you pay these kinds of prices, you are encouraging the Universal executives who think of you as cannon fodder for their salaries. Wait until the price comes down."},{"rating":"1","title":"northern exposure - the complete second sesason","review":"sorry....but I can't accept the cost of the music being the factor for the big price charge. If this was the case why was Universal able to release a dozen titles on VHS a few years ago without adding a premium cost? And why only 8 episodes at a time. Truth of the matter is Universal feel they have a captive audience because of the cult following and they are just making excuses for the huge price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Northern Exposure","review":"Great series, but it is a bit serialized so you would probably want to start with the first season and go from there. If you liked the first season you will probably like this one. My one complaint is that some of the original music has been changed. I understand that it is a trade off between price and a few of the original songs, but it takes just a tiny bit away from the overall set. Still worth buying and watching, but I had to give it four stars because of the music thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Universal","review":"Universal said it was the music that drove up the cost- now we pay the same for seven episodes accompanied by elevator music. What a joke. I love Northern Exposure, but this is very poor customer service on Universal's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Write Universal now!","review":"If you're interested in telling Universal how you feel about their mishandling of the music in the second season of Northern Exposure, you can contact them via email. [...]Music was an integral part of the effect of this show, and omission of even what some may consider simply \\"background music\\" has an impact on the mood of specific scenes. Those who charge that viewers are being too sensitive about this issue are missing the point: Northern Exposure's success lies in its sensitivity to nuance and detail. Hard to believe the producers of the original show didn't put up a fuss about this. Looks like it's up to the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Northern Exposure is perhaps my favorite television show. If someone had told me years ago that I would someday refuse to buy this on DVD, I would have thought they were crazy. But I would have to be crazy to buy it.A great part of Northern Exposure's charm was its music. The people who made the series obviously gave a lot of thought to finding just the right music to support, or to make, a scene. I don't think anyone before had given so much thought to the music heard on a television show. It is sad that the people who put out this DVD did not care enough to keep the music intact.I will never, ever, buy this set until the music is restored. And I won't buy any of the future sets unless they contain the origina music. I gather that a lot of people agree with me. Shame on the people who put out this DVD set. They need to go back and make this right. And they need to ensure that future sets contain all of the original music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just happy to have the DVD!","review":"I don't care if there are only 7 episodes, the important thing is that they're continuing to release the seasons on DVD. Spread the word so that Universal knows there's a demand and will release the rest of the seasons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothern Exposure is cheating us","review":"We love the show - but when we bought the first DVD we were very annoyed at how it was packaged. FIrst of all, the priced it really high for how many episodes were on it. Second, they made it a double sided DVD. How cheap is that? The lettering on the DVD is so tiny, it is impossible to read. WE gave up trying to view the horrible thing.We will NOT be buying another. Which is sad, because I had taped all of them on VHS tapes, but they have completely degraded.To the company that makes these - Stop being so CHEAP!

The book is worth buying just for this great tale!And, if you haven't read A Game of Thrones or A Clash of Kings - it will convince you to!

I enjoyed the other stories too, but I can't get enough of Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. The Hedge Knight gives us a little history of a few of the families from the other stories. I especially like how it makes the Targaryens more tangible. They seem almost like a family of crazy, yet mystical people in the other books, but here we see them as your typical royal family with troubles like every one else.

When I heard Gareth was releasing an original I was thinking high but all I got was a cheesy pop song that teaches you even if you know someone they can still cheat on you. Even Gareth... *gasp*Is this the type of song we want our kids to hear?

It told quite a bit about not only the operations on the railroad but also about all of the equipment that is used to keep and mantain the railroad through the harsk Sierra Mt. winters. It also gave a good overview of Southern Pacific as a whole and told about the numerous operations of Southern in and around the Donner Pass area.

The 85 inch blades are an odd size that can only be bought here. I have yet to make a single cut without stripping all the teeth off the blade. ( yes I have read the book on tips to prevent this from happening, but it still does it). I cannot cut any big pieces of steel without the reset button tripping on the motor. As of this time the saw sets in a corner with junk piled around it because I am out of blades. it has made 5 cuts. Buy the bigger saw. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Color, lousy shipping","review":"The colors are great. Unfortunately, I was not able to use my mower once it arrived 4 weeks after ordering it. When my mower shipped it was missing half the parts, probably due to the fact that it was shipped it in an improvised box, on which the tape failed. The packer did have a sense of humor though. They wrote on the top of the box, \\"rattle OK.\\" That was probably because they ran out of packing materials. I think you are supposed to use more than one of those little air pillows to pack the item. Well that little rattle was the cutting unit falling apart as it bounced along in transit. Anyways, when it finally arrived, the missing instructions wouldn't have done me any good anyways because one section of the handle was missing along with the screws to put the handle sections together. Also, I doubt the instructions would have told me how to reafix the wheel which had fallen off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Poorly designed. Hard plastic wheels (meaning SLICK).

Maybe it's not for me :) I'll pick different one up locally...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mower","review":"I put this together in a few minutes with a 1 year old strapped to my back. I was very impressed with the mechanism-it seems that it would be impossible to hurt someone with it, with the back roller and front guard.

A 270 some page book and after 168 pages, the 'Wentworth' character has been in only two scenes. There is nothing except 'Anne's' character doing her job as a guidance counselor. I actually had to put the book out of my misery and not finish it. Ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Guidance Counselling, Too Little Austen","review":"As a fan of Persuasion, I was excited to read a modern retelling, but this isn't it. The rekindling of Anne's lost love is practically a side story, while we get description after description of the predicaments of the heroine's high school senior charges and their silly ,status-obsessed parents. One mom is described as always on her way to buy her son tube socks -- what? The novel has its moments, but I wanted more Anne and Ben. Cohen's earlier effort, Jane Austen in Boca, is lots more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, but alright to pass the time","review":"This book was actually a little boring. There was virtually no character development, and very little interaction between the main character and the long-lost boyfriend. It's mostly just an endless series of case studies of spoiled high-school students trying to get into college, occasionally a bit about the main character that seemed almost forced, and then at the end they just happen to end up together. There wasn't enough information given about the characters to really make me care one way or the other. Overall it was an easy way to pass some time, but only if you have already read every word of the airplane vomit bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great...but kept me entertained when my flight was delayed.","review":"I have to say that while it was mildly entertaining when all that was available to do was watch CNN, the book was written pretty bad. The whole thing was about random high school students and their college applications. I kept wondering when the story was actually going to start, and then I realized I was only 20 pages from the end. I think the whole thing with Ben should have been a little more hashed out. It was too tidy of an ending for the circumstances. I had to give it at least 2 stars though because it did hold my attention during a 2 hour flight delay. I probably won't read anything by Ms. Cohen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good.","review":"I really wanted to like this book. When it comes down to it, the book is mostly about the main character's (Anne) life as a guidance counselor. Most of the book is descriptions of the students and their parents as they apply to colleges. In between this there is little about the life of Anne outside of the school and very little to recommend the book as a good romance.As a fairly faithful reinvention of the novel Persuasion it may rank high, but as a stand alone novel, it's just not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"It was okay.Fairly predictable - and, since it's been a long time since I read 'Persuasion,' I can't even chalk it up to already knowing the plot in advance. But after the third or fourth time a chapter ended with Anne pining wistfully away for her lost love (Seriously! It's been thirteen years!)

These occurred randomly several times. The CD would work again in a few minutes to a few days. Pulling off the detachable face and putting it back sometimes got it working again (or was it coincidence?) The CDs I played have always been clean and in good condition.

It definitely drives the more intellectual points home. And, at the same time, the disjunction never gets in the way of the bizarre story that is unfolding. The artwork interspersed throughout the text adds visual impact that cannot be fully explained -- it melds with the mood of the narrative. It's absolutely fantastic. I have never seen anthing else like this. And, I was also pleased to find that I didn't have to know anything about Japan or Japanese culture to appreciate this. It stands boldly on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense psychological and philosophical work","review":"Keizo Yukawa, an museum curator in Japan, embarks on an intense and excruciating test when he accepts the job of head curator at a new private museum dedicated to the enigmatic artist Takenoko. As Yukawa's story unfolds, Takenoko's parallels it in the margins of this imaginative and thought-provoking work. One by one, Yukawa meets the family of Ichiro Ono, the museum owner. Each one introduces a tiny piece of the puzzle that is the Ono family history and draws Yukawa deeper into the part he has to play in the mystery.Illustrations by L.J.C. Shimoda add an authenticity and depth to this well-researched and beautifully written book. If you're interested in Japanese culture, the question of aesthetics, or just looking for a book that diverges in a lively way from the norm, pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I have read and enjoyed many of L.E.

Modesitt, Jr. is an incredible writer, I have enjoyed dozens of his novels. This wasn't one of them. Quite honestly, the deeper I got into it, the more confused I became. From other reviews here, it is suggested that this is a novel about a thwarted love interest, politics, religion, revenge and redemption. I'll have to take their word for that, I read only a mishmash of hazy ideas and unconnected lines. Quite a departure from the author's \\"Recluse\\" and \\"Corean Chronicles\\" sagas, which were straightforward and enjoyable fantasies with a strong beginning, middle and finish.Happily, this novel does have a \\"search inside\\" option, I suggest you avail yourself of that opportunity before buying it.

Discourteous costumer service.","review":"I received this heater as a replacement of another Delonghi heater which was higher-performing with more heat output in watts. This is how Delonghi treats you with its cocky 1-year limited warranty. You might as well get an inferior, cheaper product as Delonghi mistreats its customers to do itself a favor. The service location to deliver the broken heater was far, and Delonghi took more than a month to provide me with this cheaper heater.Besides, both my original heater and the replacement (this heater that the review is about) broke in less than a year. I had to change through 3 heaters in less than a year due to Delonghi's rock bottom product quality. Additionally, the heater makes a noise when in operation that sounds like beating its metal with a hard object. It can be disturbing depending on the person.Do NOT buy from Delonghi to bear this poor product quality and customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"The actor playing Van Gogh has the mannerisms and speech patterns of Woody Allen.

This book -- and others -- recommend things that are terrible for hedgehogs. Cedar shavings, as another reviewer noted, are recommended by this book. The aromatic oils from cedar shavings can cause respiratory failure in hedgehogs and other complications. It gets worse from there.The novice hedgehog owner is not going to pick up on these inaccuracies or errors, and that means that because of this book, hedgehogs are going to receive poor care.

Much of his information is incorrect (the usage of cedar shavings, the 'nausea' sections, etc) and the rest seems to be based off of his observation of African Pygmies in the WILD.

I tried reapplying and re-washing a few times on each wheel, but the truth is, there is no substitute to elbow grease.After doing all four wheels I realized I had used nearly the entire bottle and they still weren't clean!

(Before I decided to take care of everyhing on the car myself)Now to be fair, I recently also used it on a more aggressive handling car (i.e. I was able to drive it harder and subsequently brake harder when necessary) and it required me to use a brush to work it in. In addition, this car had not had its wheels cleaned for 6 years prior to me getting a hold of it.

Each antidote is woven with comedy and shows how hard it is to be a parent.

It might take you a while to like this album, don't bother listening to it if you're in a hurry and are just listening to samples from a website or a cd store because you're probably not going to like it.

His entire research is biased to prove he is right in order to get more patients. If he was just a researcher, he would see how distorted and untrue his opinions really are.Plus the book rambles on and on about his own legal issues. He is very bitter because he has been at the losing end so much.

His stories of legal crusades and many medical ideas have some use. He mentions ideas about mold spores not being the issue, but thier toxins, and this is in many science articles, but one has the impression he created this information.Consider this as a reference tool, not a regular text one reads to learn a topic for home hygiene lessons, unless you have significant time and are willing to read some chapters 3x.

If the book reaches those shelves it will be available not only to patients but also to interns, residents,and those cutting edge physicians who use libraries to keep a step above the rest.

It's odd because movies cost a fortune to create. You would think that they would hire someone to look into their basic physics. But no, movies are a couple decades behind novels in that way. This little book is more plausible and mature than \\"Avatar\\" or \\"District 9\\". It's a military action story about troops engaging an extraterrestrial enemy. I've read a number of such books this last year, this was among the best.In both Avatar and District 9 the moral of the story is that Earth people are evil and so you should side with the extraterrestrials to help them exterminate all humans.

At a reading, Mr Sandlin made known that this was the first book that wasn't about himself. So perhaps it's a transitional necessity, an experiment, and good for him. Artists need to stretch. I certainly hope he keeps writing. I hope the Honey Dont becomes a movie and Tim becomes rich off it. The characters are unbelievable yet wacky enough that coupled with the plot (it's really plot driven - ug)that a decent movie could come out of it. Anyhow, my two cents, keep writing and best of luck Tim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not right","review":"Either this book was written by someone other than Tim Sandlin, or he was pressured by his publishers to write.

This is funnier in an over-the-top sort of way than his four-book trilogy, which is just plain funny in a Tim Sandlin sort of way. One way to look at this, if you're so inclined, is to consider Honey Don't as Tim's answer to my novel, Heart Seizure wherein I created an unfortunate FBI Agent by the name of Sandlin (in Tim's honor). In Honey Don't, Tim paid me back by creating a Senator Fitzhugh who is, well, lacking in several key personality traits.

Anyone who doesn't enjoy seeing an Anime come to life might not 'get' it (that might not be a con...lol).I might have had issues with missing parts if I had seen the anime or read the manga first.But, seeing this first and then starting the Anime and Manga, I find that the books and Anime fill things in for me and don't take away from the movies.You Must do yourself a favor!

For those of you who like L I highly recomend this movie for he is perfectly portrayed. The movie stays pretty true to the story line of books 1-3, however scene cuts were made or scenes from other books were edited together, and there is the addition of a character, Light's girlfriend. The one main difference is how Light gets on the investigation team, which makes up the ending of the movie, however you'll have plenty of laughs and if you are a fan of Death Note the screenwriters did a pretty good job of bringing this to a movie, way better than any American screenwriter could have done.

As for the advertisements that permeate their way into programs - I don't see why the authors don't realize television wouldn't survive without clever advertising to keep the cash rolling in.

I was stung by her condecending portrayal of Americans in general--one would never guess that the author was an American herself! I was infuriated by the weasel-like way that Ms. Stevenson portrayed Ted Hughes's affair--that he \\"made contact\\" with the woman who became his mistress, and that Plath's jealousy essentially \\"forced\\" him to be unfaithful. I had always heard that Ted Hughes's sister had a great deal to do with the final book, and I feel that her spectre shadows almost every word. Never have someone who dislikes you write your biography--particularly if she is hiding behind another person!

So, I tried it because I was looking for an easier way to floss. I have tight contacts between my teeth, so it was hard to get the floss in and out. The piece of floss was also too taunt and inflexible, and I could not floss under the gumline with it. I needed it to \\"curve\\" it around my tooth more, so I tried to put more force on it to bend the floss into the proper shape, but this caused the floss to break. The handle is nice, and the size is good. My biggest complaint is that it was inflexible and felt like it was cutting my gums instead of being able to floss under them.

Fair play to Michael Woods and Moogwai for saving this track in fine style!Both mixes are totally different. The Moogwai mix is more minimal on the bassline, and lets the main riff take control of the song. Its absolutely brilliant, and is better for home-listening or to chill too I think.Then, the Michael Woods remix. His first ever remix, and its arguably better than the Moogwai mix. Its the shortest of the 3 mixes on the single (6 minutes long), and takes a good 4 minutes to get going. But that second breakdown in this mix is absolutely amazing!!

I have similar products from three other makers of Professional DJ/Audio racks that are being replaced because of the difference in the quality and appearance. I would recommend this case with one piece of advise, the case is built with real plywood and as such, may require a litle maintenence prior to use. When I received this, and two other cases, the rails were a little loose. Since the rails are held in place with bolts and are able to be tightened or replaced, 5 minutes and a 10 millimeter wrench will correct the looseness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapper rip off","review":"This doesn't work at all I tried clapping--yelling everything and it doesn't do anything--don't waste your money.

We have it running a lamp next to the front door. There's no wall switch for that outlet, and the switch on the lamp is a bit cumbersome, so I thought the clapper would be a convenient way to turn on the light when returning home at night. It is, but the unit is way too sensitive. Maybe it's the acoustics of the room (hardwood floors), but just about anything will set it off as another reviewer mentioned. Ours does have the adjustable sensitivity and even with it set fully to \\"home\\" mode (least sensitive) it gets triggered when not desired. It will eventually get scrapped when we get a different lamp with a more accessible switch, although I'm just about fed up enough to do away with it even before then."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a nuisance","review":"This little device was more of an irritation to me that I finally unplugged the sucker. I pluged a lamp that I have in my bedroom to the clapper and it would turn on and off at the slightest noise! If I dropped the remote on the floor, it would go on/off. If my TV made a loud noise, it would turn on/off. If I was talking on the phone, it would turn on/off. I used to joke that I had a strobe light in my bedroom, but it got too much for me to handle that I had to finally unplug it. It didn't come with a sensitivity switch and was VERY sensitive to sound, so in short, don't buy it unless you plan to live in silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clapper Is A Fire Hazard!","review":"I bought a Clapper for my daughter for Christmas.

Then in June 2009, while watching tv with my two young children, the lamp turned off for no reason. I walked over to the clapper and bent over to look at it, when it started sizzling and crackling and glowed bright red. I think the red glow was because it was on fire on the inside of the unit. I unplugged it as fast as I could but the house smelled of smoke for a long time afterward. I am just glad this didn't happen while I was out of the room. I think my house could have burned down and/or my kids could have been hurt. Why hasn't this product been recalled?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money on the Clapper","review":"I read the previous reviews and hoped the negative one was not true. But, the Clapper would not work at all for me either. No amount of close up or far off clapping worked. But when I leaned in close to examine it, it turned on without clapping. The sensitivity control did not make one bit of difference. I am not a novice in electronics, and I am telling the truth here. I am not affiliated with any competitive company or product, but just think this product should be taken off the market. I urge you to find some other product that will accomplish your task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fart and it will work.

But my neighbors came to check on me to see if i was clapping for help. But one night i discovered the secret to making it work. It was very simple just fart 2 times and it works. Needless to say i would have to eat Indian or mexican food every day in order to operate my lights. So i decided to go back to basics and use the switch.

Other times I come home and the lamp has turned itself on and burned electricity. I even found a burn mark in my lamp shade. My house could have caught on fire!I tried both slots.

The Clapper has worked great for me. It comes with two plugs. The first plug requires two distinct claps to operate the device plugged into it, and the second three. This feature greatly reduces the number of times in which the clapper turns your item off because of noise other than a clap. For instance, when my dog barks the clapper does not respond. I have had the clapper for about a month and it has only turned itself off in response to other noises a handful of times. The old clappers were more sensitive. This only works when it heres two or three distinct and separate noises back to back. If there is too much noise it doesn't respond. It is not perfect, but it fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapper doesn't respond to claps","review":"I received The Clapper for Christmas from my husband.

I realized I had to use a pair of hard-soled shoes to get The Clapper to turn on or off. I can get the sequence down for both sides - that isn't the issue. But I live in an apartment and had to hit the shoes together so loudly that my husband could hear them outside and around the corner - I'm sure my neighbors will be just as glad to get rid of The Clapper as I am.

The Clapper seemed like the perfect solution.It would turn on/off if our dog barked, but we could clap 4, 5, 6... times and it wouldn't turn on/off.

First, sometimes I don't successfully clap it on or off on the first try. Trying again usually works. Also, some sharp repetitive noises set it off. When I had a cold, my coughing would turn the lights off, which was funny and only occasionally inconvenient.If you are close to the clapper case, you can actually tap lightly on the case instead of clapping.

Why won't they? It's called profit. I use them for now, but when they are gone, I'm going back to purchasing regular floss at the 99 cent store. It's a far better deal economically. It's the small things in life that raid our bank accounts, until they add up over time to huge expenditures. They are convenient, but at 14 cents each, I can do without them. So can you! They only last about three days, using them one time a day. I can watch them fail and wonder what I'm doing buying them. And since they aren't available in bulk on line, I suspect the maker is behind that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hippo needs some real friends.","review":"This book gets two stars for being well-written, having cute pictures, and being fun to read. However, I am concerned about the content. If you want to bring up your children to resist peer pressure, then this might not be a good choice.I'm sure the author didn't intend anything bad, but when the hippo finally goes along with the crowd to have some fun, some alarms go off in my head.Clearly the hippo's struggle was with shyness, and the other animals certainly weren't doing anything \\"bad,\\" but when my daughter encounters situations where others are having fun but she's struggling with her moral compass, I want her to have the strength to leave that situation and find some different friends who have their heads on straight.When my daughter's a little older I'll ask her to help me write an alternate ending for this book, in which the hippo will find some real friends who respect his values and like him because of who he is, not because of what he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good message about self esteem","review":"I love Sandra Boynton books. We have many and I want the rest but I just don't care for this book. Either I totally missed the point or she's sending the wrong message here. The hippo is left out of fun things time and time again then when the gang finally thinks to invite the hippo he only hesitates for a moment then runs to join the gang. The gang are inconsiderate fake friends. The hippo does not need fake friends and I will not encourage my child to join other kids that usually leave him out."},{"rating":"1","title":"the only Boynton book I didn't love","review":"My daughters don't care much for this book either, but they love all the rest of her books.

Children should be taught to treat others with kindness instead of ignoring a new friend.While the other animals are not to blame for the hippo's shyness, it is certainly within their power to ask her to join in. Sadly, more than three-quarters of the book (and five opportunities to be friendly) pass by before they do so. Even then, the armadillo is left behind. Instead of ending the book on a positive note, the author apparently planned for a sequel.Even the book's dedication smacks of cliquism. I have no idea who Ash, Kyle, and Paisley are (children? pets?), but to explicitly exclude one is to start the book on the wrong note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative messaging","review":"I first read this when a friend bought a set of Sandra Boynton books for her soon. She and I were both horrified by the ending.There were far more positive ways that Ms. Boynton could have ended this story - the hippo could have returned and invited the armadillo along; the book could have ended with the hippo being invited along; all of the animals could have come back for the armadillo.To me, the message of this book is that someone is always left out and implies that it is OK to leave out someone who is different.It's a shame, because the other books in the collection are wonderful. My children will never read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIZARELY WRONG MESSAGE","review":"How this story was seriously considered for a children's book is beyond me.

I never thought that my almost 2-year old would say \\"hippopotomus\\" and \\"armadillo\\" but he does!

The ryming flow of the story gives this book it's good rythm. The author does a good job of keeping the story simple with a nice ryming flow that is not over done. It holds the adults attention as well as the childs. There are just enough words per page as my son looks at the pictures and turns the pages while I am reading to him.I have the board book and highly recommend this type of book. It encouranges interaction from the child allowing them to turn the pages and look at the pictures without tearing the pages. I have found that my son is quite interested most of Boynton's books. I have read to him from a very early age and he will often pick up her books and page through them and bring them over to me to read them to him.Boynton's books were recommended to me at a hospital sponsored child education class and I highly recommend them to you. They make great gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her top favorite","review":"My 3 year old thinks this is by far the most hilarious book ever written.

Sandra Boynton is an excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capture Your Child's Heart With Humor","review":"This is one of our favorite read-aloud books! It isn't so long that you find yourself droning on and on towards a predictable end. Rather, the pictures are funny and elicit laughter and smiles all along the way. If you take the time to make the happy and disappointed faces of the characters as you read and shout \\"YES!\\" with the characters, your child will love it even more. There's lots of room for animation in reading this book, but even if you're not much of a ham, the book brings a smile.. . . And for those of us that have felt like a Hippo (or the occasional armadillo), it's an encouraging reminder to join in with a smile and embrace the fun. Great gift for the special child in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"This is one of the best chidren's books I have ever read to my sons. I enjoy reading it as much as they enjoy listening and looking at the pictures.The person who gave this book such a low rating obviously did not pay much attention to the story. It is a terrific story about having the courage to avoid getting discouraged, and being very happy with the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good message","review":"While S. Boynton's other books are well written, I really don't like the message of excluding others in this one. It seems that the hippo is shy and no of the other animals ask her to play until late in the book and then it ends with the exclusion of another animal..the armidillo. My son likes the pictures so I have re-framed the book to include a \\"because she is shy\\" in a reasonably positive voice and in our house the armidillo gets to play as well (it is \\"and the armidillo\\" on the last page.)I give this book 2 stars because of the illustrations and pleasant rhyming scheme."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a parent's dream come true!","review":"Boynton is the new Dr. Seuss!

I thought it was a little expensive for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and rhythmic, a great way to get your children reading","review":"This book is bright, simple and has a great rhythm. It is about a hippopotomus who is left out of all her friends activities and, of course, how she eventually joins them. It's easy to get your children to begin reciting in reply to each statement 'but not the hippopomus!'. I found my, then 2 1/2 year old 'reading' this book (from memory) to her little sister after only a few weeks. Excepting the fact that many of the terms used for the animals are hardly recognisable outside the US, it is a great little book. A word of warning though.... it's not a good bedtime book unless you plan to read it 30 times before their heads hit the pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably good Mil-SF, though its RPG roots show","review":"Several of the characters from Rice's earlier 'Damned If We Do' return in his second RPG-based 'Renegade Legion' book. This time they're fighting cardboard-cutout villains at the icy south pole of a war-torn planet. The narrative moves at a fairly decent pace, and the story manages to avoid descending into mere gun-fondling; however, the dice can clearly be heard rolling in the background of some action sequences, and the action is occasionally a bit difficult to follow. A degree of familiarity with the RPG background is also assumed. Fans of Battletech novels and David Drake's earlier works will enjoy this one, though it probably wouldn't be suitable for a 'first Mil-SF' book. The content is about a PG-13 level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Root got me and a lot of friends back on our feet","review":"I have a dog-eared copy of this book and I've bought it for every friend I know who has back pain, and they have all benefited from it. Dr. Root does NOT talk in technical language, contrary to what one reviewer said. He talks in a comforting tone as if you have just walked into his office. And you follow him through all the conditions and into the last section -- which most of us considered the most valuable -- and that is the exercises. I've read lots of books with back exercises, but the way Root has organized these, selected them and divided them into stages you can advance to (or not), is the most helpful I've seen. The first section (A) of exercises done seriously for a period of months got me from a frustrating series of set-backs onto a relatively pain-free existence, after the initial pulling of my back. Everytime I slip, I refer to my Root book again. I recommend everyone have it on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide to back pain management.","review":"This book provides some of the most effective lower back exercises and advice I have read. Root focuses on the physiology of the back, and the causes of back pain. While not light reading, the book is concise, understandable, and written with a sense of humor.The author repeatedly emphasizes the need for an understanding of the back, and the necessity of incorporating back stretches into daily living. The descriptions of the exercises, combined with the clear illustrations, provide an excellent foundation to begin this program.While this book may be out of print, it is well worth seeking out. I sincerely hope the publishers reissue it. I use Dr. Root's stretches on a daily basis. They have been very effective for me. I highly reccomend this book for anyone suffering from back pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must book for anyone with back pain","review":"Although \\"Ok My Aching Back\\" was written over 25 years ago, I find it incredibly thorough, relevant.and readable.

Unlike the Barney series on television, and the other videotaped Barney \\"concerts\\" (which are simply the television show on stage), this video is less a series of production numbers and dialogue, and more of an audience sing-along which encourages lots of at-home audience participation. Many of the songs will be familiar to most parents, allowing you to sing and interact with your child while he watches. Additionally, the more informal presentation of material is far more engaging than the other, more staged Barney videos, encouraging real participation as opposed to passive television watching. Lastly, this video combines education with entertainment, such as the alphabet sung in English, Hebrew and French by young audience members. A great way to have fun time with your child--or to give yourself 40 minutes to shower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Video","review":"and so does my 9 month old baby. She loves to dance to it and talk back to Barney. Even my 6 year old and 2 11 year olds like this video. There is less dialogue than in a typical Barney show and more music and dancing.

It gives me the 40 minutes or so in the day that I need to get things accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was horrible!","review":"My kids thought this was much more boring than the other Barney videos.

A huge stage, plus a secondary stage and an energetic Mick make for a fun time. The live show includes a special appearance by Dave Matthews in a duet with Jagger during \\"Wild Horses\\". There is also an appearance by jazz great Josh Redman during \\"Waiting on a Friend\\". The DVD exhibits quality engineering and is closed-captioned, recorded in 2 channel stereo and Dolby 5.1 - making good use of rear channels. No other special features are added, which is a little disappointing, but nonetheless a definite plus to any DVD music collection.

The 10 minute Miss You version here is the best available, with the whole band acting like they never want it to end. Lisa Fischer, the awesome support singer, is in rare form as she and Mick bump and grind all over the stage. She gets in everybody's business on this one. Surprisingly, Miss You doesn't appear on Four Flicks. Neither does Its Only Rock and Roll, which is a highlight from the B-stage here. Also is a terrific Wild Horses duet with Dave Matthews and Dylan's Like a Rolling Stone-performed better here than on Stripped. Another highlight is Keith's I wanna Hold You, from Undercover. The sound is a slight step down from Four Flicks, but certainly great for when it was released. At the end we get a blazing Juming Jack Flash with Mick sporting cool shades and Keith and Ronnie weaving in and out like they're trying to outdo themselves. Lots of Fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent snapshot of the Stones","review":"I didn't see this concert live, only saw the DVD, but as a long time Stones fan I was impressed.

The Stones were on top of their game at this St. Louis concert, soulful, bluesy, and rocking. The cameras stay on the band the whole time, unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience. The sound is CD quality, the picture and color is vivid, the editing is tight. The highlight for me is Keith Richards' \\"I Wanna Hold You\\" and some incredible versions of many classics. The songs from the Bridges to Babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire. The fact of the matter is the Stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts.I highly recommend this DVD. It is superior to the Four Flicks, and a lot less expensive. Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rolling Stones prove their live performance legendry!","review":"This is the first DVD I've ever purchased and I must say it met my expectations.

One may either love or hate the rap versions, but they are done well, as usual. \\"Don't Take Away My Heart\\" is an interesting single in itself, and works best in the vocal version. \\"Fly to the Moon\\" is nice, but much less demanding than the title single.

The base of the mic will accept either the included XLR cable or a wireless 'stub.' There is a small base unit with an extending antenna (about 12\\" long) which connects to your audio equipment. You'll need to buy an extra 1/8\\" to 1/8\\" mono cable to connect to a PC sound card.The wireless reception is abysmal. If you move around while singing into the mic, it keeps dropping signal and emitting a loud static 'snow.' Even standing nearby (10 feet) and carefully orienting the microphone with the base antenna, the signal inexplicably fades in and out.At least the unit was very inexpensive...not worth my time to issue a return.

As we age, we see new movies or books or games that have been done before. Sometimes the new movie or game is acutally better than the original. Usually though, it is an average redo with new technology to \\"make it the best ever\\". If you never played some of the older games like Diablo, than this is well worth buying. Otherwise, you may be bored.

So you just go out and kill stuff until you lvl up some more. If you do that,The game wil be alot of fun to play. At lvl 13,the main quest sent me to kill 3 lvl 18 mobs and i got locked in the cave with them to boot. I died quick,so for now i'll just have fun killing stuff or try to find some side quest to do. What really makes the game stand out for me is the character/class system. You can really come up with some interesting ideas. This is a pretty good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of content","review":"This game has a ton of content. I haven't completely finished it, but at this point I've already felt that I was at the end twice only to have a whole new chapter of the game open up. That's pretty impressive to me after having played through numerous recent games that had less than 10 hours of content. I really felt like I got my money's worth and then some out of this game.Of course as other reviewers have mentioned, this game bears a striking resemblance to Diablo II. If you are into action type RPG's, that's a good thing, though and exactly why I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished and buggy.","review":"Be advised, this game is extremely crash prone and suffers from some extremely frustrating bugs - like character loss! The company admits to issues, and claims to be trying to fix them, but thus far they've done nothing.To top it off, there are big balance issues later in the game that clearly show the game was not fully play tested. Once again the developer claims to be working to address these issues - yet we see no patches to address them.The final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is short, expect only 3 hours to finish the main quest on normal, then you have to repeat the SAME GAME 2 more times to unlock all difficulty levels.What a stinker of a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"CV boot tool","review":"This tool works just as advertised.

I was swept up in the gripping narrative. I knew Bukowski and we were close friends for 20 years, so it was like reading an account of my own life. There were fotos I'd never seen before, of Hank and his family, of his girlfriends in later years, and a lot of information about Bukowski that Sounes discovered during his research. I was very impressed with the book and recommend it to anyone intersted in Bukowski's extraordinary life. Sounes did not spare him, but he was fair and objective.

I would have never bought this for myself, but decided to just use it since it was for free and if I didn't like it I would give it away. One night before bed I applied it to my arms and it was SO thick, so GREASY, the residue it left on my skin was horrible and I felt like none of it even sunk in. It was shocking.

These include family / personal issues, history of church violence, anti-Semitism, Viet Nam, and the infiltration of Christian fundamentalism into the Air Force Academy.As a documentary the film is all over the map, selective and limited in it's documentation, subjective in it's conclusions. The result is a flawed film that I would not be able to recommend.I hope Mr. Carroll is able to make peace with himself and with his God. I think that's really what this film is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not pefect but an important film","review":"History and religion are rarely black and white, and occasionally in this documentary James Carroll seems to forget that fact. Still, this is a devastating look at the ways the Christian religion too often contributed to and cooperated with anti-Semitism, a virus conceived long before Christianity was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"James Carroll has condensed the essence of both of his towering works, \\"Constantine's Sword\\" AND \\"The House of War\\" into this must see documentary. The sad history of Jewish persecution at the hands of Christians, begins with Emperor Constantine and his remarkable mother. From there, through a fascinating series of little known vignettes and insights, culminating in the Nazi Shoah, we drop straight into the lap of today's right wing, so called \\"christian\\" assault on American religious liberty. But Carroll is not content to leave us complacently congratulating ourselves, thinking we viewers, are, after all, above that. He drives home the realization that, if allowed to continue unchecked, we are on an inevitable trajectory to nuclear holocaust. Religious hatred must be called out wherever and whenever we see it.\\"No War is Holy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy","review":"This album is a great one for the collection if you are into alt country.

I have owned this Schepkin disc of the WTC-Book 1 for quite some time and it is one that I reach for as often as any I own - and I have probably a dozen WTC1s. His interpretation does not transgress the bounds of taste or authentic performance practice as some do, and yet he brings a freshness and ��lan to his playing that I find quite invigorating. His ornaments are always appropriate and yet often surprisingly inventive. Further, the recorded piano sound is lifelike; the bass is particularly rich here so that he doesn't seem to feel the need to do octave doublings as some interpreters do.For what it's worth, I also love his 'Goldberg Variations' on this same label. I think young Mr Schepkin is an outstanding Bachian and I look for anything he records.2 CDs - TT: 115:30Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment!","review":"The market is full of great Bach's WTK recordings made by Russians: Richter, Feinberg, Feltsman, Afanassiev, etc....Why do we need to hear a vain attempt to copy all of the above by a good student from New England Conservatory?

I put this trap at one of his holes, but he avoided it like the plague. Within a few days, it was rusted to the point that the trap would not even set off when I poked the trigger with a stick. So now it's off to recycling. If, as some commenters suggest, covering it with some primer is a good way to make it last longer, I suggest the manufacturers do so.And unlike some other commenter said, you DO want the setting tool. I'm a decent sized ex-offensive lineman and NCAA athlete, and my intelligence is not lacking. I had a very hard time setting this trap, and eventually went back to buy the setting tool. Now that's off to recycling too...I did catch a groundhog with a live trap a few weeks after I gave up on this one.

When I saw her obituary, I knew that she had gone to that mountain because her father had named her for it; it wasn't until I read this book that I knew how and why she died. Her father was an obsessed mountain climber who never realized he was endangering his daughter with his behavior. He once gave a talk to our school on how he had saved his frozen, fallen off toes from another climb, and made it sound like a funny joke to have frost-bitten parts of your body fall off. Devi was bright, pretty and friendly; she deserved a better life than to go to meet her predestined death on that mountain.This book allowed me to know what happened; I am grateful for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A self-serving book","review":"As an avid reader of mountain books, this is one of the better ones. The story of the ascent of Nanda Devi and the unfolding tragedy is a compelling one. That being said, I have read other accounts of this expedition, and of other expeditions that included John Roskelly, and it is obvious that the author has very much climbing skill and very little emotional intelligence. This version is self-serving, and it is doubtful that it represents anything other than his perspective. One thing that is glaringly obvious- Roskelly's complete lack of respect for the Unsoeld family and their values, his distain for women (except the kind he can control), and his lack of interest in anything other than the summit.Who knows what effect this had on the expedition's outcome? I sincerely hope he has grown up by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool British-style product","review":"I loved barbecued baked beans but these British-style beans with a simple tomato sauce are so much more versatile.

You can get many different effects by changing settings, which is easy to do. Can insert a SD card for huge number of photos on the road. Takes low light very well, even without flash. Auto features.

This book has helped to fuel my desire to be home and be my own boss, while helping me to sort out the steps I need to take to start my own home-based business. Ms. Folger has sensibly organized this book, enabling the reader to approach a home business thoughtfully. What I found most helpful were the profiles of 29 women out there who really made it.

Sure, Liz Folger gives you practical advice on how to work from home and take care of your family. But if you were a degreed professional prior to being a mom, this is NOT the book for you. I have a B.A. in Communications and an M.B.A. in Economics. But according to the book, now that I'm a mother I should pursue a home business in candlemaking or crafts (meaning absolutely no disrespect to the wonderful women profiled here). But this is the 90's, not the 50's, Liz! Many of us are educated in far different arenas than were portrayed here!

Instead, hear a great ensemble lead by a brilliant deep voiced dark but swinging vocalist. What's different about this album is that instead of having all lazy tempo Jazz standards or super uptempo bebop, the thing offers a lot of variety and shows a heavy grooving and hard swinging ensemble at ease with themselves and the music. Both the cliches of vocal and organ Jazz are notably absent, as a result you can listen straight through and follow it, but without feeling like you?ve heard it all before. The first two tunes are the best on the CD as well as a haunting version of Soft and Furry in which James Spaulding blows some haunting flute !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie Jefferson getting his due","review":"Terrific swinging album; Landsberg is highly into it on the Hammond B-3 organ. Giacomo Gates does vocalese in the Eddie Jefferson style with his own unique voice.

Well, worth the import price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near Miss","review":"\\"Grand Drive\\" are a band who I'd heard a lot about, and just sort of assumed I'd like. On the surface they're just the sort of band who I'd go for - intelligent, guitar based, folky, soulful. But for some reason this just never hits the spot. Their sound is too mushy, too honey-coated and gooey. There are some nice numbers on here; \\"Sleepy\\" stands out, and \\"A Ladder to the Stars\\" combines a nice tune with thoughtful lyrics but the rest melt away into a sort of nice, mellow but ultimately unsatisfactory mist.

A film that wanders aimlessly around for a long time, following a group of repugnant characters. Then, in a naked attempt at some kind of climax, we get a scene of graphic violence (well, actually, about three scenes of graphic, bloody violence cut together). Then the film goes back to aimless stupid wandering, and finally finally finally comes to a close.The way Paul Thomas Anderson is able to supply his fine cast of actors with big scenes, in which they get to choke back tears, scream at each other, and just generally ACT ACT ACT ACT in big broad strokes, is truly remarkable. If only he was able to tie all these bravura moments into something that was of any value whatever.Comparisons with Scorsese and Altman are ill-advised, as even a cursory viewing of Raging Bull and/or Nashville will throw the inadequacies of Boogie Nights into sharp relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst films of the decade","review":"A long, boring, absolutely awful movie.

His film about a close-knit, surrogate family of porn stars is beautifully told and brilliantly portrayed by one of the best casts of recent years. While real porn stars are looked down upon, I thought it was really amazing how Anderson used the sex/porn idea to lure people into the movie, but made them stay by showing great characters and great actors portraying them. Dirk Diggler, the character played by Mark Wahlburg (who shows that he really has become an actor) was based off of an actual fallen porn star.

There's so much to love -- Burt Reynolds used to even better effect than John Travolta was in PULP FICTION, a script that performs the exceedingly difficult balancing act of making a poignant, resonant story with characters who are completely ridiculous and laughable, a Polaroid-perfect rendering of the 70s and early 80s, and of course the cast. But of course this is a review of the DVD specifically -- and it's really, really worth buyting. P.T. Anderson's commentary is among the best DVD commentaries I've ever heard, the deleted scenes include wonderful performances by Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle, and overall the special features are really satisfying. The packaging for this DVD is in a great faux-70s style and includes an essay on BOOGIE NIGHTS from Film Comment magazine.

Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Heather Graham all give outstanding performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this movie","review":"Folks seem to pretty divided on this one, but I think it is really an amazing film.

It is not just about people who made porn films, it is a look at the ties which bound people during that hedonistic, confusing era and allowed them to cope--or not cope--with the issues of the day. Almost all of the cast shines, and Mark Wahlberg proves he can act. If you like this film check out Robert Altman's \\"Short Cuts,\\" a criminally overlooked film released in 1993 which, like \\"Boogie Nights,\\" is almost a \\"Nashville\\" for the 1990s.

These four -- and others -- turn in scene stealing performances that never quite overshadow the surprisingly impressive central performance by Mark Wahlberg.Director Paul Thomas Anderson takes viewers inside the porn industry at a time when video was replacing celluloid, but it's the characters that dominate, not the setting. The delicately interwoven stories will grab you and move you even if you've never seen a single porno flick.The soundtrack is great, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a female that lived it, it was awesome.","review":"I, having known Thomas,Paul in his past and having not liked him much personally, thought he did an extrordonary film. Thomas exemplified not only the era via 1978....of the erotica film industry, but he created a film that depicted precedence, process,pain,perseverance,vanity, and shear gut and the ugliness of the time. I agree w/ the 1st review that the male perspective what greatly presented.I would add that what should ensew is in like of the same, a/the female perspective of entering/exiting the erotic industry unscathed.I should add, my opinion of honoring Thomas on his creative process in presenting a true movie that depicts mostly what erotica was about at that time.

The characters are very realistically drawn and - like those horrid clothes and hairstyles! - evoke the atmosphere of the 1970s extremely well. It is in no way a voyeuristic movie. The measure of its success is that the viewer is compelled to sympathise with poor Dirk. This is also Burt Reynolds' best movie since Deliverance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific ensemble acting!!!","review":"We all know that Burt Reynolds, Juliane Moore and Mark Wahlberg turned in excellent performances in this film. However, kudos are also richly deserved for the outstanding perfomraces of Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Bill Macey, the always excellent Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina. Moreover, director Anderson's use of music is phenomenal - the soundtrack does not just set up retro 70s/80s hits, but ties in the the specific mood and action of the film and characters themselves.

So I was glad to get this dvd. It has fabulous and enlightening commentary by Paul Thomas Anderson and many cast members, including Mark Wahlberg, William H. Macy and Julianne Moore et al., but not Burt Reynolds who is given a sweet tribute by Anderson. And big fun is to see, as always, those deleted scenes and outtakes, including excellent work in one deleted sequence by Ari Nicole Parker. Really a good package, as it were, and the film itself, of course, is thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the coolest movie ever made.","review":"I grew up in the 80s, and although a large portion of this film takes place in the 70s, it feels tremendously nostalgic. I feel like every aspect of filmmaking is represented with simultaneous perfection and originality.

Another reviewer thought the characters in this movie were more likeable than those in Magnolia. I think the characterization in Magnolia is its major strength. In Boogie Nights I'm not sure which character was in the least bit likable even less respectable except for William Macy, Burt Reynolds, and the guy who opens the stereo store(sorry forgot his name). Mark Walbergh's character was pathetic. He's arrogant, shallow, and doesn't have any recognizably good qualities. Walberg's acting isn't anything special either.

This movie features many stars of the late 90's and today, including Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams, Burt Reynolds at Jack Horner, John C. Reilly as Reid Rothchild, and Julianne Moore as Amber Waves. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore were nominated for oscars for their breakthrough performance.

Paul Thomas Anderson takes a tough subject, \\"porn\\", and turns it into a moving account of characters involved in the 70's early 80's porn industry. Burt Reynolds could have easily won an Oscar for his great performance as a porn-director with visions of someday making his opus. The ensemble cast is great: especially Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, and John C. Reilly. Anderson is the most exciting director to come out of Hollywood in a long time. He is already a great storyteller and a virtuoso behind the camera. Boogie Nights will probably be his, \\"Citizen Kane.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film - DVD's are the same.","review":"What can i say about this film that hasn't been said? ...You already know that its a great film, wonderful directing and cast.

Don't be dooped by New Line's marketing strategies. You get the same extra features, but on 2 discs instead of one and a nifty new packaging, which is what you are paying for.

The goofy dialoge, the empty characters and the gratuitous violence had me enraged. P.T. Anderson rips off Martin Scorcese at every turn, and the story moves at a snail's pace. I felt no sympathy/empathy for any of the characters. This movie is based on scumbag John Holmes, and anybody that knows the truth about him should be seething at the fact that a movie has been made glorifiying his life. Finally, this film is just plain boring. I rented this movie with the highest expectations, but an hour into it, I was watching the timer on the VCR wondering when this abomination of film making was going to end. This is the worst film I've ever seen. Sure, the acting and production values in 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' are infamous, but 'Boogie Nights' left me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"This movie is just overrated trash. It is boring, long, & there is really no point to it. I cannot see why people are giving it five stars & calling it one of the best ever.

I can think of several actors who would have been as good as Burt, and many that would probably have been better, because the role doesn't demand much of an actor.Mark Wahlberg was good as the young man in the movie, but he's been much better in several other movies.Save your money.

The materials covered by the book are not difficult at all from a mathematical point of view (I have a background in theoretical physics) but the authors managed to make them hard by giving bad explanations or no explanation.

However, if you don't know C programming and have no experience in any language programming, please don't use it. The author puts some hard materials on the very first chapters, such as functions and objects. The author didn't clearly put definitions or concepts first and then explain by examples. Rather, the concepts are not highlighted and are only explained if needed. This means you have to look for the concepts by yourself. This might be what the author said: reducing those unnecessary contents. Honestly speaking, it's an excellent book because it teaches something of what programmers might be unaware, such as data and memory managements. So I suggest it for experienced programmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I can't praise this book enough for its style and clarity. Dr. Shtern has an unusual talent for speaking in terms that a beginning C++ user can understand and an experienced C++ user can appreciate. Far more than a \\"how to\\" book, it's also a \\"why to,\\" a \\"when to,\\" and a \\"why this is important (or not)\\" book. I won't try to say it all here; read the Amazon.com editorial review--it's right on the money. \\"Core C++\\" has been a real pleasure to read.

Instead, this version is full of modern, slangy English idioms, like \\"You've got it made.\\"And the repeated use of the word \\"wench\\" instead of a more poetic rendering, for instance \\"girl\\" \\"maiden\\" \\"serving maid\\" or \\"handmaiden\\" or even just plain \\"woman\\" or \\"young woman\\" would have been far better. I'll be selling this copy and buying one of the older translations of the Kalevala.Don't bother with this one unless you want a very modern read---and I don't mean that in a good way---with all the magic sucked out of it due to an uninspired translation.Thoroughly lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, too-literal translation","review":"I first heard about the Kalava in middle school when I wrote a term paper about Finland, and learned that its poetic meter was copied by Longfellow when he wrote \\"The Song of Hiawatha.\\" Recently I ran across it again while doing research on mythology, and decided to actually read it this time. The stories are fascinating, and now I know where Tolkein (a great favorite of mine) got some of his ideas! However, the translation was disappointing. I think the author was trying to be as true to the original as possible, but the result is clunky and not at all poetic. For instance, every time someone speaks, it says, \\"he/she declared, chattered,\\" which sounds more like a cocktail party than an epic poem! Finally I purchased a different translation which preserves the original meter, and found it much more readable. I've kept this one for reference in case I want to know the literal meaning of a passage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wish I had paid better attention and reviewed the inside of this book before making my purchase.

The chest strap broke after 6 months of use. The replaceable battery is nice if the rest of the unit holds up, but it didn't.

It seemed to function relatively well when I received it (though I suspect this was due to the fact that I was sitting in a chair when I tested the heart monitor function) On beginning intensive use of the heart monitor function in late December '06 and having problems with it, I did some research online and discovered that in general, Timex heart monitors have been extremely unreliable - this has been my experience as well.The heart rate monitor is EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE. Readout registers numbers ranging from in the 40s during heavy exertion (should be somewhere in the 160+ range), up to the max of 240 (my max rate is approximately 190). HRM frequently loses connection with display on watch.Of course thus far in my communication with them BestBuy has invoked their \\"30-day return policy,\\" and I don't expect much from Timex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex cardio watch is just what I wanted","review":"I purchased the Timex watch with pulse rate monitor for a couple of reasons:- it had exactly the features I wanted at a reasonable price- unlike the leading brand that you find in all the sporting goods stores, you don't have to throw the chest band away or send the watch back to the manufacturer when the battery dies. The chest band battery is user replaceable and the watch battery can be taken into any store that can replace watch batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything we asked for...","review":"I got this watch as a Christmas present for my husband.

And yes I have wet the sensors and moved it around and even tried it w/ different bras thinking they might be interfering with the way it sits on my torso - to no avail. It worked great for the 1st month or two, and then just stopped. I will be doubled over trying to catch my breath in a high intensity interval training session and the heart rate monitor reads my heart rate at 42! then out of no where it jumps up to 170 and at random can't find my heart rate again. there seems to be no correlation on what exercise i'm doing. Congrats to those who got one that works, but there seems to be just too high a percentage that you'll get one like the rest of us who got lemons.

I finally got the monitor, and it does not function well. The watch part works great, but according to the instructions the chest strap has to be SOAKING WET to send a signal to the watch (something not mentioned in the online product description), and even then does not send a reliable signal, even with the chest strap uncomfortably tight and the watch 6\\" away.

Salamanstodon is one of many wonderful Redwall books. I think anyone who thinks it's stupid IS STUPID, not to be rude, though. Feahrgro (I think that's spelled wrong), is one of the worst most evil villians in Redwall history! He and his braty son Klitch. Those two never got along, and when some vermin turned against their evil leader and tried to kill him, Feahrgro thought his son hired them to, so he really didn't trust Klitch. I thought Klitch was idiotic to kill himself, even though he didn't mean to. He should have known. I liked the good guys much more, and the way that Urthwyte was found, and how everybody came together. It was sad in some parts, but that didn't change how much I loved it!

It's the perfect book for fantasy and medival lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent!","review":"Salamandastron is a wonderful tale about a group of animals that live in a wery large mountain kingdom that dominates a peaceful land. It displays the courage of the many animals as they go on dangerous adventures and try to fend off their evil enemies. The detail of the wonderful setting at Redwall Abbey is fantastic, and you feel like you are right with all the freindly animals. This story is an exiting display of survival of the fittest as the animals fight to keep reign over the kingdom. The plot is very unpredictable, and you always get surprised. I sat on the edge of my seat for the entire book, and I just couldn't put it down. From travels along backcountry roads to a quest for a sacred sword, this is probably one of the most exiting, and intriguing stories that I have ever read. Upon finishing it I wanted to get right in to the next book, and I certainly see that Brian Jaques has an unbeleiveable talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"I hate to be a damp rag, but this book really seems like it was wrote halfheartedly. Urthstripe? Urthwyte? I mean, come on, you're going to need better names than that if you want to write a book. Though Urthstripe and Mara both seem wishy-washy and poorly defined, the other characters more than make up for what those two lack.Even though Salamandastron did not lve up to my expectations, I would feel terrible if I gave anything less than 4 stars to any of Brian Jacques books. Brian Jacques is a masterful writer, with the ability to keep the reader engrossed in even the worst of his many books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talos The Mummy is a great score!","review":"Wow, when I saw this movie I thought it was really good - but you know what?

He has a fluid and easy and personable manner on stage that's a reflection of the years of painstakingly refining his material, getting the timing and the minute facial expressions down pat.

Here are people who probably will find spending more than ten minutes listening to his jokes cumbersome and annoying: those who are single and who don't want to hear about those who are not complain about having kids, those who work out and are in good shape and don't want to hear those who are not complain about how hard it is to go the gym.

But, not a word of useful info for any problematical issues we can encounter when using their printers.

He didn't get to do anything. The ladies, though, are very nice looking.I would rate this movie X-."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the item","review":"I never received the item. Apparently they had the old address for the office and no one ever called to get the proper address. I believe the item just got returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is there to say?","review":"If you are looking at this item, then you know what it does and why you need it.I purchased the 8U Space version so that I would have room to grow, but if you don't think you need 8U, then a smaller size may be more portable. I can carry this unit, but it is just thick enough to make carrying it sort of awkward. Other than that, I have no regrets (and, really, I don't regret that, when all is said and done...).One additional note: I also purchased some rack screws to mount my hardware, but discovered upon opening this unit that rack screws are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product for soft curls!","review":"I have curly hair - loose spirals - and somewhat thin hair. This product is AMAZING because it defines my curls, makes them silky soft, without weighing them down. My frizz is controlled, and it looks very natural. I have used this product for years, and I would be heartbroken if Redken discontinued it! I find most curl cremes to be too heavy and sticky for me, but this product is very light and moisturizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiroji Kobuta Japan Advanced Civilization","review":"Mr. Kubota is thus far my favorite Japanese photographer. His book \\"Japan\\" is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! If I had billions of dollars, I would make the book available to kids and at-risk youth in ghettos throughout the world as a means with which to show and demonstrate how resilient and incredibly intelligent Japanese citizens are in the way they work together and as depicted by Hiroji Kubota in his photos. Hiroji Kubota's book changes paradigms and the way that we view the world as a whole. This book is a an absolute must see and read! Get it if you can! 5 STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy Boats in a half-full tub...","review":"This is a pretty good book on the subject. I gave it a four because I believe this is a worthy subject and needs more attention to details. In other words, the book, as good as it is, needs many more and detailed photos. Otherwise, perhaps, it could have added more info on the manufacturers and any history/interesting background on each model. The photos, as they were in number, are quite good in quality. I do recommend this book for anyone wanting a brief look at these samples of the toy boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Block does it AGAIN!","review":"You should probably know that I'm a bit biased about this book, because Francesca Lia Block is, in my opinion, the most amazing author ever. So of course I devoured _Guarding the Moon_ in less than 24 hours, and found every page delicious. Block meditates on life with her new daughter using the same gorgeous language that made me fall in love with her fictional characters. Even as someone who *never* wants children, I couldn't help but be moved by Block's love for her daughter.The book, like Block's others, is beautiful, even as some parts are very sad. If you've read her other works, you've no doubt wondered about which of the themes (dead & dying fathers, eating disorders, etc.) Block had pulled out of her own life. This book answers some of those questions and is a beautiful testament of a mother's love for her daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I have been a Francesca Lia Block fan for a while and I hadn't bought this book because I'm not a mom so I didn't think I'd be able to relate. I was so wrong. Her poetic style translates just as well in to non-fiction as it does in fantasy. Her insight into motherhood is so deep and touching. I would encourage anyone to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Moon-eyed for Me","review":"I read this book on the basis of the rave reviews here. Frankly, I was disappointed. I found it tediously self-indulgent and self-absorbed. She goes on and on and ON about how enraptured she is with her bambina, and yet every now again she lets slip something like how \\"they lost their regular sitter\\" when the baby was nine months old. A sitter! Yet she has said over and over how incredibly attached and preoccupied whe is with this infant! In that way she reminds me of the aunt in Proust's Swann's Way who claimed she never ever slept and yet would sometimes forget and say something about waking up or nodding off, or of a dream she had had.Block is so totally focused on her feelings and her body that in some ways the baby is almost incidental to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book--for some good laughs","review":"This is the most self-indulgent piece of you-know-what I've ever read in my life. I got this book for a present, and I ended up turning to random pages and reading out loud random passages to friends so that we could laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. I'm a first-time mother, and I'm appalled that anyone would think that I could relate to this woman's awful narrative. It's like she just decided to publish her personal journal, thinking that people would enjoy reading it. And I guess some have, but it just wasn't for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work even after4 coats","review":"By buying this more expensive sealer, I thought I would have nothing to worry about. But even after 4 coats, I don't get the desired result on my kitchen granite. My granite type is: typhoon green. I called up stone tech experts after applying 2 coats and they asked me to apply a few more coats. Now after 4 coats, I still have water marks in 5 minutes. We aren't taking any chances with cookIng oil making sure we have no spills at all. I might call the granite guys to seal it. But after more than a gallon of stone tech use, we are left disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source of butterfly pictures","review":"There are 388 pictures to draw from. Some are not very clear (a little blurry) but I'd say 80% are really good. Great colors, lots of variety both in terms of types of butterflies and in sizes. Most are stand alone butterflies but some are accompanied by flowers/fruit too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated version sent twice","review":"I have ordered this carseat and when it arrived it was the old version without the gracopedic foam, 3X more EPS foam, and no travel pillow. I called and they sent out another seat. Same outdated seat sent. I will not compromise my angels safety. If Graco added more EPS foam, then the booster needed it. I want the item very badly, but I want it as described, with the new advances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great booster seat","review":"We always liked Graco products and have had several for our twin girls, now age 5. We used Graco infant seats, stollers, and now this booster seat. This seat does all that it supposed to do. My girls love the pattern, the cup holders, slide inside which is good. The cup holders could be a little bigger but safety is most important. Amazon had the cheapest price for this, with free shipping and no tax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This booster seat is the cutest thing ever. Ordered it friday got in on wednesday!!! The back goes down very easily when you carry it. Other then that i love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, easy to use & easy to switch from car to car","review":"The Graco TurboBooster is the ubiquitous booster in all the minivans and SUVs around the elementary school grounds for a reason- it's so easy to use and lightweight. Great for transferring from one car to the other or just if you want to fold down the seats when you're hauling something without the kids in tow. It's comfy enough for the kids to sit on long car rides (our kids have been in it for 4-1/2 hour stretches at a time without complaint). I easily took it from the taxi to the luggage check-in to rental car as we traveled with it. Just be sure to put it in a plastic airline bag when you're checking it as the two pieces do tend to come apart easily. That's handy when you want to remove the back as they kids get older and just use the base as a regular booster.Great lightweight, adaptable and transportable seat for all kinds of situations that grows with a child from toddler to 8 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco TurboBooster Safe Seat Fairy Tales","review":"The Graco TurboBooster Safe Seat in Fairy Tales was easy to put together and install. My daughter is proud to be out of the car seat and into a booster. She is 3 1/2 and her best friends are 6 yr. old twins, all three like it because it's pink and girlie. I like the design, ease of use, and safety features. I do remind my daughter to sit up straight, and she is mature enough to do so. I'm very happy with this purchase,"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"We love the ease of transitioning the carseat between cars. According to safety reviews, this was considered to be one of the safest seats, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice booster","review":"I purchased this seat for my 4 year old because she loves fairies, and pink and purple. We also have another Graco high back booster for my son, so I knew the quality was good. I like the fact that this seat reclines since my daughter still occasionally falls asleep in the car. That way she doesn't slouch forward and the \\"wings\\" on the headpiece are large enough for her to lean on. I wish the arm rests went up for easier buckling, but I know once we take the back off it's easier to carry by the arm. I also like the fact the cup holders are large enough to accomodate the larger cups, unlike another booster we have. The cushioning on this model isn't a lot but my kids have never complained about that. This will be the only booster she needs since we'll take the back off when she gets a little older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really pleased","review":"I was very pleased with my Graco High Back Turbobooster car seat. It was very easy to put together and looked just like the picture. The cupholders were great. I did add a little of my own padding on the seat because we went on a long trip. I received the seat within in a few days of ordering. My grandaughter was very comfortable and it was very safe too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat","review":"I bought the car seat when my daughter was approaching 3 yrs old. It is very light and my mother has no trouble getting it in and out of her car. There have been no problems so far and my daughter likes it and finds it comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Booster!","review":"I bought this product because the Graco TurboBoosters are well-reviewed by Consumer Reports. The head support on this one has worked very well to support my daughter's head when she falls asleep in the car. The fabric is also very cute. My 6-year old loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a little girl","review":"My daughter loves her fairy tales booster seat, and frankly I'm over the moon for something so easy to install!! My daughter had figured out how to move the chest plate of her 5-point harness around, so it was time for a change. This seat is easy to carry, easy to install, and my daughter loves the design so much she actually wants to get in her carseat.It does have to be put together - but my husband did it in minutes. There was a minimum of work involved.I would recommend this to any mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not for sleep booster","review":"This seat is perfect for everything but sleeping. My Daughter loved the colors the cups and is very comfortable. Except when she falls asleep. When she falls asleep she ends up sideways and slumped over onto the armrest.

Still, it has a happy ending, and is a good family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"Don't let the name \\"Streamlight\\" deceive you. The two levels of green LED's are helpful when packing up hunting items in the woods or preparing to climb a tree. However, the lens, especially with the white light, causes the light to disperse into a huge circle, filled with numerous shadows and dark spots. This is especially true for the center, which is usually where the most direct light is needed. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this light. I would have returned it but hunting season was starting and I didn't have time. Save your money and purchase either a Princeton Tec Predator Pro or some other type of headlamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deer Away Big Game Repellant","review":"The deer are still nibbling at my trees.

Just a little wet or dripping. Probably won't try this product or any other like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"Packed with interesting history of the weapons. Also a lot of information is received for the money. All in all a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working For The Nazi's","review":"The book \\"The Holocaust Survivors\\" is mainly about how interviewers ask some of the survivors what it was like to be in the Holocaust. Many of the survivors said that it was very tragic to see some of their family members being shot, for some unknown reason or dieing, or from starvation. I thought this book was a great book on the Holocaust during World War II. The book also taught me more facts on what happened to the survivors. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afro Celt Sound System Volume 5: Anatomic","review":"This is my second buy for the Afro Celts.

Wonderful international flavor, deep soulful female vocals and great Irish sounds abound. I like it.Not as much fire in this one as the first 3 albums (not mellow but it doesn't test my Sony as the first 3 did). And thankfully not as hypermixed as POD. Not bad, not stellar, but a good enjoyable CDWorthy of 4 stars for ACSS's 5TH CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afro Celt Sound System","review":"Five stars!

But, this child prevails. With Courage and Determination he writes about his life in this remarkable book. This is an absolute must read book that ranks up there at the top with Nightmares Echo, A Child Called It, Running With Scissors and Sickened.My final words are: read the books,learn the signs and help stop this from happening around our silent ears"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"For those who are solitary and just starting on their journey I can't reccomend this enough. Start with the Inner Temple then move on to the Outer Temple. I have always had difficulty with meditation, my mind wanders to much. His guided meditations have been invaluable to me. The journey with the Goddess took me places I NEVER thought I was able to go. He also does a complete ritual with casting a circle, calling the quarters and leaves plenty of time to work whatever you need to inside the circle. To me it was as if a high priest was right there helping me with my ritual. The beautiful background music was able to take me into an altered state within the circle. If you are experienced and comfortable with this, already have a deep connection with your patron this is not really for you. But someone needing just that little bit of direction to start out with. This is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this one.","review":"Another great book in the \\"temple\\" series. Penczak recommends taking a year to complete all the exercises in the book. Perhaps because I am already a practicing Witch, I don't see how it could possibly take that long. Also, Penczak is very generic in his books and does not teach a particular path, but witchcraft in general. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murrow cousin comment","review":"Persico did an oustanding job of capturing the life of Ed Murrow. As a cousin of Ed Murrow and researcher of the family history, one correction in future printings would be appreciatiated. Chapter 2, page 16 (in my version) states that Ed's father, Roscoe's, grandfather, \\"had married a woman who was half Cherokee\\". That is not correct. Roscoe's grandfather was Andrew Murrow who married a true daughter of the British Isles. Our beloved Cherokee connection comes from a generation earlier - Roscoe Murrow's great grandfather, father of Andrew, John Murrow, married a woman who was one QUARTER Cherokee. So the statement was wrong on both counts - wrong generation and wrong amount of Native American heritage. In Persico's defense, this information came from an interview during which Ed Murrow himself apparently misquoted the family history."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you could ever want to know about Ed & broadcasting","review":"This is an excellent book! It's long but worth every minute. The read the life of Edward R. Murrow is to read the history of broadcast journalism. Not always loved, but certainly always respected by his colleagues, Ed introduced the live broadcast so the listener could \\"experience\\" history in the making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total and complete waste of money","review":"I bought this product at a local Petco, hoping it would shut up the horrible barking dogs our neighbors refuse to control. I brought it home and pointed it first at my own two dogs. One dog (at a distance of only about 5 feet) had no reaction at all; the other dog just perked up his ears and then went about his business. Outside, the neighbor dogs didn't even respond to it (not even a flick of the ears) and our dogs just ignored it totally.Our cat, however, FREAKED OUT and clearly heard the noise.Great for cats, very, very ineffective for dogs (at least the four I tested it on).Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"amp","review":"I should have read this feedback before I made my purchase.

(At least Mae West never missed a performance because she was too busy at home having multiple orgasms.) La Tetrazzini was as mysterious as an oyster; she never learned to speak much English and used this language barrier to her advantage by having her publicist spin article after article to the news media without revealing much more about the singer's private life than which foods the soprano enjoyed or how much she missed being in England. Unfortunately, even though the account of her private life and her brilliant career should be a page-turner, Mr. Gattey does not know how to do justice to his material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dance Remixes In The WORLD!","review":"Please,Please,Please Buy This!

This was before the modern age of the internet, and tracking stuff down, was next to impossible.She wrote a letter to the author, asking about how she could find a copy. The author sent a copy to her, which she gave to me.

Then they substituted Ashley Judd for Harrison Ford. Unfortunately she's playing above her pay grade in this movie which is basically a clunker, redeemed only by the brilliant Tommy Lee Jones who simply can't be bad, no matter the material.There are so many implausible plot twists, not least of which is the idea that if you get wrongfully convicted of killing someone who is not actually dead, you can go ahead and kill them and not be prosecuted for it twice (\\"double jeopardy\\") which is completely untrue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Had one of these already in my wiring cabinet and bought this so I could have the whole house wired up at the same time.

Joe has come a long way since his aborted attempt at \\"hitting it big\\" with his debut album a few years back.

As some of the other reviewers have astutely indicated, there are cut-aways during songs.

The orchestra is excellent and more fluid than the performances of the singers which are more rigid than I tend to enjoy of the German versions.

On the downside, the information and strategy presented in this book are simplistic and somewhat out of date when the original 1987 publication date is taken into consideration.

With the song \\"I'm Trying\\", this CD could not get any better. The message behind that song is so important to daily life. On another song, he has an little Irish influence in it as well.

'Straight Into Darkness' is one of my Petty favourites and sits perfectly in the middle of this album. This album doesn't have the blatant rock n roll fun of his first album, the fire and power of 'Damn The Torpedoes' or the exuberance of 'Full Moon fever', yet it has a solid sound and feel to it that makes it stand out in it's own right.

There is far too much melodrama. The revelations of past events are plain junk food for the mind.On top of that, the narrative concept sucks. You have a first person narrator who is in the middle of the plot, and then every few chapters, a 3rd person narrator shows up who introduces mysterious personae in mysterious circumstances, who are obviuously somehow related to the central mystery of the disappeared elder brother of the central man, and his mysterious alleged murder.I give two stars instead of one, because the author is good at twisting the tale.

Every time I thought I had the book figured out, another twist would be thrown in--and not just a little twist here and there, but entire 180-degree, plot-changing curves! Even down to the last chapter or two, when you finally feel like the plot has finally been laid out.In short, a hearty recommendation from me just on pure entertainment value"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan Coben is amazing!","review":"I have read several of Harlan Coben's novels and his novels are the only ones I will spend my time reading. He is an amazing writer, to say the least. I would recommend any of his novels to anyone who enjoys suspense thrillers with intriguing characters and plot twists galore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone For Good","review":"If you are thinking about reading Harlan Coben's latest novel solely based on the praise of \\"TELL NO ONE\\" I can assure you that \\"GONE FOR GOOD\\" will not disappoint! \\"GONE FOR GOOD\\" is an action packed, roller coaster ride of a novel that will keep you guessing until the very last page.Will Klein has been leading a pretty normal life since the disappearance of his brother Ken over a decade ago. He has a good job at Covenant House, a girlfriend he soon plans to marry and has finally begun to put the past behind him. That is until his mother's death brings the circumstances surrounding the believed death of his brother back to the surface. This coupled with an abrupt departure of his girlfriend lead Will to believe that these events may somehow be connected, forcing him to take a closer look at the events surrounding his brothers disappearance. This eventually leads Will to the realization that Ken may not really be dead after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so terrific. . . .","review":"And it doesn't hold up to \\"Tell No One.\\" He crams red herrings and double crosses to the point of failing any suspension of disbelief. Are we really supposed to believe a father would essentially sell his son off to prison for $5000, and that the son would turn out to be a ruthless killer (with a penchant for breaking noses)who ends up having a heart of gold? It's light summer reading- - -fast and with some excitment, but ultimately as light and airless as a summer dessert. Pick up \\"Tell No ONe\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Coben book","review":"I discovered this author with last year's \\"Tell no one\\" which then prompted me to go to the library and check out all the other books by the same author. His style for the Myron Bolitar novels is less sinister and more witty, but all his books leave you in suspense and are very well plotted and written. Not one of those books where you know the killer by chapter two!This new book, Gone for Good, is about the unravelling life of Will Klein who struggles to move beyond the fact that his beloved, elder bro, Ken, allegedly killed Will's first love.The book is dark, suspenseful and totally thrilling. Each twist and turn leaves you reeling, gasping, and wanting more.I definitely recommend this book. Coben has an amazing way of keeping the story going until the very last word!Enjoy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! GREAT BOOK!!","review":"I read alot of mysteries and I'm really tired of guessing the \\"real killer\\" 50 pages into them.

I had high expectations for this book but it came up very short. The characters weren't well developed, it's full of cheesy lines, and the story was very weak. It felt like those books that some successful authors crank out in a hurry just because they know their prior success guarantees them a certain number of copies sold. It read like it was written in a couple of weeks with poor editing or written by someone else but with Coben's name. Among the positives: At 340 pages in hardcover you can read this in one or two sittings. Save your money. Try Immoral by Brian Freeman or Tell No One from Coben instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This was my first Harlan Coben book, and it was truly a great book. Interesting plot development and twists. I fully recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan Coben. You. Rock.","review":"Another good book by Harlan Coben. I only gave it four stars because I thought Tell No One was a tad superior. Also a few times I found myself back paddling through the book for answers, that weren't there, but then showed up within the next chapter or two. For example, why didn't Will immediately question how Sheila who supposedly was a teen-age run-a-way, into drugs and prostitution, acquire the means to go away to college? In the book when Will found out the Sheila was away at college, I didn't understand how he (Will) wrapped his brain around that one without question. I assumed that I had to have missed something, maybe in the conversation he had with Mrs. Rogers, but no. After deciding to keep reading forward, then it became clear. However, if I questioned this, why didn't Will?Other than that, I thought it was a terrific story through and through, a great ending, too. I've already purchased the first of the Myron Bolitar series, and look forward to all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Coben book but definitely not my last!","review":"This was my first book by Harlan Coben but definitely not my last. If I ever find a moment of peace and quiet I will soon be adding his backlist to my wish list. Gone for Good had me interested from the first page to the last which is quite an accomplishment for me, the all-too-easily bored. I'm not a huge mystery fan and, to be honest, was somewhat dreading having to read this story for my suspense group because it contained so many pages (anything over 300 scares me). But it was terrific! I never knew where the plot was going to take me next and the characters were very well fleshed out and interesting and I truly enjoyed the glimpse into the world of a famous Yoga instructor (Yoga is my second addiction after books). A big draw for me was the heartrending emotionalism weaved within the story; I came close to tears on many occasions. This is a great book if you like some heart along with your suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Myron","review":"I've loved all of Coben's other novels, but this was a disappointment.

I grew up in the very same Livingston neighborhood where this book is set. That definitely enhanced the story for me. The dizzying plot twists made me wish the book was a bit longer.

I couldn't get into the plot. It dragged on too much about Covenant House, prostitutes, how rough street life is. I didn't like or care for any of the characters.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu","review":"This is my 2nd Harlan Coben book, & I'm equally disappointed. Both books have essentially the same theme, something happened years ago, a whole bunch of characters who utimately all end up interlinked (seems I'm the only one not connected to one of the characters!); really poorly defined characters & far-out twists! I'm done with Coben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"In the book Gone For Good, Will Klein has to deal with a lot of pain and emotional issues throughout his life. First was the murder of his first love eleven years earlier. The suspected murderer was his older brother Ken who disappeared after right after the murder of Julie Miller. Ken was later thought to be dead because no traces of him were ever found11 years later, while at his mothers death, Will finds a recent picture of his brother Ken hidden under a picture frame. Wills fianc�� Sheila later disappears and Will starts finding out unbelievable secretes about both his brother and fianc��.The book itself was good but it reminded me about his book Tell No One. They both deal with the same issue- a disappearance of a loved one who later receives clues that they are still alive. The book is easy to comprehend and is also a fast read. What I mostly liked about it is that I was never bored. It kept me thinking about what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan Coben Owes Me 4 Hours of Sleep!!!!","review":"I absolutely, positively could NOT put this book down!! I could not leave these characters dangling in midair while I concerned myself with sleep!! From page 1 until the last page I was hooked--turning pages as fast as possible and growling at anyone who thought to interrupt me!Coben has done it again with the characters--Will, Squares, Sheila, the Ghost--each with his/her own personality quirks and unique voice. I love the fact that the father/son relationship is just as strong in this book as it is in his Bolitar series. That draws me closer to the main character and I was most definitely drawn to Will.The plot twists are extraordinary--one almost needs a map to keep up!! But just almost. Coben leads the reader through the maze of twists and turns like the master story teller he is.Now to get some sleep......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Its such a great read and keeps you pulled into it and there's so many different things you are wondering while your reading and then the end is just a total shock!

Something new and unexpected about the protagonists is uncovered about every 20 pages. That sounds good but it sounds a lot better than it reads. I just never cared about the characters and all the twists and turns got old fast. I finished it because I was on a business trip to Lilongwe, Malawi and there wasn't a whole lot else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughing Out Loud","review":"By the last 20 pages of this \\"page turner,\\" I was, literally, laughing out loud and reading passages to my annoyed co-workers. I mean -- come on. How many hairpin turns can one book take? And then, the ultimate insult for me as a reader -- a sickeningly sweet ending. It takes guts as a mystery writer to not make it all work out for the main character at the end of the book. Karin Slaughter, by the way, does that very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling stuff","review":"this book, as his last, is certainly suspenseful. Is certainly exciting. Is certainly quite well written. Is certainly interesting. And has certainly got some very real characters, feeling some very real emotions.There is not a lot else that can be said, really.I'm sure you know the plot, i shant summarise it.On hearing what it would be, i was afraid that it would be far too much like \\"Tell No One\\" but luckily HC has managed to keep himself out of that rut, and produce a book which is distinct, fresh, and bears only very very small similarities to Tell No One. He suceeds in making the plot very different in its execution, although it holds a similar style.There are many many great twists. Right until the final 100 pages, it is impossible to see how any of it all connects together, or will make sense. It all seems completely impossible. Yet, Harlan Coben is able to provide an eloquent solution which satisfies, and explains.

He has me guessing till the last page of his books. They never leave my side. I carry them about in anticipation of having a minute or two to read even a paragraph.In this, his latest mystery, we meet Will whose brother Ken disappeared several years ago after being accused of a murder that his family believes he has been framed for. The circumstances around the murder become a tangled web of secrets and everyone has something to hide. Friend becomes foe and vice versa, as everything in Will's life is questioned from start to finish. Wonderfully intricate story line with bone chilling characters that leap off the pages.

Oh yeah, what a wonderful reading experience. The story was a twister, couldn't turn the pages fast enough and the ending, WOW! And the best part is that he writes with a sense of humor.

You may sleep with the light on after reading this one. A Plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snap-Crackling Conclusion","review":"After reading Coben's previous novel, Tell No One, I was looking forward to Gone For Good. This is a complicated mystery with many twists and turns. Coben's subtle humor is sprinkled throughout and tends to ease the tension somewhat. Will Klein, our hero, is very believable as a sometimes brave and sometimes clueless guy. I found the jumping from one scene to another a little disruptive and there were a few noticeable errors. On two different occasions, a character would sit down, then a few lines later, would sit again. This story wasn't quite as good as Tell No One, but it was still a very good read. If you can follow the many twists and turns, you will be rewarded with a snap-crackling good conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same plot, different characters","review":"This is exactly the same premise and plot as \\"Tell No One\\", complete with the ueber-psycho hit man, a girlfriend who works with the homeless (really!), and a totally benevolent, gotta-love-him main character. Both of them were reasonably enjoyable page turners, but it was hard to enjoy what was essentially the same story. My best advice would be to pick one or the other (and they're both equally implausible, so flip a coin) and then don't read the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Thriller","review":"When Julie Miller was found brutally murdered in her basement with Ken Klein as the primary suspect, Will Klein lost both the woman he loved and his brother.

When Will begins to investigate he learns truths and secrets about his brother, his lover, even himself. But there is someone who doesn't what those secrets to come to light and will do anything, even kill, to keep them in the dark.This book just reeks with tension and suspense, my advice is not to start reading it if you have anything else to do, because this haunting thriller will keep you from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better writing and more suspenseful than \\"Tell No One\\"","review":"If you enjoyed Harlan Coben's last book, \\"Tell No One,\\" you will find his new book to be better, or at least an equal.In Gone For Good, Coben again relies on a large cast of characters and tricky plot twists to keep you guessing the outcome right up until the end.Unlike \\"Tell No One,\\" Coben has taken away some of the technological goodies and has written a much more mystery-solving style of thriller and it noticeably helps keep the suspense up without forcing you to slighty suspend your belief.His characters are also more intriguing and well-rounded this time. You get to know more about them and they play a much more integral role in the book.I don't want to ruin the suprises so I'll end my review here.Highly Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone For Good","review":"This book was fanastic.

His Myron Bolitar series is outstanding and his first non-Myron book, \\"Tell No One\\" was great.

It's fast paced and has characters you care about..BUT and this is a big BUT..THERE IS A MAJOR PLOT FLAW EARLY ON THAT NEGATES THE POWER OF THE BOOK. So as not to spoil this for those who haven't read it yet, I won't give away the plot. But, early on in the \\"Ghosts\\" reminiscing, there is an incredible story about how he relished his murder, and later on, we find out something quite contrary. I've e-mailed Harlan on this all too conspicuous mistake, and am awaiting his reply. So, read the book---it's very good...but I only gave two stars because of this big, big faux pas!

Here's another one. I think any good work of mystery fiction should at least have some degree of plausibility, but none here. Mr. Coben could have at least TRIED to write an interesting book, but I guess it's just a lot easier to plagiarise your own mindless drivel. Maybe his next book could involve \\"self-plagiarism\\".

He led you down the path about two characters and then show you how everything isn't always what it seems. I thought it was fast paced enough to keep my attention and didn't take long to read at all.

I can barely finish edging my front drive and sidewalk with one load, let alone the other edging tasks; and I am on an average suburban lot.i only gave it two stars instead of one because it is quite powerful and the two lines sticking out make short order of weeds (before they quickly run out, of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Very lovely shoe, sturdy and comfortable.

There were not as many broken pieces. I returned it again and asked for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged and kinda cheap","review":"The carton came damaged from the shipper. But beyond that, it was packaged damaged from the seller. When we unpacked it looking for any damage, the wrapped pieces inside were bent. There was no way it was a shipping issue. It is pretty bad that quality control would let bent and warped metal through to packaging. I was also unimpressed with the weight of the metal. It was cheap, and I doubted it would last past one season. I opted to return and not seek a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer Problems","review":"I own both Wordperfect 9 and 11 and find that 9 is superior. Apparently in Wordperfect 11, Corel revamped the way the software interfaces with printers so all of the features of my printer (a new model Hewlet Packard Laserjet) do not work without going through several steps in the page setup. Further, Wordperfect 11 freezes up if one uses the latest printer drivers and only works with older versions of drivers. Plus, I bought the product with the understanding that it automatically converts batches of old wordperfect files. I have many documents in wordperfect 4.2 and 5.1. However, Wordperfect 11 does not convert batches of old files in 4.2 and 5.1. Other than above, the software is fine but you may as well stick to version 9 which is fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item never received.","review":"I never received the product.

However, for the same two reasons, now that Linux has become easy to use and rich in programs, I am leaving Microsoft operating systems. And there lies the problem : Wordperfect 11 does not run under Linux, but only under the recent versions of Microsoft's operating system. Too bad, I am greatly disappointed in Wordperfect. I think that if they don't understand that their faithful users are the kind of people that are leaving the Microsoft world towards Linux, they will in the end have to disappear.

Line-up: Nick Mott-guitar, sax & vocals, Daniel Padden-keyboards, guitar, clarinet & vocals, Clarence Manuelo-tapes & electronics and Aaron Moore-drums, trumpet & vocals.

Tabitha's Secret is NOT an earlier incarnation of what is now Matchbox 20. It's NOT a precursor to the band. \\"Don't Play With Matches\\" is NOT Matchbox 20's freshman debut!!! Tabitha's Secret was a different band that three of MB20's members were in. They do not condone the purchase of this album, but they do perform some of these songs in concert. This is a beautiful collection of songs by Rob Thomas, the masterful songwriter/singer that fronts Matchbox 20 and once fronted Tabitha's Secret. If you want to follow his work - buy the CD. But please, please, please....do not confuse Tabitha's Secret with Matchbox 20!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before MB20","review":"This is a good cd. It is a great addition to the collection of any MB20 fan, although it doesnt compare to MB20 and their newer cds. This cd by Rob Thomas' previous band, Tabitha's Secret, has some incredible songs, in which Rob sounds great!! His voice is very different, less raspy, which gives a different feel to 3AM making it sound pure and beautiful. There are some random songs that seem like filler (i.e. Jesus was an Alien) but there are also some great songs that can't be found on MB20's other cds. i.e. Forever December, Dear Joan, and the hidden track Dizzy.

Great performance, wonderful voices, energetic conducting, but how I wished for better recording quality! I am sure today's technology is capable of editing or, at least, reducing the noises from the audience. The \\"pirate\\" really should've turned to his/her neighbors and said \\"hey, I am taping here!\\" Opera D'Oro obtained quite a few selections from now-perished Legato Classics, greatly reducing the price, but sacrificing cover photos and libretti in the process. Except for Eugeny Onegin, I am not aware of any studio-quality recordings on this label (fans, help me out if you are). Of particular interest here is also Mr. Renato Bruson, whose only other recording of Miller was available for the shortest time on DG (under Maestro Maazel). At this price and with these three principals this is an unbeatable deal, even though we all would gladly pay more to hear them in studio recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is the background","review":"This quality of this recording is truly horrific. With all the coughing, talking and murmuring of the audience, the music is relegated to the background. There is not one single piece on this disc that you can enjoy without interruption from a noisy spectator. I have never listened to such a bad live recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost ideal cast","review":"The singers here, especially the Luisa, Miller and Rudolfo, are almost ideal for their parts. Where the performance falls down, in my opinion, is that all three are only too willing to play to the house--in order words go for vocal effects to please the crowd rather than enhance the characters. If that is your bag, and sometimes it is quite marvelous, this is a recording for you. This recording, by the way,is better than the Caballe/Pavarotti version that is also available because it has none of the tension (tension in the sense of anger and/or hostility) of the Caballe/Pavarotti effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Renee The Atavus Slayer","review":"This is what the show should have been re-named, \\"Renee The Atavus Slayer\\", because all the story lines are basically the same thing: Renee trying to hunt down and kill these vampire-like aliens (similar to Buffy The Vampire Slayer). So many things about this season didn't even make sense I don't know where to begin, but one which I thought was pretty obvious is: how does the Taelon mothership manage to stay in orbit for a whole year if it had no core energy left and it got nuked? At the end of Season 4 we are told the ship is in a decaying orbit, which means it should be crashing into the atmosphere sometime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"like in almost every sci-fi serials the last season is the worst one. babylon 5 etc. and we don't have an exception in this one.i couldn'tbelive it when i read the reviews of the others. luckily they were cheap, cause i bought the seasons 3,4 and 5 and i have to admit, that the 4th one is the best one.still hoping to get the first two season to complete the whole series, but if you want to preservate your eyes, don't buy this season!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1000 never seem so long","review":"This truly will tip over your personal barrel of monkeys.

I don't want to sound mean in the least, but I was very disappointed when opening the book to find out that the jokes contained didn't make me laugh. Then I thought about the money I spent on it, and it made it even harder for me to laugh. Now, I'm not boasting when I say I am a truly funny guy. But this is not funny. :(This is funny: Did you hear about the Amish couple that got a divorce? He was driving her buggy. :) Now, that's funny. I didn't find a joke like that in the book.

The dialog was the worst, the acting unbelievably bad. Come on, Vivica, you can do better than this! Sorry to say, but the dog was the best actor in the entire film. I'm not an expert on serial killers, but I would think he would have killed the girl longer ago than he did for all the trouble she caused him. I'll throw it a bone, so to speak, and say that the movie succeeded in being gross and disturbing. Other than that, I found the entire scenario hard to swallow, much like his \\"dinners,\\" and the only one I felt any real emotional bond with was the dog. That's saying something right there. Watch it if you want, but if you think this movie is anywhere close to good where serial killers are concerned, this must be the first one you've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Gone Good","review":"Junkyard Dog is an awesome, edge-of-your seat, film that pulls you in, makes you imagine the unimaginable by showing you the truth which shakes your sensibilities down to the bone and raw nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Qbert?","review":"His name is on the title, but he is nowhere to be found in the video.

I have tried numerous other workout videos, but I always keep coming back to this one. It never gets boring because you are constantly moving so it keeps your attention. It really makes you work up a sweat, and you will feel it the next day. The workout is pretty intense, with lots of jumping jacks, step work, squats, pushups and abs. I personally love the music in this video, and I really like how Keith Byard is constantly counting, talking, and cueing. This is definately my favorite workout video. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows Great Results!","review":"This is a great workout for anyone who exercises frequently. The upper body workout with weights is fantastic! It's a bit tough, but eventually one will be able to keep up. I got a lot of compliments on my toned arms and shoulders. The abs workout is also great, I saw results quickly (eating properly helps too!) The only drawback is one of the girls in the video, Ann (the one with the pigtails) she is sometimes ahead of the instructor, so try not to pay too much attention to her. I highly recommend this video! It includes a bonus 30 minute Yoga segment, but I have never tried it, I'm really hooked on the Advanced workout. This video along with Elle Macpherson's \\"Personal Best\\" really do provide great results when done frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"As explained by other reviewers, this video provides an excellent, intense full-body workout.

If you are buying a minolta camera for it's lens quality, this is the only lens I would buy from Amazon.

I have 2 infant foster daughters and the eldest one at 7 1/2 months would be interested in the flutterbye dreams mobile for a while but would start to lose interest. Since we got this soother to put on her crib she does not fuss anymore at bed time. She is completely mezmorized by the cute little birdies projected onto the ceiling and drifts off to sleep. At nap time in the afternoon I put it on just the regular mode and she just loves to watch the little birds inside it and bats at the soother. She really just loves this thing. She still looks over at the my other 2 month old foster daughters crib which has the flutterbye dreams mobile... but the soother with the the projection keeps her more interested by far. I cannot reccomend this product enough if you have a baby that tends to be cranky at bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soothing toys for babies I've found!","review":"This soother is awesome. It didn't even make it all the way to my house in the box! I got it at babies r us (the store) and I had it out of the box and turned on before we came close to our home. As soon as my two month old saw the birdies and the lights and heard the music, she was absolutely captivated. She loves her aquarium, and now she has birds to love, too. Even my two year old loves it! And the projector feature is great, too. I'm amazed at how well the image shows up on our popcorn ceilings, but it's crystal clear. I think I'll be hanging on to this for a looong time! I still use my Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and even the Peaceful Planet smaller fishbowls. Both my girls love all of their soothers.

We saw the Lullabye Birdies Soother at the store and loved the look and the light show feature. But once we put it in her crib, the light show also included the rotation and the motor was way too loud. It kept her up rather than lulled her to sleep!!We still have it and the kids play with it but it's not used to soothe them to sleep. I might use this one for my youngest baby who is 3 months since she might grow accustomed to the engine noise but for my other daughter, it was just too loud to what she was used to so the Aquarium stays with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months old in hopes to get her to sleep in her crib. It worked like a charm. She loves to look at the birds as they move and the projector is a great soother, she falls asleep within minutes!! I bought the aquarium for my first child and I thought that was great, but the projector on this one is a huge bonus. The only downfall (and why 4 stars not 5) is that the projector uses batteries fairly quickly, but well worth replacing batteries for a good nights sleep!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I just bought this for my son, even though he's 20 months.

We love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not the Best","review":"We bought our son when he was a newborn the Oceanarium that would play for 10-15 min or so. He is 2 1/2 and still uses it to sooth him to sleep and he is an ANGEL when it comes to bedtime/going to bed. We bought the Flutterbye for our 2nd child bc I though it looked ADORABLE but the projection lights shine only 3/4 of the show on the ceiling, the rest is on the wall no matter HOW you posotion it on the crib (baby doesn't seem to mind that at all though) but I wish it would play longer. Some nights when it takes her longer than \\"8\\" minutes to fall asleep she gets upset when it shuts off too soon and she's not asleep yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Dreams","review":"I bought this for my baby out of sentimentality to the orignial Fisher Price Bluebird toy I had as a child. The music is very good and I like how many choices there are, it was always easy to turn on in the dark room in the middle of the night if he woke up and it would help sooth him back to sleep. Now that my baby is crawling, he moves himself over to it and turns it on which is nice because I can always tell that he is awake. My older kids even have fun playing with the projection portion of this toy. The only drawback is that sometimes the bluebirds make a grinding noise when they go around, but it does not seem to bother my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful attention-keeper","review":"The songs, colors, sounds are all great to keep my little one's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"crib toy","review":"I love this toy, I used it to teach my daughter to lay in the crib and fall asleep on her own.

I also found the movement of the birds to be rather loud and almost drowned out the music.My son didn't seem to miss it when I removed it from his crib and loved his mobile more than this anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last more than a few weeks","review":"my daughter loved the flutterbye dreams soother, but it doesn't last long at all. I have returned the item to the store 4 times and got a new one each time and none of them worked. The first one the sound stopped working, I put in new batterys didn't help. The second one the ceiling lights stoped working changed the batterys didn't help. Third one the birds stopped moving changed the batterys didn't help. Fourth one the inside lights where the birds are stopped, of course I changed the batterys each time with new batterys and I tried the batterys on other toys to see if the batterys or ok and the batterys was ok. Ive been through 4 of flutterbye dreams soothers and I just gave up and got a different brand, I got Vtech soother and haven't had any problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so cute but will not last","review":"I received this 5 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child. I loved how the birdies were projected onto the ceiling and I loved how sweet the music sounded. It wasn't too loud and my son loved it. After he outgrew it I took the batteries out and stored it carefully. Now that my second child is due to be born in a few weeks I took this soother out of the closet and put new batteries in it. The only thing that works is the music and lights. The birds no longer move and the light show does not project. Such a bummer. They just don't build things to last anymore. So while it did last for about a year with my first child it no longer works and I don't know why. I just think these baby items should last through more than one baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this crib toy!!","review":"My baby loves this crib toy. She loves to watch the birds chirping and the pictures on the ceiling as she drifts off to sleep. In my experience, it is one of the only crib toys that actually has good picture quality with the projected image on the ceiling (it even amazed my older children). My four month old really enjoys watching the images on the ceiling, and has already learned that whenever I turn the toy on, she darts her eyes up to the ceiling to see the ever-changing images. It has several different types of music and sounds, as well as three different volume settings. Highly reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but doesn't last long.","review":"I thought this toy was adorable & bought it for my daughter for Christmas & the sound went out after about a month of being attached to her crib. There's no chance of the toy being damaged causing it to break. It still lights up & she enjoys that. I'm a little disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have!!","review":"I received the soother while I was pregnant with my daughter and have used it at naptime and bedtime EVERY DAY since. I don't even travel without it. My daughter will be one in February and she is now able to control the music on her own. She will literally get up during the night and turn her music on and go back to sleep. This toy has been an absolute life saver. Every mother to be should have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy Baby!","review":"My friend bought one of these for her new baby and my daughter fell in love with it! She is now one year old and I did not want to get her another crib toy at her age; however, I relented and bought it. Her FP aquarium toy now sits unused and the birdies are very well used! She loves it, she enjoys the light show and she is completely fascinated by the birds. It is very easy to use she figured it out immediately and it lasts long enough to put her to sleep. I highly recommend it and it is a toy that will last the child beyond the first year!I have to add my daughter is now 3 and she still sleeps with this next to her bed - I am waiting to see if it goes to college with her !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for sleeping, but these birds don't fly.","review":"I loved this toy for our baby girl. The music is precious and she really enjoyed watching the little birds move. After several months, the only thing that works is the light and music. It no longer moves even after changing batteries. I've found this with the fish toy as well. Love the music, but not life of the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best item in nursery","review":"We could not live without this,used it every day since baby was 3 months old and now he is 15 months! It teaches them to fall asleep in the crib and if they wake they just turn it on. The bird is super easy to push. Has like 7 different 'song/sounds' but we like the music the best. He bangs on it and moves all the on off buttons and it still works great! A MUST have! Better than a mobile anyday.GREAT GIFT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is a dream","review":"My daughter adores her Flutterbye Dreams. She knows how to activate it, and when she does she puts on the biggest, brightest smile and squeals with delight. It has many great features. The music and nature sounds are soothing enough to help my daughter fall asleep. And it has a volume control button. You can play the music with lights or without the lights. It also projects pictures onto the ceiling, and that is my favorite feature of them all. I think I love this toy just about as much as my daughter does! It is just darling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful item!","review":"We bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since. We just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way, and she just wouldn't part with it. My husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night. (Almost 22 months old).I was so disappointed to see that Fisher Price doesn't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby, but the prices people are asking here are outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Magic!","review":"My son's grandparents bought this for him when he was only about 4 months old.

The replacement came but again the shipping box was flimsy and the base of the machine was broken in half. We glued it back together rather than make our daughter wait another week for her Christmas present. This one has its problems, too. The cd/video player freezes up and we have to unplug it to make it reset (reboot?). For $240, this machine is not worth it. And since it gets damaged easily during shipping, I would not buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once, twice a bad purchase","review":"Had to return this item twice due to malfunctioning microphones.

I've tried standard audio CDs, a burned audio CD, a DVD and several CD+Gs. Same result. It keeps telling me there is 'no disc' loaded. This is really disappointing since I've had other machines made by this company and never had a problem before. The same discs that can't be read in this machine were fine in my other ones. I don't know what the problem is, but if I can't get anything to play tomorrow (assuming there is the off-chance that there is 'moisture' in the machine, as suggested by the manual), then this is going back.I am also not a big fan of the front-loading disc playback method.

The box has everything required to connect the systems, the Switcher is easy to set up, and works as advertised.The two minor issues I've come across are that1) My Logitech MX600 cordless mouse is \\"jumpy\\". I may just get one mouse for each system as the problem only occurs when the USB Receiver is plugged into the Switcher.2) Swapping back to the 8300 is slow (5+ seconds) but I suspect that's due to the 8+ USB devices attached to it...I'd highly recommend the 2X1 to anyone looking for a 2 system Dvi KVM in the Gefen price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Giallo (Minor Spoilers)","review":"A weak \\"giallo\\" thriller (from the early 1970s) as a detective finds himself constantly one step behind a killer covering his/her tracks after a kidnapping gone wrong.

He is an arrogant cuss and I laughed as Maggie gave him his due. She was a great heroine as she led him on a merry chase. She had his number and called him on it every time. I laughed all the way through it, especially at Maggie's shoes and the scene with her legs. Priceless. There were so many warm, tender moments. I can easily see why these two hooked up.

He was arrogant and way too sure of himself, especially of his prowess with the ladies. I felt sorry for Maggie for falling in love with such an egotistical jerk and felt that she deserved much better.I especially hated McKinley's theme of infidelity. I know that historically, this is the norm of the book's time period but it just made the book seem tawdry and not as magical and sweet as her usual books.The only thing I liked in the book was Braden's brother Sin, and I eagerly await his own book, hoping it would be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to watch","review":"Sorry, I know this was shot in 1986, but I don't remember the rest of the films shot that year being THIS technically terrible. The bad effects and film quality are so distracting, it actually makes the movie almost laughable. Not a good quality in any film, let alone a period piece.I'm not as familiar with this Jane Austen work as some of her others, but if her leading lady is as dreamy as portrayed here with so much internal fantasizing going on, you're going to need a special director to pull it off. I assume she was meant to be portrayed as highly creative, idealistic, unprepared for any sort of reality - instead she seems like a ridiculous, immature twit - or maybe that was the acting. I'd also be surprised if JA created her characters with so little depth or provided them with short, insipid text.Honestly, I'd try another version.

This film version was a complete waste of time. After watching it, and I can't believe I sat through the whole thing, I wanted to get up remove the tape from the VCR, and crush the tape. Since the tape was a friend's, I could not. The film felt like a cheap meshing of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", \\"Dynasty\\", with flimsy associations with the novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\".

So the first time I saw it I did find parts a bit tasteless and disturbing; care must be taken when transforming literature into a visual medium sometimes. But it's a movie I've watched many times. For greatest satisfaction I find it best to take it on its own terms. I think some probably give it a negative review simply because it is very, very different from what they expect. But after forgetting expectations and just watching it as any other film, you may feel very differently. Some key scenes (such as the confrontation between Henry Tilney and his father) would benefit from greater development. The end I find rushed. Overall a film I enjoy watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Northanger Abbey","review":"I bought this movie years ago and was so excited to start a classic movie library. I am not usually a harsh critic, but this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. I threw it in the trash. Years later, before the Andrew Davies version came out, I had forgotten how bad it was and figured I had overreacted in my judgement. So, I bought it again.....and threw it in trash again. Thankfully, a new version came out with Felicity Jones as Catherine and JJ Feild as Henry Tilney. This version really accomplished what I wanted to see. Andrew Davies screenplay. Who could ask for more? I would suggest they never reissue this version again. I would then encourage anyone wanting to see this well-written, well acted and totally engrossing story to run out and buy the Andrew Davies version and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!","review":"I love this book and all Jane Austen books but this movie is dreadful!

I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it.

The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy's General Tilney. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the \\"bad guys\\" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie-!","review":"This has got to be the worst film version of an Austin story I've ever seen. The plot is only tenuously connected with the book; as for the characters, hairstyles & costumes, it should be subtitled \\"Fellini Does Austin\\" because it most closely resembles the \\"Satyricon\\" IMO. The makeup, costuming, & hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically, but downright grotesque & bizarre - and that's just the lead character, Catherine. The rest are worse. Bad acting, too. Very lame film. The Austin estate should sue BBC for turning out such a turkey & using her name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This novel is my least favorite of Austen's work.

I didn't like it at all and turned it off after half an hour. Several years later, when I read the book and enjoyed it immensely, I thought perhaps I hadn't understood the story well enough when I first watched the movie. So I tried watching it again, and this time I got almost all the way through. But it was ultimately a waste of time.I really like the book, but the movie is poorly made. The acting is bad (acting lessons are needed, plus the actors had no idea who or what their characters were supposed to be like), the picture is often out of focus or grainy (not just due to being VHS, but also due to poor cinematography), and the story has just been screwed up.The book was a satirical, albeit dark, comedy, and this movie had the flawed notion to try (unsuccessfully) to be a drama--it bordered more on the melodramatic. Skip the movie, read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! This is not a movie!","review":"I ordered this thinking it was a movie. It is a book on DVD. Amazon.com has it misclassified under TV and Movies. I popped it in the DVD player, all excited to see a version of this movie I had never seen, and, to my surprise, words came up. I laughed, at first, and thought since I'd never read the book that I would. However, on the last page of every few chapters, the DVD auto-advances to the chapter menu and you cannot read that last page.

While the acting is very good, the production is very poor.

The director took a great deal of \\"artistic license\\", of which none was for the best. I found the acting only mediocre and as I wrote before, the \\"artistic license\\" taken was for the deprivation of the movie. The scenery was, for the credit of the movie, beautiful.

Overall, I would not recommend this movie - I would however, with high regard recommend the book to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This movie was slightly bearable to watch. I only recommend it for true Jane Austen fans. The problem is not with the plot, but with the horrid acting and directing.

It just needs a bit of work to be up to the Jane Austen standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I dreamed it could be","review":"I was fully prepared for a less than stellar production based on the reviews here but was stunned at just how bad this version really is. Instead of portraying Cathrine's youthful fantasy through EVO or a dream sequence that made sense, they make her imaginings seem like those of a psycotic involving all of those around her. The actress seems incapable of smiling and spends much time with what appears to be a smirk on her face. The lack of an abbey has been noted before as well as the shortcomings of the soundtrack so I won't add to those complaints. The acting was poorly done. I don't know if that is because these are not good actors or they were being badly directed. What was offered did follow Austen's work but was too abbreviated to do it justice.I would suggest buying the more expensive version even though it is even shorter. It can't be worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I enjoyed it!","review":"The reviewer below me was right. What's up with people? This movie had SOME flaws, but all in all I really liked it!

Except for some fine moments from the lead actress, the acting is poor, and the quality of the filming is lousy. Some scenes from the book are redone with such minute detail that they're boring, while other important scenes are skipped altogether (i.e. the scene when Catherine learns she is to be sent home by post unaccompanied).

This is the first movie I've seen based on it, and I found it charming, provocative, and fun. Miss Morland is no great beauty, no great intellect, and no great wit, but that's ok. She is sincere, and sweet, has \\"good notions\\" about things and people, is open and teachable, but strong-willed when she knows herself in the right. Mr. Tilney is young, smart, witty, respectable, hansome, and independant -- he is \\"the catch\\", the man she could never have hoped for if he had been the least bit vain. This is a story about young love and is the cutest romance Austen ever wrote. Very glad to see such a faithful transfer from book to film. Well done, BBC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece Theatre's version is much better.","review":"Masterpiece Theatre's version of Northanger Abbey is *much* better than this version. This version is choppy, and it is too obvious that it is a product of the 80's. (Not that there is anything wrong with movies from the 80's, but I think its signature (the 80's feel) on a film from a different time period is disturbing.) The Masterpiece Theatre version delivers the plot more smoothly and, in my opinion, is of better quality all the way around (including the choice of actors). I highly recommend passing up this version in favor of Masterpiece Theatre's."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Better","review":"Good acting, writing and sets. It was so much better than the 1986 version were they had way too much make-up on, had crappy 1980s music and the actors where really not attractive.There is a problem though, they have mixed the 1986 reviews with the 2007 one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this movie because Northanger Abbey is my favorite Austin book.

Not one of Peter Firth's Best Movies!","review":"I have seen most of the BBC productions of Jane Austen's novels and I liked all of the ones I have seen except Northanger Abbey. Peter Firth is a great actor but even he couldn't save this dud and he seemed uncomfortable and confused as though even he himself was confused by the disjointed, choppy filming and knew that it was going to turn out to be a lousy movie! The actress who played Catherine was very cute but didn't really have a great range and showed the same expressions on her face to show every type of emotion. She would constantly make her eyes get all big and her mouth drop open into an o shape. Very irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESY!","review":"I guess the adaptations of Jane Austen's other novels spoiled me. Cheesy is the word I would use to describe this movie. I really didn't like anything about it. I think the director wanted to make a gothic movie rather than a romance. Plus, there were so many things in the movie that did not happen in the book. These things make the movie terrible. I would love for the BBC to make a film that was true to Austen's wonderful novels. Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, etc, were incredible adaptations. Many people seeing the movies read the books as a result. The opposite happens when people view the movie Northanger Abbey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy and Boring","review":"I can't wait for this short 2-hour movie to end because it was so badly acted! Compare this to the 6-hour movie-thon I spent watching Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle in P&P and did not want it to end! I have read the book twice and found the movie too flippant - no justice to Jane Austen's writing.

Good thing I do not own this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Northanger Abbey video review","review":"This is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel I've ever seen. The novel was an early work by Jane Austen (published posthumously) so it's not as well crafted as later works. Despite the novel's weaknesses, however, even this video production does not do it justice. The heroine looks like she's on heroin, Maj. Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff. I can't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one I chose or whether there was no other choice. The only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships--before I read the book.

It seemed awkward and stilted. I absolutely hated the actor's portrayal of Catherine. She was the most irritating of all. Her attempts at \\"wide-eyed innocence\\" came across as \\"space-out stupidity.\\" The cuts between fantasy/dream sequences and reality were reminiscent of B-movies.

Until someone makes a decent movie adaptation of Northanger Abbey, please just read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow- What a disappointment!","review":"I received this video as a Christmas gift and was excited to see the one Jane Austen adaptation I had yet to see.

Anyone who is tired of the stuff churned out on today's TV choices can relax with these movies that contain not only lots of action and horseback chases, but comedy and intrigue. Be a kid again, or if you are still a kid discover why Hopalong Cassidy movies will always be in demand.These movies are great for the whole family. They contain mild violence, only the good guys win, they are funny and full of adventure. Hoppy never drinks or smokes and provides morals and principles that we wish all kids could see and copy. If you want good movies for your kids (or grandkids) to watch, Hopalong Cassidy should always be on top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"western fan","review":"after buying volume one I ordered this one as well and I was'nt disappointed- excellent product on every level.Strongly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How did they do that?????","review":"The quality is so good that you will think you are watching brand new prints in the best theater on Main Street in the 1940s. Actually it's probably better than that. The intro says these digital re-masters were done by a company named \\"US Television Office, Inc.\\". For goodness sake, every person or studio who has old prints TAKE THEM TO \\"US TELEVISION OFFICE, INC.\\" AND GET THEM RE-MASTERED. Platinum has released 8 volumes of these Hoppy feature films and I own all 8. But for some strange reason, probably only known to some \\"power lunch\\" executive, they did not number the volumes...so you will just have to tell the difference by the numbers Amazon gives them. They are worth twice or 3 times the price. There were 66 Hopalong Cassidy films made starring William Boyd, and you can own 40 of them with these 8 volumes at a slim price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality is worth the price","review":"What you have to remember is that the Paramount films from the 1930s and 40s were superb in every detail, but the earliest were already released through Image Entertainment as double features (those are also on Amazon for purchase). These are the second best, ignoring the last twelve that William Boyd produced himself, which drag and are very slooowww. So slow in fact that when he edited them into TV features in the 1950s, they work better as 25 minute episodes. But overall, the picture quality is superb and so is the sound. These used to sell on VHS as single features at $14.95 each so five of them for a little more than a buck a piece is a bargain and worth the price. This company released eight DVDs, by the way, for a total of 40 of the 66 movies. I recommend you buy all eight of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoppy Fan","review":"I have watched several of these DVD's of the Hopalong Cassidy series and have to say the quality is very good as they have been Digital Remastered in 2000, so they are quiteup to date for watching.

I streamed some different Hopalong Cassidy movies on Netflix with the quality acceptable butnot quite as good as these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for at the park","review":"Blanket is the perfect size, easy to carry, lightweight.

The skit/lecture about encountering a deaf person in a shop was a waste of time. Some of the signs are not repeated.

I snapped it up and ran to work to grab my 18Volt Bosch battery. This radio is very good for a jobsite radio. True the reception could be better, but, then again - eveything in this world is not perfect. The fact that it has a digital tuner, and a CD player makes this radio Rock! The only strange thing I have discovered with this radio that no one seems to have noticed yet is that if you leave the battery in it, even with the radio off - the battery discharges.

You have to have the power box plugged in even to charge your cell phone. Bought a bosch 24v platinum battery for it ( over $130.00! ) & it only works for about 8 hours before going stone dead. Lastly, the darn thing is heavier than a box of tools! With all that weight behind it & a price tag way bigger than Milwaulkee & Dewalt ( actually, you can buy both of them for the price of the Bosch!!!) you'd think they could make a better performing unit!

The FM reception is a joke, I guess they fixed that but I'm not buying another one to find out. One of the buttons got stuck and I had to break it off to unstick it.

It was never abused, in fact, I am so anal with my tools I still have my 1st set of power tools that I started with 23 years ago.

The sound quality is poor and it doesn't go loud enough to be heard over most power tools. The charger is a slow charger, not as good as a standard Bosch quick charger. By default it enters \\"bosch sound\\" mode, which you have to turn off to get the sound to be halfway decent, every time you turn the unit on. When you insert a CD into the unit, you have to wait like 10 seconds before you can hit \\"play\\" while it reads this disk.

Took it back for replacement. Sound is around what you would find on $100 Sony Portable Boom Box, maybe slightly less bass. The preset EQ settings are actually decent, which is amazing as no one ever gets that right. Radion reception was actually really good. This came with the detachable wire antenna. I live in Amish country so reception can be a problem, but this thing had no problem bringing it in. Would I pay $175 for one of these?

This performance is one of the highlights of a good career. Christa Ludwig is in great voice and invests the words with meaning and beauty. There is no sacrificing of tone for effect that Verdi himself said might be necessary to convey Lady Macbeth's character, but Ludwig presents a truly formidable and complex character who is only too willing to descend into evil for a goal. Bohm never fails to amaze me at the range of his conducting: he always serves the needs of the music and his cast with a balance and integrity that enhances every measure. Not, by far, the best Verdi, but as good a presentation of it as you will find. More than worth the price you will pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Good Recording","review":"I've never been a fan of \\"live\\" opera recordings--the sound quality is usually not very good, and the noises and coughs from the audience tends to come at inopportune times. I've also been burned a few times by purchasing recordings from Opera D'Oro--again the sound quality is usually pretty bad.That being said, I recently picked up this live recording of Macbeth, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ludwig is chilling as Lady Macbeth, and with Sherrill Milnes as Macbeth, what more could you ask for.This is one of the finest recordings of Macbeth I have heard, and far surpasses any studio recording I own. The sound is outstanding, the cast is impeccable. OK...there's no libretto, but look at the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of both Macbeths","review":"As you know Verdi had two Macbeths, and this recording takes the ending of the 1847 score and combines it with an edited version of the more popular 1865 revision. The result is one of the best \\"live\\" recordings of this opera. Some of the witches' choruses have been simplified, but this moves the drama along at a faster pace. Milnes is in top form and his \\"Pieta, respetto, amore\\" aria is without equal. Milnes also excels in the very last aria (from the 1847 version) and it replaces the usual ending (no final chorus). In my opinion, adding the death aria is an improvement and brings the story to a more dramatic ending. Christa Ludwig is an exciting Lady Macbeth and adds to the evil feeling of this recording, although she sometimes doesn't bother to pronounce her words. The rest of the cast is good with \\"no bad apples\\". Karl Bohn's conducting makes this a Macbeth that you can listen to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Item was delivered in poor condition.

They're both liars without any regret over who they hurt in their pursuit of \\"love\\".This movie isn't particularly funny or even amusing.

The panoramic mode works surprisingly well, with negligible distortion at the edges.Things get more complicated when you want to take control to produce custom shots. Changing flash settings, exposure or apeture settings require combinations of controls that are difficult to remember off the top of your head, so I spent a fair amount of time with my head buried in the instruction manual.I also had some overexposure problems with the built-in flash in one situation, but it was a tough metering situation.a"},{"rating":"1","title":"People with stories should not always write them","review":"I think Kathleen's story might have been better if she had chosen a \\"ghost\\" writer instead.

The bend of the clasp extension did not fit the size of the band. Where the clasp attaches to the band appeared to be defective, the angle was bent more than the jeweler thought it should have been. The watch just did not feel comfortable. In addition, the band has quite rough edges. I would think the watch could easily get snagged on clothing. I was disappointed with the quality of the watch. I am surprised, because I have always thought Seiko to be a quality brand. After seeing the quality of this watch, I don't think I will be purchasing another Seiko.

I would not be afraid to run it over my face. If you are considering buying a grater/zester, I suggest you try another brand, I know I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sharp as I had expected. Buy the microplane.","review":"I thought this would be better than the Microplane because of its much-touted \\"2 sided photo etching process\\". I was terribly disappointed. The unit I got was dull and would not grate without using force. In addition, the grating surface is too short because it is divided into two- coarse and fine surfaces (each about 5-6\\" only). The sliding plastic covering the other half of the rasp interferes with grating. You could remove it to give you a little more room but that causes the rasp to lose torsional stiffness. The tendency to twist when you grate is not helped at all by the rounded ends. If they were flat, you could rest one end on the counter to stabilize it, but they are rounded so it actually promotes twisting. The Microplane is half the price, is built much better and grates so much more smoothly and effortlessly than the Cuisipro. I would definitely advise against buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned in","review":"The theory of having dual graters was attractive, but the reality is that this grater felt cheap and flimsy.

Rothko's work was full of vibrancy and beauty, but this book offers flat, lifeless reproductions. The blacks are not black and shadow details do not exist. The colors are often so far from the originals that you must use the artist's titles for clues as to what the actual colors were."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Awesome","review":"This book contains many of Rothko's early, later, and intermediate works making it easy for the reader to see the trasitions that he made. The beautiful reproductions in this book are almost as good as visiting the actual museums. I could practically feel his power eminating from the pages. His life story could have been better told, but the dramatic reproductions more than make up for the less than perfect prose. I highly recommend this book not only for Rothko enthusiastics like me but also for all art lovers in general. Whether you understand, pretend to, or blatantly dislike his works this is a book that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"as if Rothko becomes color blind","review":"the layout of this book is fine, but the printing is poor, the color is just not there...Rothko's work always evoke something in me when i look at it, but the coloring is so bad that it was just like looking at black and white rectangles in this book.

What caught my attention about WordPerfect 11 was the Classic 5.1 Environment. With everyone working at my company on 5.1 It may be the way to go to get everyone up-to-date. Corel should have done this along time ago! My first few minutes playing around with it and reading the manual to get it into classic mode it was nice. The product seems to be pretty solid, unlike past WordPerfect Windows releases.

Bass 305 has an upbeat 'Techno sound' with bass that covers the whole frequency range. Then incorporates some clear and loud clicks from the highs. (so it's not just bass - but an all around high quality sound) The best thing I like about Bass 305's 'The Future' is that there is very little words and NO lyrics, which translates to me as nothing to be offended by, where as most bass artist feel their message should exploit women, and use profanity. Bass 305 is CLEAN, so mom shouldn't have a problem allowing this to be played, so long as it is in the car, cuz man this album can bump and thump!!!

I, myself, am a former attorney turned actor/producer and needed to get \\"ripped\\" for a scene I was shooting in a movie and believe you me, when the time came, I had no problem taking my shirt off thanks to Tony's system.Needless to say, the program is only for those who are committed to doing whatever it takes, short of risking their health, to become lean. If you are not serious about taking the weight off, don't spend the 20 bucks.

He watched the bird, batted at the toys, and pulled at the mat. The toys are very durable and colorful. Like most of these mats, the construction is a bit unstable. We had a friend's child over, and he tried to pull himself up using the bars and fell because the velcro came undone on the bottom (that's what holds them in place) and the bars tipped over. Ouch. Once my son was a little older, he started to pull the bird off. It seemed like his mission... The bird always worked though. The bird is motion activated, but you can change that. The mat wasn't created with shoulder straps or snaps to help with transport, which would have been nice. The lights held my son's attention, and the music was calming and not too loud.

They were kind enough to allow me to exchange it for the Flutterbye gym. My son is 3 months old and he absolutely loves it! However, there are some features that needs to be improved, such as: 1.) The arches are attached under the mat by velcro, which makes it hard to move the mat from place to place without it coming detached. 2.) Although the mirror on the mat seemed like a good idea at first it really needs to be removed. My son likes to move around on the mat, especially while on his back, and the mirror has injured him several times. 3.) The bird comes off if pulled hard enough. My son has been able to remove it several times. On the positive side, I like the hanging toys, the satin mat and the musical birdhouse w/ the flying bird.

It doesn't do anything but runs straight into a wall or anything that is in the way, crashes and stops.Cons: It is very hard to place Mikey the turtle back on the skateboard, you have to align both feet onto two things on the board and press firmly and sometimes it falls off again before you even put it on the floor. But once it is on the board and it is running it stays on until it crashes (be careful with molding and furniture because it is pretty heavy and runs fast).My husband and I decided to throw away the board and now our son has the turtle on a shelf in his room.

At least that's what I'm thinking when I hear the 1968 USoA album and 'Extended Play Two' back to back. The song 'A Man For Atlantis' uses certain elements found on USoA's song cycle 'The American Way of Love'. And the lovely, sublime 'Poem of Dead Song' is most definitely a nod to USoA's 'Love Song For The Dead Che'. And it makes Broadcast stand apart from other bands it's usually compared to like Stereolab, Fugu and Lali Puna.

For Innocent to be 33-34 he couldn't make up his mind what he really wanted and nor could Noire. Now I will say the author did a wonderful job of detailing all of the places the characters visited, I will give her that. But this book could have been sumed up in fewer pages.

I'm an avid reader of all genre's and this book definitely missed the mark. The story was just BORING and undeveloped. There were too many cliche's, stereotypes and unoriginal material. Example: Innocent invites Noire over to his place and surprises her with an expensive new outfit and jewelry for an evening out. Where have we seen that one before?? And with all the unneccesary designer name dropping, I hope Ms. Turnipseed is getting some kind of kickback. Nice try."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sleep Aid That Doesn't Require The Intake Of Medicine!","review":"With the possible exception of College Boy by The Urban Griot (aka Omar Tyree), A Love Noire was the most boring book I've read in 2003.

There was a sense of confusion and frustration with the characters at times. I didn't understand why the author had to put that scene in with Noire and Afrike (those who read the book know what I am talking about). I am looking forward to the sequel.

This author did a great job of revealing them to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for A Love Noire","review":"What a spectacular debut for Ms. Turnipseed! From the moment I picked up this book, I just simply couldn't put it down. The plot and themes are so intriguing, that I felt I knew Noire and Innocent personally. Turnipseed's characters are so tangible and life-like, that their personalities and complexities come forth as though emanating from a silver screen. Spanning three continents and a host of historic and cultural references from the Edisto Island, South Carolina to the Caribbean and Central America, Turnipseed takes up on an exiciting journey of love, passion and in a not-so-bad way angst. Each page brings a new surprise as subplots unfold to reveal new and interesting tidbits about the cast of variegated characters who show us what it means to be young and in love with the world as a stage of infinite possibilites."},{"rating":"1","title":"So how on earth did someone tag this an IR","review":"This is not an IR.

His growth and progession into a finely tuned song writer is blatently evident. This new band offers a wide array of gifts. The bass is a foundation and subtly haunts your aural senses repeatedly. Guitars drive this power with touch when called on and stinging crunch when let loose. In the back there seems to be a solid and strong groove from the drums. This album demands respect from every critical stance that dares to reer a head. I wish we could still visit the website and find out where and what Milkweed is doing.

I was concerned that he would not have the patience to go through what many of the previous reviewers had in order to get the thing up and running properly. It turns out there was no need for worry. After doing the online update, the Celestron has worked like a charm. Getting a GPS fix takes a few minutes, but after that it works amazingly well. He's been able to identify countless stars in the past two weeks and so far, he's totally thrilled with all that it can do. The SkyScout has been wonderful for finding a particular constellation and them identifying the individual stars within it. The informative audio information is not only educational, but surprisingly enjoyable since the recorded female voice isn't too robotic. I agree it's a somewhat costly item, but from my perspective, the WOW factor has been worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"Easy to use and accurate.

The software will only operate on a 32 bit system. She has a 64 bit system and will not be able to get updates on the Skyscout. Otherwise she is very happy with it. It is very easy to run. After reading the instructions she was outside and using it. Listening to the audio about \\"that star\\" is great. It does run through batteries so make sure you have plenty on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Buy","review":"I just bought my Celestron SkyScout today from REI, tried it out this evening and everything they said it would do is just what it did. The function that allows you to identify stars worked perfectly and the sky scout is very easy to aim and you always get the object that you were actually aiming at. Another function that the sky scout features allows you to find a particular object in the sky.The sky scout will even give you a list of 20 featured objects that are out that night. Once you have found an object you can do one of many things, these include, read about it, listen to a description, or look at scientific facts. Now I paid $230.00 for mine and I would recommend not spending to much more for it is just not worth that much more money, and you will be investing a lot into AA batteries because it chews them up very fast. Over all I am really pleased and I would recommend this product to astronomers if all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I've been through three of these and not one of them did anything right. They are absurdly sensitive to magnetic fields (I began to worry the minute I saw that it came with battery shields. Sheesh). The buttons are randomly responsive; on one occasion I could not scroll to the right in the display for around ten minutes, then all of a sudden it decided to move again. When the GPS tells a New Yorker he's in the Florida Keys, he can try entering the coordinates by hand, but they don't stay set. You never know where Sky Scout will think it is. Celestron suggested that I try different batteries, which I did, but who are they kidding? You'd be better off to hire my twelve year old son as a guide. At least he knows that Sirius is not in Auriga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next version","review":"I too am disappointed with this product, despite my high hopes. I found the same problems as others have already posted on Amazon.I suggest that you wait for the improved product. I'm sure Celestron has read these reviews and is working on improving device. They must know how many sales they have lost from all these negative postings.At $400 for a toy, uh, tool, I will wait for a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUY MALA GARANTIA POST-VENTA","review":"A todos los astronomos amateurs que necesitan de este tipo de equipos tengan mucho cuidado.

So, I took the SkyScout out to Blythe, California into the fields, but again, the ole magnetic interference icon. Sooo, I next took the thing out to Joshua Tree National Park, and again, YES, you guessed it, the magnetic interference icon. I guess that explains why the moon was 30 to 90 degrees off!!!

It works well as billed and is easy to use though we are pretty tech oriented. It does take a little time to acquire orientation when you first come out and turn it on. It is very accurate and we use it with the Celestron maps. Note--as everyone does--that it does not magnify. It is purely an identification aid. I tried its competitor from Meade and found it a lot more clunky to use and in reality it was more of a talking video tour. This unit can do that as well but it is not its primarly use. Tough, pretty compact and easy to use though not foolproof. Price has dropped some and is fair for the capability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is one of the best gadgets on the market today. It's easy to use and a lot of fun.

Twice, when I had questions about the SkyScout, I emailed customer service and I received a clear response within a day or two. I recommend the SkyScout highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It","review":"I had never been so disappointed in a product. The advertisements and reviews swayed me to purchase the product. I have a great interest in astronomy so I could hardly wait to get the Celestron SkyScout. Setting up the program on the computer was painless. It was capturing stars that was next to impossible. You cannot simply point at a star and capture it. I tried using a tripod but even that was difficult. I returned the product and went back to my dependable telescopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still needs work","review":"This thing goes through batteries quickly. You will need to have extra sets handy. The built in GPS receiver is practically worthless, has yet to work. Fortunately my 5 year old Magellan works each and very time. Entering the Longitude and Latitude (yes it's reversed) manually does not allow for entering \\"minutes\\". It is also subject to \\"magnetic\\" interference, who knows from where??? On the positve side if you enter your location and the \\"correct\\" time it will get you close to what you looking for. It is also not Apple compatible which a real issue in that you have to keep/find a Win PC for firmwear updates.The concept has great potential and I am looking forward to another vendor producing a similar unit with an improved GPS unit. In the mean time, it is the only game in town, and at $[...] its not a cheap game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, too bad it doesn't work","review":"I have a 15 year old Garmin GPS that can capture GPS satellites quickly in my backyard.

It was off kilter, as others have reviewed. It would identify objcts a few degrees to the right of where I pointed the lens (that doesn't magnify). That makes it a real problem to identify stars among clusters. I wrote the company twice about returning it or getting it calibrated, with no response. Still getting their promo emails though.So it's just a piece of junk in my closet that I can't seem to throw away because it cost almost $200. I had plans to buy a Celestron telescope with it, but obviously not now. Anyway, I bought the little speaker, which doesn't connect well and always falls off, and I was able to use it in the \\"general direction\\" of the star I heard described - a few minutes about the composition of the star and related mythology and a little history at times. It's interesting, but a bit gimmicky. My Android app can use GPS to identify stars.

Not one person mentioned that the device does not work next to wifi recievers. I have a ten inch dobsonian reflecter that I cannot exactly move around my property with ease. Therefore I can only use a balcony outside my room. But because I have a wireless service that uses wifi the Skyscout failed to perform. No matter where I moved around the balcony the indicator always said \\"Cannot connect to GPS due to electromagnetic interference\\". So if you buy this Skyscout be sure you do not have a wireless service that could interfere with reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many conditions","review":"We have enough open sky for DirectTV, but apparently not enough for this item to pick up the GPS satellites. I manually entered my latitude and longitude only to get a big M for magnetic interference. Yes, we have electricity and power lines near our house, and this thing won't work with them there. I would have to drive a long way to find an open field. I got this thing for my backyard! If I could see the entire sky, I could figure out where objects are much easier and would not need it so much. I agree it really sucks batteries. I've been through 1 1/2 sets and haven't even gotten to work yet. The store I bought it from has only a seven day return policy, so I can't even send it back.

I didn't use it for about a year and then decided to try it out. The Target function did not work right out of the box. I called Celestron and they needed a receipt to give me an RMA to return it. I explained that it was a gift and rather difficult to get the receipt (Person who gave it to me is 87 and now has Alzheimers) They would only fix it on a cash basis and if the repair bill was too high for me, they would charge to return it.Then, I decided to use the functions that did work and then the GPS promptly developed an error that said \\"Error: GPS hardware problem detected. Please contact Celestron Technical Support. Still no receipt no support.In short, shoddy product right out of the box on first time use and no support.

Pure and simple. The reason why this woman nailed her cousin, Kim, so badly was because she is jealous of Kim. She wanted Eminmen and he did not want her and this was her way of getting back at both of them. It is human nature at its worst and if I could apologize to both Eminem and Kim for purchasing this piece of trash I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent","review":"She may or may not have been close with eminem. She lacks credibility as she puts a horrendous spin and paints herself as the martyr and loyal subject to Marshall.This book is clearly about Kim and her obvious jealousy towards her. You can also read between the lines that she wants Marshall for herself and by answering his every whim - she hopes to get him.She paints him to be passive and a coward. I feel sorry for her, as the one item she despises about all around Marshall is the fact they use him for money - what is she trying to do?This book is poorly written and isn't worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me the money","review":"I wish I'd have thought of this first. Make up a bunch of stories about a rich and famous rapper and watch the money flow in. If you like a healthy dose of fiction mixed in with a pinch of truth then this books for you. Millions of people by the National Enquirer every day so I'm sure this book will do fantastic. Two thumbs down if this is supposed to be a biography but have to admit it's a great idea to rake in the cash(good timing with the movie coming out). Kinda sad though that there's people out there that will believe every story that manages to make it into a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"I think I paid close to $100 for this book and it was garbage. I guess it was interesting to read on his life, however she comes across as someone who is just jealous of Kim. The book certainly couldnt catch your attention and keep it. For a tiny little book (And I mean TINY) It took my like a month to read beacuse I just kept losing interest. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't rate it until it comes out...","review":"I'm sure you'll see many reviews from obsessed, love-struck fans who will back up Marshall Mathers for some strange, delusional reason, but everyone is allowed to write a book, especially if there is a \\"story\\" there. Hell, I'll read it just because she was there and knows him personally. I want to hear her side of the story. Good Luck to you JR!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I wouldn't even bother buying this book-and that says a lot considering I'm a HUGE Eminem fan...The author can't even string together a sentence, let alone keep you entertained for an entire book!I hear there's one coming out in the Fall by that Rolling Stone writer, Anthony Bozza. MTV says it's the more \\"intellectual one,\\" looking at Eminem's role in hip-hop, etc. He wrote that first Eminem cover story-and in my opinion it's the best friggin' article I've ever read!! He did another one at the time of the Eminem Show. I'd save my money for that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"no point on buying this one...","review":"J.R Watkins writing about the personal lives and relationships of Marshall and Kim and the family is really taking things too far. I can't believe that she was able to publish this book. This women has to learn that people enjoy privacy.

Other than that, get a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Review","review":"How on earth did this book get published? Has this lady ever heard of an editor? She is nothing but a jealouse person.

She will tell you that all others exploit him to get his money. This is exactly what she has done by writing this book. This is about the trashy way Kim and the author lived. She paints Marshall to be weak and an easy victim.Her writing is horrible - almost like an uneducated person has written the book. She is looking for sympathy and painting herself as some type of martyr.Don't waste your money - or time . I am sorry I did!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"Any one who likes or thinks this is a good book isn't an Eminem supporter. The only person who can write a book on themselves is that person. Nobody knows Eminem more than himself and his family that are close to him. How can u say that this book is a factual book when you have to read a book to find out yourself who Eminem really is? Nobody in Eminem's public will know the true him. A book that is written by a woman who tried to get with Eminem when Eminem said no is obviously goin to exaggerate the story a little. There may be some truth in this but we will only be able to find out from those who REALLY know Eminem!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"English Composition 101","review":"There is a large amount of required learning needed.I hope her 1 1/2 minutes of fame was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead us not into temptation...","review":"I just wanted to say that as a fan of Eminem, it's very tempting to purchase this book. However, out of respect for him and his family, I will not. If you want to get to know him better, I would suggest you purchase 'Angry Blonde', which is an official book of Eminem. Although it is not an autobiography, it contains all of his lyrics and it was very interesting to read directly from Eminem himself about how he put together each song, and his reasons for doing each song. There are also extra treats as well as lots of great pictures.I feel that if Eminem wanted his fans to know certain things then he would write a book of his own - which I would buy in a heartbeat. Actually, his CD's are almost like autobiographies in themselves. As Eminem said about his songs in Rolling Stone magazine, \\"If you listen to them and don't take the words out of context, they'll tell you why I'm saying this or that...They will tell you everything.\\"Good enough for me!Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the poor mand james bond vol 4","review":"the title says it all, this book is the survivor vol 4. if you are looking for PMJB vol keep hunting its an elusive volume"},{"rating":"1","title":"sangean support","review":"sangean support stinks. the ats-909 is a tremendous radio and too bad sangean doesn't back it up with good support. i was afraid to pull too hard on the folddown stand for fear that i would snap the stand off. i sent an e-mail to the sangean tech support to find out if there was any special way to pull down the stand (nothing is mentioned in the instructions referring to this stand.) i never received an answer and after some time worked it out myself. moral: great radio with no backup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sangean ATS 909","review":"I have purchased this in the UK and find the radio to be very disappointing.It is reasonably sensitive on am and fm both shortwave and elsewhere.

The quality from line output does not match the sound on the speaker.The switches on the side for tone, stereo to mono are only very thin plastic. The battery cover is small and flimsy as is the stand.Spend your money on a Sony 7600G or 100E.

I find that the author is too economical in his explanations of how he got from step to step, often leaving significantly large gaps of assumed reader knowledge or prescience. But my main complaint is the horrible job of editing. There are mistakes and disagreements between the text and the illustrations and the illustrations and their headings. If you're not already comfortable with fooling around with Photoshop tools, and just trying things, you can get totally lost trying to figure out whether the text, heading or illustration is correct.The book is attractive and well presented.

It assumes Photoshop, so techniques such as channel mixing may not be relevant if you use another program. It is VERY poorly edited: text and figures sometimes don't match, many figures are so small that the modifications being illustrated are difficult or impossible to see, some figures are printed across the gutter, etc. I recommend looking at this book before purchasing it to see if it provides you with enough value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Photoshop book","review":"First and foremost this is a Photoshop book.

When the software arrived I was shocked. It does not look at all like the disks I have in my classroom it appears to be a fake copy, the disk has no formal cover and the plastic wrap has been hand sealed. I contacted amazon with my concerns about the vendor and they didn't care that a vendor of theirs is selling copies of software. I was told by amazon that I would need to contact the vendor myself. Interestingly enough, from the looks of the package the disk came in I need to contact some guy in Kentucky.

The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful. In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work. The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another. However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don't mind putting in the time or work. The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example).This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type. Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Money magazine article stretched out into a small book","review":"This book is essentially 100 two page book reports on various small businesses that ordinary people can run.

Robert Shaw is mesmerizing in this romantic lead, and a huge surprise! Genevieve Bujold is also a small but plucky rapier wielding delight! Amazing supporting cast with Geofrey Holder as Cujo the knife thrower and his street theatre band, Beau Bridges in his stunning 20's, Peter Boyle in black satin and slicked back hair of the degenerate villain and Angelica Huston in a wordless performance as \\"Woman of Dark Visage\\".

Airport 79 takes top (bottom?) billing. If you recall, these were a series of airplane disaster flics (Airport, Airport 75, Airport 77, and the grand turkey of all time: Airport 79). These movies gave birth to the spoof, Airplane, though after Airport 79 there is no longer a need for a spoof movie.Swashbuckler is supposed to be a light comedy action pirate movie a la the current rage Pirates of the Caribbean. Though the cast is tremendous, the acting, the action scenes, the drama, the love story, the building tension leading to the finale is anything but tremendous. About the best thing I can say for this movie is that it is not quite as bad as Airport 79. This movie is far and away the worst pirate movie I have seen.

I finally found it, ordered it... and adored it. I giggled as much as I did back then, and appreciated it in a whole different way.

It all goes together and comes apart for cleaning quite easily.The keys to making a successful slurpee are using a drink with a high sugar content and having the right ice/salt/water mixture. No, you're not going to get a huge amount of slurpee, and you're going to have to refill the ice chamber if you want to make a lot, but for an inexpensive child's toy, it does quite well.It will be a refreshing little treat on hot summer days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Partially Freeze a Soda...Exact Same Results","review":"My daughter really wanted this...she is a slurpee nut. After disassembling, washing, reassembling, crushing ice, measuring salt and water, chilling soda, installing four different sets of fresh batteries.....we had not one drop of slurpee. The unit wouldn't even come on.I was going to exchange it for a working unit, but this thing was too much trouble. I could walk to 7-11 and buy a real slurpee faster than getting drink from this machine. My two neice's have this same product and they didn't care for it either.Same your money and put a can of your favorite soft drink in the freeze until it turns slushy. It's what I do for the kids now. It works great and my neices say it has the same taste and texture as the slurpee machine 'slurpee.'

Her parents made several attempts and re-reading the instructions to make sure they were following them right, but no, the thing is just a piece of junk.

It took us about 45 minutes just to get the thing together. Then, you have to fill the metal thing with ice, salt ,and warm water.

Once it started getting thick enough, the motor almost stopped because it was just starting to get thick. Finally it was ready. I pulled the thing so the slurpee would come out.

The lid does not fit tight enough so it kept turing off and you had to put the lid back on. It takes 12oz of liquid and only makes one slurpee at a time that is if you can even get it to make a slurpee ours just made really cold soda. We even left it on after the recomended 5 to 8 min.

My experience with Radio Shack's version of the Sangean SG-622 may explain this discrepancy.This Sangean has truly excellent sound quality for a radio with such a small speaker. I also found its sensitivity excellent on the AM, FM, and Shortwave bands here in the Midwest.After several weeks, the sound became distorted, and I returned it to Radio Shack to be repaired within the warranty period. The repairman replaced a faulty integrated circuit and the speaker.It worked fine for several months, and then the connection between the tuning dial and the tuner came loose, and it was impossible to tune it. The earlier repair work may have loosened it.In my opinion, the SG-622 is a very good little radio, but the quality control at the factory may be lax. The year-long warranty may help solve this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Junk","review":"I have many radios.

The tuning failed to work well within several weeks. It is a very cheap elastic string around a pulley and in colder weather...even 50's...it loses friction and slips making tuning almost impossible. And yes, the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others. Reception of FM and Am are pretty good. There is only limited reception of shortwave with antenna fully extended and with trying to aim antenna to fine tune a station. So, if you leave your radio on a favorite station and the poor tuning mechanics aren't a bother this might be an acceptable choice...but radios half the price are around with no cheap mechanical parts...it's a shame they would use fairly good electronics but allow such cheap tuning and volume mechanicals to make the radio a poor choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent emergency radio","review":"I bought this radio as my place loses power a lot and right away I got great reception!

I agree with a previous reviewers comment that the subject of international relations depends on an impartial and evenhanded approach and I feel that this book fails in this respect.Perhaps the 7th edition addresses some of the more overt opinions stated in the book, I personally would not recommend it to any teacher or student thinking of using it to teach political science or International relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Biased","review":"I had this assigned for a course, and the text reeks of conservative views and values.

This book clearly does not outline the history of foreign policy accurately--rather it presents ego centric America-loving behaviour.

I'm pretty sure 1900's adult Americans have quite different background and thinkings from 21st century readers. History is history, contemporary events are contemporary events. I believe that there is a reason that this book is updated every other year. The misconception that decades old ideology can be applied to \\"our\\" thinking is one that must be avoided at all costs.

Both my favourites styles are somewhat represented here as it's heavy to a point and it's melodic. I find the singers delivery to be way over the top most of the time? and the music is just ok. To be honest this cd set did absolutely nothing for me. I just found it to be lacked truly good songs. Yes it has moments here and there, but not near enough of the them I'm afraid. It's a disappointment my books.The sound quality is decent and so is the jackets as it contains lyrics and so on.In conclusion, it's an ok listen, but nothing exceptional.

No viewfinder. Most ultra compacts don't have one but in bright sun it's tricky to see the display. I \\"reshopped\\" today and found a Canon Elph 800si but - it was only 3x optical zoom not 5x, it weighed more, cost $100 more, had fewer features and scenes (which I really use), wasn't weather resistant and was harder to \\"figure out\\". I decided to keep my 750 and just learn how to shield the display better. It takes great shots and the automatic scenes are easy to use and easy to switch among. Much easier than my old Olympus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The view screen is almost impossible to see in bright sunlight. All you can do is guess and hope that you framed the subject well.It has a very hard time focusing under normal conditions, (daytime, outdoors.) Sometimes after the second or third try on the same subject the focus will improve, but not always. It does quite well in macro mode, though...After I had been using the camera six months or so it developed a new problem where anything dark would come out a weird green and lack detail. Makes most pictures worthless.I had an Olympus before that I liked a lot, but this one is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera, one common flaw...","review":"This is our 2nd Olympus Digital camera and was well worth the buy. Takes great pictures and is very easy to use. The flaw is the lack of a viewfinder. It is nearly impossible to preview the picture that you are taking in bright daylight, even with a \\"anti-reflective\\" screen protector in place. This seems to be a growing problem with new point and shoot digitals. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. Nevertheless, it is a great camera with lots of useful, easy to manage settings built in."},{"rating":"2","title":"olympus styus 750","review":"I am very happy with this product I haven't had it long enough to do everything the camera is capable of.

I am an avid picture taker (approx 400 per month) - and my previous Kodak camera was 100 times better than this camera. The controls are hard to use on this Stylus. Taking pictures of Holiday lights downtown on Chicago's Magnificent Mile, you might as well forget it (BLURRY - BLURRY - BLURRY). Guess I should of went ultra professional and set up a tri-pod and lights just to get these seemingly simple pictures. I will never buy another Olympus product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus Stylus 750","review":"Battery life is terrible if you use image stabilizer, expect 25-30 shots on a full battery. Also the camera lacks of an optical view finder. Very difficult to shoot in sunlight with LCD. Many shots are somewhat bleached out while using auto white balance. Owned a stylus 400 digital prior to this and it is a dissapointment rather than upgrade. The only upsides are the 5x optical zoom which is a little choppy, and the image stabilizer that kills the battery if left on."},{"rating":"2","title":"New camera","review":"I like all of the features on this camera except the fact it doesn't have a view finder.

Unlike the Kodak, the Olympus has no \\"delete all phots\\" feature, so the only way to delete all the photos from the camera after transfering to the computer is to look at each photo separately on the camera's LCD display, push the delete button on the back of the camera, confirm that I really want to delete it, then it's gone. One photo gone and 235 to go. It takes about 10 minutes to delete every hundred photos (each deletion requires 3 button pushes, one picture at a time). I've now bought a replacement camera (a Canon) that has a \\"delete all photos\\" option. I never would have guessed that a camera would be sold that made it so hard to delete the photos. It's a flaw that makes the camera functionally so clunky that I'd advise looking to another manufacturer for your digital camera purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent indoor camera ng for outdoors","review":"Works fine indoors but should have an optical view finder for outdoors!CANNOT SEE IMAGE IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus Stylus 750","review":"Poor product suport and no solution to an issue that Olympus clearly acknowledges.

Wrong. Its glossy, glare-ridden display screen is virtually impossible to use in moderate sunlight--and in Arizona, moderate sunlight is about as good as it gets--all you can see is reflection, even with field-expedient shades. Battery life is mediocre if you have to use flash for fill or to deal with backlight, and auto exposure control seems incapable of taking decent pictures under high contrast. Only upside is that it is genuinely rain-resistant. But it is less capable than my daughter's 5 megapixel Nikon Coolpix, which takes better photos and has the advantage of running forever on 2 easily replaced lithium AA batteries.

The nice big viewing area on the back just goes completly black even in low light outdoors so you cannot see what you are shooting. I will be replacing this camera as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment","review":"This camera is virtually useless. Not having a view finder is a real detriment. I tried taking pictures while skiing and in the sun, the LCD screen is invisible. You cannot see what you are taking. I tried other shots outside with the same result. I guess it's fine for taking inside shots, but I need a camera that does both. So I bought a new camera that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus doesn't honor their warranty","review":"The camera broke shortly after we purchased it. When we sent it in for repair we were told that our warranty was void because the camera had been dropped. The camera had not been dropped!

Also--\\"Olympus Master\\"? Creepy. I edit in the camera or using MS Photo Editor or Photoshop.**no viewfinder means sometimes you're not sure what you're shooting.

It is told as a middle of the 3rd Millenium history book about the Middle Time, around 1975, it consists of several threads intricately woven together, and when you get into it, it most of all appears as a psychological fantasy novel: people taking on each other's identities, sharing identities, having split personalities. And even after having read this book, you'll still have the greatest subtlety of Madsen's left to discover - the way in which all his works are tightly woven together - you'll find stories, which are main plot threads in one book as mere remarks in other books, you'll rejoice meeting main characters in one book again as extras in other books...

I am the web developer at a major financial institution and I picked them up to gain more insight on web security and hackers. I didn't care for the writing style, nor the sense of humor. All the crud in here that I will never use mades me shake my head. I handed them over to our security engineer for his opinion. His one-sentence analysis was \\"what a waste of time\\". Endless useless pieces of information crammed into this book just to fill up the pages and make it look impressive. This 'complete reference' doesn't even include information about XWindows, the default windowing system for Unix. None of the ideas in this book come across clearly.

However last night I couldn't sleep at all, try as I might. In a fit of brilliance I took out the Hack Attack books to read, and I was out like a light.

Take for example an entire chapter devoted to the \\"C\\" programming language that goes into detail describing MS-DOS 16-bit pointer types and how to write a DOS TSR program. This was obviously culled from some programming reference from the mid 80s. How relevant is this to security in this day and age?

I particularly like the style the author used and the way each topic intertwined with more serious security technologies later on. Although I found some errors, the overall material was organized well and explained in great detail. A picture says a thousand words, and that's what I like most about the many examples (the author doesn't spare any expense with this book's illustrations).

There are also extensive walkthroughs of some topics which makes it unique in this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than advertized","review":"my friends told me not to buy this and i ignored them. i should have listened. this book would have been groundbreaking eight years ago, but its worthless in the 21st century. too outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long, too wrong.","review":"This book was too long, and contained too many completely wrong 'facts' and analysis, to be usable by anyone actually into hacking or the security field..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More inacuracies than pages","review":"This book has more show-stopping mistakes than it has pages -- and that's hard to do in a book this size. I stopped reading this book for content a long time ago, and now only read it when I'm bored at work and need a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many trees died to make this thing?","review":"I've read some of the other reviews here and all are either really really good or really really bad which made me wonder about the content--so I got it and I can say that it's really really bad. I can't figure out why some readers find it so helpful and wonderful when it clearly isn't. It's not the worst reference in the world, but it definitely isn't five stars great either. I have bought my share of security references and taken my share of classes so I feel justified in stating that the information could have been organized and written a lot better. It reads as though the author knew what he wanted to say, but it wasn't explained well--which makes for a poor technical guide. It's for those of us out there that want to learn it from someone who not only has the knowledge, but can convey that knowledge in a concise way. Can anyone out there recommend a better guide for me to get this information?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for all","review":"Exceptional book for everyone. The veteran engineer will find the advanced material and programming technically challenging, while the beginner will be educated and enlightened with the hottest security methods. And there's so much more to this book than that. The best part might be the utilities and techniques given for testing your own computers and networks. I think you'll enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the web","review":"This book is only a compilation of already available information. Now if this were a 'The best of the Web -- Security Edition' then perhaps I could understand. It could have been a quick place on paper to find all the information you need, even if it's nothing new on it's own. Instead this is a jumble of things that aren't tied together, and at least half of which are outdated. The last time I needed to write a TSR was in 1990 - is this state of the art today? Sure, if you still use your old 286 machine on a daily basis. Do you need a copy of the ASCII table? This is your source. You could, of course, type 'man ascii' on your unix machine and get it for free. What this book needed was a big pair of scissors to cut out the cruft and leave the gold. Right now I can't see anything shiny through the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good stuff, well worth the money.","review":"Lots of good stuff, well worth the money. I've contacted the author and found out the original book was too big, so it was broken down into two books Hack Attacks Revealed for the exploits and procedures, and Hack Attacks Denied for the intrusion defense stuff.Still there's 400 or so pages left for second editions!A MUST BE part of any security collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I have 3 years in IT security and I found this book helpful. It gives information for secutity holes in the most known products.The only think that I didn't like is the big C codes examples but this could be useful for many people interested on programming for security with C."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better references","review":"Undeniably one of the worst technical books I have ever had the misfortune to read. It is sort of a combination of networking protocalls, coding, server info, and lists of commands. Each of these areas is very separate from each other in reality. The novice user will be unable to use it because he will not understand it; and the pro will not want to read 900 pages of items he mostly already knows. What we're missing here is technique and explanation. I'm not sure what someone would use this book for. I already have reference books for most of these areas, so don't buy this if you are really looking for techniques on how a real hacker does things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Resource","review":"The book is a great resource on the fundamentals of network security. I found it thorough and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Scifi books","review":"This book was amazing. I first read it in my local library and loved it so much I had to buy a copy for myself. It was a fun read based on a future world with body switching abilities, and main characters with a special bond to one another. I go back from time to time to look at my favorite scenes in the book. There's a sense of suspense throughout the book because you just don't know how the main character will get out of the bind he's in.If you love scifi, I say go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Thing","review":"Having grown up on Chuck Wagon Gang 78's, I can tell you that finding this CD was like being instantly transported back in time. This is the original Chuck Wagon Gang -- Dad Carter, Rose, Anna and Jim. If you're familiar with the Chuck Wagon Gang, nothing else needs to be said. If you don't know them, it's all about the harmonies. The instrumentation is only an acoustic guitar. The focus is all on the vocals and, again, the wonderful harmony. This is gospel music in its simplest and rawest form. It's also gospel music in its most powerful form. There isn't a weak track on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"\\"Abduction\\" is about a boy and a girl who find that they have no idea what is happenng to them every night between 10pm and 2am.

I read it on a plane after I went on vacation and I couldn't put it down. My dad was trying to point out all sorts of cool sights from the window, but I couldn't pull myself away from the book. If you don't read this, you're really missing something awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to recommend it","review":"Trash literature for young adults, most appropriate for middle school kids. While this book may appeal to \\"reluctant readers\\" because of its fast-paced action, it has little to recommend it. The two main characters are fairly uninteresting. There are very clear-cut good guys and bad guys, with no shadings of gray. That will make it appealing to some young readers, but the characters seem flat. Lots of sexual innuendo and undertones...the young virginal girl is in danger of being molested by the sicko leader of the aliens. Philbrook has written some other books with good character development and interesting themes, but this book doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interior Design","review":"I ordered this magazine for my daughter as a gift as she is studying Interior Design and really likes the content of the magazine.

He is going to Scotland. Dairmid Hume is travelling with him, and while on the journey sells Edouard on the idea of taking a bride. Hume has a widowed niece holding an estate in trust for her ten-year-old son. He agrees to meet her, but will not marry her unless it is what she desires. She doesn't want to marry any man, but when Hume threatens to take away her son Robert, if she doesn't marry Trouville, she agrees. She'll simply have to hide Robert's deafness from Edouard. Anne soon finds her heart stolen by Edouard, but each time she decides to tell him about her son, the comte acts in a way that reveals that he dislikes imperfection. Lyn Stone has written a wonderful tale of love, trust and acceptance. The story is not predictable in the least and is full of lots of twists and turns. Don't miss this winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"affif stretches out","review":"This album is an arched box full of flavors and I haven't been able to get it out of my car cd player since I found it.

Not only is it SO VERY NOT USER FRIENDLY, (You'll have to read the manual three times over) but it, often freezes up, and takes alot of memory (and you still have to keep the CD-rom in the drive when you start it.) It comes with two discs, I didn't even get to the second one. After spending a good amount of time remixing one of my favorite tunes, I found that I was unable to save the mix in any kind of useful format. Can't exchange the tune, and can't burn it to a CD.

Great price. However, on one of them the print is a little on the light side and attempts to improve the print quality through printer settings have not been successful. No smudges or dots, so OK in that regard.On the second one, however, every page comes out crooked, making the cartridge pretty much useless.On one of the cartridges, the Low Toner signal always blinks, and although it will print anything I send it from my computer, for some unknown reason it will not print incoming faxes.

I have used a lot of \\"refurbished\\" toners over the past 5 years and these are the first ones I have ever had a problem with.

I was able to get rid of the black stains by wiggling the cartrage a little, but I was not able to get rid of the noise yet. Maybe if I try longer, I could find a sweet spot to get rid of the noise. I am just a little concerned that this may wear out my printer faster!I re-installed my original Canon X25 Cartridge and it works fine.Can not return the cartrage since the return window just expired (Feb 27).Based on this experience, I can not recommend this product.

Despite the fact that this WAS the correctly specified cartridge for my Canon MF5770, the printer would only dispay a message saying, \\"Install Cartridge\\". Super Media Store customer service advised me to leave the cartridge in the machine for several hours. Seemed like a waste of time and it was. Worst of all, I was completely unable to get ANYONE at Super Media to again answer the phone despite up to 8 calls on 3 different days!

This book absolutely confirms this for me.While I was VERY intrigued to learn more about Decker's eldest child - Cindy, I was left feeling as though this character was never really put out for us to understand. Its as though Kellerman wasn't quite sure what kind of person Cindy should be so she made her into a very \\"neutral\\" kind of person.Also, I found the storyline was very slow.

I think that they need more chacthers in the book like pee wee herman or even the great Jason Bateman.

The suspense keeps you glued to the page when you should be doing something else, like sleeping. Cindy Decker is determine to blend in with the cops she works with, but not all the boys are receptive to letting the girls play in their games. It may sound childish, but there is a lot of it still out there and for a female cop it can be deadly. Cindy can be forgiven her stubborness, but she makes some realy dumb moves for a woman who should know better, I expected more from her. As always in Kellerman's stories, family is a big part of it all. In this brave new world where women are allowed to have as much courage as men, if you add in a few insecure egos and one woman's determination to do it all on her own you have all the makings for a great tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read most of Faye Kellerman's books and have really enjoyed most of them. However, Stalker was a major disappointment. By the middle of the book, I was so tired of Cindy's whining and complaining I didn't care what happened to her. Very boring effort this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I really enjoyed this latest effort by Faye Kellerman. I was dubious at first because I have grown to so like Peter and Rina. But this was a wonderful exploration and it seems to me that Faye Kellerman's skill in writing continues to mature.All of my favorite elements were there as were my favorite characters from her other works. A nice surprise was the development of the Scott Oliver character. I hadn't expected that and it was nice to see Faye attempt to make him more human and less stereotypical. The use of stereotype as device seems to creep in too easily but I have to admit it is effective.I thought Cindy's character development was a bit heavy but perhaps it is just that I am too far from 25 to remember.Still it was a wonderful trip and makes me eager to take the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treacherous","review":"This is my first & last Faye Kellerman book. I had to force myself to finish it hoping it would get better. The dialoug between the characters was horrendous. I felt like I was reading a \\"B\\" movie.

I DO NOT recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faye Kellerman lost her touch with this one.","review":"I was disappointed in this book, and even more so after having waited anxiously for the book's August 2000 release. I was first in line so I could read yet another episode in the lives of the Decker family. However, this book was just not nearly as interesting and/or entertaining as her others. In fact, I found myself extremely bored with the plot and the characters. The characters were unbelieveable and they possessed little depth and substance. The story dragged as it winded endlessly around and around telling a tale that never took off. This was the first time, since I started reading a Kellerman novel, that I was not even a little bit sad to see the story end. Let's hope the next one is better! I won't jump ship just yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not as good as others, and disappointing writing","review":"As a great fan of Faye Kellerman's series, I have read them all in order, and some twice. This is not one I would read again. I am pleased in some ways that Kellerman is bringing in Cynthia as a more central character, but I miss seeing Decker and Rina. What bothered me most was the poor quality of the writing and/or editing; in one place, Kellerman writes (something like), \\"She parked herself in front of the TV and turned on the boob tube.\\" Overwritten (no need for repeating any word for TV) and \\"boob tube\\" is just stupid (I don't think many 25 year olds use it). These type of \\"Gen X\\" pepper the book and are annoying. Again, it is repetitive and it seems that, because she has been a bestselling author for many years, either Kellerman or her editors are slacking off. Don't, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've read many of Faye Kellermans books, but I just couldn't get into this one.

Stick with Peter and Rina from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As many books...","review":"The book's beginning was wonderful but as you keep reading the story keeps boring you. The last hundred pages or so when the thrilling part must be at pinnacle the book goes out of the main plot so many times that you'll forget what are you reading.

It sounded as if she started writing the book without knowing where it was going. The plot was confusing. The cop language sounded forced. Do cops today really still say \\"grub\\", as in \\"lets get some grub\\" ? which appears more than once in one form or another. I also find it hard to believe that a college-educated cop is such a rarity on today's police force."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW AND BORING","review":"It took me over a week to read this book. I would pick it up, read a few minutes and then think of something I'd rather be doing. The next night I would pick it up again, with the same results.

We are told that she is a graduate of an Ivy League college, but, oddly, she is not smart enough to keep her head down and her mouth shut during her important rookie period. This book lacks a center. I missed Peter and Rina; I missed the focus which Orthodox Judaism lent to the early books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stalker","review":"I have enjoyed all of the preceeding books by both Kellermans. In this case, however, I found myself wishing someone would simply kill Cindy and get it over with. I would have much preferred dealing with Peter and Rina's grief over Cindy's death than enduring her attitude and behavior. I sincerely hope that Ms. Kellerman brings much, much more maturity and depth to Cindy's character in the next episode. Until then, \\"Cindy-the Cop\\" is an idea gone very, very wrong!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"What made Faye Kellerman's books so special was her treatment of a world that most of us don't live in, the world of Orthodox Judaism and how it effects the characters of Rina and Peter. This book focuses on Peter's daughter, Cindy, who is not of this world and rather boring to boot. Rina does not make an appearance until halfway through the book and then she's mostly serving food. There was none of the feisty, original thinking that she is so famous for and Peter seemed diminished as he simply turned into a worried parent. Had this book not had the framework of being billed as a Peter and Rina novel, it would have boiled down to a very ordinary, cliched story. I feel that the book was masquerading under false pretenses. I buy this series to learn what Peter and Rina are up to and to better understand their lives in the context of their faith. This book was a cheat."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great story","review":"The last person who wrote a review said they didn't like the book because the main character was stubborn and it ruined the story. I totally disagree! Cindy was stubborn in her ways, but she's like her father and lots of people are like that. It was very realistic. If you like mystery summer reading with a little romance and a lot of detective work, you will like this book. I am a very picky reader, if a book doesn't interest me in the first few pages then forget about it. But this one grabs you and doesn't let go until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"This was a slow \\"cops talking to cops\\" book.

To make matters worse, her father has been on the force for years and, of course, some of her co-workers believe she is favored because of his position.As Cindy works the streets, partnered with a veteran, she becomes embroiled in a crime that will eventually put her in a position of exposing dirty cops. Her life becomes a nightmare as someone begins to follow her every move and creates a pattern of threatening notes and incidents.She can believe and trust in no one and must rely on her own judgment and police training to get her through. The story builds to a harrowing ending with split second timing and lightening speed required to come out alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cindy Go Home-","review":"In the past, Kellerman has consistently drawn complex characters that the reader is interested in and can identify with. Cindy is not such a character.Why would anyone be interested in a narcissistic little twit with a wardrobe obsession? Why would readers want to endure in literature a character whom in real life we would avoid like the plague? I'm too busy a person to spend my time with someone so shallow and trivial. Cindy has no moral depth, no psychological complexity. We don't identify with this character; we don't care about this character. On the other hand, we desperately miss Peter and Rina.Altogether, this book was a disappointment--to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and suspenseful","review":"Cindy Decker, a new rookie cop based in Hollywood, is finding it hard to cope with the job as she is being constantly hazed by her male colleagues who resent the fact that she has a college education and even more resentful that her father is Lieutenant Peter Decker. When suspicious things start to happen to her, she is determined to go it alone and not seek advice or help from her father...big mistake, as things escalate to downright frightening. It's a great cop story with lots of twists but I couldn't help but feel that this girl who is supposed to be a mature, gun carrying police woman, needs a good slap around the legs for being so obstinate and just plain stupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best watch ever!","review":"I have owned two of these watches (only because I lost the first).

Aaron and others get spooked by surprise cameramen. Melissa turns her car on the crew. Eric gets powdered on a photo shoot.The Real World fish also come into play. Rachel gets upset at their fate.

There is so much build up, but very little result. Overall, I was very dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"New King of short fiction?","review":"This guy is way better than his father has been lately. This book shows he knows his way around a short story better than King did in \\"Everything's Eventual\\" (a book I thought was more than decent). What I find really surprising is Hill's insight into the mind and motivations of the common man, considering he must have grown up never knowing need or deprivation. This type of down-to-earth, prosaic realism has been King's forte for decades and I daresay Hill gives him a run for his money. For fiction, especially genre fiction, enjoyment is inevitably proportionate to the measure that one can suspend disbelief. While Joe Hill's stories often veer toward the exceedingly fantastic, they are carefully constructed to be literary Golden Gate Bridges, the other side of which you always want to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait til he has some experience","review":"After the second story you realize that the author is a seriously gifted writer. He expects his readers to be prepared to catch his references and to be familiar with the conventions of the short story. The work can be appreciated by beginners, but if you've been around the block, you marvel. This guy can write. He's got the talent to match the genes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing His Dad Proud","review":"Joe Hill, the author of A Heart Shaped Box, and the son of Stephen King (his full name is Joseph Hillstrom King), has written a compilation of short stories that is at times very disturbing (\\"The Cape\\" comes to mind), fantastic (\\"Pop Art\\"), or elusively deceiving (\\"My Fathers Mask\\"). If you have to read fluff that always ends happily you might want to look elsewhere. I, for one, could barely stop reading it until I finished every story."},{"rating":"2","title":":-)","review":"What a pleasure to read these lovely, funny, homespun tales. I was delighted with the very goofy pop art, one of the smaller stories here. While not everything is equally powerful, there are some truly fresh and deep currents running throughout. JH has a wide-ranging imagination, curiosity and enthusiasm, a unique voice, and a genuine gift for storytelling. However uneven, I'm really enjoying his stories and novels.I'm a little more than halfway through this collection, and just finished the story featuring the kid who works at the video store.. it could be far better, but I really like where it's headed...a territory so well explored by Patricia Highsmith, Ruth Rendell (in the novels), some of Roman Polanski's earlier work.I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what develops with this talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Collection","review":"I can't see anyone not being impressed with this outstanding collection.

I was very disapointed to find out that not only were none of these stories scary in the least, they had no ending, which left you hanging. Some of the stories, such as \\"Better than Home\\" in NO WAY constituted a ghost story, or was frightening in any way, shape, or form.

I would not reccomend this book overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Title For This Book","review":"I was really looking forward to this book after reading Heart Shaped Box, but I have to admit I was disappointed.

I read the short stories until I was scared to read the next one.

A friend took it off my hands so I did not have to pitch it after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of his finest work!","review":"I'm not really a huge fan of the short story format, but this collection was more entertaining than most. Stephen King's son is talented in his own right, that is for sure! This collection varied in subject and length, with some stories being little more than a page, and others much longer. I have read Hill's two novels, and I think that some of his best characters, however, can be found within these stories. He has a particularly good grasp on adolescent boys. None of these stories stood out as being especially frightening, but they were entertaining and I was surprised by the emotional level displayed in many of them. While I think _Horns_ has been his finest work to date, I did enjoy this more than _Heart-Shaped Box_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Hill's 20th Century Ghosts is Brilliant","review":"Joe Hill is brilliant, I can't say it any other way. The stories in 20th Century Ghosts are fresh and intelligent. Mr. Hill develops characters that are 3 dimensional and which the reader cares deeply about. I was hypnotized by these stories from the beginning to the end. When I finished the last story, I was deeply depressed.I am an English teacher and I read the story Pop Art, (a tale of an inflatable boy), aloud to my Freshmen class, and they were absolutely mesmerized. It's outlandishly macabre,sad and deeply disturbing at the same time. I don't think I've ever read a story that compares to this in my life. One can only hope that Joe Hill will continue writing for many years to come. If you are looking for a book that is satisfying, scary, funny, sad and impossible to put down, this it it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent durability","review":"While setting up my AMS wave arrow rest, i took a few practice shots with these arrows and managed to put one thru a log roughly 3\\" in diameter.

I got this book since it deals with one pilot's story of how he entered the Pacific war by literally flying right into it! Clarence Dickinson's book tells of his exploits as a Douglas SBD Dauntless pilot with VS-6 of the U.S.S. Enterprise. His style is easy to read and the book is short but it leaves you breathless with all that happened to him and his squadron in the early days of the carrier air wars.He recounts his entry into the war when he and his squadron were flying from the carrier into Pearl Harbor, you guessed it, right during the attack from the japanese! He managed to get himself shot down and parachuted to safety. He then tells of the spring of 1942 leading up to his participation and successful bombing run on one of the jap carriers during the battle of Midway.Hard to find book but get this one for your WWII library.

The photos are horrible and do not represent the breeds as they should be represented."},{"rating":"1","title":"More information on the AKC website","review":"If you want information on breeds, look at the AKC website, or at websites for the different breed clubs. This is nothing more than a breakdown of each breeds (and it doesn't include them all) standard. As mentioned by others, the pictures are not good. It would have been nice to have comparisons of a good head to a bad head or top dog to one that doesn't fit the standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, practical, valuable","review":"This useful book may appear out of date but it's packed with information useful to any painter or photographer. For example, a head shot is compared in different lighting. An identical pose is framed and placed differently.

The styles and dress of the pictures are dated, but the content never goes out of date."},{"rating":"1","title":"His second book is much better","review":"I really don't understand how you can publish an art book in black and white since art/painting is all about color. Many of the topics and examples are exactly the same as images included in subsequent books -- but, they are in color. The book was purchased as used. It would be very helpful if the sellers would specify that the book was previously owned by a smoker. As I attempted to read through the book i had a major allergy attack.

No American History on this program! I get frusterated a lot because it's so hard to exit the program. You click all these buttons before you exit! Poorly written Software!

All it tells you is the original key the songs were played in.

The second tpe is good for teaching the basics, but go and find a live instructor.In the second tape, we had to rewind couple of times in the swing jams because it was really funny - no offense, but if you are doing a tape to sell, I think you need better dancers than this.

The moves are really lame and some spins will not work at all because there is no initiation at all. Do not listen to instruction on getting out of cuddle position. It is just plain wrong.

Sure it lacks the super shiny editing efforts and sound engineering...(the garnish) but there is enough information here to get you started so you can practice the basics of swing. It's affordably priced and the teachers are real and likable in their presentations. I checked this video out from the library...then purchased a copy for myself.

I read it because it was tauted as a book of over coming racism and prejudice. The idea of American racism was supposedly being used as a tool to demean the white pilot into submission by the Vietcong. Human nature never ceases to amaze me but it is hard to comprehend that two Americans in the dire straits of a POW camp would let something like the color of their skin hinder companionship, communication et. al., things in low supply at a POW camp apparently. The story is heartwarming and informative of a POW's plight. The actual racism issue is of no significance to me when it is put in perspective of what else was going on in the camps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Let's be realistic here; parents buy a potty video to help teach the child. Having read enough about what the parent is to do, I bought this video for my twin girls thinking it was a 30 minute (per the box) or so video designed to teach all aspects of the potty to the child. The children's video is about 5 minutes; another five minutes of \\"credits\\" and the remainder, and clear majority of the video is parental advice. I returned it the same day in favor of a video that would take longer than five minutes to teach my girls all aspects of this important ritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loved it.","review":"My daughter really enjoyed this video. She watched it over and over again. I believe it was a great motivator for her at 2. She was done potty training by 2yrs and 4mo. She related very well to the kids in the video. This simple video can be very hard for adults to watch but the simplicity is what I think helped my daughter understand the \\"potty\\" concept. She watched it so much the tape was ruined by the time she was done potty training. I am planning to purchase the boys version for my son who is almost two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for our 20 month old daughter","review":"We aren't yet toilet training our daughter, who's almost 2, but we bought this video and potty just to introduce her to the potty concept.The video is annoying, and the shots of the babies putting their potties on their heads set a bad example, but our 20-month-old daughter watched the video a few times and started to demand to use the potty. She's certainly not toilet trained, but she's successfully used the potty at least a few days a week every week since we've bought the video.So yes, the video is annoying to parents, but parents aren't toddlers. Toddlers who don't have a lot of videos and are ready for potty information could get a lot out of this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't watch again","review":"I bought several potty training dvd's for my two year olds who are halfway through potty training. This was my least favorite. I expected much more from something produced by a doctor. Instead, the video is mostly diaper clad toddlers running around with their potties, pushing them around on the floor, dancing with them to music, and even throwing them once. After watching it for the first time yesterday, my kids started racing around the house pushing their potties in front of them like cars, then picking them up and throwing them like the boy in the show. Not exactly the results I was looking for! The video uses the terms wee wee and poo poo which is not consistent with the terms we use so that was confusing too. The one positive thing I would say is that the theme song is very catchy and my kids were already trying to sing it after only one viewing (as they threw their potties)I wish I had not spent so much on this dvd - I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great potty learning tool!","review":"This DVD is a great companion to the Once Upon a Potty book, which my toddler loves.

My daughter asks for this DVD every day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"once upon a potty for her","review":"We bought this book, and my daughter loved the book. I thought the video might make more of an impact, so I bought that too. It didn't really do any good.

I would buy the book again, but not the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Diapers","review":"I bought this video when my daughter was potty training. We had the book already, and she loved that, so I thought that this might keep her sitting on the potty a bit longer. I was disappointed by the only live-action children wearing their diapers to sit on the potty. Who wears diapers to sit on a potty? However, she did love the video, and continued to sing the Potty Song for long after she had been potty trained. I will not buy the boys version for my son, as there are better training tools out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"By the time you get through all the credits you end up with about 5 minutes of instruction for your child.

The potty looks nothing like any of the potty's out there in stores. The DVD quality is lousy, keeps flickering. The cartoon is brief and the little girl does it all in one sitting! ya, right.I think she only likes the video because of the babies.Cute song, they should really update this video. I agree with the other parents about how they should have shown a baby pulling down their pants to use the potty, kids aren't usually running around the house butt naked all day! And the close up of the bum hole is pretty un-necessary too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"The video is way too short and outdated. It's maybe worth $5.00, not $15.00 like I paid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Piqued her interest","review":"I have had multiple potty books. Even one's that made a flushing sound. Nothing worked. This video as annoying as the song is got my daughter interested. And in days she was going to the potty. I also got the book- not necessary. The dvd was suficent. I would recommend this to everyone. However, this is the only dvd I have tried. Some people have had problems with the language used- hole for pooping, poop etc... I thought it was fine and definitely got the point across. Shows children the anatomy in a cartoon. Like I said before- It really gets their attention, and that's half the battle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better.","review":"This movie is ok for potty training. The song is catchy, kids like watching other kids so it's fun for them to watch. The actual story is lacking though. It's about 7 minutes long and Prudence only ever feels the need to go \\"poo poo\\" and never has to urinate but always seems to when she has a bm. Also, she spends most of the video bottomless. It would be nice if she had to urinate sometimes and had to pull down her pants - had an accident once, got it right once - because come let's face it, that's what happens. Then at the end when she's \\"using it all the time\\" that's it. She pulls on some panties while introducing the song. I'd prefer a big celebration and a big deal made out of her being able to leave the diapers behind and use big girl panties.My daughter likes it but it could be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was very excited when I ordered this DVD.

It didn't help at all - the kids on there are BABIES who sit on the potty with their diaper on. This is all my daughter wanted to do after watching the video. There is one part where \\"Prudence\\" puts the potty on her head, which my daughter also wanted to do. It'd be more helpful it if taught kids of the right age how to pull their pants down, sit on the potty, then afterwards WASH THEIR HANDS. No mention of toilet paper at all, either. This was a complete waste of money and time for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a potty disaster; right there on your living room couch","review":"My niece watched this movie, and went and hid under the covers. I think they just made the big potty seem way too scary. This isn't a potty training video, it is more like an anti-potty training video.

The potties look ancient! The kids have to straddle them. The kids sitting on them look no more than 18 months old and have diapers on. Who told the writers of \\"The Potty Song\\" that kids call urine \\"wee wee\\"? My daughter was like \\"uh what's that?\\"Prudence only uses the potty once and it is pee and poo all at once. She is naked when she uses it, doesn't wipe herself or wash her hands.My daughter mostly laughed at the babies running around and placing potties on their heads (oh yeah, that's educational) and that crazy song they are dancing to that is stuck in my head ALL DAY at work.I think it's time for a new generation video that is a little more PC shall we say than this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short to the point","review":"My daughter really liked the video. I was short, to the point, and has a very catchy song. Although she is not potty trained it sure sparked some interest in using the potty. In fact, after we watched the show she wanted to try her potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"An effective little movie!","review":"My little girl liked Prudence and the little potty chair. Yes, the potty chair doesn't look like the potty that everyone I know uses, but my two year old wasn't that analytical about the look of the potty. She knew what the little girl was trying to do- what she herself tried to do, and failed. When that little girl made the \\"poo poo\\" in the potty, my daughter went into the bathroom and sat and did it too. She must have thought that if SHE can do it, I can too.This was an effective little movie for us! Cute and to the point, with other babies to see too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter likes it, I don't!","review":"I thought this would help with my 2 yr old's potty learning but I can't say that it does. There are too many flaws to make it worth while in my opinion. It has video of babies playing with the potty and this just causes my daughter to do the same thing. NOT GOOD! Things like putting the potty on her head, etc. The song also mentions how easy life was with a diaper (is this really what we want a potty training child to think?) and it calls a vagina a \\"pee pee\\" which is where the \\"wee wee\\" comes out. Overall, I don't approve of the message or the terminology but, I prefer to use the real name for things. My daughter on the other hand would disagree - she loves it. It hasn't helped her go in the potty anymore than before but she enjoys watching the babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want to hear a horrible \\"potty song\\"","review":"Since your child will want to watch it again and again, choose your potty-teaching video wisely. \\"Bear in the Big Blue House\\" is MUCH better all around. Clever, fun songs (5 of them!), no cutesey words for body parts (\\"Once...\\" explains that pee-pee comes out of your wee-wee, whereas in \\"Bear...\\" one simply poops, the word we use in our house). One up-side for \\"Once...\\": for parents who have questions about when and how to being potty-teaching, there is a much more informative section AFTER the kid's video, but you may want to fast-forward through the awful \\"Potty Song.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line: it's outdated, and you will be disappointed.","review":"I am so glad that I rented this from the library rather than had it purchased from here based on mostly positive reviews. The video and animation is very low quality, and they'll especially be bad if you view it on an HDTV. I am annoyed that they recycle the \\"music video\\" and show it twice in this very short DVD.. and even WITHIN the video they recycle clips! Very, very sad. If there's any redeeming quality to this, it's the animation portion. I would love to see an updated, expanded, corrected (not wiping/washing hands as other pointed out) version of this, but as it currently stands, not worth more than a $2 investment if found at Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste the money","review":"I am so glad I borrowed this video from the library instead of spending good money to own this bore. The story dramatization lasts but 5 minutes. All the rest is annoying filler. The sing along potty song will immediately irritate you.

I was about to make the purchase, but before I did I went to the library and checked out the VHS of Once Upon a Potty.I am so disappointed. The actual story portion of the tape is probably about 5 or 10 minutes at the most. The rest of the kids portion of the tape- another 5 or 10 minutes- is the stupid potty song. This tape grates on my nerves so much I have to leave the room when the kids are watching it.I hope that it produces the desired result which is helping my daughter understand and show interest in potty-training. Quite frankly I would never buy this tape because there must be less painful ways for parents to go through the training process with their toddlers.

Glad I did.I found it funny, clever and satirical. It's not a novel, so don't expect a minature dose of discworld. But as a treatise on the essence of \\"catness\\" it's a little gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impenetrable","review":"Was given this as a gift by a friend who is a cat enthusiast. Not quite sure what possessed her. I think cats are cute, but I'm far from having the enthusiasm required to appreciate this book, which is a lengthy exegesis on the behaviors of \\"adulterated\\" cats and \\"real\\" cats, a metaphysical speculation which proves tiresome after the jacket flap. I can scarcely fathom how one could devote a single page, let alone an entire book, to an imaginary (and slightly deranged) argument in which artificial categories are imposed on animals incapable of resisting them. Yet Terry Pratchett has achieved this, presumably in the expectation of laughter from the similarly pet-obsessed, who, if they cannot write a book like this, will certainly pay to read it. But the result is less than adorable, far from funny, and not a little sickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing cliche.","review":"I'm a big fan of Sir Terry Pratchett, so I was really looking forward to enjoying his take on cats. However, it was a huge disappointment. The book is one long cliche from beginning to end, and it reads like a cheap Douglas Adams knockoff. I guess I should have noticed it was printed in the early 1990s, before Pratchett really hit his stride. Skip this one and pick up one of his Tiffany Aching stories instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as the reviews would have you believe","review":"This was my introduction to Terry Pratchett's writing. Reading all of the reviews led me to believe that this book was a funny take on the world of cats. This book, which reads like an essay of observations, is not ground breaking and is certainly not hilarious. If I were counting I would say that there might have been ten chuckles all together. Certainly not as funny as it was cracked up to be.The treatment felt superficial and the observations felt recycled from other writings about cats. Nothing here would recommend this book over any other cat book or story that I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pratchett & cats","review":"This is not a really great Pratchett book, it could have been so much more and so much funnier. I love cats and especially \\"real\\" cats! But somehow this book just misses the real real cat somewhere. Others might love it, I did not really.

The Unadulterated Cat did the trick perfectly. This book is about what a Real cats should be, and also what they shouldn't be. About what they do, and eat, what to call them, etc.No doubt you will enjoy this book, even if you don't have a cat (I don't).

The book comes up with assorted and scandalous-sounding allegations.

The book itself is riddled with typos and figures that do not demonstrate the concept that is being explained. In fact, one figure early on in Chapter 2 shows the opposite of what is trying to be explained.

Unfortunately, what I found was a blatant propaganda piece. Although there are interviews with a variety of different pro-Israel speakers, they interview 1 representative of the Palestinian side for a total of about 30 seconds. The movie is replete with tragic visuals of victims on the Israeli side, yet only 1 or 2 images of victims on the Palestinian side. Eventually, the movie concludes that Israel has only ever acted to protect itself, and any resulting civilian casualties on the Palestinian side are essentially the fault of the Palestinians for having bad leaders. I'm no expert on the Middle East, but it doesn't take much sophistication to recognize a one-sided piece of journalistic trash.

There is a \\"parenting section\\" of the DVD in which Dr. Franel addresses some basic potty training tips that were only useful if you (as a parent) hadn't researched ANYTHING about potty training prior to viewing this DVD. I always take heed to amazon customer reviews but I believe in this instance it let me down.

Don't give up just because you don't like the shape of the potty. Give your kid some credit, he knows what they mean by the word potty. If they called it a loo or WC, he wouldn't get it, but a potty is a potty.The body parts description caught me off guard, but it is important for any child to know what their parts are for and especially topical for one who is potty training.My child seemed ready for a couple months but just wouldn't use the toilet, then after watching this several times one day, started using the toilet and hasn't turned back since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it before you buy it.","review":"I borrowed this video along with other Potty Training videos from the library.

My 20-month old son got very excited when he saw in the video and went into the other room to get his Bumbo seat (NOT a potty chair), brought it back, sat in it, and said, \\"Potty!\\" Luckily I convinced him not to use the Bumbo that way. But the movie never shows anything about using a toilet and made my son think he should go get a little seat for going to the bathroom. I would rather train my child to use a toilet (which he does, if not perfectly yet) than to carry around a plastic seat and make messes in it.The actual movie is also very short. The \\"credits\\" (pictures and names of the children who appear) take at least as long as the movie, and they're not that long, either. The movie is a very simple cartoon with sporadic scenes of naked or only diapered toddlers running around with plastic potty chairs.

Neither me or my son can stand to watch it more than a couple of times. The song is kind of catchy, but it gets old fast too. The potty does look different from any kinds I have seen as well. On another note, it shows it in his diaper when he has gone potty, I mean isn't that a little much? I think its just plain gross and my son probably didn't even know what it was supposed to be anyways. I know one of the reviewers said the kids looked too young but some of them looked too old too. I swear one of the kids in it looks like hes four. I wouldn't waste your money on this video, the repetetive nature of it bores the child too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I didn't this video was great at all. The songs are okay. They can be better. And the visual is terrible. First of all, the potties that are portrayed in this video are not all something that a 2 year old would grasp as looking anything remotely close to a toilet. It's very confusing. This video also refers to the different ways that you use the toilet in only one certain way. This makes it difficult for a child of a certain background to understand exactly what the video is trying to teach.ex. Not everyone will call #2 poopoo or poo.I think this video needs a lot of work.

The babies in the video are very, very young, as in hardly up on their feet, let alone using the potty. They start with The Potty Song, the story is short and uses silly words like wee-wee and then they end with The Potty Song. The Potty Song is back to the babies playing and not making much sense.

He was about 2 years old, and was exhibiting signs of readiness, but he was not interested in sitting on the potty. When the video arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see the little boy's name in the video was Joshua (same as my son!) This helped tremendously! The song does have a tendency to stay in your head all day, so be careful singing out loud! The video was not the sole reason my son learned to use the potty, but it definitely contributed to his success.

But it got a little better within the first few chapters. It seemed to set up an interesting premise with the discovery of the notebook page and a few murders. But sadly the plot went nowhere, and I mean nowhere. Aside some pointless although entertaining flashbacks of WWII everybody just sat around surfing the web finding stuff out (when they are not having sex). I did not know you could find these super deep dark secrets using google. The author also goes into very detailed descriptions of the surroundings that get old really fast. It is half of the book. The final showdown was a big mess, you don't really know what happens because everybody fumbles around in the dark. Lame lame, story skip it. This gets 2 stars because it was an easy fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT PREMISE BUT VERY DISAPPOINTING!","review":"This book looked like a winner-then I read it! The author indulges himself by going off on too many tangents with too many subplots and too many superfluous characters so that when the book comes to an end, you feel like you only got part of a story. The ending was boring, and didn't tie into anything. To me, this is a Dan Brown wannabe. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still not sure what the plot was","review":"I have a feeling Paul Christopher was as bored writing this book as I was reading it. He seemed to just end it with no real effort to wrap up any loose threads or explain why any of the events happened or what reason there was for the string of murders. But then, maybe that was par for the course since none of the characters seemed to have any real motive for anything they did, whether it was killing someone, having sex with someone, or anything else.All that being said, it was still better than Davinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"This book had a lot of potential, from the interesting cover, to the premise on the back. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was disjointed, confusing, underdeveloped (plot and characters) and boring. It lacked a strong plot and had little resolution at the end. The author had more fun describing the lead female basically as a sexual object than a mature adult. The sexual overtones were unnecessary and distracting. His attempts to keep the reader in the dark were so confusing that I never knew what was going on, which \\"plot\\" to focus on or which decade to be in. All in all, a terrible \\"thriller.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Save your money and time by not reading this book. It is horribly written and is not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Da Vinci Code","review":"I hate to see this book equated with the Da Vinci Code. It's better in terms of plot and writing. By contrast, \\"The Code\\" is poorly written and derivative - certainly derived in concept from \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\" (which I read when it was first published), but in novel form follows more closely Lewis Perdue's (far better) \\"Da Vinci Legacy.\\" Although Michelangelo's Notebook is not a great book, it is an entertaining who-done-it that concentrates on Nazi art theft - one of my favorite topics for escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"It's not very often that I actually can't get through a book, but this one I just had to put down. I can't speak much to the quality of the whole story since I didn't finish, but the the writing style is so bad, I couldn't take anymore. If you read the first few chapters, you will see what I mean. He starts of the book by describing the novel's heroine in physical detail, because (of course) she just happens to be a nude model for art classes in her spare time. Which is completely unrelated to the rest of the story. It comes off like a dirty, but also totally cheesy, porn romance novel. I mean, he seriously spends several sentences talking about the color of her nipples, and even compares them to seashells. The whole book goes on like this. I read about 100 pages and then had to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"was there supposed to be a notebook somewhere?","review":"Aside from the fact that the main(?) character in the book finds a page from the ficticious? mystical?

Won't read this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Routine but readable light thriller","review":"This is a stripped-down version of the ponderous, intricate, and-to me- often boringDa Vinci Code-style of thriller. My own belief is that a straight ahead chronological retailing of the action would have made for greater clarity and strength than the author's interweaving of action in 1945 with the focus of the book, which is the young heroines search for the killers of her boyfriend and, nearly, herself. The absence of the elaborations one might get in a book of greater depth are hardly missed, since the elements are familiar ones in the pattern the author utilizes and most of us can just fill in the blanks as we go along. I would not recommend this as a book one wants to bury oneself in, to the exclusion of other interests, but in waiting or traveling in train, bus or plane, waiting for a doctor, dentist or lab test, waiting for children at the end of school, and similar occasions which demand time-filling, this would serve well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable And Disappointing","review":"I'm going to keep this short.This book was a run of the mill Dan Brown wannabe and failed miserably.The plot was cliched and full of typical action sequences.The characters were poorly developed if developed at all.And worse of all what ever potential the plot had was never realized.I would avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done.","review":"Fortunately, this book was published in paperback, so I only wasted $8 on it.

Take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh","review":"I don't know how many times I've paused while reading this book to complain about how bad the writing is. While the plot seems interesting, the characters act and do things for completely no reason at all.

I don't think I have the stomach to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"As imaginative as a high-school sophomore's lit project","review":"This book is so stilted in its plot and character development you want to find its author and demand a refund. The male lead, Valentine, is so carbon-copied off of other novelists who actually take the time to develop a semi-coherent character that you can almost see the plageurism. The female lead is worse, and you become very creeped out by the sex scenes.

The music that plays is cute, too. The only thing that I wonder about is the title of the toy says \\"Rockin' Aquarium Gym\\", and unless I am missing something, her gym doesn't make any rocking motion whatsoever.

First of all, it's not very soft for a little baby to be playing on. Under the thin piece of frabic is hard plastic. The fabric doesn't even cover all of the plastic. Second, once your baby starts moving around a little, there is no place for him/her to move. The thing is just not big enough. Another thing is the yellow coverings on the sides do not screw on all the way. You can only turn the screws in a little before they are too tight to turn anymore. The picture even shows the yellow covering on the left side falling apart. When I realized this, that's when I started to take it apart.

They have hit her in the head and left red marks, which as a parent I hate seeing any \\"boo-boo.\\" The part that hits her is made of bendable rubber to go into the toy.

He was able to spin the ball on the rattle, so my husband and I were happy with the gift until we turned the music wheel on. After about 10 seconds, the fish in the wheel gets stuck and it makes loud clicking noises that never stops unless you hit it. Addition to that, there isn't any padding and the hanging toys fall down. I wanted to return this item but my husband threw the box away. But, after reading the reviews, several consumers have returned it. I plan on doing the same, otherwise I will throw it in the trash.

The inside has three places for storage. On top is a large mesh net which you can place soft accesories into (it sits on top of the camera when closed). In the front is a pocket for storage of an extra battery & behind is a slot for an extra SD flash card. There is a belt loop on the back however is is too small for a two inch belt.

The rewards of this format are immediately clear, as this provides a constant framework to assess and reinforce good writing. Clever dialogue throughout makes it particularly enjoyable, and the winking self-referencing style of the hero (all the while breaking down the nuances of structure+character) gives it a style similar to Scott McCloud's landmark Understanding Comics. I'd love if the subtitle to this book were \\"From Hollywood to Hell (and Back, literally)\\" as readers actually take a writer's journey through Hades with an encouraging and then deceitful Virgil. It makes for a lot of fun with great moments to illustrate those all-important points.

It is more than just shooting at targets or fly by birds. You have to be patient and use skill to let the birds come to you. Another phase of this game is to train your self as well as the dog to fetch the fallen ducks. Once you get the commands down you will be able to speed the game along. One tip to rememeber is to wait till the ducks get closer to you before you shoot because it will take you a little longer to locate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I took it back","review":"I had high hopes for this game, but it was not what I had hoped. As with one other reviewer, I was hoping for something more along the lines of the original duck hunting game featuring clays etc. I like the fact that is teaches good hunting etiquette in that you need to train your dog before you go hunging etc, but it was low on action. If you want a slow paced and patience teaching game, this is pretty good. If you want action, keep looking, that's what I am doing now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite","review":"I got this along with Big Game Hunter and thought the movements and controls would be about the same as Big Game Hunter, but it is, to me, a little less fun. You can't \\"look around\\" with just a simple movement of the remote, you have to use the nunchuck control to do so. I'm not a big video game player, so for me, there was just too much going on with both hands just to look around and see where the ducks are coming from. But that is just my opinion. I just might not be coordinated enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like actual Duck hunting","review":"This game is very realistic. nothing like old duck hunt. you actually train your dog, make duck calls and sit in a blind. ducks come close only once in a while and then when you get one, you have to make your dog go get it. very very real sounds you feel like you are in the duck blind"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst game I own for the wii","review":"I rarely write product reviews but I thought this game would be like the original duck hunt which was a great game.

I will say that after you go through all of the crap and finally figure out how to shoot a duck, it is very satisfying. I attribute this to the fact that every other aspect of this game is horrible and that the hour or so you spent on training and trying to shoot and retrieve a duck is lost forever from your life, so that one duck means a lot.

AND when you call the manufacturer to tell them it was defective, 'customer service' (what a misnomer) requires YOU to pay to ship it back to them to fix it or replace it. It's an over sized item and will require a huge box - think of the hassle and expense just to return it to them! So if you pay $119.99 for the bag for example and it falls apart the first time you use it, then you earn the privilege to pay another $40 to ship it back to them and in the end, you still end up with one that will likely fall apart, but now you've paid $160 for it.

Not good when you purchase luggage for travelling and you need to travel.And each time I've finally recieved the peices back the repair work has been of poor quality and in most cases the issue has re-occured first time its used.I've attempted twice to contact the company that reps them in Canada, Holiday, but have not heard back other than that they're experiencing delays in responding to customer complaints.

We all know what happened when each country from Yugoslavia wanted independence, Serbs attacked them. First Slovenia, then Croatia, then Bosnia. Seriously though, Serbs have been trying to stir up trouble in Bosnia from ages ago. Remember what sparked the World War I? A Serbian did, he murdered Franz Ferdinand. Do I need to say more?This movie is just a pathetic attempt from a Serbian to try to cover up what happened. No need for lies, the whole world knows.

It is basically an excuse for the director to show guys getting drunk and shooting off guns in a village in flames at night time, while Yugoslav rock music blares. The relationship between the Serb and Muslim boyhood-friends-turned-enemies should be the crux of the movie but it is never adequately explored.It is no different than every other movie on the Bosnian war, with the exception of No Man's Land. It does not show the geopolitical situation of the time or the machinations of elites but rather assumes the bloodshed was the result of ancient or grassroots ethnic hatreds. Obviously there were \\"ordinary\\" Croatians, Serbians, and some Bosniacs involved in atrocities, but this is only part of the story.I got the feeling that this is the kind of movie made by a director who spent the early 1990s in Germany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Village Pretty Flame","review":"What can I say,I have seen this rank garbage,I find myself in a unique position as a critic.

As a humanitarian worker living the past four years in former Yugoslavia, I was prepared for the outrage and shock essential to a true-life war drama. But I was also hoping for some ennobling message, or a possible glimpse of heroism, beauty, or human kindness. What I found instead was a fragmented and dehumanizing film that left me disgusted with just about everyone around me. The film is unquestionably realistic, but beyond presenting an accurate picture of life, I still expect art to elevate. If I want to see this kind of profanity, I'd do better to save my money and take a walk down the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and dishonest","review":"The movie represents another Serbian propaganda attempt to make the war in Bosnia look like a civil war with equally responsible sides. It tries to hide Serbian atrocities against Bosnian civilians, committed during the Serbian aggression on Bosnia. Bosnians had no weapons to defend themselves against the savagery. The situation in which Serbian forces are hiding in tunnel is even more absurd knowing that Bosnian did not even have weapons. The propaganda attempt falls short of its purpose and comes across more as a farce. Fortunately, history tells us what really happened in Bosnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!","review":"Pretty Village, Pretty Flame provides a rare glimpse and an objective account of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990's. The movie tackles the brutality and complexity of a war that has repeatedly fallen victim to distortion and propaganda by different parties with different agendas (both direct and indirect \\"players\\" with a high stake in the Balkans). The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!

As a huge fan of the Swell Season and Glen Hansard, it means so much more to understand the relationships behind the music and about the musicians themselves than I thought possible. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Warning: This is not a love story, but a story about love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, depressing","review":"I'm a big fan of both Once and the Swell Season. When I saw that there was a documentary about them with rave reviews, I ordered it immediately. While the DVD has some nice concert footage and some insights into their life, it was generally slow-paced, jumpy and rather depressing as their relationship slowly ends. There were such large gaps in the filming sessions that the film lost some of its continuity. One of the big problems for me was that I read so many positive reviews of this documentary, I went into it with very high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"No captioning!","review":"Buyer beware! Even though the product page and the DVD cover itself says the movie has closed captioning, it does NOT. Would not have purchased it had the labeling and identification been correct.

One of the outstanding characteristics of Glen's music has always been emotional honesty. I mena, the man lays it all out there. But this !! Wow, not always pretty to watch , but always compelling.

Yet it isn't shallow, not at all a book that would make you want to scream at the main character. In fact, Maggy is created like a true teenager, with the same thoughts and feelings.The 'poetic' language makes the book have a strange feeling I've never seen in a book before. It's wonderful, but sometimes the sentences go on forever and are hard to understand. The book is fairly short, but it stops at the right moment.I would rate this book Mature for language and sexual content, but it's realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"I give this five stars for otherworldly perceptiveness and the same for a satisfying conclusion. Maggy is literally saved by her art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Young Adults.","review":"This is the first Kathe Koja book I have had the pleasure of coming across, and I can tell any other newcomer here that it won't be my last. I am taking a course in writing literature for children and young adults, and this book is exemplary for kids to read. It teaches so much about the dangers of low self-esteem, but also has a happy resolve for two of the characters, Maggy and Marianne. It also reminds me of my younger days when I was so much like Maggy and thinking that flirting with danger was \\"cool.\\" What Koja's book teaches young people is that you can never be careful or confident enough not to get hurt but, if you're smart, you will learn from your mistakes and there is no seemingly overpowering person who can take you away from yourself unless you allow them to. A really good, fascinating story that draws you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. If Cole's lines weren't so hokey and old, you might fall for him through Maggy's eyes too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blue Mirror","review":"The Blue Mirror by Kathe Koja is short but it is still a great book. Despite its shortness it holds great details and an even better story. Maggy is your somewhat average teenager, she doesn't like school and she hates being stuck at home, but the catch is that her mother is a alcoholic. The only part of school that she dose enjoy is art. When she does go to school during all her classes she would draw a different world inside her drawing book which she named the Blue Mirror. She dubbed her drawing pad after her favorite downtown caf?, the Blue Mirror. One day while at the Blue Mirror she meets Cole. Maggy is fascinated by Cole and the two girls that follow him, Jouly and Marianne. Maggy life is changed forever when Cole tells her that he loves her, but is he really what she sees him as or is he something else. You'll find out soon if you read this because once you start it, you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D Chainsaw","review":"Purchased this for my nephew. He is 4 and loves it.

My critique is that I wished for better \\"how-to's\\". This is a compilation of pages and suggestions from the scrappers who made the pages, and their stories are interesting.

Comic book art should, by defintion, be exagerrated and cartoonish, in order to have a more immediate visual impact. The artists featured in this excellent collection - Kirby, Ditko, Byrne, et al - represent some of the finest artists to ever work in the field of comics.The stories are wonderfully imaginative, the characters seem as real as people I know, and the narratives are gripping.

With the exception of a couple of the stories being more mainstream (i.e.: The Monkey's Paw, Wendigo), most are relatively fresh, though dated, to today's horror genre. Though most of the stories are dated in their writings, due to the era in which they were initially written, they still have the timeless horror-attraction, able to get your attention and hold it. Overall, truly world-class horror stories...but not too scary to read aloud to a boyscout troup, or a children's sleepover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"If you are new to candle magic or even a seasoned wiccan or pagan this is a must for your collection.

I had heard from many readers whose opinions I highly respect, that Thompson novels were apexes of noir literature. Maybe. But The Grifters certainly isn't. It has the tasty cheesiness of a mid-century crime noir, but lacks any characterization that make a story compelling.I closed the novel recalling this about the plot: criminal meets woman. Criminal's mother doesn't like woman. One woman kills the other. Queue twist, and scene. This isn't something worth praising.I'll definitely try another Thompson novel, as I respect close friends who adore his work, but the next one had better be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and boring - a crime for Thompson","review":"For some reason, The Grifters is not as interesting to me as it is a lot of people. I can't really put my finger on it, but the novel is quite boring, which is unusual for Thompson. It is also littered with repulsive characters. Of course, Thompson's books feature psychopaths, but the nuts are uniformly interesting, funny, and, ironically, nice. In The Grifters, there are no such characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp and Real","review":"Author Jim Thompson (1906-77) catches the flavor of grifting with this crisp tale set in Los Angeles in the late 1950's. The main character is Roy Dillon, a young salesman and short-con operator a bit too soft for this line - he nearly dies from a beating when caught short-changing a cashier. Actually, Roy is merely a babe compared to his older-and-wiser girlfriend Moira Langtry and gun-toting mother Lilly. Moira emerges as a manipulative long-con artist seeking a new partner, while Lilly is a still-attractive toughie who places large bets for the mob at racetracks. Each character works their angles, seeks to manipulate, and conceals a few things too. The story has compelling friction between the characters including some sexual tension between Roy and his mother. This is be pulp fiction, but a gripping read.This book is worth a look, as is the nicely-cast 1990 movie starring John Cusack (Roy), Annette Benning (Moira) and Angelica Huston (Lilly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This cd is completely overrated but should be bought if it can be had for a cheap price (like a used copy).

The story has a few too many twists to be plausible but the style has the stark urgency that made Welles famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Welles' Best Film!!","review":"Lady From Shanghai is an excellently mysterious movie. It is very similar to an Alfred Hitchcock film. Welles has an Irish accent that at first seems unnecesary, but emphasises the unique role he plays as a naive, but buff sailor. He becomes entangled in the deadly web of the woman he loves, the fatal Rita Hayworth. I find this movie to portray Welles at his finest and most handsome hour! I definatly recomend this movie to any Orson Welles fan stuggeling to find a movie where Welles is not only a good actor but a hotty to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wellesian Filmmaking at Its Most Delirious","review":"\\"The Lady from Shanghai\\" (1948) flaunts its cinematic iconoclasm from beginning to end. Defying Hollywood tradition, director-star Orson Welles creates a nightmarish charade. Since Orson's Irish sailor remains as unconvincing as Rita Hayworth's femme fatale, \\"The Lady from Shanghai\\" can be viewed as a distorted, fun-house parody of classic film noir. Modern-day critics who bemoan the confused plotting and bizarre motivations never acknowledge the stream-of-consciousness framework established by Welles' tongue-in-cheek narration. There is a method to this chaos. Marked by abrupt shifts in tone and locale, the film becomes a never-ending series of jolts - culminating in the legendary \\"hall of mirrors\\" shootout. Despite studio interference, the wildly uneven \\"Lady from Shanghai\\" is delirious Wellesian bravura with an undercurrent of paranoia and despair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acapulco in the 1940's","review":"Welle's pseudo-Irish accent and a homosexual undercurrent between two other characters are just two of the problems that complicate a flimsy and ultimately unbelieveable plot.

However; if you are looking for inspiration and the \\"why\\" rather than the \\"how\\" then this is the book for you.I literally read this book from cover to cover and just like a good novel, found it to be a page-turner. Nick Bantock takes the reader through the various types of ephemera and the reasons he chose the techniques used to produce his thought (and emotion) provoking works. I was absolutely enthralled and found my own muse stimulated to produce works of my own.Granted this book does not give step-by-step directions for creating the effects demonstrated, but isn't that part of the attraction of our chosen medium; the discovery of new techniques and processes that result in the look, feeling, and thoughts we are trying to convey?For true collage and assemblage artists this is an absolute must have.

It's not a step by step guide, or a how-to on collage, but more of a peek into the life and art of Mr. Bantock.It's a delightful journey filled with lovingly collected ephemera, rubber stamps, odd bits and pieces that come with a story, or are waiting for Nick to create a story with them.The book is written in a casual chatty manner which makes it an easy read, but at the same time he is explaining his process forcreating some of the gorgeous art he has done over the years. If you're looking for a how-to book, or a Griffin & Sabine novel, you're not going to find it here. This is a far more personal book and fans of Mr. Bantock's art will love having a closer look at the way he thinks and works.Buy it, read it, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Bantock but not a step-by-step book","review":"I enjoyed Urgent 2nd Class because it was put together by Nick Bantock, who charmed me with the Sabine series and the Artful Dodger and others too numerous to mention. His images are multilayered and artful. He does talk about how some images were made (ephemera, Bantock-designed rubber stamps) but he does not show you step by step how to accomplish any particular image. And his ephemera may not be available to the average person. He does by from dealers in Vancouver BC, giving him an advantage over those in small towns.This is not a shortcoming, however, if you have other books that show you the construction and layering of stuff. The beauty of Bantock lies in his imagination, his imagination. He does encourage the reader to use their own, and that's a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"God and Mammon","review":"According to the author, at least so I surmise, the Catholic Church is now no more than a huckster for the crass Anti-Christ materialism and vulgarity of the West. Who are the prime sources for this 'Catholic' writer? the Protestant materialist von Mises and the materialist Jew Murray Rothbard--their opinions on this are of no value. Nowhere are statements from many popes condemning capitalist morality (or lack thereof). And to deny that the Faith has no business in judging the white-collar criminals or their political whores in deranging the country and looting it for their own greed and amorality is tantamount to right-wing Marxism. Let me be quite clear on this: No Christian of any integrity should give their allegiance to our Anti-Christ economy and the government of paid lackeys that panders to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 yr old loves it","review":"Bought this for my son in 2nd grade.

They have been restored with nu-metal crunchy guitar rockers, and post-grunge Creed-like ballads (SHINE, could be a Creed song). This album is nothing compared to Buckcherry.

It is and always will be up there as one of the greatest kinds of thrasing/heavy rock in it's time. But Josh Todd just got gay. I don't like the title, and the songs are weak. Don't waste your time if you're looking for more of a Buck Cherry feel. It's all but dead. Dissapointing.

Highlights include \\"Don't let your Deal go down\\", and \\"Yankee's Revenge\\" for some great picking, the touching instrumental \\"Sheebeg and Sheemore\\", along with \\"Spanish Johnny\\" perhaps the best song on the album, and a great Live rendition of \\"As years go passing by\\".

The few photographic techniques mentioned were not adequately explained, and not one photograph was explained in complete detail. Then there was the awful \\"capture a sea turtle\\" segment - again, no photgraphic commentary. The viewer might get some artistic ideas from watching it, but the same would result from about an hour of surfing the web.

It lasted about 36 hours and was very difficult to control with anti-diarrheal medications. I was extremely dehydrated and it felt like I was preparing for a colonoscopy. Definitely check with your doctor before using this product and I would even suggests starting with smaller doses so that you can see how your body will react."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I think what it boils down to is that Venapro works magic for some folks and wastes the money of others. I found it affordably on Amazon and thought that the good reviews overrode the bad and so tried it out. It has been over two weeks with ZERO results. My condition isn't what you would call severe, just inconvenient. At the same time I began taking Venapro, I also enacted some lifestyle changes: drinking lots of water, taking a fiber supplement, icing the area, using Tucks pads, taking ibuprofen to reduce swelling, and eating healthy foods. Even after all of this, I still have not noticed a difference. Maybe I am just a tough case, and like I said, maybe Venapro is a life saver for some folks. Just not for me.

Until I saw this book. It's simplicity and beauty grabbed me and in a completly non-intimidating way brought me into the world of magic. It touched on the basics of so many of my questions, such as the history and differences of various forms of witch craft, the definitions and meanings of many elements of magic and a starting knowledge of the practicing wiccan. This wonderful book has left me actively and confidently pursuing more knowledge. I look forward to reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sendero Espiritual","review":"Encontrar la palabra del Maestro El Morya, la radiaci��n de la Voluntad de Dios en persona, moviliza a cualquier senderista.

I maxed out the memory with a 32 MB module, so graphics as well as text print fine. Works fine with my Macs running OS X at home. Fast and excellent quality output. Prints envelopes easily with hand fed front slot. Some express concerns about separate toner and drum replacement and associated costs, but drum life appears to be fairly long. I am quite satisfied with this unit at two months of home use with a few hundred sheets printed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic laser printer.","review":"Purchased this printer refurbished....a bit hesitant, but everything works fine and there's a full one year warranty.Printer is a bit deeper than normal due to the paper tray sticking out the back, so it makes a bit larger footprint than some other models.The first page takes a few moments to get started, but once going the print speed is fine for this level of printer.Product registration / information / set-up all are easy and seem to be great.Memory is the only issue...the standard 2MB is fine for text, but if you're going to be printing a lot of black & white pictures or graphics, you would definately need to upgrade the memory. Not really an issue for me, though. It will still print the graphics, just at a lower resolution.Otherwise, very happy w/ this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds Expectations","review":"I would highly recommend this printer. For the price, you can't beat it. Set up was super easy, the pages look great and it's relatively quiet.My only knock is that there doesn't seem to be a way to do a wireless set-up without using a proprietary Brother adapter or router. (I did some research - enough to be disheartened.) And I so wanted to use an Airport Express, but there doesn't seem to be a way to make it work with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Laser Printer","review":"The rebuilt model was cheaper than replacing the drum on my existing Brother laser printer, which lasted for five years of daily use. What a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"longest lasting printer i've ever purchased!","review":"Okay, I know this thing is no longer being made but I figured I'd write a review for it anyway. I've had mine since 2004 and it's worked solidly the entire time. Hell, I'm still on my original ink cartridge! I've gone through complete printers in 2 years so getting anything resembling a year for ink use is amazing to me. Let alone 7+!! So my ancient looking Brother 1440 keeps chugging away and I haven't had to shop for another printer since its arrival. How sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother HL 1440 Laser Printer","review":"I have used this laser printer since 2003. I print about 150 pages per month. In all that time, I have had one paper jam and I use the cheapest paper I can find. ThoughI have used two toner cartridges but there is no sign of drum wear.I would not hesitate to buy a remanufacturedBrother 1440. I might add that Brother is just great about answering technical questions fast and free,despite the fact that I bought the machine four years ago. The only down side is the machine's size."},{"rating":"2","title":"HL-1440 good and easy","review":"The Brother HL-1440 is inexpensive, easy to use and fast. The only down side is the the replacement drum is expensive to replace, but I bought a refurbished one that also comes with a cartridge for less than $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed product","review":"I Have worked with two of these printers, one at work and a second i later purchased for the home. Both printers after about a year required the purchase of a new drum assembly, which costs as much as the printer. The drum becomes defective, it streaks the output. Customer service was no help, and refused to acknowledge that this is a common problem. I have read on other boards people having the same experience. I still use mine, but not for anything that needs to look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the refurbished one~","review":"The toner went out very very fast.

It was a compaq with 500mHZ and 40 gb and a single cd drive (i put a writer in) and a floppy of course. However 3 weeks ago the cd drive quit working, and her modem went out. The Floppy also went out. So i went shopping on Amazon. I found this. I knew it would be true to my Mom for years to come. I ordered it, i set it up. It went VERY slow for 2100 mHZ. My mother loves it. It does OF COURSE go faster then her 500mHZ old computer. But it still ran really slow. It ran at the speed of my sisters computer, 900mHZ. It surprised me. The gb is awesome. however if you are a person who is constantly using computers. Especially gaming.

I loved it, and have read it several times. The concepts involved in beneficial parasites, light and energy beings, and the ability to transform oneself from one thing to another, continued to enthrall me. The real mindblower though was the thought of what could happen if reproductive cycles were voluntary and completely in the hands of women. It made one consider what else might change in a society if the rules were flip-flopped. Fascinating concept to consider. The only drawback I could find with this book was it's lack of a sequel, or better, it's continuation as a series. What else might Juanita Coulson have come up with?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced","review":"I have read this book over and over again. I am just caught up in the characters which are unique and have a tantalizing rapport with each other. I only wish Ms. Coulson had gone on to write more in this universe of galactic peace Arbiters. The concept of the Ka-Eens, little symbiotic entities that \\"possess\\" their humanoid or alien counterparts is a wonderful idea. The team she puts together in this book really needed to have more missions together, as their characters were just getting started to know each other. The book is fast paced and full of action as well as some humor from the displaced human tossed into the peace negotiations. Her struggle to fit in this new universe is very well done. The only flaw I found was that I wanted a lot more backstory on the Arbiters and their worlds. We only got a brief glimpse of who these guys were, and I have as many questions as the heroine does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute ring","review":"The stone does not look much like the picture (the stone is more translucent), but the ring is still very nice.

Unfortunately, the wider the scope an essay aims to, the more vagueness it risks.Good writing, proper references and sound solutions are not enough to stand out against the equally good tens of publications available about the subject. Like as many of them, it becomes a very elegant source for material to speak ABOUT the work in data warehouse environment (a treasure for slide shows!), or that can be very useful to present the whole of it to a beginner, but carrying out an actual development is a different matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Perspectives on Tough Topics","review":"I enjoyed this book. We all hear about tough issues, but this book goes further and offers insightful opinions and sound advice. The format of the book makes it very easy to read. It's an interesting peek into the tough little realities that lurk inside data warehousing projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I specifically ordered an IBM 80 GB HD, I needed one that was specifically not a Western Digital brand as it was a replacement for a hard drive in an Avio Editting machine.

The pictures, which were supposed to explain what certain things look like, were so unclear that you couldn't tell what they were. In some cases, the pictures were faded so much so that they didn't look like a picture at all. For us, the book is pretty much unusable and a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for MP3 users","review":"Wife bought the product as a present. Unit couldn't read any mp3 cds (from different brands) nor could it read any cds created via Windows Media or other brand cd burning software. It was simply useless as a product for non-commercially created CDs. My car has a much older CD-player that could read the Windows Media-created disc....Just a pathetic product, IMHO.

Worse yet, her spirited guardian kept prodding her to fight for Seth Caldwell's love. Bedeviled by an angel, befuddled by kids, and bedazzled by a rancher, Maeve could only pray for the strength to claim a love that was made in paradise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story","review":"Maeve, a woman of the 80's is sent back in time to find the one man who perfectly complete's her.

Amazon must have worked out whatever problem the other reviewers were complaining about.So many times this book has settled debates at my workplace over which artist did what song or what year a song came out.This latest edition has many updates and additional information.

I recommend fully.Any bad comments? Only published once every 4 years.

I am not sure why the lecturer dressed as if she were going to a presidential inaugural ball.

This, plus the large scale, makes it difficult to 'take in' all of California at once. I would have preferred it to show the entire state on one side, and the index and everything else on the other side, but that's just me. The coverage goes far enough east to Las Vegas.

Not explained well, a lot of the data is incorrect anyway and general assumptions are made without proof to back them. A lot seems to be the author's opinion rather than actual fact, and in a technological industry, you really need to prove your statements. Technical people will buy this to learn from, so will need more than just opinions to implement security in their networks. I didn't feel that I got a good step-by-step walkthrough of how to fully secure our network--many options and tools are presented but mainly the book leaves you paranoid that you cannot fully protect your company. I liked Hacking Exposed better because it was less general and left me with fewer decisions and questions.

It has great coverage and it's easy to keep clean. It has never gotten smelly, like some other bibs I have tried. It dries quickly after machine washing. Very well-made and durable material that does not leak through. Also a consideration is that it's American-made and does not contain PVC, vinyl, or other chemicals of concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bib!","review":"Good bib. The bib protects the shirts from food. The crumb catcher isn't a good as a scoop bib, but it's worth it since all the shirts don't end up stained. The bib can be a little challenging to tie on a wiggly toddler with long hair. Overall great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Bib","review":"These bibs are amazing! I bought two of them for my 13 month old daughter. It is perfect for this time of year because it saves me so many stained/ruined sleeves from eating. It wipes off so easily and drys extremely fast. One big thing I love is that they don't get an odor. I have other similar bibs that would get this awful smell any time they got wet. They machine wash great too. I have bought several more to give as gifts. They may seem a little pricey, but totally worth it. They are the only bibs I put her in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But could be better","review":"Pretty good bib. It works well at keeping my sons sleeves clean, but I did find a different long- sleeved bib I like better. I prefer the version that has Velcro rather than tie strings and the elastic around the ends of the sleeves on this bib make it a little bit more difficult to get on a less than cooperative baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"At first I wasn't sure if it will fit my son because there's no size chart.

Returning product and making our own bib out of a used tent.Sorry, Bumkins, your product design in nice and the pattern is fun, but the material with lead is a no,no for us. We don't like sending products back to Amazon and blame the seller or the company.Lead has to go, but not to dinner with us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bibs, great protection","review":"Overall, we are quite happy with these bibs. We have three of them, and use them daily. They are very waterproof, and the long sleeves are great for keeping clothes clean. Additionally, they have cute/fun patterns that we enjoy.However, I do have a couple of complaints:1) Durability - Some of the bibs are holding up better than others, but in general they are starting to fall apart on the stitching in some places on the edges, especially on the back where the tie is.2) Size - Our daughter is in the 95% for height/weight. Yet, these bibs have a bit over-sized neck hole, making it difficult to tie the bib around the neck tight enough to keep food from getting on the neck of her shirts. In order to tighten them with a sufficiently small opening for the neck, we end up pulling the material itself into the knot in the back, rather than ust the tie strings themselves. This obviously contributes to the degradation of the stitching around the ties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Big","review":"I ordered this in my daughter's size months ago and she still hasn't grown into it.

It's not the stiff plastic that gets creased and terrible looking after a few uses. Sleeved bibs are GENIUS and have saved my kids' clothes.

It's a bit difficult to get two squiggly 8 month olds to let me get their arms in the sleeves, but that's not the bib's fault. I love the lightweight fabric, and the fact that it's PVC-vinyl-BPA free and washable. We've really only had to toss it into the washing machine a couple of times. Most of the time, a quick once-over with a wipe works just fine. Would recommend to parents of messy eaters like ours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this bib!","review":"this bib is great. it really helps make clean up so easy. now that my 18 mo old is becoming more independent and wanting to feed herself, the highchair and her clothes would be a total mess after a meal. now i just take the bib off and wash the tray. it has saved me so much time and laundry! plus the fact that its a tie back vs velcro means that it stays on for good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bib","review":"I received a size 6-24 months and it fits great on my 11 month old and it still has space for her to grow into. I like the elastic on the cuffs, and it ties on the back for those whose babies rip their bibs off them like mine... Will have to wait to see how much this one lasts with my LO. Looks like a good product so far. I give the product 4 stars since one of the ties has a bit of loose stitching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves clothes time and again!","review":"I love these bibs. They are thick, waterproof, and easy to wipe off in a snap. I originally had a bunch of all different kinds of bibs, but now I primarily just use these. They've fit my now two year old since he was 8-9 mos old. They offer MUCH better coverage, easier clean-up for re-use between full-washes, and are adorable to boot! (I love Keith Haring).My only slight complaints would be 1) I wish the pocket opened a bit more (and wasn't sewn in the middle in order to allow this to happen), and 2) I wish the collar laid a bit better when on. If my son is eating sauces or something \\"drippy\\" (like fruit), even with the bib on, he almost always gets food around his collar. don't get me wrong, that's still MUCH better than all over his belly and sleeves though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good bib.","review":"I like this bib and really want to love it. The sleeves are great and easy on and off. The material is durable and machine or sink washable. The print is cute. BUT it is too big on the neck for my 13 month old. She is small for her age but not that small that she shouldn't fit a product with age/size range 6-24 months. Because of the slick material there is no way to tighten it past a certain point. So it does a great job of protecting her pants and her sleeves but food gets in between the bib and her chest. So if your child is thin this product is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Purchase","review":"We bought the blue one after realizing how often we were using our pink one. Great coverage for messy meals, and not too tight. The elastic cuffs mean that the sleeves don't have to be the perfect length, no rolling necessary. Our baby has been using these bibs from ages one to almost two. She likes the patterns and colors. I wish the neck clcosure was velcro instead of tie, but if you want to throw it in the laundry and then hang dry, it won't catch on other soft items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bumkins long sleeve bib","review":"Great bib, but wonder why they don't use velcro at the neck like with their sleeveless bibs? It takes a little bit of effort to get the sleeves on, and by this time, the baby is squirming, and resists the bib being tied- velcro would be so much easier. Also, fabric is a little stiff until washed, but it is wonderful for it's waterproofing! All in all, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"too small","review":"It has a good quality and cute color but it is too small for my son, he is only 2 years only,so I recommend it to the baby who is under 18m"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely small","review":"I ordered two of these bibs for my 2 year old granddaughter. She is on the small side and the bibs were too tight for her. On the package the pic shows children around 3 or 4 years old wearing them. I looked on the web site and no where on the site is there a size option. I would not have ordered them if I had known how small they are. They are truly for infants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewer, it is easy to clean after each meal. I only wish it is a bit longer to cover the entire lap area, so I gives it 4 stars instead of 5. It is light weight enough that you can use it during warmer days, just put it on right over whatever your child is wearing. I tried some other bib that has a fleece front, it was just way too warm even the room temp was only 69 degrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love the material. It's waterproof but not stiff. Feels like windbreaker material with some coating on the inside. My little girl is 9 months old and she eats and makes a huge mess. She can't get it off either! I wipe the high chair and her hands then take the bib off- she doesn't have any food on her clothes! I hand wash the bib in the sink and let it dry. It dries quickly and is ready for the next meal. I've been using it for a month and only needed to throw it in the laundry once. It washed well. I let it air dry. It is seriously incredible. I wish I had it for baby #1 but I honestly just took his clothes off and fed him in his diaper. I had time for it. Baby #3? Not so much. Buy this. You will LOVE it. Buy it for someone else and they will LOVE you for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! These bibs are amazing!!!","review":"I thought the regular Bumkins bibs were great, and then I got these! With cold weather came long sleeves and I was tired of pulling my 17 month old daughter's sleeves up, which only sort of worked anyway - she is a messy eater and getting into a defiant stage. These have been wonderful! No liquid soaks through, and the sleeves fit well so they drag in the food and are not cumbersome. The fabric is lightweight and breathable. We even used them with her formal Thanksgiving dress and, as usual, not a single drop or stain on her outfit. Now if they just made something for the hair and face! Hahaha!

It is true to size, has a handy pocket that catches spills, and has saved countless outfits from stains.

Heavy-duty, water/spill proof, sturdy stiching, easy to clean, a nice big pocket, and one of my favorite features is the elastic edges on the sleeves that helps keeps shirt-sleeves clean. We've purchased a few of these Bumkins bibs and have loved every one - they are made to last and look great on top of being very functional. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the price - I do think they could do a little better in that department."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleved bib","review":"I have purchased several Bumkin waterproof bibs, one of them is the long sleeve one in yellow color. i must admit i purchased yellow robot one because it was cheaper than other colors, but when it arrived i realized that the quality is not the same as the sleeveless blue colored bibs i purchased earlier. material is rough, it feels cheap and almost scratchy. i regret not spending few more $ and purchasing a different color which i am assuming would have been a better quality product as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bib","review":"This bib fits my daughter very well.

My son is at the 90% height/weight and the sleeves were probably twice as long as his arms. There was no way I could close the back of it tight enough so that it would fit without his arms slipping inside and out the bottom. This will probably be useful in a year or so, but definitely not useful for a 6 mo old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as described! No velcro as described for this pattern","review":"I have not used it yet on my 15mth old. I bought this particular one because this one said it had a velcro closure in the back instead of the tie.

Now maybe I'll use this bib more when she's a messy self feeder but the Baby Bjorn is perfect....not too stiff for her neck and she ignores it. Get that one. Better and cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I found this bib to be very hard to get on/off. The material has no give and makes it hard when you have a squirming child you are trying to get it on. I also found that after several washing mold started to develop inside the pocket area.

I thought that a lot of the events in the first part of the book, absorbing as they are, were just memoir, giving us insight into what made Vivienne the person she is, but everything is tied neatly together in the exciting climax. Very satisfying. And so much ambience to revel in--the rarefied atmosphere of eighteenth-century Paris, the taste-of-the-forbidden clubs in New York City, and the dark underside of New Orleans. Lastly, but maybe most important, I was captivated by Vivienne--her spirit, her intelligence, and her great capacity for love. Fans of Tanya Huff, Laurell K. Hamilton, and Anne Rice will definitely enjoy this book, and it works well as a standalone, so even if you haven't caught up with Taylor's chronicles of Deirdre Griffin, dive right in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain stupid","review":"Now don't get me wrong, this book would've been great if it focused on a plot of some sort rather than the half-autobiography, half-totalcrap thing it did.

Taylor doesn't pay attention to detail very well i've noticed. Things just kinda happen randomly.

Granted, as someone else pointed out, these Salieri pieces are not an ideal choice for Bartoli, which explains some of the discomfort, but there is no way to excuse the vocalization that permeates the entire disc.Sadly, this is a recording that should never have been released, and is a mockery of what the bel canto voice used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Quality?","review":"Has anyone been bothered by the poor sound quality of this disc? The orchestra is thin, Baroli's voice harsh, and the ambiance constricted? It sounds almost like some dolby or noise reduction system distortion is happening.

That's not the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"There is not much to say about this album. The music is most revealing and long overdue on CD and public exposure however the Bartoli performances marr any semblance of beauty and elegance that Salieri carries in his composition. Let us hope that another artist will take on the musical presentation of these pieces rather than the overwhelming bad production on this disc. I found myself hoping that each track would have less of the Bartoli mannerisms, but sadly that was not to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One powerful, captivating performance after another.","review":"Bartoli writes that she records this album to honor Salieri to help him \\"emerge from the shadow of Mozart and finally accord him the status he deserves.

Sounds like vocal exercises that she's doing. And her coloratura is more laboured and withheld then I've ever heard her before. I suggest that she shouldn't try to sound like \\"A little girl trying on mommy's shoes\\". She needs to stick with songs that are in the Mezzo range, and should't venture out and sing anything higher than the Soprano High B or High C. She could never be Kathleen Battle (despite her reputations and her diva-acting attitude), or Edita Gruberova."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but the voice is ugly","review":"The first aria on this disk is absolutely horrible in execution and painful on the ear. Just listen to the music sample for yourself and tell me if you want to spend money on this disc. CB's cloying mannerisms coupled with her \\"miss piggy-esque\\" vocal pyrotechnics barely conceal the obvious fact that her voice is thin, strained at the top, and steely to the point that that it has become ugly. Buy her earlier discs to discover the marvel that she once was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava Cecilia!","review":"I have been waiting for a long time for this cd to come out, and I got it the first thing in the morning today. Wow, I was not disappointed. It has every thing - the ostentatiously ornamented rondos, the long, heart-broken lamentations, to the jocundly playful sobrette ballads. Of course, Bartoli's singing is impeccable and nearly perfect: her characterization of the roles are supreme - from the innocent peasant girl to the noble Rinaldo. But what surprise me the most is how original Salieri's music is. Very refreshing and very distinct from other 18th century composer, perhaps even more so than Mozart's music. Of course, I know the musicologists and Bartoli purposely picked the pieces that stand out above others. Overall, the cd is full of surprises and delight. . . and also, it's Bartoli!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm down!","review":"I have only seen the French version, but be aware that this CD-ROM is not as \\"visual\\" as you might expect.

Once here, these men were to operate an \\"extensive campaign against the United States to disrupt the production of tanks and airplanes and blow up bridges and railroads.\\" Luckily for America, the Germas sent probably the most inept group of spies that was ever assembled, dooming this mission from the start.

Depeche mode's sequence of fame began in 1981 where they started off as an electronical band and then slowly fell into pop and then into rock and roll and then into their own realm of music genre procedeing ULTRA. Depeche Mode 101 is probably one of their most exciting and watchable video compositions. If your looking for Depeche mode music videos, this is not the DVD. You want to get the Depeche Mode 86>98 DVD. If your looking for old school Depeche Mode 81>86 then you want to get Depeche Mode Some Great Videos DVD. As for 101, if you get into Depeche Mode, you will eventually want to buy this.

The symbolism and the moral message of the film are applicable to today: money, power & sex. Not necessarily in that order. In my opinion, Father Rake was in dire need of lithium. The fact the word pregnant was used in an early 1960's film dropped my jaw. I would love to read the book, but I have not been able to find a copy. This is not much of a review.

Customer service was outsourced to India and was horrible in every aspect even when I did manage to get through to someone. Their warranty policy required me to pay for shipping and included some mail delay times, so I decided to junk this router and go with a Belkin like some of the network guys had suggested in their reviews. My Belkin has been flawless so far and it provides much greater flexibility in setting up my wireless network and security settings. Save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from this product.

Poor all around for someone who is an intermediate when it comes to computer repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY!","review":"i bought this router hoping to get signal range improvement overmy current belkin 54g router. i tested the router and had no improvement at all. in fact ,this router in no way has 1000% better coverage as marketed by netgear than my regular g router.trust me this is not even close to being true. my house is about 3000 sq ft.,so large but not enormous.there appears to be firmware problems as well. if you have a mixed b and g devices environment like i so (old laptops and g wireless media servers) the performance is awful . very slow. my son tried to do some gaming off of his laptop and it would freeze.cnet did some tests in a mixed b anf g environment and performance dropped greatly compared to an all g environment.so be warned if you have a mixed group like i do.this is not the router for you.wait for a good n router"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over 1 year and still problematic.","review":"I had this router for over a year.I have been working through Netgear since January 05 trying to solve the problem of my internet connection peridically dropping. I have tried a sheet full of possible solutions. The Netgear support tech told me it was probably a hardware problem and I should send it back for replacement as it was under warranty. When I called Netgear they refused to replace it because it was not under warranty anymore! I bought it last June (04) started having problems 7 months later (under warranty) and was finally told in July to replace it, but it was no longer under warranty. I will never buy from this company again.I have since switched to the Linksys WRT54GS and have had no problems what so ever. No dropped connection and excellent wireless coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big mistake","review":"This thing loses connectivity almost every day. Your PC tells you no signal. The only solution is to reboot the router, which means cycling the power. With no switch on the unit you have to disconnect and reconnect the power line. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, worse customer service","review":"This product lasted for about a month before one of the four ports failed and had to be returned to the company. In the short period of time that I owned it, it worked very poorly. Although the setup was easy, the range was poor with a useful range of less than thirty feet. I spent several hours on technical support with less-than-knowlegeable people trying to resolve the problem of poor range and apparent interference. After exchanging the product for a new one (at the recommendation of tech support people), I had the same problem. A few weeks later, one of the ports failed and technical support directed me to return the product to Netgear. I returned it three months ago and have not received the unit back nor have I heard a word from the company. This is a bad product from a company with poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product!","review":"I wanted to upgrade from my Linkysys wireless B network to wireless G. Netgrear was rated highly by PC World, and the price was right so I purchased the WGR614 router and a Netgear wireless G ethernet bridge. I could not get the bridge to communicate with the router nor could I get it to communicate with the Microsoft wireless G card in my 2nd PC. Called Netgear tech support and the individual could not resolve the problem, so I was told that 2nd level tech support would call me in 24 hours! Guess what? No callback. After fiddling with this junk for two days, I decided to request a return and buy Linksys wireless G equipment. Their tech support is offshore also, but at least they will help you and not make you wait for them to call back after days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"The router was simple enough to set up and use, and the feature set is attractive. I purchased this for my parents' home, in which they have 2 PCs and a Playstation 2. Wireless features work very well around the two story house. The problem lies in attempting to one of the PS2 games. After almost exactly 20 minutes online, the PS2 is disconnected by the router. This is a very odd issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap. Huge disappointment.","review":"Bought this a month ago.. started having problems with dropped and slow as hell connections after a few weeks of using it. The unit gets really hot even though I have it in an open space. I shouldn't have to intall a fan just to get this P.O.S. to work. I should have listened to prior reviews.Your 40 bucks is better invested into a stable router that actually does its job. Don't be fooled by a cheap price and nice case design if it DOESN'T WORK right.Never Netgear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheats if you use more than 2 ports","review":"This product has a big problem with overheating. I solved it for a while by switching out the power supply for a lower voltage (I know, it surprised me that this worked too). At any rate, it worked great for the first 90 days or so, but it's not a good long term investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to work after one year","review":"It worked well until a little bit after a year --- their warranty time. Called them but was told that if the wired part works, the wireless should work too. I used it as a wired router then for another 4 months. And the wired connection is now getting intermittently interrupted. It's a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Something Else!","review":"Purchased what seemed like a good wireless router, but eventually the performance dropped, pages timed-out etc. I scoured the internet, but found that my particular model, the v4, has persistent problems, and neither the company nor anyone else had a fix for it. Eventually I replaced it with a Linksys WRT54GS. Not a problem since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops Connection every 5 min","review":"I have this router for over an year now and as the time progressed, the router's performance has deteriorated. As of today, it drops connection every 5 minutes. I have heard similar complaints from my co-workers about this router.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother with this router","review":"I consider myself somewhat sophisticated when it comes to setting up wireless routers. This one is a waste of time and might leave you very frustrated. After several attempts, the CD only got me so far. No troubleshooting available. And if you want to call a number for customer service, they'll charge you a fee!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"Internet stops working once in a while for both corded and wireless connections. Turing the router off and back on solves the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for Macs","review":"My household uses this router to wirelessly connect to two Mac laptops and a Nintendo Wii. It was extremely simple to set up, and we have had no major issues since. Connection speeds are generally quite good even one or two rooms away, although if you are all the way across the house there is a bit of a slowdown, but nothing major. We have had the router for over a month and we have never had any issues with a dropped signal or inability to connect. Several of our friends have brought their laptops to our house and are able to connect within seconds. Overall, I am very happy with both the price and quality. Also, I know that there is always a bit of a question about compatability of routers with Macs, but like I said, we are a Mac household and have had no troubles."},{"rating":"1","title":"For once the bad reviews were right.","review":"The product is fairly easy to install, though the interface is a little quirky. Wireless option is turned off by default. Starting it isn't as simple as clicking a button. The button is there but you can't click it. I had to go through the awful \\"Smart\\" Wizard to get it to enable the Wireless capability.Once setup, I was pleased to find out that my company VPN was able to connect. The problem is the range. I have an old Belkin 802.11 B WAP and the range is better with that than this router/WAP combo. I moved my laptop out of the office where it's located and the strength drops to almost half while when I test it with my old WAP, the strength barely flickers. I move it to the next floor and I lose all connectivity while I still have about 75% strength connecting to the old WAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS AND CRAPY PRODUCT-DO NOT BUY","review":"Netgear product really sucks. Do not buy any products form NEtgear. There are thousands of users of this product and all compalins about dropping network connections. And to top that off, they charge shipping to replace the router. I would never buy a product from Netgear again. The products are unreliable and really crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their products have no warranty.","review":"Contrary to their claims, their products have no warranty at all (unless you pay for it). I have a 2 year old gateway router that had a 5 year warranty that stopped working one day so I called their tech support. The tech support person told me that since the product is over 90 days old and they do not manufacture it anymore, then I would have to contact their pay tech support line to get an RMA. If they are able to fix the problem over the phone line, then they will charge me, otherwise they will offer me an RMA number for a return. So basically you have to pay to use their warranty. A friend who is a lawyer is currently handling this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly resetting this router","review":"There is something wrong with the DHCP server on this router. Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers. I can be in the middle of surfing, playing games over the net or even mid-download, the DHCP server will attempt to renew and drop the internet connection. The LAN will still be operational, but the internet will suddenly be inacccessible. The support page only offers \\"reset everything...\\" which is ludicrous. A person should not have to constantly return to the router to reset it manually. I end up resetting the router 3-4 times a day.I had a Linksys 802.11b router and gave it away to my brother when I upgraded to G. I seriously regret that now. This Netgear is the most finicky/exasperating router I have ever encountered. I will never buy from Netgear again, and will now spend more money for a new Linksys g rouiter."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 months and died - a far cry from my trusty RT-314...","review":"The sad thing about this is that it's only 6 months old and it went brain-dead while I'm deployed to Afghanistan with the Army. I thought I would have better luck than the dozens of other reviewers that had this router die on them, but I was mistaken. I had a Netgear RT-314 router that ran continuously for nearly 5 years without failing before going wireless with this router, so I'm really bummed that Netgear would produce such a problem-ridden router that so many people are dissatisfied with. I replaced it with a Cisco SOHO 91 to get my family back on line reliably until I return home in 6 months. When the replacement WGR614 comes in I'll just use it as an access point to get rid of the cable I had to run to my son's room, but I'll keep that cable standing by for when the replacement dies in 6 months again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good set of features, unreliable, horrible RMA service.","review":"First of all, I used to be a Netgear fan. WGR614, just like MR814 has the exact set of features I ever needed. Unfortunately, the product died (now it would not even power up - even though I've got a surge protector) a month after I've got it. Shipped it to the RMA center overnight, and haven't got back for three weeks. Keep calling them every other day, and every time they say that the product was on backorder, but they will ship it overnight today. Needless to say, they don't keep their word.Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Netgear support is horrible","review":"I purchased a Netgear WGR614 wireless router 6 months ago and it failed a couple of weeks ago. The unit is locked up and brain dead. This is the second Netgear wireless router I've had that has done this. Netgear will not replace it on warranty unless you talk to tech support on the phone. The catch is, it is damn near impossible (as far as I can tell) to get through. So their 3-year warranty isn't worth crap. Also, the range on this unit, when it was working, was very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy set up","review":"From my experience, the netgear routers are much easier to set up than the linksys routers. Plus setting up MAC authentication is extremely easy in the web based interface.I use this router at school, and I bring it home with me for the breaks even though we have a linksys wireless router at home. The amount of time it takes to plug this one into the internet is so much less than it would take to add me to the linksys router that it's worth toting it around.It's sleek looking, and it has a good setup interface. I love mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor wireless range","review":"I have used my WGR614v3 for 10 months now. the wireless range is very short 15 feet max. I thought it might be theconstruction of our apt. so I brought home a wireless router from the office to test it out. Well, it isn't my apt. but the router. I got 4 times the distance with a different router. I've upgraded all the firmware and tech support is useless. So this router is going in the garbage. It works great wired but wireless range is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought one of these to replace an older Linksys box that was 11b only.Setup was easy, and configurability better than my old Linksys. The box was also nice to look at.The problem is it simply doesn't work reliably. The router would reset itself around every 10 minutes while the wireless connection was in use. Also my network attached printer didn't get served an IP address. After trying all setting combinations and 3 versions of firmware (wasting 4-5 hours) this guy has gone back. For now I'm sticking with the old Linksys."},{"rating":"2","title":"NetGear made it simple","review":"This is my first leap into DSL and my own Wi-Fi. I sat down and installed both, expecting a long, drawn-out \\"simple\\" installation. Well, it worked immediately!

Customer support does not return phone calls or emails. Easily hacked into by anyone with a basic computer understanding, leaving all your confidential information vulnerable. Nothing but a headache, and problem. RUN away fast from any Netgear product.I got a Linksys router and have been very happy with it and my security."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM NETGEAR","review":"I bought this router a few months back and have had MAJOR PROBLEMS.

When playing Starcraft over the internet (multiplayer game) it will have high latency, making a terrible game lag. I contacted netgear support several times and tried every configuration they suggested, it did not work. In the end, I had to return it. It seems that the way it was built can't handle bursts of small packages well. It will probably work well for home network without any high demands (as any other router would, as a matter of fact)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product- Nigtmare Technical Support","review":"WGR614 Router comes in multiple versions, some of which have known problems with many DSL routers. Of course, you won't learn this until you spend 8 hours with Netgear level 1 technical support (outsourced to india). Only after hours of this torture, did they bump me up to level 2 support where after a couple more hours they finally confirmed the device had this known problem. They promised to send me a more reliable version within 5-7 days. Three weeks later, it never arrived & I never heard a word from them, no email, no confirmation, nothing. I gave them one last chance & tried to call back the level 2 support line ... can't... their line is out of order the past couple evenings.Conclusion: DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you're a masochist and need to be punished and humiliated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a few months....","review":"I would encourage you to visit the netgear website and browse their forums for posts on the wgr614 and the 624.

After buying two (2) of the WGR614's (recommended by Netgear)and spending countless hours on hold with Technical Support(India), this Router could never hold a signal and every few hours to every few days needed to be re-set. Set-up was very easy on the Netgear, but having to buy 2 units and both not working, I changed to the Linksys WRT54G and never have had a dropped signal yet. Speed is great, set-up was a breeze and they have US Technical support. Sorry Netgear."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing doesn't work!!!","review":"The set-up seemed to go smoothly, but after using it a week I have had nothing but problems. Just out of the blue it will stop working, then I have to connect directly to the router to try and fix the problem and sometimes it would start working again and sometimes it wouldn't.

I called them back and they walk me through the same set-up and firmware upgrades I've already done. The router worked while i was on the phone (of course). They told me if I still had problems that I could just called back to have it replaced. Of course, one week later the router stops working again, and they never called to check on it so I called on what happened to be the day that was exactly one year from the purchase date (dec 18, 2006 to dec 18, 2007).
