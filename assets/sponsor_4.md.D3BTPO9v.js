The first surprise is that Marriott even attempted another Small Faces reunion, the second is that this fully completed album wasn't released for almost two decades, and the third (perhaps not so surprising to Lane fans) is that this is far superior to Marriott's last four Small Faces/Humble Pie reunion albums. Lane is funny, insightful, and melodic; Marriott is funny, soulful, and rocks. In addition, Mick Green is a terrific guitarist and the whole band is very good. It's a shame Ronnie couldn't play bass, or guitar, and a shame Ian McLagan (touring with the Rolling Stones) and Kenny Jones (touring with the Who) couldn't contribute, but the album offers plenty of fun just the way it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great artists who never got the fame they deserved","review":"Great album, Ronnie Lane is one of my favorites and Steve Marriott could really sing, check out his work in Humble Pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low-calorie, low-fat treat.","review":"A great low-calorie, low-fat treat.

This book is perfect for anyone who wants a volume that is a compilation of a ton of already known quotes, jokes, poems and even a Hallmark greeting card sentiment. There is a lot of the Abraham-Hicks material as well but I would recommend you go straight to Abraham-Hicks to get that. There is some original work in this book but not much. It's really more like the author had a huge file of clippings and put them in a book. It's like it all got dumped in there without much flow. I like an author to take concepts and put their own spin on it but Sharon Warren merely compiled a plethora of other people's concepts - no spin, just two cool little magnets. I would highly recommend any of the Catherine Ponder books, Wayne Dyer books, and the Abraham-Hicks materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I am really enjoying reading this little book, I love the earth magnets they help to keep you focased on how you attract or repel things.

It is cheap and unlocked. It's small and light. The battery life is excellent. You get at least one bar in most places and usually a lot more, so I'm saying it detects a signal very well. Most importantly, no dropped calls as of yet. That's a biggie for me. My motofone f3 dropped calls and that is why I replaced it with this Nokia.If you just want basic features to make/receive calls and text messages, you'll be very satisfied with the Nokia 1600.

Needless to say it didn't work at all in Europe or the Black Sea area and when I contacted Moble, the SIM card company, they told me the phone would only work in the US.

My wife loved it and shipping made it possible to give it to her for X-mas.Thx very much"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and expressive performance","review":"I warmly recommend this recording. It's a very moving performance and the tempos are ideal. Willard White's powerful firm voice provides a commanding and expressive Elijah, and the darkness of his timbre suits the role well. The other soloists are also in good voice, although tenor Arthur Davies sings with less variety of expression than his partners. Choral music is Richard Hickox's specialty and the choir sings with beauty and a full range of expression, although as with recordings of large scale choral works generally, including other performances of Elijah, it would not always be easy to understand the words without the libretto that's included."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible recording of a great piece","review":"Mendelssohn's Elijah is a great piece of music, but this recording does not do it justice. The problem starts at the top, with Willard White's wobbly Elijah. He constantly attacks his notes from below. The sound is mediocre at best, and the tempos are annoyingly slow. Instead, try the new Bryn Terfel recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull with mediocre soloists","review":"Elijah is Mendelssohn's choral masterpiece, ranking with Haydn's Creation and the great oratorios of Handel, but this recording does not do it justice. The LSO and LS Chorus are of course world-class ensembles, but turn out utterly dull and shapeless performances of what should be rousing choruses, and the soloists all seseem to be plagued with intonation problems. Willard White's rough, gravelly voice might appeal to some as the appropriate characterization of the prophet, but the soprano and alto sound as if they had mouths full of marbles, with words barely recognizable, probably will not.Another strike against this recording is the muddy sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo a Figaro!","review":"Terrific cast, with great voices, acting skills and comic timing. I am in love with Alan Titus as Figaro--he is the quintessential Barber of Seville--handsome, a bit cocky, great at scheming and loveable. Beverly Sills is adorable as Rosina. You'll really want her to triumph. Samuel Ramey drips oil as Basilio. Everyone else is great too.Staging and production are great, as is the conducting and orchestra.Rossini's comedy never goes out of style. You will enjoy this production.

I couldn't tell if he had read this book at all (said he didn't want to \\"give away the plot\\"). In any case, it was terrible, awful, trite, and unconnected. Too many characters, with no development. Lots of hints at a Great Hidden Idea, but sorry, it never happened. Really awful writing too. But once I start a book, I'll finish it, no matter how bad. This one was really tough to get through, though. So much so, that I felt obligated to write this review. In retrospect, I tried to change it to one star, but they won't let that happen once you've made a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neural flights, Spiritual heights","review":"Recently finished this mind-expanding epic and am still bristling with intellectual energy. Little potent seeds of revolutionary thought will gradually impregnate your mindscape as you are taken on spiritual/ sci-fi adventures that jump start the soul.

The other products in the box seem okay, but I can't believe selling a new product that has an expiration date three years before it was purchased.

Not the case with Jaded, every track is solid and there is a lot of variety among the tracks so you won't get bored with this one too easily. I would describe the music as rock based with pop and blues influences and Tina Yothers' voice as deep and soulful. Overall a great effort and I hope to hear more from them in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did nothing for my hair.","review":"This product was recommended b/c my hair was a bit dry from coloring.I purchased it and used it.

Hoping this would pouf my hair a bit (don't know why I thought that), I purchased and began using every day. I couldn't tell anything right away, but after a couple of months, my hair was SUPER dry and starting to break. At my next hair appt., I told my hairdresser what I had been using, and she said that any treatment with a lot of protein will do that to hair. Yikes!!

My hair is too fine to use a cream conditioner, yet it needs something after a shampoo to help repair damage and for detangling. CAT is a protein based product rather than a cream based product. Therefore it doesn't weigh down fine hair. It is sprayed on after shampooing and rinsed out after a few minutes. I usually try to avoid rinsing it all out, so it will continue to repair and protect my hair during blow drying and when I am in the sun. It leaves hair feeling really healthy without the weightiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The books in this series are absolutely incredible.

Although Good sets out to do a very mainstream anthropological study, he gets drawn in to the community, and what ensues is a fascinating tale, a touching love story, and hopefully, a major change in people's beliefs about so-called \\"primitive tribes\\". As Good becomes more and more frustrated with the competitive and stuffy world of academia and more connected to his Yanomama tribe, he truly begins to change his life. Remarkable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A whining anthropologist and pedophile","review":"Good goes into the Amazon to a primitive people to measure their food intake and how they acquire it - hunting and gardening. He manages to piss off three different universities that participate in funding his research and then whines that he is broke. He complains about the rules that Venezuela has for access to these primitive people.If you can get past the self-aggrandizement and the whining, you will be appalled at the notion of him accepting the promise of a native 9 year old wife. He eventually impregnates her and moves her to New Jersey where she has no idea of what's going on. The notion that he would go to work when she has a baby or that he would obey a policeman is completely foreign to her experience. She hasn't been taught English. They eventually have more kids and the sad ending is that she goes back to the jungle and he keeps the kids in New Jersey. Talk about unprofessional!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly designed","review":"This rocker is badly designed and cheaply built. For example, it is very uncomfortable to get the baby in and out of it. More importantly, the front handle only holds as long as the hood is in place.

I found myself flipping back and forth to find out who offered such words of wisdom on motherhood.

The new model keeps water and other liquids from spilling into the electrical openings and short-circuiting the system. That's what happened to an older model I had. However, it seems that it takes longer for the large plate to get hot or the pot/pan does not get as hot unless the bottom is actually centered on the plate. I wish the white labels on the knobs did not rub off after only a few times of turning it on and off.

There is no commentary, so you're left reading government documents that are written like stereo instructions. About 60 of the 160 or so pages are tax instructions...basically reprints of the expat equivalent of 1040 instructions. While I haven't checked, these seem like the kind of documents that a) change relatively often and b) can be obtained for free if you need them.Bottom line: This is a good book to have on the shelf as a reference you hope to never have to use. As for providing you with a practical guide to living and working overseas, try something like the Expert Expatriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I've seen regarding this topic!","review":"Wow - so this guy spent the time getting US Government pamphlets and putting them in book form?

It's an amusing way to spend the time. No surprises as to the plot, which could have been recycled from old MacGuyver episodes, and the mysterious clues weren't all that mysterious, but the writing is fun and airy and the two lead characters -- basically the only ones in the book -- are fun cariactures.

I have to admit I was attracted to the description of the book that said the character was a shopaholic that still shopped in the face of danger. Light, right?The book ended up being pretty silly, not very suspenseful, a liitle too light. It may be good for a vacation read where you find you will not be able to concentrate at all, and just need something to fill time on a beach or by the pool. Something with alot of fluff and not much substance. Too much like the bodice rippers I read in my late teens and early twenties with a modern twist.

It's far too disturbing and inappropriate. However, I would recommend that teenagers watch it with some friends. I disagree that the last 22 minutes was the worst. Yes, it was awful, shocking, horrible. But realistic and you will understand why I say that after you google it.So did I like it? No, I didn't.

This 'movie' is basically just a lot of obnoxious footage of 2 irritating teenage girls making YouTube style videos calling each other 'bitches' and 'sluts''. They throw in some fake looking 'news reports' (why can't they ever get the right words at the bottom of the screen that look like the words you see on an actual news report?), and finally the last few minutes shows the fate of these irritating girls which is actually really vile. There's no gore here whatsoever but the final few minutes are vomit-inducing and I really can't believe they allowed this thing on Amazon. Curiosity seekers will get burned badly and won't be able to get some of these sick images out of their heads and TOTAL sicko / psychos now have some new masturbation material. I'm really sorry I even watched this vile crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Simply terrible.","review":"As my title suggests, this movie was terrible. The only good thing about it, is now me and my friends have something to make fun of for a little bit. First of all, how are these actresses supposed to be 14? They were at least 17 or 18. Add their terrible acting to the mix and you've got a terrible movie. The director clearly does not know how teenagers truly act, no 14 year old would be doing hard drugs and kissing other girls. Again, that's more 17 or 18 year olds. And for the last 22 minutes, half of it was just either him digging a hole, or filling said hole up. I do not recommend this movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be Required Viewing !!!","review":"From age 11 on this film should be required viewing! It should be shown in schools. Yes, it is very disturbing because it is realistic. So it may scare and upset some who watch it. SO WHAT?! It might save some lives ! This stuff happens all the time and kids and young adults really really need to watch this and see how easily things like this can and do happen. And could happen even to them. It does not always happen to someone else. Sometimes it happens to YOU! Please be sure to see this and get the kids to watch it too. And really everyone under the age of 60. This is probably the most important film to be made in the history of film making. It is not funny. It is not a joke. It should be taken very much to heart. The world we live in makes this a seriously important film. Don't miss it. Don't let the small children see this . Buy it and save it for when they turn 11 ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Enthralling","review":"the only thing writer/director Michael Goi achieves is making Megan, 100 percent repugnant from the start. You don't care about her because he goes out of his way to present her as the kind of kid who probably deserves a good punch to knock her off her pedestal. Honestly, I was so sick of hearing her speak her petty, self-absorbed yapping, I couldn't wait for her to go missing. This is amateurish trash disguised as an \\"important\\" message movie.The entirety of \\"Megan Is Missing\\" is tough to watch -- not because of its finger-pointing, \\"it could happen to you\\" approach, but because it's simply dull. If you've ever wanted to see the feet of a guy as he uses a shovel to move dirt for nearly 12 minutes -- and that's no exaggeration -- this is your movie.Thanks Rod Lott"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't loose sight of the message.","review":"The message in this movie is very real yet disturbing. It's an awful thing to watch and I'm not even sure how to take the ending. It's purely not needed. Overall don't support this creative version of kiddie porn. They could have gotten their message across ( Which is that it's incredibly easy to get to our kids) by doing something else. This movie is for predators and the directors should be under surveillance for the rest of their lives.Again it is incredibly easy for predators to get to our kids. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE.

Also, this book goes into more than just historical fact by expressing ideas that spread through the country, cultural changes, and political trends.

Kleiber's performances are always refreshing, so detailed and refined, yet so direct and simple, like there can't be another way since it's utterly convincing. You can rediscover how wonderful music is from watching and listening to them. And whether he wanted it or not, Kleiber made the likes of the widely popular Karajan look like a business man on podium.This particular concert would give you a joyous, energetic and exciting spirit for a beautiful new year.

I have never had a problem charging it with several different pumps (floor and handheld) and it's now on a second bike. Yes, it's a schrader valve and my tires are presta, so what!!! Most pumps will service both valves. I recommend this horn to everyone who is looking for a horn to get someone's attention. It's light weight and mounting versatility make it a bargain. Only have one water bottle cage? Install another cage with hose clamps in an out of the way location. You'll never have to mess with the bottle once it's installed, so it doesn't have to be easily accessable.

It is loud but only partly effective. The one dog ,that had bitten me, did not hesitate with a four second blast. I needed to put my cadence at 115 rpm to get away from the dog. (Really bad dog owner) That day I had been chased by at least four sets of dogs. Some stopped chasing me with a blast from the horn. Others ignored it, as one huge lab was able to get close, only evasive measures saved me.I recommend getting a spray to better defend yourself from dogs while riding. The horn works no doubt about that but for scaring dogs it has mixed results. Also get a helmet cam to show local animal control the problems you are having"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowsa!","review":"A buddy got one of these and although I hate being a copycat, after hearing it, I had to own one too. I'm a daily bike commuter and this horn has saved my life once and allowed me to exact revenge on rude motorists twice.I think the bracket is a bit cheap but for the money, the horn simply cannot be beat.Not for kids' bikes and not recommended for bike paths. It's so loud that irresponsible use or close quarters use might cause more problems than it solves. If, however, you are mixing it up with cars in traffic, this horn is a great equalizer.Made in North America too. Gotta love that it's not made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and loud","review":"Plus: volume. Minus: designed for straight handle bars not drop bars. A must have for any cyclist who has to fend off clueless car drivers. Car drivers don't seem to realize that cyclists are traveling anywhere from 10 - 30 mph and therefore always seem to think they can make a turn in front of you. Well, not anymore if you got this horn. If one of these unconscious drivers looks like they might cut you off just give them a little toot and they'll be frozen in their tracks.

Probably a good couple dozen on medium power. No great problem though, it only takes a second to recharge the canister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Are All the Parts?!?","review":"Sounds like an airhorn at a sporting event, loud but hard to take seriously. My package was delivered with all of the mounting brackets missing...was forced to go McGiver on it and make do with materials I had saved for just this magic moment! Could have returned it but who needs that kind of a hassle...too bad it couldn't have been inspected prior to shipment. The volume adjustment seems to be a little loose, but is absolutely necessary to prevent mischevious little hands from playing their own mini-symphonies while your ride is left unattended. Otherwise, it's a fine product that sure beats the ninja turtle horn alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome! Very loud.","review":"I bought this for my wife, who rides her bike in Seattle, where the drivers are possibly the worst in the country. It has saved her from injury on several occasions, and alerted drivers to her presence countless times. It is extremely loud, and can be heard over cell phones, booming radios, construction noise, etc. You can turn down the volume, but why would you?It usually lasts for about 6 to 8 good blasts before you have to pressurize it again. A standard bike pump will pump it back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, but tricky to install","review":"Came already charged with air, which quite surprised me. Plenty loud enough. Fits in a bottle cage or to its own frame mounted velcro fastener. Fitting of the horn to the handlebar is a little tricky, as it seems to require removing the handlebar grip (immerse in boiling water) and brake lever to slide the horn over the end of the handlebar, and then refit components.Edit: This horn broke after just a few refills. The valve / trigger ruptured. Shame as its a nice idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good horn, terrible attachment system","review":"Pros:* The horn is extremely loud, loud enough to get any driver's attention. It has already helped avoid me getting run off the road twice in only a handful of outingsCons:* TERRIBLE attachment mechanisms. The clamp for the horn part is completely worthless. I ended up attaching it with more zip ties. The velcro attachment for the air bottle is a little better, but still allows for the bottle to move around too much. I used some gaff tape to hold it more steady.* The air hose is too long and tends to just get in the way.* It's too easy to accidentally sound the horn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product","review":"Cute product! Its small, lightweight, and noisy as ever. When it is out of air charge, a few pumps on the handle and its good for hours. It was easy to mount and took no more room than a standard water bottle.

It was exactly what I needed in traffic to get drivers' attention (not for pedestrians!). I used it for a while, but eventually the actuator button failed - when I pressed the button to actuate the horn, it just caused air to leak out of the pressurized bottle with no horn sound.

In NYC it can be a bit ineffective at times simply because many drivers are self centered pricks used to being honked at. It's great for scaring pedestrians off the bike path or getting a j-walker to look up from their cell phone before they walk into you. I've had no problems filling it and haven't seen any leakage. It survived a crash my front fork/rim didn't and it seems like an all round quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest to a car horn for a bike that you can get","review":"As a biker, I know and obey all of the traffic rules. I also try to avoid getting in anyone's way, because I know how annoying it can be when a biker is in your lane and has plenty of room off to the side. Anyways, I still get cars honking at me - some just to be obnoxious, others because they think I should be on the sidewalk. I also have problems with cars pulling out without looking. Long story short, I wanted the loudest, most annoying horn I could get, and this horn is it! With sound this loud you have a presence that is hard to ignore. I feel much safer now.

I could not get it to fit on the handle bar of my bike. An easier to install clamp that is more adjustable is needed. If you only have one water bottle carrier on your bike, it is difficult to find an acceptable location for the air reservior. The supply line from the air reservoir to the horn did not appear to be able to be shortened. The volume control is not easily accessed.

When it initially was received it worked fine. The Horn is extremely flimsy.Fair Warning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The only good thing about this horn is that when it works it is loud. Trouble is you have to place the horn on the handle bars in a manner so that it points forward and the actuator button is on top of the horn. That means you have to take a hand off the handle bar grip to honk. The main reason I honk is that someone is trying to run over me. Releasing the grip of one hand puts me more at risk. The other main problem is that it runs on high pressure air. Any system like that is prone to leaks as did mine after only a few months. It is in the trash now and I am looking for a mechanical or electric horn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware! Can become dislodged and jam into your spokes!","review":"Make sure you wrap the hose around your handle bar a few times, because the mount kinda sucks and can shake loose, causing the horn thing to dangle into your spokes. The local bike shop stopped selling them since they were threatened with a lawsuit for this flaw. Otherwise this thing is awesome! Loud enough to make people laugh and ask \\"How'd you get a car horn on you'r bike?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud & Proud","review":"Whats the point of a horn or bell if a car can't hear you? This thing is LOUD! I think the fact that it runs only on pumped air gives it a re-usability factor over other types of horns. I would not advise honking this up close to passerby's as it will frighten them. I only gave it four stars as I think that the clip is a bit strange and the horn falls off at times when I off-road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud ... but VERY effective","review":"It is true that this horn is VERY loud, but keep in mind that there is a volume control. This is effective in getting through to cars, even the luxery sedans with tons of road noise dampening, that also happens to dampen the noise they need to hear to be safe.The fastening bracket is a little flimsy, I would suspect that it could brake if I take a tumbler on the pavement."},{"rating":"2","title":"FREAKING AWESOME!","review":"This thing is louder than some car horns! it's saved my ass 3 times already from the Miami drivers! super easy to take on and off.

I needed noise and I was put onto the Airzound bike horn. This is one AWESOME piece of cycling artillary, and it has saved my bacon more than once since acquiring it. Whenever I think a car is going to cut in or hasn't seen me, a blast of this horn and they hit the skids, looking for the semi-trailer. In fact, a semi-trailer gave me a blast for taking right-of-way at a roundabout and my blast WAS LOUDER!Also this horn is a breeze to maintain. You just use the same pump as the tyres.

I didn't get to actually use it as the flimsy plastic trigger hinge was factory-broken, right out of the box.A replacement is on the way, but I don't really expect this item to hold up in use. Its all-plastic construction is just too fragile and poorly engineered at stress points. The mounting system is also inadequate.

A must have if you ride in traffic.It is so loud that often drivers will INSTANTLY get back in their lane when you hit the button. My favorite part is seeing them check their rearview mirrors or turn their head left looking for the \\"truck\\" they assumed just honked at them. If they do finally see you, they won't believe it was actually your little bike that honked so loudly. The important thing is that it will get the drivers attention, and FAST.I only needed to replace mine after years of use because I put too much pressure in the bottle once and it messed up the horn valve, so don't exceed the 100psi limit.Just be sure to only honk it at cars, not people or bikes directly in front of you because it's just too loud (and rude) for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"stupid lasts for 30 seconds i pressed it 2 time and thats it. please do not buy this item. get the electric one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I had a little difficulty finding a place to mount it on my Catrike recumbent tricycle and ended up mounting it on my left steering column and installing the bottle in my water bottle holder.

I use the horn about every time out either to let kids know I'm coming if they are playing out in the road, scare dogs off, and let people in cars know I'm coming if they start to pull out from a stopsign or back out in the road from their driveway.

The main canine character grows up from a puppy to become an extremely overweight dog. Yet, there is no indication in the book that obesity is an avoidable condition or that it was detrimental to the dog's health to be overweight. Obviously this book was not intended to be a book about proper animal care, I get that. But if the author was not going to address the dog's obesity in any way, why was it such a prominent element in the story? Inadvertently, the author sends the message to children that dogs get fat and we can't do anything about it. As a person who works in animal welfare, I am uncomfortable with that message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful for young kids","review":"My 4yo niece had to face losing her dog and we used this book in the week leading up to his death. It allowed her to say goodbye to him with a sense that she'd expressed her love. She had no problem with the \\"every night\\" part of it that some have objected to. That might have been more of an issue for a somewhat older child, but at 4 she just took it as it was.One side effect of reading several books about pets dying is that she was disappointed she didn't get to, \\"see Lucy [the dog] die.\\" So many of these books feature pets dying and being buried at home. That's not been our experience with any of our pets so far, as most of them have had to be put to sleep following a catastrophic illness of one type or another. And no burying them in the backyard either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book...","review":"There are some books I think should be in every household, and if you have both children and pets, this is one of them.

Nothing will stop the pain of the loss of course, but \\"I'll Always Love You\\" helps bring back the happiness and lets the healing begin.

It is clearly another means to rope in pagans and attempt to convert them, as was done in days of old. Such as building cathedrals on the spot of an ancient grove to entice the pagan populous to attend.It was severly disappointing from the aspect that I spent money on this thinking that I would glean some pagan wisewoman knowledge to add to my compendium, but instead I received preaching and Christian slight of hand.

It was recommended to me as a book that \\"tips the bucket on Hepburn.\\" My initial thought (without looking at the book) was that it was going to tell us more about Hepburn's well known arrogance, egotism etc. Boy was I in for a shock. That was the very same day I was introduced to David Bret and his equally bad book on Rock Hudson.To accept this book as factual, you must believe that no one was heterosexual in Hollywood. And we all know that that is impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy","review":"So this is the way myths are made...through page after page of misinformation? There might be some truth in this screed, but it would take the patience of Job to extricate it from the fantasy plots. This book is about the spinning of little kernels of truth and dialogue into a money making pastime for the author.A particularly laughable bloated fantasy instance, was that Kate was on the set of \\"Swing Time\\" with Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire, and George Stevens. Her purpose? To interfere with the making of the film, and the budding romance between Rogers and Stevens. Yeah sure! In those days...she would have been kicked out on her ear. Fred alone, would have gone ballistic. It never happened.This book has no other value other than to prompt musings at the length some authors will travel to avoid the hard work of research...and to indulge the public in their fantasies...for money.

This book was, of course, inevitable, but only after Katharine Hepburn's death when she could not refute any of its dubious content and, to put it kindly, guesswork of its author. Whether Hepburn was bisexual or not -- and does it matter? -- the \\"evidence\\" in support of this book's many assertions is scant at best. Heresay, rumor, and wild guesses are, for this author, apparently the equivalent of research and hard evidence.As other reviewers have previously noted, this book is poorly edited and the writing is sloppy and uninteresting, perhaps the saddest statement of all since there was nothing about Katharine Hepburn that was uninteresting. She deserves much better than this exploitive garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"[...]There are so many great books written about Miss Hepburn's life and this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOLDEN READ FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD","review":"My favorite movie actress, Katharine Hepburn, is a lot less mysterious after reading this enthralling book. The amazing thing about Miss Hepburn's life is that no one has, until now, published anything with any meat in it. Compiled over many a year, from many eyewitnesses, this is a treasure trove of data beautifully organized and compiled into one blockbuster of a read.Our modern images of Miss Hepburn are those of an old lady, as exemplified by On Golden Pond. It's marvaleous to know that she was once young and beautiful, and led a life filled with joy, pain, sorrow and regrets--like you and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"So you wanna be a star, kid?","review":"K Callan starts off by giving you a no-b.s. look into the way that show biz works that is so dauntingly realistic, you may have to fight the impulse to run screaming to the nearest business school, trade school or college, vowing never to dream of becoming an actor ever again. Then she proceeds to give you valuable tips, tricks of the trade and common sense strategies to help you achieve success, no matter how high the deck is stacked against you.

If you are just starting out and looking for a \\"fun\\" book to read, this is the one. The only thing I didn't like was that she focused mainly on working in New York and LA, although she does talk a bit about finding work in smaller cities.

Too many wrong notes ...","review":"Opp. 51 and 61 are highlights in Dvorak's extensive, but under-rated and under-performed quartet output. These works are less complex than the late quartets of Beethoven or the six of Bartok, but are more beautuful in many ways. There are several excellent recordings of the undulating, melodic Eb and the majestic C major quartets - but this is not one of them. I was surprised at the number of errors that the quartet made, and disappointed at the lack of warmth and vibrancy that is achieved by other groups in the opening bars of the Eb. These discs are full-price, and are not good value. I would recommend the Prague Quartet recordings, which are superior and cheaper if you are thinking of buying the complete works (well worthwhile - the less famous quartets are a Pandora's box of melodic gems). If you just want to dabble, then get the Vlach quartet recordings on Naxos. Opp. 51, 34, 80, 61, 96, 104 and 105 are a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Evening With Danny Kaye","review":"I purchased this VHS casette from AMAZON US.

My favorites are \\"When You Love SOmeone Like That\\", \\"Does the Wind Still Blow in Oklahoma\\" (great country song\\", and \\"Because of You\\" (country-rock).Reba is the true star of the album, but each of the guest singers are given the chance to shine, with the exception, surprisingly, of Justin Timberlake, who is more of a background singer than a duet partner on his song.4 stars.

It's good to hear from Carole King, Vince Gill, and Leanne Rimes, but Reba's voice is mixed louder than any of her duet partners', and in some cases, the duet \\"partner\\" is barely given a verse of his/her own, making it more of a glorified background vocal.I rate this cd two-stars, solely because Reba's voice remains one of the best in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never knew why","review":"I downloaded several of the free songs from Amazon.

The acting was very flat and very annoying (i use the term acting loosely) and the pace is very slow. So a mentally unbalanced girl has a more than sisterly love for her brother who is away in the military. She tortures people who irritate her, family friends and loved ones. She doesn't seem to discriminate about who she tortures. However, the torture scenes were very lame. I'm guessing the torture scenes were trying to be different with the makeshift strap on dilbo but it ended up very lame with a few blood splatters on the floor. Placing a rat in a bag and putting it on one's head could have been interesting but it wasn't in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Torture porn","review":"The lead actress of this film does a fantastic job portraying the damaged young lead, but the movie really couldn't hold me because it is just this shallow shell of a film that just seems like an excuse to make a mixed salad of scenes of violence and says to hell with a worth a damn story line. If you like films like Hostel, then you'd dig this - but if you are looking for something smart and something that'll grab your attention and give you a gore-filled ride with brains to match, then this can be skipped, cause this ain't that film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Suck girl","review":"Bad acting, bad direction, bad setups, bad writing and why do none of the victims fight back until they are tied up.

The story had potential but the sound and cinematography were awful. You can barely understand most of the dialog. The story is disjointed - just what was the connection of the school bus slaughter? Andy Signore was hilarious in the outtake - they should have left it in. If you want to watch a really good sick movie watch Any Signore's \\"The Janitor.\\" Now that's sick AND funny with a great story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Sick Girl!!!","review":"I thought that I was totally desensitized by watching violent, horror movies my whole life but this one made me cover my eyes a few times. Warning!! This movie is not for everyone. I was not expecting much when I rented this on Netflix, but I was pleasantly or unpleasantly surprized. This movie was not made on a big budget, hence the reason I wanted to watch it in the first place. The acting is really good and sometimes believing (some actors in this flick are just horrible). Overall, I really enjoyed this movie enough to purchase my own copy. This review is directed only toward the hardcore horror fans!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool","review":"This isn't your average horror movie if you're into mainstream horror.This digs much deeper into the character's psyche and shows no mercy.If you're into twisted independent horror movies that have lots of gore you won't be disappointed.The girl isn't the best actress in the world, but it doesn't really take away much from the movie since the film itself is unpredictable and leads you to try and figure out why she's on a killing spree.This movie is not for everyone since it contains children being abused and killed as well as a graphic rape scene. Girl on girl rape scene that is. Not so hot as it may sound though since well...you'll find out for yourself. Haha.I enjoyed it for what it was. It wasn't too over the top for my taste, yet it didn't lack what i was looking for.

Just a 15 minute into or even a montage would have done it.3)It needs 5 more minutes at the end.. it left me hanging I was like\\"ok.. now what will she do.. hey it's the credits?\\"But the movie itself is ok - I liked it. It wasn't as gory or sick as I thought it would be be, but she is cool as a \\"Sick\\" girl (and the end scene was pretty sick!)Again I just wish they tied up the story better and the sound is bad, that's why I only give it 2 stars.Oh.. and the mini-documentary is pretty cool!

I ended up cleaning with a spray foam carpet cleaner for pets the next day with better results. *One additional note, the bottles were put inside plastic bags so when they leaked it was into a bag.

As I began reading, I expected to find the same combination of sophisticated social consciousness, wicked yet gentle wit, and sparkling prose that make her other books so wonderful. But, alas, it seems even Miss Manners has to lay an egg once in a while. This book was not a bit funny; In fact, it seemed almost mean-spirited and sarcastic at times. It isn't quite rude, of course, but just the same, it lacks the lively spirit of cheerful helpfulness, and the brilliant intellect, that is present in her other books. Sorry, Ms. Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"At long last...","review":"For the fans of Miss Manners, this is the one so long awaited. Instead of her typical format (q-&a, as seen in her columns,) this is the fruition of the ideas first presented in Common Courtesy. Rather than the how-tos of etiquette, she fully presents all the whys, whens and whats. An engaging combination of play, novel and history textbook, it's difficult to put down, while each paragraph could be digested three times over for the layers of meaning. It's exactly the little book one wants to leave about for others to infectiously read. No patriotic American can fail to lift his head up high after reading this. Unhitch the horses, boys, it's time to pull Miss Manners through the streets ourselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful !!","review":"This is a book by Judith Martin (aka Miss Manners) on the history of American manners.Although there were some interesting points in the book, they were few and far between. The writing was convoluted as was the logic of the arguments made in too many instances. Ms. Martin seemed cynical and sarcastic in an excessive number of places. I also did not appreciate many of her comments and things she implied regarding southern manners.It is beyond me how she got the positive reviews cited in the book.Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Resounding Truth...written terribly.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I agree with most of what Miss Manners has to say about the general superiority of American manners in the field of equality, but the book itself is just jummbled.

Those elements were in the first two seasons, but in season three they really \\"click\\".Watching the episodes on DVD now, it's interesting to see how many actors were used over and over again, but in different roles each time.

Backed by an excellent supporting cast and superlative writing, this show never gets old despite the fact that I've seen each episode a gazillion times. Whether he is peddling a slick con to a gullible, greedy crook. bailing sleazy Angel out for the umpteenth time, turning the tables on the bad guys in the end with Dennis and the cavalry coming in the door at the last minute, Jim, (Garner or Rockford - who knows?) makes an extremely appealing character who everyone would like to have as a friend or buddy. Add a number of beautiful woman who never seem to be able to corral Jim and you have a series for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the rest?","review":"Rockford is great and this is the season wherein James Garner hit his stride with the character and storylines.

It focuses fast. Chromatic aberration is under control. Bokeh is great.Who cares if it's heavy. If you want a light lens, you are probably willing to compromise image quality.Drawbacks: There is significant distortion at 17mm. Correctible in PS(-3 does the trick), but I would expect more from such a pricey piece of glass. Also, I wish it had VR. Again, for the price that would make sense.Overall, it is pro glass. you get what you pay for, and it will probably never leave the D200 body. Those who are considering this purchase should wait for a couple of months - nikon (and the rest) will be debuting new products before the holidays. I'd bet they'll roll out a VR version of this guy. So, this will model will probably drop in price. (just a guess)p.s. (i like using parentheses)"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect apsc zoom lens","review":"I use it with my D7000, it is a all purpose lens. Fundamentally it is very sharp even at f2.8, some of my f2.8 zoom lens dose not give me sharp image at f2.8 (so why don't they just made them f4?). And its contrast and bokeh are very good. The most important point to me is it's f2.8, yes, for a apsc body, its iso performance is not as good as full frame body, so if you want high shutter speed (in event photography), you need fast aperture to ensure the image quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality walk around lens (if you can handle the weight and size)","review":"Pros: This lens offers superb build quality, fast and secure autofocus, fast aperture through the range.It is also sharp wide open, and it becomes very sharp by stepping a little.Cons: Not cheap, but its built to last a lifetime. Its big and heavy, yet to its defense it balances great on a d300s. The lens does not have VR... this I dont regret much within this zoom range.I recommend this lens, because though its pricey most people will use it as their primary lens and it delivers as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quintessential Wedding and Portrait Lens","review":"It is perfect for what it does. Fast, not too big, with a zoom range equivalent to 25-88mm in 35mm terms. This lens is for portraits, small groups, indoor events where the lighting might not be so good. It is flattering to people with enough distance at the long end to keep the photographer from being too intrusive and also give you a shallow enough depth of field to isolate a subject from its background. Bokeh is excellent. At the wide end you can easily catch most of a dance floor or a band. Focusing is fast, sure, and quiet, even in dim light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I had purchased this lens for my D200 Nikon. Although this is not a cheap product, I am very satisfied with the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"I bought the lens used, not new, so may be some of the things that I am about to point out are related to the fact that the lens was previously owned and there might have been issues related to a use by another owner.When I got the lens and did a few test shots I was not very happy. I am used to my f1.8 lens and my other is another prime and is f 1.2. This lens obviously is not as fast in a low light as my prime lenses. However, after testing the lens some more I have changed my mind. It is fairly nice and fast. Its is sturdy too. I love the fact that it autofocuses on Nikon D5000 cameras (just what I needed). Another thing I have noticed is that it is a bit noisy at 400 ISO (more than I would expect, but again, I am comparing with prime lenses and may be I am expecting too much).Pros: Fast, nice zoom range, low aperture, has internal autofocus (can autofocus on such cameras as Nikon D5100).Cons: Heavy! The aperture and zoom rings are a little bit tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"17-55mm 2.8 is worth the money","review":"After messing around with cheaper lenses I purchased this lens and have been very pleased with the results. I am spending less time touching up pictures which is a huge plus in my book. The other lenses up until this point worked fine but were too spuratic in regards to picture quality and sharpness. This lens performs the way you would expect it to. I just wish that I had bought it sooner but I had to do what I had to do to get to this point. If you have bucks to jump into this lens and it's something you want or need then by all means take the plunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome Glass","review":"There is not much more that can be added to the comments about this lens. It is quick, extremely sharp, and has great color reproduction. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. If you are a professional photographer you probably already have one of these in your bag or working on purchasing one. If you are a serious hobbyist, do yourself a favor, sell the boat, take out a second mortgage, or do whatever it takes but, make sure to get one of these for your bag. You will not regret it.The only shortcoming that I can find with this lens is that I wish that they would have extended the focal length to about 85mm. That would most definitely have made this the perfect tool for all occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT! best lens I've used so far, just shot a wedding with it!","review":"This lens is great for low light situations. It creates beautiful bokeh effects on the photos. Great depth of field. It is a little heavy, but it's definitely worth the hassle. The pictures come out really sharp.

The problem is, the motor drive for the auto focus was really noisey and all the pictures were a little blurry at 40 to 55mm. I thought it was just me having to much motion, turns out even on a tripod it was the same. I called Nikon and they had me send them photos to review. They contacted me and told me I needed to send the lens in for repair.With shipping and repair I am still under the cost of a brand new lens but not by much but still out an additional 300.00....I would not buy a used lens again, just to big a gamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colors of the photos by 17-55mm is strange","review":"I am using this lens with D2X but my pictures are strange.

If I have to get closer, the marriage of the 70-200mm F.8 lens is its partner. Don't forget to spend a few dollars for the front end filter-don't go cheap here please!

It's a great book, and has quick easy to read, short chapters so I can read it on my lunch break, etc and take in a whole chapter or two while multi-tasking. It's inspiring, and a great read.

(Not just for women by the way!)This book taught me how to:1. Get my ideas onto paper.2. Accept that my first draft might be crappy - but that's OK.3. Revise my drafts until I had a finished product that I would be proud to show to the world.It's actually pretty easy if you just follow the author's advice. There's no magic here.

This album highlights Lenny's talent for being a great producer, and a catylist for showcasing talent. It is one of the things that I have always admired about him. He has the ability to bring out the best in the people he chooses to associate himself with. As a musician, it has always been my hope to be able to do the same thing with the musicians I play with.

When I received it I quickly read the liner notes to see who was on it with Mr. White. The first warning sign was that all of the songs had vocals. The second sign was the presense of Marcus Miller on all songs with no production or co-production credits(he doesn't do that very often these days).Once I played the disc my dissappointment was complete.

I got it a few days after it came out, and I've been listening to it ever since. I love the fact that it has some non-released tracks from somewhat new bands, like Stone Sour or Ill Nino, as well as the \\"old-school\\" touch of some of the older bands like Obituary or Life Of Agony. It's an awesome mix of old and new rock, and everyone should definitely add it to their cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Metal Mix Ever!","review":"This CD is totally kick a** mix of old and new bands and songs.

Here's the deal, it has some old metal bands but also introduces you to some really cool new ones too. It's the perfect mixture of old and new music with the right amount of attitude (isn't that what Roadrunner is known for anyway)? And for the price, you can't beat it! Cut out the McDonald's and Taco Bell for a week, save the money and buy something that's gonna satisfy you a lot longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAXIMUM HEAD BANGING!!!","review":"This CD is great, it'll freaking keep you slamming around for hours.

I highly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of RoadRunner shows a little taste of past and present","review":"The Heart of Road Runner has songs from past bands and new bands and has a great mix of bands from the label. I like most of the songs on here. There's only one song on here I'm not very fond of and that's only because I didn't think it was hard enough, but other than that I loved the cd. Hopefully they will make another Heart of Road Runner with more bands because Road Runner had alot of good bands on their label. This is an all around great CD and I liked it alot and everyone should go out and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmmmmmm","review":"well lets see ive listened to the cd on roadrunner and well even though all the sondskind of bled together where you couldnt change tracks it was still really great. good choice in music and bands. Some of the songs i just kind of skipped through because i didnt want to stay online forever plus i didnt want to listen to some of the bands of which i never heard of. but still the parts of the songs i did hear were really good...

There's something here for everyone!! Classic tracks like \\"Roots Bloody Roots\\" and \\"Replica\\" make any roadtrip all the more exciting while the unreleased material such as \\"Fascination Street\\" and \\"Negative Creep\\" make the cd impossible to get out of your cd player.

And for such a low price, how could you not pick it up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Heart of Roadrunner\\"","review":"In the past few years I have taken an extreme liking to various rock/metal bands. A friend asked me to listen to this particular CD and rate it. Although I have not heard many of the songs/ bands on the cd I believe that it was put together very well. Although I am not really into the hard core metal stuff this cd brings it all to life and has a lot of heavy hard core songs. If your into bands such as Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Ill Nino, etc this would be the perfect pick for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road Runner 4ever","review":"Road runner had many of the bands that rule the metal world and this is the cd proves that this.

I recommed this Cd to anyone who like heavy metal and you're guarenteed to like a song on this Cd no matter what kinda metal your into. This Cd rules an everyone should go and buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"This CD is just great. It has many of the well known bands signed onto Road Runner Records.

Spanning Roadrunner Records life as a label, it debilitates you with 'old-school' bands like King Diamond, Obituary, Deicide (\\"Deicide, ...Deicide, man,\\" ever see Black Circle Boys?), Life Of Agony, Sepultura and Type O Negative. It then finishes your pitiful body off with newer bands like Slipknot, Stone Sour, Coal Chamber, Spineshank, Fear Factory, Soulfly and more. Twenty KILLER tracks in all.Bottom line: If you can only buy metal compilation, buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Nice Things, Mostly Not","review":"There are a few nice pieces in this book but not enough to warrant a whole book. There is one picture I spotted as being identical to a picture on another page. Many of the items one could see by going to a Copper and Brass store that sells new items. I now have the book, \\"Metalwork in Early America : Copper and It's Alloys from the Winterthur Collection,\\". If you want in-depth information on antique copper and brass, I'm afraid you're going to have to go the money. This is what I was looking for when I bought this other book. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books that I have ever read. It is just plain horrible!

Instead of letting someone else run with their idea and just about ruin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeeeew!!!!","review":"One of the worst Dragonlance or Fantasy books i have ever read (if not THE worst). The characters are so shallow that it reminds me of those children fairy tales. The plot is laughable. The author has dishonored Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Let's hope this will be her last DL book. Anyone who loves this book should try to read the old Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis books before they give their reviews!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing compared to the others","review":"This book was a great let down. It really went no where and only accoplished little. The ending is not really that, just a sort of hang on until the next book. It is a pit because the other books by Jean Rabe are really good. Well they can't all be master peices"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read!","review":"This is one of the worst books I ever read. The plot was non existint, and there was no charactor development. In short, save your money until Weiss and Hickman are back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!","review":"Well, so much for maintaining old standards. Dragonlance is a series that focuses on characters and emotions. Weis and Hickman excel in drawing readers into the emotional drama of their people. I'm sorry to say Jean Rabe lacks this skill. The characters in the 5th age barely keep my interest, never mind my involvment. Can anyone seriously say that characters like Feril or Rig are as intriguing as Raistlin or Sturm? Even Palin is a drag. Old characters, like Goldmoon and Gilthanas, are thrown into the 5th age mix in a gratuitous effort to gain the readership of original fans. They are shells of their original selves. If Jean Rabe wants to write, I suggest trying the Forgotten Realms series, where generic dungeons and dragons stories seem to be welcome, and leave Krynn alone. (Sorry if I offend FR fans!) Bring back Weis and Hickman!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, dull, and plenty of filler","review":"Honestly, Rabe could have done MUCH better. Did you notice that 50 pages of the book was merely Dhamon and crew on the boat fighting? It was horrible. \\"Dhamon ducked, sliced, and then came round while Rig...\\". That one on for quite some time. Spare me this filler. The other parts were dull, and historically incorrect. Palin, the world's most powerful sorcerer, seemed to be equal in power with all those Skull (thorn?) knights. Magic's gone! The whole quest is to restore magic! Yet they STILL have as much power as before already! sigh....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor introduction to the Fifth Age","review":"This was supposed to be the last book in the trilogy. However, it failed to wrap up many of the mysteries presented in the first two novels. In fact, it seemed to generate even more questions at the end then it answered. Case and point (trying not to spoil the story), the wolf changing when hit by a dragonclaw. Was it a wolf or something more? Perhaps the creature that deafened Growler in the first place acting as a guardian? Unless the author intended on developing these characters in later single novels, then reading these stories was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For dragonlance fans only.","review":"A disapointing end to the first fifth age trilogy. Rabe built the story up well in the first two books, but failed to capitalize in the final novel. The story was dragged out and relatively boring until the end. And even the nothing significant happened. It seems it was only written for the purpose of a sequal. However for the average dragonlance fan it is still a must read. I wouldn't recommend it to dragonlance new entrants however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then I thought...","review":"Jean did a better job of this series then I suspected. She has the writing talents needed, but just not all the facts. I'm not trying to be rude when I say this, Jean, but the time and events within the series went by way to fast, and more things about Krynn (And Kender) should be considered and reviewed before hand. But other then that, I thought it was great. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new characters, open ending","review":"I was happy to see that at the conclusion to the trilogy the heroes were not able to truly best the dragons. I would have been disappointed if the dragons were so wimpy a group of humans and elves could have done them in. Plus, I liked Khellendros gaining the power you figured Malystryx would have gained. And I liked that it left room for more stories at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Dragonlance fans.","review":"The first Fifth Age trilogy ends with a great climax and a few surprises. I found myself becoming as fond of the new companions as I did about the ones from the War of the Lance. Jean Rabe does a wonderful job bringing the new companions and dragons to life. Eve of the Maelstrom is a must read for all Dragonlance fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many loopholes in story.","review":"As one of the biggest DL lovers I know I am less than thrilled with the fith age books> The characters lack any presence and the fights any thrills I wish these books were better.I am looking forward to the new books:::::::Maylx"},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure to keep up with the old standards.","review":"The book was not bad, however, it lacked many simple logical parts, for example, why, in the world would the dragons be attacked, when they all are together? In my opinion, it is not that hard to fake a attack of one dragon on another dragon's realm, then we have a two-three month Dragon Purge, a couple of dragons left over and then, just finish them up. Also I would recommend anyone to read this book only, if he can borrow it from his friend or local library. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats the point?","review":"what was the purpose of this trilogy? The only thing it did was introduce the dragon overlords and the rest of the story is [...] and doesn't matter.

So if you are planning to get this book DONT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It was an okay book, but altogether I expect more from Dragonlance and I think that the whole trilogy was a flop, plus I could barely get through some of the more boring parts of the book. The characters were uninteresting and even some of my old favorites from previous books were very boring in these books and I could barely tell that they were meant to be the same people. There wasn't enough description at some of the crucial or potentially interesting parts of the book and to much description in the boring parts of the book. The plot had potential but was poorly handled and very confusing at times even to the most avid Dragonlance reader. I was disappointed in the whole trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiraling into Confusion","review":"Just so I had a better understanding of characters and events from other Dragonlance authors that appeared in Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's new 2001 trilogy (that I wasn't reading until 2010), I read all three of Jean Rabe's Dragons of a New Age Trilogy. That is potentially the only reason I see to read the conclusion, Eve of the Maelstrom.However, a reader could skip this confused, jumbled, straight out of bad night at the roleplaying game table catastrophe and he or she would still perfectly understand what is going on in the War of Souls.This book lacks basic character development, basic plot cohesiveness, basic pacing, basic sensible dialog, essentially basic everything. It is not worth the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Trying","review":"Yet again, I'm sorry for this. Why would a 500 ft., aspiring to become a god, magically talented dragon be vanquished by a normal guy and a girl with a helmet that functions as a squirt gun? Why would people wait to go after dragons when they're all together? WHY DID ANYONE LET THIS BOOK GET PUBLISHED???? I apologize if I offended anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad characters and plot.","review":"I must say that this book is a disappointment. The characters do not live up to the series, and neither does the plot. They are empty, and I suspect this book was made for the sole purpose of setting the stage for another book (at least it better be from the quality). That is a terrible reason to write a book, for several reasons that I won't go over here. This book could be improved in quality by giving the characters some more depth and making the plot a little more complicated. They have a tradition to live up to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eve of the Malestrom","review":"This book did have some good parts. And I will agree with \\"TheDoomBrigade@yahoo.com\\" in this: if a reader thinks a book is bad, just because it is different, they ARE narrow minded. But I don't dislike this book because it is different. In fact, I was looking forward to the changes of Krynn. And in my opinion, they weren't stressed enough. I also don't mind if a writer has a different style of writing than Margaret and Tracy. But with all that in mind, I still say, Jean Rabe did a terrible job on this book. It doesn't matter if the purpose of this book was just to set the scene for the next ones, it still could have been done better. I think Jean Rabe has potential. But I hope beyond hope, that if she ever wants to write DL again, she will first learn all she can about Krynn. It wouldn't hurt if she read a few reviews either, to see what she's doing wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of the entire trilogy","review":"Gee uummm let me see here..... Rabe's characters are obviously immortal since almost every character lives through impossible odds. I'll give the examle of when a small group of warriors successfully destroy seven knights of Takhisis ships and no one is dead. The plot is also shallow (I won't go into that though, since everyone else already has). However I ike the great dragon overlord idea. But too many things that could have been good went bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"How far Dragonlance has fallen","review":"I bought Dragons of Summer Flame and the entire 5th Age trilogy thinking that finally the Dragonlance saga was going to move forward. Flame was fairly good, but 5th Age was a huge disappointment. The characters failed to intrigue me. The plot was sometimes nonsensical, like Rabe was forcing the book to go a certain direction without any logical reason for the characters' actions. The climactic battle in Eve of the Maelstrom was absurd. I'm done with Dragonlance until Weis and Hickman's new trilogy comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Blight on a Good Name","review":"It is a shame that Dragonlance has allowed someone who writes this poor to launch it's new novel line, and I think someone at TSR must agree. If you read this book, as well as the others in the trilogy, and then read Dragons of the Fallen Sun, you can see many inconsistancies and a few attempts to reverse the damage this trilogy has done. My advice is skip this trilogy and read the new stuff by the talented writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop! oh for the love of god, make it stop!","review":"I am suprised that Jean Rabe made it this far. Yes she had a lot to live up to (any one of Margaret Weis' & Tracy Hickman's books) but still..... after the first two you'd think she would go hide in a cave in tibet and ponder her wrong doings but nooooooo. The 3rd installment to her trilogy is yet another failure. Ripping of the heros and heroins we know so well from the Dargons/Twins Trilogies is clearly evident. NOt only does the plot suck, but he characters are not ones you can identfy with, nor are they well developed (even though she had 3 books to do it). I'm sure on of the other reviews will summarise the book for you so I wont *spoil* the ending for you. Anyways, the book sucks, and Rabe has ruined the world of Krynn. The challenge Raistlin faced in becoming a God pales in comparison to the challenge Weis and Hickman are presented with (fixing Krynn from Rabe's reign of terror)"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok....","review":"There's several things I don't like about this book, and the series for that matter. She's a good writer and so on but who gave her permission to mess up everything? And the one thing that bothered me the most is that she took magic away from the whole series. That's what Dragonlance is sorta based on is magic. I bet Raistlin is not happy with that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely gorgeous!","review":"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my mother and it arrived quickly and is beautiful.

Well if not, that is ok but the singer/guitarist Larry Saltis is also the singer for this solid AOR CD. When It All Falls Down is worth the price of this CD alone.

The game controls are a little complicated to use, because you don't know for sure if you're going to jump on the plataform of if you're going to fall. The graphics, on the other hand, are awesome for a GBA, really impressive, unbelievable. But this isn't enough to make this game a good one.

Readers who have read \\"The Rich Shall Inherit\\" should also read this book. Set in the late 1800's to the early 1900's, it follows the story of Leonie, a poor young girl in France, and the obsession of one man she calls Monsieur. Living in the shadow of fear from Monsieur, Leonie becomes a famous singer and eventually finds true love.The story comes together in a final conflict that frees Leonie from her Monsieur forever.I found this book difficult to put down, and I'm sure you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Been Done Before","review":"The only Adler book I can give five stars to is \\"The Rich Shall Inherit,\\" because I adored Poppy, the main character, and the story-line was riveting.But \\"Leonie\\" is a hollow, unsatisfying character, and her main purpose in life seems to be jumping from man to man and moving the (somewhat stilted) plot along. Her love/hate relationship with Monsieur is at first entertaining, but his life-long obsession with her seems overplayed, and we never get a real idea of what makes him tick. And people always seem to die at such convenient points in this book; it began to get annoying. I hate to bring up real life in a book about pure fantasy--which is what all Adler's books are about--but there isn't enough reality in this book to give the fantasy something to stand on.Bottom line: in a book wherein everything you want to happen is inevitably going to, the journey there should be entertaining enough to make it work anyway. And in \\"Leonie,\\" it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been much shorter . . .","review":"To me it seemed that Léonie didn't have many facets to her personality other than that of a good, sweet person, far sweeter than she should have been given her circumstances. Her daughter was pretty much the same. Oh, Léonie was lucky of course - inexplicably so and mostly because of her astounding beauty. It really was quite annoying how every man she ever came across seemed to fall in love with her in less than a day. I mean, how beautiful can she be? She had far too many lovers, most of them rather unnecessary. So much of the story could have been removed without harming the plot at all. Most of it was written just to make the book longer, it seemed. After a couple hundred pages it just gets boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for almost a year...","review":"This battery worked well for almost a year.

The game play might have pasted as acceptable in the days of the first Diablo, but by modern gaming standards, this is a laugh. It is clear that not only was this thing rushed for Christmas, it is also relying on hype and a niche market to sell copies. I honestly would not recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind.......In More Ways Than One","review":"I knew this game didn't get rave reviews, but I wanted to try it out anyways. When comparing it to other strategy-based games, Left Behind just doesn't measure up. It gets very repetitive (having to acquire the same buildings over and over every single mission) and just isn't the experience that you'd expect coming from a game that was developed from the great Left Behind series. I'm a big fan of Age of Empires III, and the difference between this game and that one is like night and day. I truly believe if the developers of AOE III would have worked on this, you'd easily have one of the top strategy games, hands down. However, this is not the case, and hopefully they'll do better next time. They're supposed to be developing another Left Behind game, and believe you me, it couldn't possibly be any worse than this one. Even die-hard fans of the book should stay away from this game, it's just not worth playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly not very good..","review":"I like the books. At least the early books, and I'm an avid video gamer so when I saw they had a Left behind game, I decided to give it a whirl. First of all, even though my PC is up to spec, the game has REALLY long load times. The tutorial was beastly, the interface awkward. The units (people), look too similar, and have specific assigned genders (such as no female soldiers, etc.) Halfway through the monstrously long and unweildy tutorial I gave up. The graphics and the clunky iterface just didn't do it for me.I think this series would make a better adventure game... You know with puzzles and traveling to exotic locations (like those produced by DreamCatcher) The LB universe is so interesting it would really shine in that kind of environment. Particularly if characters could visit places such as Jerusalem, New Babylon, and Tribulation force HQ.The one plus to this game was the soundtrack. It was beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate and bigotry","review":"So this is what we've come to? Religious warfare? How different is this game from one where you slaughter Jews and Infidels?

Beyond the obvious moral hypocricy of convert-or-be-killed (such a very Spanish Inquisition approach), the game does not have its technology in order - specs are missing, video card incompatibility, lame graphics, slow play... the game is huge waste of time and money, pretty much a rip... and no doubt rushed to market in time for christmas, not tested well... reeks of amateur development.I wish Amazon had a negative stars rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible game","review":"This is a game that Amazon should remove from its site.

The players get to blow areas of the whole city using tanks, kill in the name of the lord and then pray their guilt away and increase their spirits using the special pray button. This game is absurd promotes intolerance and bigotry. If a company in the Middle East / India /China came up with a similar game killing people of other religions who did not convert to Islam / Hinduism / Buddhism, we would all be up in arms with Bill O'Riley, Ann Coulter and Glen Beck decrying the lack of sanity and tolerance in that part of the world. Strangely they seem to have this game their silent nod of approval an example Glen Becks Dec 4 interview with the Jeff Frichner, President, Left Behind Games. Parents should keep their children away from it. If killing is your thrill, I would recommend the World of Warcraft or Half Life as alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?!?","review":"How can Amazon sell something that is so offensive.

I was surprised and pleased when I discovered that the game also came with the Left Behind book. The game was too much to play. There were endless instructions for every movement in the game. The images were not always clear, at least on my computer, so if I misplaced a person by even a little bit I was stuck. I never go to really play. The whole thing was too much work and memorization of instructions. Even my husband who is a flight sim the more he can learn the better didn't go very far into the game before he gave up.The book on the other hand was a fun read, similar to Stephen King's The Stand.

I would agree with other reviewer that it definatly felt like it was a rush job for christmas and luckily I have and Alienware PC the met the requirements. I would compare the game to that developed by the US Army. It's and ok game but it was created with and underlying message. So the only thing I will say that was \\"Left Behind\\" were the average gamers who don't have the system requirements to play this game.On a personal note. Games like this are made to stir people up. I mean think about it. If EA or any other major game manufacture had developed this game you would have had the option to play the side of the Anti-christ. So that's my thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Christian Game","review":"This game is not best, most up-to-date game in the world. I will acknowledge that. It is, however a good quality game for Christians to play as an alternative to D&D or other role playing games with non-Christian themes. Yes, the graphics are old, but the theme of the game really makes up for it. Christians should buy the game. We should be supporting our Christian video game options.

Everyone should read this look at a world long dead, brought gloriously alive by the brilliant Herodotus. If you've never taken \\"the long view\\" before, you'll soon see that a lot went on before you were born (and a lot, no doubt, is yet to happen). Civilizations created and conquered, Gods worshipped and forgotten-- it reads like fiction or fantasy, but it is not: it's as close as Herodotus could get to telling the absolute truth as he saw it (and he saw a lot).Some \\"classics\\" are hard to slog through and appreciate. This is not one of them. Read! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic","review":"Few things are eternal. One is this translation and text.Herodotus (born 490-480 BC in Halicarnassus - modern Bodrum) opens with \\"In this book, as a result of my inquiries into history, I hope to do two things: to preserve the memory of the past by putting on record the astonishing achievements both of our own and of the Asiatic peoples; secondly and more particularly, to show how the two races came into conflict.\\"This was an ambitious goal, given the crisis of Persian invasions that resulted in the haphazard and ultimately heroic unification of Hellenes for a brief period against Persian \`barbarians.'The text proceeds innocuously as if a 5C BC travel guide replete with gossip and speculation on everything known to the author. This is invaluable as a contemporary view of the ancient world. But the conclusion (from Book Seven) is unique and as riveting as the most popular fiction.Herodotus, like Homer and Thucydides, is a foundation of civilization as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable Translation; Still Waiting For The \\"Landmark Herodotus\\"","review":"This is a very readable translation of Herodotus' masterpiece and well worth your time. My only complaint about this edition is that the layout of maps and endnotes requires constant flipping back and forth while you're reading (use three bookmarks to keep track of where you are). I'd like to see a \\"Landmark Herodotus\\" like the \\"Landmark Thucydides\\" by Strassler that included maps and footnotes with the body of the text, but until it comes out, I'd personally recommend this translation over some of the others I've seen, not because the others are bad, but because this one seems more colloquial and easier to follow.

When she looks through it by herself she recites it to herself- nothing like that happens to any other book we have. This book is what she is asking for first thing in the morning and the last thing she parts with when she goes to sleep. All the staffed toys she used to take with her to bed are almost forgotten. The book is a bit heavy for her and therefore a hard to handle on her own - but the book is holding strong. Considering the heavy usage we had only couple of very minor repairs.

Good food, wonderful insight into Spanish and South American kosher cooking -- but the history! It was the history of those accused by the Inquisition that caught our attention. Now my friend has the gift copy and I am ordering a second copy for myself.

I was looking forward to a celebration of the rich interchange between the Jewish, Catholic and Moorish communities of Spain experienced for centuries on end. Jewish consciousness permeates much of Spanish culture from Alfonso El Sabio, to Teresa of Avila etc. That is what I was looking for: something which would be a means of understanding and bridge-building.I am sad to say that beginning with the first sentence on the dust cover there is a fixation on the victimhood of Jews in Spain. Rather than celebrating a wonderful interweaving of cultures the book chose to reinforce age-old prejudices. It is one more example of a centuries old tradition that tars the Christian Spaniards with the brush of persecution and perpetuates the myth of \\"Black Spain\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Food, Bad History","review":"I was excited when I first heard about this book, but when I got a copy, I was quite disappointed.First the good... the recipes produce tasty dishes.But they are not the recipes of Spain's Jews, secret or public.These are recipes invented by the authors with a minimum of supporting evidence, or, in fact, most of the time, none at all.They are based for the most part on the testimony of people who turned in Conversos for being \\"secrect Jews\\". The mere mention of, oh, say, chick peas and honey, has led the authors to invent a recipe that includes these ingredients.If you are truly interested in the history the food eaten by Spain's Jews, you will not learn much.

Covered in fingerprints!! The only advantage is that there's a cloth that you can ue to wipe of the fingerprints on the outside really easily, but I didn't have the intention of bothering with fingerprints at all!

I have around 20K photos organized right now, didn't find any especially useful new information.For someone who is starting out on organizing their photos, I could see this being a FANTASTIC resource. If you are already have a work flow that involves tools such as Downloader Pro, Photomechanic, IPTC tagging and Photoshop, skip it. If you don't, then BUY this book now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book before setting up your DAM system","review":"Photographer Peter Krogh is a pioneering DAM user with years of experience to draw on. Peter's reputation amongst other professional photographers is well established.The DAM Book will guide you through the maze of setting up an image archive the right way. Through trial and error I did the hard way and Peter's book would have saved me hundreds of dollars and more importantly many hundreds of hours work!Peter style is firm and easy going without losing you in jargon. All the tech stuff is in the book and is expanded upon if you do want to know more.This book suits everyone from a DAM novice to seasoned users. Just when you thought you knew everything about DAM along comes the DAM Book. There really is a lot more than simply buying a cataloging program. Peter covers everything any pro or amateur needs to know.Very highly recommended.-- Robert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but you need to pace yourself","review":"So this book was recommended to me by a fellow photographer. It's a great book and if you're a digital photographer at some point in your career or hobby you're gonna want to get your hands on this book. For the most part it's a good read and there isn't a lot of technical jargon in there to confuse you. However, if you have the time to read it from cover that's great but if you're like me and you've got one million things on the burner putting it down and picking it up will have it's disadvantages. But overall it's a great find and a very, very, very useful book to have in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a must-have book for photographers who are amassing a large collection of photos.I needed to read it 2 times before getting a feel for how to impliment it.Great strategies and it has now changed my workflow completely and for the betterMoney very well spent (although it cost me many thousands more since I also updated my computer, server, and softward to impliment this)Regards, Dean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific material, very well written","review":"I really liked the book, and not only for its content. It's one of the few advanced books I've ever read that explains a difficult subject in an interesting, enjoyable way while still respecting the reader's intelligence. And, I say that having tried to do the same thing myself (my own books are here on Amazon, too), but Krogh does it better.I especially appreciated that he skipped all the boring introductory stuff that he was smart enough to know his readers already knew, and jumped right into the meat. In fact, the book is all meat.Krogh's focus is on the busy pro who needs to work efficiently day-to-day and who also want to maximize the value of his or her stock photos. Krogh shoots more pictures in an hour than I do in a month, and nobody except my children's grandparents wants any of my \\"stock\\" photos, but I benefitted enourmously from his workflow nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"For everyone who hopes to find their digital images.","review":"If you are a professional photographer awash in thousands of digital images or a serious amatuer, hoping to build a searchable library of photographs, this book will become your manual for organization. The area of cataloging digital photography is quite new and the software needed for the task is changing at a rate difficult to keep up with.Krogh has created the bible of digital image organization. The book is full of tips on how to get started for any size collection. His sense of humor makes this coma inducing topic enjoyable to sort out.With an eye to your ability to expand, knowing that the current software might become obsolete in coming years Krogh seems to cover all the bases.So, if you find yourself wondering where the great photos you made on assignment in Alaska last year are or simply hoping to find the baby photos this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overkill?!

Alas, such was not the case.Mr. Krogh's guidance is, unfortunately, limited to the co-ordination of Adobe's Photoshop CS2 Bridge (which has well-known bugs) with his preferred catalog software iView Media Pro. His file preference is DNG.This book does not provide general guidance for a DAM system using your own preferred software - if you are not using Bridge and iView, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a great guide to managing thousands of photos","review":"One of the most difficult realities of managing thousands of digital photo images is how to label them in a consitent manner so that you can easily retrieve photos and keep track of photos that have been altered. Another important consideration is if you will be able to read the information as software and hardware changes occur. Peter Krogh makes logical suggestions and tells you why he chose to label an image in a particular manner. The DAM Book also has great suggestions on backing up photos. I have always struggled with labeling/numbering consistency, Peter Krogh makes it all very logical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peggy Would Be Proud","review":"Over the years Maria Muldaur has combined her vocal talents and intelligence to explore many areas of the pop music spectrum, always with very good results.

Featuring members of the Harry Connick Jr. Big Band rhythm section, Dan Hicks and stellar horns, this release is the both the best tribute to Peggy Lee and the best Maria Muldaur cd EVER!!

Crossgen Comics has,until now, been using artists who usually make all the books look like the're done by the same artist, but for some reason crossgen decided to fix something that isn't broken and it has floped in my eyes. The artists give no hint of a third demension and the characters look like paper dolls. The reapeted use of browns make the book dull and less appealing to the eyes. I read other comics from crossgen and will continue to do so but The path will never be one of those comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everquest is DEAD.","review":"Everquest was great when it first came out. It was so addictive that some people even got a divorce to be able to play more. It took up hundres of hours of my free time and I had no regrets. However, that was over 5 years ago.Today, with the release of World of Warcraft, many players have stopped playing Everquest. Populations on all servers are extremely low and guilds are having trouble recruiting people.With that being said, this expansion is simply a waste of money. Dragon raids require many people (usually 20 or more), who are high level (65+), and have the proper resist gear in order to win. There simply isn't enough people playing these days to do the raids, and there aren't any new people playing this game.This expansion should be given away for free, and the monthly subscription needs to be dropped to $0.99. Then, I can propbably ask my old buddies to log in and relive the old times. Otherwise, go buy World of Warcraft and save yourself $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a marketing professional, I was truly disappointed with this book.

Yes, I said she broke the cable, it is not pull out like the first time, it broke. I will have to shorten the cable to 77 feet and move it to a different tree to fix it, for the second time. I think it will work, just a lot of trial and error.I would not buy this again, I believe the spring is under sized and the cable broke.

Anybody reading this should try reading one of the earlier books(like #'s 1-14), and then read a more recent one. See if you can see the change. This book was still pretty good, though. I hope that there are a lot of new things in store for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna Netrebko: Opera Arias","review":"Miss Netrebko's beautiful voice does not disappoint in this varied selection of well-known and beloved opera arias.

She is beautiful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding debut album","review":"This is one of the best recent classical vocal albums. She has a beautiful voice and uses it with intelligence and feeling. I look forward to hearing more of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, she's pretty..","review":"I find Netrebko to be hyped. The basic voice is lovely and beautifully produced, but her bel-canto technique is not up to the standards set by other, superior singers in this much-recorded repertoire. The fact that her Jewel Song lacks trills or anything resembling them is a turnoff for me. And some of her runs and fiorature are uneasy. She studies with Renata Scotto. Couldn't Scotto have done something to improve her facility in this regard? Mme Marchese's absence is more lamented with each passing year! I did not keep this recording and the frantic advertisements for her second cd (that's not make-up, it's war-paint!!) did nothing to make me want that either. Sorry, I can't recommend.

Shame those hands had to scrub floors; hope she makes it on the cover of Vogue someday. However, she is not the Great New Hope for opera. That voice is not suited for bel canto, or Mozart. She sounds like a new Barbara Frittoli to me. Frittoli, with a dash of Fleming. She has that taffy-pull to her voice, like Fleming, without the heavy portamento and sighing and all those other awful Fleming tricks. The basic color of the voice is interesting, rather dark-hued, but the technique is not quite there, despite the studio producers' best attempts to turbo-charge her high notes.Sorry, guys, but for romantic French and Italian bel canto reperatoire, I am sticking with Natalie Dessay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake to buy this CD.","review":"Unlike Bartoli's or Hei-kyung Hong's new CDs, this CD was a bigdisappointment to me.I guess I just relied on the reviews by Grammophon Magazine andAmazon.com's review. Usually, I do listen the music before I buy.For this CD, I had no choice since there are no listening boothat the record store.Anyhow, I hates her mushy voice(kind of worst feature from Sutherland's voice). Her voice doesn't have anything special except annoying sound.Surely, she is very very beautiful. Perhaps, she will survive on stage because of the stage presence or volumm of her voice.However, I have a big doubt that she will be successful in recording field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case Logic Vertical Pouch","review":"I use this case for my iPhone 3GS - fits well, easy to get at the phone, and the magnetic closure works great.

Uses highly speculative linguistic clues. Biggest problem is ignorance of Indian, Indonesian, and even Arab navigation and technology - thereby lacking perspective and claiming too much for Ming fleets. With Menzies (but less extreme) he claims Chinese rounded Africa to Atlantic. He is unaware of Ajanta caves that have boat carving in early 7th century rather like a few on maps used speculating about Chinese from which broad conclusions are drawn. A very few new points are worth consideration. Minimal notes and limited familiary with the considerable academic literature on Indian Ocean. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"I am disappointed with the writing. It rambles and is had to figure out what points the author is trying to make. I don't know if I will be able to maintain my interest in the subject enough to figure out if there is something of value here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts Need Checking","review":"I have enjoyed previous issues of this book but I bought the current one expecting, as a Red Sox fan, the descriptions of the scoring of the playoff games and the play by play of the World Series. Unfortunately many innings were missing and the scores were not always accurate.The descriptions of the batting leaders for 2004 were also mistitled. It is too bad that an otherwise valuable record book was issued too hastily without checking the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome technical Death Metal!!!","review":"This album is incredible. Extremely technical, brutal, and tightly executed - every track holds its own and brings something interesting to the table. I was very sad to hear about Vitek; he was an incredible drummer, and passed away at such a young age. I don't know what the future holds for this band, but this is definitely an album worth checking out. Technical death metal at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Definitely some good metal here. Vocals hit a good mid-range, avoiding the tendency to fall into the same cliched growling vocal delivery that many bands do. Solid guitar and drum work, with some memorable riffs. There are also some slower bits (usually only a matter of seconds), which are well placed, and set up the punch of their heavier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect musicianship","review":"When I popped this baby in I was assaulted audioly with pummling riffs, technical drumming, and...the vocals..? The new vocalist sounds a little new Napalm Deathish. Sauron to me was better, but this does give the album a different feel. I am still floored as to how long this stayed in my car player before i finally took it in. I swear I think I listened to it 150 times IN A ROW! Seeing as these guys are one of my all time favorite bands, how could I not suggest getting them? If you don't know them by now, better get to it, because these guys are the next Cryptopsy, Atheist, and Suffocation. Looking forward to more albums from these guys in the near future.

Live, they put on a great show and that is what got me into them in the first place. This album just doesnt cut it. There is a new vocalist, and I cant stand it. Gone are the low rumblings from Winds of Creation and other Decapitated releases. The album kinda sounds like The Negation (which bored the hell out of me), but with crappy vocals.Lots of reviewers tend to say \\"if you like Behemoth or Cryptopsy, you should check out Decapitated.\\" Well, Behemoth and Decapitated do have somewhat of a similar sound (kinda like early Vader), but does that mean it's good ? Not really.I honestly cant believe how over-hyped this band and their past two records are. Sure, Decapitated plays some decent death metal, but its nothing that hasnt been done before. The new Suffocation blows this away."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY BE A HATER....","review":"why all the negative comments? people expect too much, from bands that really limit themselves musically. Sure,decapitated has evolved from it original \\"core\\", but really its for the better. i have been a fan sincetheir debut, and im glad the old singer is gone. everyone i turned onto this band hated his vox anyway, stating he was \\"too cookie monster\\".this album is short, but so violent and heavy, any more would make you die. track 7 is the shiznit! hands down THE BEST extreme metal of '06.the drummer is the best of the genre, just try and prove me wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your reading time","review":"I find this book to be extremely dull and lifeless. I love studying geomorphology, but this book is almost enough to turn me away. The graphs, diagrams, and charts are overwhelming. It seems to based more on statistics then observations of how systems really work. The photos are boring and uninspirational. Reading through the text is like slowly dragging my fingernails down a chalkboard. I can barely make it through 5 pages at a time without losing complete interest. The explanations of how systems and processes work makes no sense to me. I find myself having to cross refernce this text with other geology texts from different classes. Also, many of the people that are quoted are from the 1940's and '50's. Ridiculous!! It reads like a computer assembly manual in Japanese. Granted, the text does cover a wide range of geomorphological features, it does not cover them well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color Challenge","review":"This book taught me the ability to mix colors unlike any bookI've ever used or learned from before.It was a delightful experience.Much like a very needed vacation away from stress.I had so much funwith this form of art & painting.I wish this author would publish more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking in Faith","review":"\\"Is it requiring steps of faith\\" is the fourth question in the six-question method for spiritual discernment in my book (Direction: Discernment for the Decisions of Your Life) so I read Fran's book with speacial interest.

You'll be challenged and encouraged in your faith-walk, and with the faith-lifters at the end of each chapter, you'll also learn how to make faith your dominant stride.

The only thing that would have made it better would have been a full season. The writer strike got a hold of this one thus shortening some of the funny. The laughs that this season delivers however, lingers just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Season","review":"I know everyone is whining around about the price for a shortened season, but let's face the facts, Season 4 was excellent even against tough expectations. The humor was still buoyant and creative, and the storylines still had energy as the twists and turns stayed fresh. Storylines were also craftily constructed to show parallels between characters, or wrapped together 2 or 3 seperate storylines, etc.After the slighest of let-downs in Season 3, Season 4 still shows the punch and zip of a fun and humorous mockumentary that's well edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I am disappointed with season 4 - it started like fun but truthful comedy in seasons 1-3 but it shifted to soap-opera in season 4.

It is ridiculous to pay this much for HALF of a season basically. You aren't getting your money's worth and if NBC sees big profits from this it will encourage them to get away with it in the future.

This is not a full season and so it should be priced as such. I bought the first season for around $20 it didn't have a lot of episodes that season, so I felt the price was fair. To pay more than $20 for season 4 is way to much in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making up for lost Profit","review":"I think that NBC, or whoever sells these dvds, is trying to make up for lost profits (fancy word for money) that were suffered during the writers' strike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Funny!","review":"My husband got these as a gift.

Therefore you can imagine my joy when I found out that my DVD player was multi region and therefore could play The Office Season 4. This season is by no means the best season, however it is still hilarious. It is well worth a buy if you, like me were dying to know what happened after the end of the season 3 climax.Also, I have to add that in my opinion, American DVDs seem to be of a better standard than their European counterparts. Both in packaging, content and freebies.All in all, an amazing product that I would recommend to anyone State side or European."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Such a funny show!

I was a fan of the hour-long episodes because a lot of the latest season's episodes seem too short. Not a lot of episodes... probably because of the hour-longs and the writers strike.I just wish there were more commentaries and special features. This DVD set seems to have even less than seasons 2 and 3.Cause, I mean, without the commentaries and special features I might at well record the season myself and not bother buying the DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over 200 minutes shorter than season 3 for the same price.","review":"Season 4 was great; though not as funny as other seasons. I guess everything goes down hill after a while. Anyway, I have bought the past 3 seasons the first day they were available on DVD. I will not be buying this one for a while. I would buy it for 19.99-24.99 but nothing over that. It is not even a full season even with the episodes that are around 40 minutes. According to the Walmart web site it is only 2/3 as long as season 3. Ridiculous Season 4 = 320 min. while season 3 = over 560 min. I'll just buy it used later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great season but...","review":"I love the Office more than most shows on tv today however, why does NBC feel the need to charge so much for a season that was half as long because of the writer'strike?

But this season... what happened? Are they out of ideas? Are there new writers? What used to be witty and genius has turned obvious and slapstick. Also, it was depressing and tried to be artsy. Please! It's the Office. I liked it better before. Season 2 was the best so far. Season 4 was crap. I can't believe I got it the day it came out.

I recommend them for anyone who has ever worked anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good season","review":"First off, I must say that the humor found in The Office series is amazing. The writers and actors capture the awkward situations occurring in every day office life (and then some!) with brilliance. That said, I was slightly disappointed with Season 4.

Even though this season had is obvious struggles due, I think, mostly to the writers' strike, I still think this season was great! Every character is hilarious. And, yes, even though he became quite wierd and unlikeable toward the end of the season, I will still miss Toby. Overall: Great Season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Not Great","review":"Season Four of \\"The Office\\" was my least favorite, both because the writers' strike affected the number of episodes and because I found the plot line between Michael and Jan to be more stressful than funny. However, The Office is my favorite show and I have all of the other seasons on DVD. This season still has some great parts to it and it is definitely worth owning. I also appreciate the fact that Amazon priced it lower than the previous seasons, presumably to compensate for the shorter season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sickness, I know","review":"If you haven't seen The Office you are missing out. I cannot stress how much you are missing. It's rare to find something that makes you laugh out loud week after week and The Office is just such a rare find. It's on NBC on Thursday nights, you can buy the DVD set or you can download it from iTunes. I buy it on iTunes when it comes out because each episode warrants several viewings. I then buy it on DVD to see the deleted scenes. A sickness, I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"This episode is why I love the office","review":"This episode is so hilarious, so dry and so emotionally disturbing. Just an Office classic as the gang joins Jan and Michael for an ill-fated dinner party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair price, great show","review":"Even though the season was cut short, the price Amazon is charging for this season isn't too bad.-Best Buy's charging the same price-Circuit City's charging $49.98-WalMart's charging $31.86I haven't checked anywhere else but I don't think you're gonna get much cheaper than $30.

Can't wait for Season 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!","review":"I'm patiently awaiting the release of season 4 and looking forward to season 5.

But think about it, 5 out of the 15 are hour long episodes. This season is just a tad bit shorter in time than the 2nd season and the 2nd season costs the same. Also it really doesn't matter how long it is, because this was the best season ever! Definatly buy this, you will not be disapointed in the slightest. But wait, there's more! Before you pre order, or buy this, I recomend getting the exclusive gift set. I know Best Buy has one, and Target will to. Last year, It was totaly worth the 10 extra bucks.

Beyond that, the classic 'Dinner Party' episode is the shining light of this season. There are some great character arcs for Kevin, Toby, and Dwight, and the subplots with Ryan run throughout the season, culminating in a terrific surprise. Of course, Steve Carell's portrayal of Michael Scott holds front and center in this season, and his glue holds everything together like mayo holds tuna salad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but sweet-ish","review":"First of all this is a short season! A few more episodes than season 1.In this season you got what you waited for at the end of season 3. Jim/Pam Mike/Jan it's funny as the previous seasons.

The discs were in fine condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"remember","review":"I watched this season and yes it is not the best season, but real fans do not complain. It's the writers and producers.

Remember, the office won an emmy but the cast was the most average people there....just like the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Office Season 4","review":"I love the Office! However this is not their strongest season and i really believe its because of the Writers Strike. There are about half the episodes of a normal season and each disk only has 3 to 4 episodes. There is a lot in this season but it feels rushed and you miss a lot of the richness that was in the second and third season. However its a must have to follow the story and come on its still the Office so its still amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I love \\"The Office\\" and was happy to be able to pre-order it! I only wish I could have gotten the edition that is offered only at Target stores with all the extra goodies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHORT BUT STILL GREAT","review":"Even though this season was cut short, I highly recommend it because there is no humor in other shows like The Office. Some of the episodes are 1 hour-long.Unfortunately, there are only four commentaries (if you like to listen to them, just like I do), but overall it is a great season."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Season Too Many","review":"They should have stopped after three.Season four is where the show's humorous moments are outweighed by the \\"this is just too stupid\\" moments.In one episode, for example, Michael Scott is driving a car with Dwight. The GPS system in the car says \\"right turn\\" and, with Dwight protesting that they should only bear right, Michael turns right and drives into a lake.You know the show is losing it when Michael Scott is portrayed as even more demented than Dwight.Season four is still laugh-out-loud funny at times, but usually not enough to make it worth your time.

Although there aren't as many episodes in this season--thanks to the writers' strike--the show makes up for it in humor. This set is very high quality, and the picture and sound are excellent. I definitely recommend this set for anyone obsessed with \\"The Office\\", or anyone looking for a hilarious show to start watching--because once you start, you can't stop!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I love this show, simply hilarious.Season 4 isn't as funny as earlier seasons, but if you're a fan of any episode of the show, you should watch and enjoy this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awkward love","review":"Love this show, awkward though it may be.

I have hope for season five, though, and I have faith in the writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My dvd case came crushed because it was shipped in a simply padded envelope.

That said, I'm just chiming in to lend support to this album. Above the Weeping World is the only Insomnium album I own, so I can't compare it to other works in their catalog. I do, however, listen to a great deal of melo-death, and I can say definitively that this is the best melodic death metal album I've bought in a long time. Drawn to Black is, in my opinion, the stand out track.If you've exhausted the supply of classic entries in the genre (Slaughter of the Soul, The Jester Race, etc) and are looking to expand to a band still releasing strong material, I can't recommend Insomnium highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness...","review":"One of the best melodic death metal albums of 2006. It begins with the calming sound of rain pouring over you, and it just slowly brings you into this album. Then it hits you, excellent guitar, pounding drums, awesome bass, and some of the best metal vocal around today. I've listened to this album at least once a week since I got it back when it first came out, it's a must have among metal fans.

Eckert is one of my favorite books. I think this book can be read or listened to by all ages. The book tells the story through the eyes of the family, Ben and the villagers. While reading the book, you will find yourself comparing what they did in a certain situation with what you would have done. The main theme is the conflict of what people think of others when they act, talk and do things you find are strange.The story begins with Ben's brother and sisters going home and thinking of what had happened before (read Incident at Hawk 's Hill to understand) when George Burton shows up. Ben feeling like an animal caught runs..., finds a boat..., is found by an Indian boy and brought back to the Indian boy's village, fills fear, lonely and then love. Return to Hawk's Hill is a book you can't stop reading until it's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all its cracked up to be...","review":"this game isn't that great. it gets boring really fast. its sort of like tetris, but the reverse, you have to build a tower instead of getting rid of blocks...its more fun with more than one person, because you get to throw bombs at them, and in custom mode you have to build up and throw bombs, but it still gets old too fast. there should be more to it, more options and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am very happy with these dumbbells. Just 2 of them take the place of 26 regular ones.

I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Bell Adjustable Weight Dumbbell with Stand, TB560","review":"After your last repetition, don't drop these on the mat like you would with a regular solid dumbbell. It could cause the spacer inside the dumbbell to break which prevents the weights from being released from the unit, which happened to mine.I called Performance Fitness Systems (1-888-999-9490) and talked to Rick. He was very helpful. I had to do some troubleshooting to the unit because Rick and I did not want to send the unit back as a whole, because it's heavy. So, after opening up the unit, I discovered that one of the larger spacers broke which causes one of the larger weights to not to be able to get released from the dumbbell. Rick had 3 new spacers sent to me. Since the incident, I am more careful to try not to drop it down hard after the last rep. and the they worked great since. I've been using it for about a month and a half now."},{"rating":"1","title":"20lb weight falls off","review":"The 20lb weight on one of the dumbbells fell off 3 times in one set of 20 reps.

I don't know if it was the more likeable and real main character (who shares my name!) in Givenchy or what, but I didn't like Jennifer as much as Melanie, she felt a little flat. I felt that this book wasn't as well fleshed-out as the last one, and there was a more exclusive feeling to the riddles that turned me off a little, since they were all Broadway-based, which barred me from even trying to figure out the clues on my own. But never mind that, it was still fun and entertaining and fast-paced, and it certainly kept my attention.

Basically the same as the previous novel, except some different characters and of course a different style of shoe. I found the novel to be entertaining, but lacking in comparison to the first. The first one had all of the exciting and intrigue of a new novel. Since this is so similar, well it has fallen short.The story is about Jennifer, who was the roommate in the first book. And how she gets sucked into the PSW game along with the hunky FBI agent from book one.

The radio works well, you can record songs off the radio. The screen is kinda small for viewing quality photos, I don't save photos on it so that doesn't bother me. Easy to put music on.

The screen sticks all the time causing us to have to pop the battery out so we can even get it to shut off.

I called the online retailer and the lady asked me to send an E-mail to their tech support department and wait. Then she HANG UP MY CALL! That's very rude.In general, I believe this is the SanDisk issue because those items were missing in the brand new, sealed hard plastic container. SanDisk is able and capable to prevent this issue.

The charger and download plug port is poorly designed. Instead of the plug interfacing with a stiff card with contacts, the plug needs to slip over free-standing pins the thickness of a human hair. If you are off by a 10th of a millimeter, you will bend a pin. If you bend a pin you can't download or charge. Without the ability to charge, the unit is worthless. The design and screen are nice, but it makes a pretty light paper weight after you bend a pin. Stay away from this unit, until SanDisk redesigns the faulty plug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns off constantly","review":"This thing turns off constantly.

So I exchanged it at the store for the same exact one, and after about 2 months or so happened again! I could fiddle with the jack and have it a little out of the socket and then I could usually hear out of both buds, but that was a hassle and if it got bumped I couldn't hear anything at all.It might be some strange bad luck i have with them, but I decided to change brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly pleased","review":"Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility.

It automatically wants to convert them when you drag them on.I have some WAV files (meditation) that I do not want converted.I would send this back, but it is in a clamshell plastic that has to be destroyed to be opened. In hindsight, the edges were very thin, so it was probably already a re-seal.It also uses a proprietary connector for USB.I'm very unhappy - $45 wasted. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome if you use Rockbox","review":"I bought this player for my mother.

Anyway, he lost the data/charger cable, so I ordered one on Amazon. It took about a day for me to get used to how it worked and how to navigate. So far, the cable shipped today and I've been listening to FM. I am completley suprised by the strength of the FM Channels. I can get a station from 20 miles away! The FM Sound is clear. I like the idea of that. The battery life is another cool thing, I've had this running for about 5 hours now and the battery level when I first got it was about 50% full, it stil looks like theres 40% battery left. I like the rechargable battery, and how photos can be stored on the player. Just another great MP3 player, and I recommend anyone looking for an MP3 player - GET THIS!

So far, I've got 31 1-hour sermons on it, and I could get another 20 or so. My only real complaint is that the display colors cannot be changed for more contrast. It is very difficult to see what is being selected, and that's not a good thing when trying figure out what's next while practicing poor driving habits.

I need to loosen up and enjoy this medium. This book is just what I needed. It beautifully illustrates how to paint with a glazing technique that has gotten me excited about watercolors again. By pouring paint onto wet paper, the author shows how to produce brilliant, clean colors. My paintings usually turn out pale, but now I know how to use this poured glazing technique to get livlier color.I especially liked the section that shows how to create thirty special textural techniques. There are easy to follow demonstrations and I liked the \\"helpful hints\\" that are offered in addition to the written explainations.

Certainly, this is not a case that will take a \\"licking and keep on ticking\\", but it is good to protect your notebook in a briefcase or backpack. It resists the occasional splash of coffee, and cleans up easily. The padding is adequate for the protection it affords, and the lip at the top inside, under the zipper, is a great improvement over other cases. It protects the ports on the side of the notebook. This is especially valuable with the new lightning bolt technology, as adding this isn't exactly cheap! Take it from me, this is the best thing from down under in a long time.

It is lacking originality and exterior/interior photos of the haciendas themselves. Text content is \\"ok\\" but repetitive and sounds like that from other books. Very overpriced for what it presents. The authors mention that they are building their own \\"new\\" hacienda. If they have such a true love for the old ones why didn't they rescue one from ruin??? Very commercial in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book","review":"The New Hacienda is a beautiful and inspiring book for anyone who loves Mexico's art, design, and hacienda-style culture. From traditional architectural elements to colonial antiques, the book reveals many rich details for those seeking ideas and inspiration in creating a hacienda-style home of their own.

If you haven't read this mini-series and is planning on it, I won't spoil it for you. Just know that as usual Elizabeth is right and the bad guy will be stupid enough to let her catch them. Don't everyone wish they were as perfect as the Wakefield twins? They also end up on top, regardless of who they hurt.

This book tells teaches more than how to be psychic, but also where it all comes from, psychology and philosophy, it also combinds scientific facts and experiments to prove psychic existance, thus, giving you a broader aspect of the psychic phenomenon. For those who have finished your beginner books, and want something more in depth and fullfilling, this is the book. After reading this book, I had to order more Edgar Cayce books! Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an \\"Edgar Cayce Guide\\"","review":"This is a good intro into the psychic world, but why is it called an Edgar Cayce Guide? There really isn't that much on Edgar Cayce's technique's, advice, or view on things. Definitely a misnomer. There's a lot of content on other examples of psychic testing and abilities from other sources, but it's almost a ploy putting Cayce in there because he's kind of just mentioned among these other sources. Almost all of the book is spent giving evidence on proving that psychic ability is possible and very little practical techniques until close to the very end.If you want to read about Edgar Cayce and his advice on psychic abilities, read a different book. You'll be dissapointed if you buy this thinking that it's actually an Edgar Cayce guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is a very solid read, expounding on the spiritual philosophies of the \\"sleeping prophet\\", Edgar Gayce, who may well have been one of the most gifted psychics of his era. The author, Dr. Henry Reed does a nice job of interlapping science and metaphysical properties to help guide us into fairly easy to understand excersizes to expand our psychic awareness and abilities, based on Cayce's teachings. I really enjoyed the descriptions and hypothesis of the soul and collective consciousness, and the section on hypnosis as an induction to opening ESP and intuitive awareness was quite fascinating. Would definitely recommend this one to all pursuing their psychic gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended reading!","review":"This book is awesome!!

The book struck me as a 'rush to publish' to capitalize on Lance Armstrong and the TDF.While there are some nice photos of past Tours, I think my money would have been better invested elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maillot Junk","review":"Buyer beware of this book. It is a US edition of a French book that has been available since 1999. The jacket for the book says it has been updated to include a chapter on Lance Armstrong. Hardly - they added a few mediocre photos. Worse yet, I have found errors in the information provided in the body of the book. The editor may use the excuse that tables have not been updated for the 2001 edition. OK, but there are still errors from the 1999 edition. I had hoped to learn something from this book, but can't trust it. As Groucho once asked, \\"How many Frenchmen can't be wrong?\\" By purchasing this book (from publisher, not Amazon), I found at least one. C'est la vie? One star for historic photos. Check out Graham Watson if you want current photos. His work is outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice complete set","review":"Have used only 3 of the lenses so far and they work ok.

All the filters are stackable except for the moon filter. I checked to make sure all the elements were fully multi-coated and everything checked out as stated. I'm not checking these eyepieces based on what they say but rather by a technique acquired from an astronomy book. The accessory kit took two months to get but like earlier reviews its a decent kit for the price and wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starter kit.","review":"I just bought a Celestron EQ130 and it's a fantastic starter scope but only came with two lenses, a 20mm and a 10mm. I found myself in want of a greater selection. In particular, a low magnification lens with a wide field of view and a high magnification lens and barlow. This kit comes with all that and more and the quality seems to be decent. The filters seem to get the job done, I had a nice view of Jupiter last night and was able to use a filter to remove the glare and get some more detail. Considering the price of purchasing the pieces individually this is a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great Kit","review":"The eyepieces included with this kit are marked with the type and size (e.g., \\"Plossl 32mm\\") and the manufacturer (\\"Celestron\\"). None of the names of other Celestron eyepiece suites (e.g. Nexstar or Axiom) are shown. They appear to be well made and have good coatings but don't appear to be of the same quality as other Celestron eyepieces. My guess is that these are generic, low-cost plossl's that Celestron has packed into this kit.I don't have enough experience with these eyepieces yet to give a good review of their performance. The are far better with greater brightness and resolution than the cheap MA types that were included with my scope (Bushnell). The eye relief on the 6mm is quite short.Overall, this kit is still a bargain for those who need to upgrade to a reasonably good quality and very complete set of eyepieces and filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"EYE PIECESES WITH CASE","review":"I rate this a 5 star. With the eye piecies all are fanominally made, and the case that I got with the eye piecies is the greatest made. Again rating is a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"No single return","review":"I purchased this and found a bad 9mm lens. Neither the seller nor Celestron would replace the lens unless I returned the entire set. If one could pass inspection without being found, I figured I better not chance another set with more or a different lens being bad.I just decided to eat the cost of the lens.You'd think a company that makes lens' would have some type of inspection process to see if there were any problems but apparently not.There's really no alternative to buying this, each lens and filter would cost well over $500 if purchased separately, so take your chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After reading the reviews a bought the accessory kit. I compared the eyepieces and the barlow with standard inexpensive plossls (orion, knigth owl, gso) and the celestron's optics looked the worst one. I sold the kit after 2 weeks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Dirty can not be used","review":"The first lens out of plastic bag can not be used. Dust blocks light. How dirty can you get?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal for the money.","review":"Good eyepieces for the money. They aren't the end-all, be-all top of the line, but they do the job just fine. And considering you can easily spend three times as much by buying them individually, you really can't beat this deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for I guess","review":"I'm fairly new to astronomy, but I expected better quality when I purchased this eyepiece kit from Celestron. After reading some of the reviews here, I was convinced that these were going to be some decent eyepieces and filters. This kit may be alright for some, but I found them lacking in quality of fit and build and would not recommend them to anyone who has the desire to use the high-power eyepieces (9x, 6x, 4x, etc). I bought these because of the low price tag, and for the most part, I regret not just buying one or two better quality eyepieces from Televue. The filters were really \\"cheap\\" too."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I ordered this knowing full well that Celestron lenses weren't the greatest in the world, but this was still a little disappointing. When using these lenses in my telescope, all of the images were quite blurry, no matter which lens I used. The filters were less than impressive as well. My yellow filter arrived with a very noticeable scratch through the middle that makes it nearly worthless for using with the telescope. Also, the foam insert for my case does not match the one in the description and did not include space to store my own lenses and that was one of the factors for me that lead to my decision to buy this. Buyer beware, this looks like a great deal up front, but the quality of these lenses and filters is quite sub par."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best value kit out there","review":"This kit is one of the best values on the market today. I could not be happier with this kit, it is very high quality and all of the eyepieces and filters are of the best quality as well. I would not recommend this kit though if you dont have a very powerful telescope, because they have other kits that dont have as many eyepieces as this one or filters, but they are just the right pieces for certain scopes. Overall, noone can beat this kit... especially for this price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome value","review":"These eyepieces are a great value and an easy way to try out a variety of sizes. All work very well and are usable on my 4 inch refractor. With my 8 inch SCT the 6mm eyepiece is hard to use but that is to be expected unless the conditions are very good. If you wear glasses the eye relief can be a problem, I had to put my contacts in to make observing easier.I don't like using colored filters so the included ones are pretty worthless to me. However, the included moon filter is great and works very very well especially during a full moon. The included case is also very good.This is a great little package. It will allow you to find the eyepieces you use most and then invest in 1 or 2 really good pieces of glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless without a quality scope","review":"Bought this kit for a Celestron NextStar 8-inch SC scope. Most of these eyepieces are useless because the Celestron telescopes don't have the quality optics necessary to take advantage of their power. The most powerful eye piece (not lens or filter) would probably only be useful for looking directly at the sun (it's soooooo dark). I joke, I joke: Don't look at the sun without the appropriate filter.Using these eyepieces in a Celestron is much like mounting a 24-power Leupold scope on an Uzi: It ain't gonna do anything for your accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best price around!","review":"My puppy is on these for her skin, we aren't sure what is wrong with it but our vet recommended we try these.

The thermostat and control unit at the top is poorly ventillated and is heated by the elements.2. The control unit generates a lot of heat. This warms the temperature sensor as much as 10-20 degrees F above room temperature, so the heater will only warm the room to 60 to 70 degrees F at the highest setting of 80 F.Of course this is a good thing if you want to save energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This machine is handy for a small room. It definately gets hot. I really like that it has so many setting options for heat temp.

The characters are fun, flaky and real...like so many of my friends! The story line kept my attention and the descriptions are truly reflective of old Cape Cod. It was one of those books where you want to keep reading to see what happens next, yet you want to read s-l-o-w-l-y because you don't want the story to end.

The first is a collection of pieces that might be said to have a French theme: a review and appreciation of Edith Wharton's account of a car journey taken through France, a piece of French songsters of the sixties, a very entertaining look at the perils of the Tour de France. The second half is nearly all given over to Flaubert, Barnes's obsession. The essays on the great writer are fascinating, especially those centered around his correspondence. Barnes's love for the writer and the man is contagious. I had no great enthusiasm for Flaubert, despite having loved Barnes's 'Flaubert's Parrot', but since reading this book I have read 'Madame Bovary' with a great deal of pleasure and have begun looking into the correspondence.

After a fast-paced, dazzling opening sequence, hilariously describing the teen-aged Barnes' first encounters across the English Channel, we slow down to pick through some highlights in the lives of some of the top French authors, poets, filmmakers and other cultural icons, eventually easing to a crawl through exhaustive detail regarding the author's main interest, Flaubert and his world.

This has happened most recently with the VX8600, followed a few months later by the VX8700.This was also the case with the VX8000. While it is an excellent phone in its own right, a few months after its release, the VX8100 was released, which improved on the one major deficiency of the VX8000 - its large size. The VX8000 is a bulky phone, although some may appreciate this due to the enhanced durability it provides -- I have dropped this phone hundreds of times without any issue! The VX8100 also features bluetooth, which is missing from the VX8000. If you don't have a choice between the 8000 and 8100, the 8000 still comes highly recommended - it has a beautiful large screen, the speakerphone works well, and the battery life is excellent.--Robert H.

Robert E. Howard was the creator of Conan and none of his stories appear in this volume. What is here is the work of enthusiatic but far less talented individuals who were such big fans of Conan that they were inspired to write their own tales. I have read all of their stories and find that they are immediately recognizable as pale imitations of the original.In sum, Conan is well worth reading and all of the original Howard stories are now available in paperback.

The mutant thing (Eye, Ear, Arm) in here isn't obvious like you'd see on X-Men or some such, and are rather reasonable and considerably more low-key.Honestly, this isn't a book for just young adults.

I cannot do that.The symptoms are that the device installs, the software installs, I declare to it my SSID and encryption, and it connects fine, sees the wireless network, and works for a while. Then, the connection drops out and the device loses connection to the network.

In defense of modern poetry, they emerged as a distinct literary cult (\\"the curious Chelsea trinity\\"), rivaling such Twenties cliques as the Algonquin Round Table, the Bloomsbury group, and the self-exiles in Paris. The Sitwells' impressive output of poetry and criticism was spiced by a generous sprinkling of controversy and scandal. Pearson's engaging biography shows how the family inspired and nurtured its own myth. Along the way, he exposes some less publicized truths which hovered behind the family facade. This book is full of interest and information: a worthy addition to any Anglophile's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals many connections with key 20th Century literary icons","review":"Sometimes when one reads a book of over 500 pages it turns out a lot of the content isn't that interesting after all. I enjoyed this treatment of the Sitwells both to find out more about them but also to see how so many other writers, composers, and artists fitted into the first few decades of the 20th Century. Lots of the people brought into the story I knew a little bit about, but this book really helped group them together in a more meaningful way. The author writes well, it doesn't get boring. About the only criticism I have is that the word \\"facade\\" shows up too many times. Edith Sitwell and her brothers put together a performance of poetry and music with this title, and I think the author let himself get carried away with use of the word. You do notice it jumping off the page, but it's a minor criticism of a good book.

Bonnie Scotland is full of laughs and well worth the cost! It has a nice plot and very few dull moments.

This heater worked perfectly for a few weeks, then gradually produced less and less heat. The wick is soft and without carbon hard spots, but simply won't rise high enough to generate meaningful flame and heat. Possibly the gear for raising the wick has malfunctioned. I ended up buying a second heater locally - which works well- and setting aside the KW-11F until I have time to take it apart and fix it (if possible).

Yes, the book is filled with speculation - none of it outlandish - about the possible events in Shakespeare's life, but Mr. Wood always presents evidence for his theories. Just as important, Mr. Wood, unlike many critics and biographers, tries to connect events in Shakespeare's life to his work, e.g. how his son's death made him a greater writer.I suspect many will condemn Mr. Wood for his speculation, but when it comes to much of Shakespeare's life, what else can we do but speculate?Also, Mr. Wood paints a vivid, compelling picture of life in London during the Elizabethan Era.Finally, this book has an excellent theory about why and for whom the sonnets were written.Reading this book made me feel as if I almost knew Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book retreads other (better) scholars' work and the \\"new\\" revelations are anywhere from 20 to 60 years old.

Wood's fanciful conjectures about Robert Southwell & Shakespeare come from chapter 18 of Christopher Devlin's 1956 biography of Southwell. I don't have space for his other debts: Save your time and skip reading this one. If you like the pictures (which are good) wait for it to get remaindered (which won't be long).

He misunderstands, as he hopes his readers do, that multitudes of dynamic and unique cultures existed and continue to exist despite the cultural power of Pan-Indainism. Nerburn like many other Pan-Indian authors, many of them tribal memebers themselves, takes advantage of the misinformed public to peddle his fiction as fact.

These kids just happen to be Jewish.Then I was shown an article blog by the author, where she admits that Fiona Rosenbloom is a pen name and she has absolutely NO AUTHORITY or knowledge about the Jewish religion. Basically, she was approached to write the book and saw it as a chance to make some money. She even chose a Jewish sounding pen name, and dresses up in a wig when she does author appearances. Even after admitting to not knowing what she was talking about, she went on to write a sequel.PLEASE PLEASE do not give this author your money. There are better books out there!

This book stood out for me because of Anna Ivey's experience as serving as dean of admissions for the University of Chicago, whereas many of the other authors seemed to be law students or prominent figures within prestigious law schools, but no one directly related to admissions. I really appreciated the frank and straightforward nature of this book. Anna Ivey makes an excellent point in her book; while students often sugarcoat their application, admissions officers also sugarcoat the application process. This book is an excellent resource for prospective law students looking for straightforward answers to their questions. And at only $14, it's an economical one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!

I got tired of the author rambling on about how horrible her body was and how unappealing to her husband her body was...maybe the book was therapy for her. She also relies heavily on the medical model of birth, which makes sense for someone who only sees herself as \\"getting fat\\" while her body is growing her fetus, but it was not helpful in allaying my own concerns and neuroses (it's most common line of advice: \\"Call your Doctor\\").

I threw it away instead of recycling it","review":"I have never read such an awful book on pregnancy. While the author tries to make some jokes, in general she has a TERRIBLE attitude about birth! She clearly has issues of her own surrounding her own body and birth experience, inflicting it upon others. Her book is not at all objective, I found alot of it to be written as a scare tactic! Usually I give books to stores to be re-sold, but felt better about ripping it up, knowing it was one less copy in circulation. I hope women who choose to read this also read other books! My favorite: A Good Birth A Safe Birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"C-Sections are a GOOD thing?!?!?","review":"I was so excited to find a funny book on pregnancy because I take a pretty light-hearted approach to life. But [bad] information is [bad]information, and I think this book is full of it. Example: A scheduled C-Section allows you to be calm at birth and maintain great vaginal tone. Well, when I had my C-Section, I was scared and physically miserable, I couldn't hold the baby for a long time, and I hated having my baby in an operating room. The incision took WEEKS to recover from! And the scar was ropey and sensitive for a year, and I'll have it for the rest of my life!!!! All to avoid going to the hospital spontaneously and to keep good vag. tone? I don't think so. Vicki needs to tell the whole stories about each of the medical procedures she seems to love so much, otherwise her book is a funny bunch of dangerous [information]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 0 stars is more like it!","review":"Three words, Don't Buy It! Can you say shallow? Vicki sure can, as she reeks of it.

There are many other great books out there, do yourself a favor and keep looking as this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"This book promises much more than it delivers. I found it to be ridiculous - suggesting that excerise during pregnancy is silly because you're just going to get fat anyway, that drinking diet coke is just fine and that husbands are generally worthless and don't expect any help or support from them. The author promotes the use of drugs during labor and can't seem to understand that not everyone shares her views. Save your money and your time. This book attempted to scare you into her way of thinking. To me this seemed more like a justification for her behavior during her four pregnancies rather than a sincere helpful guide. Yeah thanks for the tip on not wearing half shirts when you're 7 months prego!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Grandma's Guide\\"","review":"Ok, I picked up this book, thinking, \\"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\". This should be a current, hip book about being pregnant! I am disappointed to report that it is the complete opposite. The first thing I thought when I finished reading was that this should be renamed, \\"Grandma's Guide to Pregnancy.\\" This book is in desperate need of a revision. The author refers to stir-up pants and the show Cheers as if they are still currently \\"en vogue.\\" She also recommends not exercising during pregnancy, making comments like \\"no one ever looks fit during pregnancy.\\" This was clearly written before anybody saw Madonna pregnant, and that was over 9 years ago. I gained no insight, and certainly could not relate to the author. I would not recommend this book to any woman currently pregnant who is looking for a \\"girlfriend\\" experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy with a sence of HUMOR","review":"This is such a GREAT book! Not only is it extremely informative, its a riot as well. I think the best part for me was all the down-and-dirty stuff about pregnancy that it covers: the stuff that your embarrassed to ask you're doctor about and the stuff that your mama might not tell you. Its also easy (and fun) to read without all kinds of medical terminology. This is a wonderful book, especially for first time and young mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fun","review":"Its pretty clear that the author is relating *HER* perspective, you may not share it. But if you consider pregnancy a means to an end and not the defining nine (ten!) months of your life, you will probably enjoy this book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but a few things bugged me.","review":"This book is amusing, but as a first time mom, and scared to death, this book didn't really help me much. There are a few cute parts, but the overall negative attitudes towards 'natural childbirth' and her comments about the 'dismissive/apathetic' father really, really bugged me. My husband is not like that, in any way. After finishing this book, I realized I -did not- want to go through this experience alone. And this book didn't help reassure me.It's too bad, because there are some really cute parts in it, but I would not recommend it to new, young, Wiccan/Pagan, 'New Age' or Natural Childbirth focussed moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much. . .","review":"I received this book as a gift. I was nervous about pregnancy and after reading just a few chapters was even more nervous. The what to expect books are so much more positive and easier to navigate through, answering questions on just what you want to know, and not what you don't. Everyone's pregnancy is different. I think her pregnancies were not the greatest experiences for her. For a first-time mom, sometimes it's nice to know just what is relevant to your own pregnancy. \\"Girlfriend's Guide\\" is not my taste, not my humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This book made me feel depressed and scared about pregnancy and birth - exactly the opposite of what I was looking for. Everything is written in a sarcastic way, which I think was meant to be humor. I found it insulting and factually very inaccurate. In fact, some of her statements are irresponsibly incorrect. I would not want her girlfriends as my own. If you want some facts about childbirth without the fear mongering read The Thinking Women's Guide to Birth by Henci Goer. It's old but the facts remain true today and are based on solid research. As for a guide to pregnancy? I'm not going to waste my money on any other books and will just enjoy the next 7 months - whatever it throws at me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book has made me laugh and it also has helped me to feel more calm and understand better what's happening with my body.

It was given to me by a friend early in my pregnancy, I just had my first child, so of coarse I was reading everything I could get my hands on. I guess the author thinks she's being funny.....guess I just didn't get her \\"humor\\". What I found especially offensive was the way she described all the horrible ways your body is going to change, and how fat and ugly you'll be while pregnant. I finally had enough, and threw it in the trash to make sure I wouldn't read any more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iovine's book is narrow-minded and insulting.","review":"My sister received this book as a gift last year while she was pregnant. She began reading and switched to another after seeing all of the husband references. She is unmarried by choice, and disliked being spoon fed stereo-typical ideals regarding family, when all she wanted was to learn about pregnancy. I learned that I was pregnant not too long ago and someone recommended this book, because we already owned it I decided to take a look. I am single as well, although not by choice. I would love to have a partner to share my pregnancy with, but that is unfortunately not the case. The author suggests in the opening parargraph of the book that babies are only to be celebrated under certain circumstances. I for one believe all babies, regardless of their parentage, deserve to be celebrated. This author should have considered the era and audience for which she was writing before alienating her book from many of the women I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste","review":"I don't recommend this book.

So to humor her, buy her book. But if you want helpful, truthful information, don't waste your money. I read the entire book and can best describe it as \\"cynical\\" and \\"misleading\\". If you are like me, you are excited about your first pregnancy but also feeling that you have much to learn. So buy some books that are actually helpful, like the very famous \\"What to Expect When You Are Expecting.\\" I found Vicki's opinions against exercising during pregnancy really misinformative! (\\"If you find yourself with extra time on your hands...spend it needlepointing.\\") Perhaps Vicki wouldn't have had so many complaints about her pregnancies had she followed a sensible prenatal fitness routine. I recommend \\"Pregnancy Fitness\\", very interesting and informative as well as practical. Enjoy your pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little cynical, but I like that","review":"I didn't buy this book because I wanted a warm, fuzzy, and reassuring view of motherhood. Every woman in my family and the doctor's office is going to give me that. I wanted this book so that every time something unpleasant or unanticipated happened, I didn't have to call the doctor. I could look at the mother of four and say, \\"Okay, this too shall pass and it's normal\\". I don't want surprises, and Ms. Iovine prepares the reader for every possible unpleasant turn of events. Overall, this book met my expectations and I plan to buy her other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to keep your sense of humor!!","review":"I feel that this book gave me a good view of how humorous the human body can be during pregnancy. Reading some of the situations made me feel better about what I was feeling and that it was normal to feel a little crazy at times. Don't loose your sense of humor with the experience and pamper yourself now by reading a book like this. If you want medical advice, get a medical book. It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out! I really enjoyed loosing myself in this book and getting some tidbits of info that i'm sure will be helpful... if you're not sure, read the excerpt. that's why it's there! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace","review":"Although I found the book entertaining, I'm glad I haven't listened to her advice. This is a woman who I definitely wouldn't choose as a girlfriend, she's way too negative.She advises to not workout during your pregnancy - if I had listened to her, my pregnancy most likely would have been a LOT more uncomfortable than it has been, and it would have been much harder to get back into shape because I'd have to start over from scratch. At least by keeping up the exercise routine, I won't have gotten lazy.I also don't like the way she criticizes birth classes. From the way she talks about them, she went into the whole thing with a poor attitude. She's all gung-ho for the epidural, which is something I will not be using for my delivery because I don't believe that it is truly unharmful to the baby and it can slow down your labor.But for the most part, the book is very entertaining. I just wouldn't take what she has to say as necessarily good advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO OUTDATED!!","review":"Part of this book have been okay and other parts of it just annoy me. The whole book is just one woman's opinion of pregnancy, what she thinks you should do, look like, feel, etc. It is also completely outdated. Her chapter on exercise is the worst. She basically says don't do it because it won't help you and you'll get fat anyways. Granted it is her opinion, but there is so much data to prove that women who stay in shape have an easier time in labor. I don't need anymore push to not work out than I already do, I know it is good for me and my baby. Her ideas for dressing during pregnancy are so outdated, you would look rediculous is some of the getups she discribes. All in all, save your money for a book that will really help you from an expert in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy","review":"I returned this book after browsing through it for 10 minutes. As a professional and educated woman who is pregnant for the first time at 36, I found it to be inaccurate, shallow and insulting. I am excited about my pregnancy, I intend to maintain a reasonable and safe level of fitness and I found Vicki's advice on diet and exercise (or lack thereof) to be quite frankly absurd. While many women may face legitimate medical reasons to take a break from exercise, her justification of \\"not looking good in workout tights\\" is nothing short of ridiculous.This book tells you nothing about what's really going on with your body or your baby, other than advising you to always check out your rear end in the mirror before leaving the house as it will be larger in reality than in your mind! I would stay far away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery Loves Company","review":"This book was given to my pregnant wife by a friend. It seems to be the commentary of a bitter woman with a disrespectful husband saying, \\"If you have a baby, you'll look and feel as bad about yourself as I do, so don't bother trying.\\"Together, we know many woman, who went through pregnancy and look incredible now. Likewise, we know many men who sincerely love and support their wives before, throughout, and after pregnancy. Read this book if you enjoy biting, nasty humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving pregnancy through humor","review":"My baby will be one week old tomorrow, so I have a rather fresh perspective on this book. For nine months, I read \\"The Girlfriend's Guide\\", \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\", and of course \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\". I had many more books at my disposal, but these three together covered everything I wanted to know. The Girlfriend's Guide offered true-to-life humor and comic relief from the day-to-day life of pregnancy. If I had to pick one chapter that was most helpful, I would have to say \\"Baby Stuff\\" was invaluable. Buy \\"What to Expect\\" for a scientific resource, but make sure you also have \\"The Girlfriend's Guide\\" to help retain your sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and badly edited to boot","review":"Even though I didn't have the easiest of pregnancies, I can't recommend this book to other moms. It perpetuates negative attitudes about a pregnant woman's body shape and gives possibly dangerous medical information disguised as advice. The author's perspective is one that only a wealthy white woman from southern California could have.I'm glad I read this book after my girl was born. Don't pay full price for this book and don't read it until your pregnancy and nursing months are done. It's a weird, very negative view of childbearing.It is also full of misspellings and grammatical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Reading this boring, trite, and obnoxiously fluffy book has made me appreciate the bright, funny, and wonderful girlfriends I have in my life. Granted, there are a few humorous moments in this book, but much of the humor is stale. (Perhaps I've been ruined by all the truly funny material I've read in my life.) Please, do yourself a favor: if you must read this book, buy it used - - especially if you can find it at a garage sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to feel badly about yourself? Read this.","review":"This was the very worst of all the pregnancy books I've read. Although Vicki Iovine believes she is being \\"honest\\" in a way few others will dare to be in a pregnancy book, I believe she just got a tickle out of being able to gripe about every aspect of the expectant state.She repeatedly refers to the mom-to-be's body as a \\"milk factory\\" (not exactly sweet) and continually tells women not to expect to be attractive while pregnant. However, I beg to differ. Pregnant women are beautiful, as they are the epitome of the life force embodied.Ladies, if you want to feel good about your pregnancy, try something by William Sears instead. He is pro-women and pro-babies. He encourages a woman to embrace the changes her body undergoes while growing a baby.Iovine's book reeks of misogyny, and she is a woman herself! She seems to hate her femininity so much that she cannot help but spew her rancid views onto her subject matter. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"I received this book as a shower gift and found a lot of the information to be outdated. It was written in 1995, so when Ms. Iovine was actually pregnant it was the late 80's and early 90's - 10 Years ago! A lot has changed. I found great pregnancy clothes, did not feel the world owed me a thing for being pregnant, and found solid advice (which I was seeking) in other books. (The Baby Whisperer Book, Sweet Child of Mine, Baby Bargains, Mayo Clinic Guide to Pregnancy, etc) Also, my child was in intensive care due to a birth defect and this book did not offer any practical advice on that subject. If you want a tongue in cheek book for laughs this is o.k., other than that read someone else's, check it out of the library, or buy it used.Not worth the money for a new copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Reference!","review":"Great information with a sense of humor. Found to be a great addition to other, drier, books. Just purchased as a gift for my sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i could get a refund","review":"Everything everyone else has said...has anyone actually counted the number of times she reminds us of getting a huge ass and cellulite? She continually reminds us of her own ridiculous notion that before and after pregnancy you'll be hideously unattractive and never have a life again. There are more important parts to this pregnancy process than weight gain. And how about the insults and stereotypes of the partners? I cant imagine why shed want to go through pregnancy four times with a spouse like she makes hers out to be. My husband would be offended by this book. I hate this book. Not worth the two laughs it caused by the time i put it down in chapter 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another opinion....","review":"I bought this during my second pregnancy, and feeling cheated out of real advice, ended up purchasing a couple other non-opinionated pregnancy books. The author skits around from all the different stages of pregnancy making jokes here and there, being sarcastic, and giving her personal opinion on everything. She shares what happened to her, or her friends during their pregnancies, but EVERY pregnancy is different. It's best not to go off the advice of someone other than a doctor. You just never know what to expect, and this book would leave a new mom confused and lost. If you want to know what happened during your friends pregnancy, great, ask them, but DONT expect any of it to apply to your pregnancy. This book is a huge waste of money. I'm sorry I ever bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Too Many","review":"Iovine describes your pregnancy as quite possibly the worst experience anyone could have. Women who elect for a home or natural birth are framed as \\"martyrs\\", so go ahead and schedule your ceserean now before all of your girlfriends judge the pants off you. Expect to become an incredibly overweight, unattractive lunatic; and anyone who doesn't is obviously depriving their child of nutrition and making life unfair for the rest of us, so be sure to look at them sideways when you pass them on the street. This book was an unfortunate, useless, offensive waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny. Just annoying.","review":"I found this at a thrift store for $3. That's about $2.75 more than I wish I would've paid. This chick isn't funny. She's a negative nelly who attempts to pass off the worst possible perspective on pregnancy as humor. This coming from me, a ridiculously sarcastic person. This book is written by a nerd for nerds. All it does is annoy you and make you sad. Read the other negative reviews. Some of them are spot on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny and offensive","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a girlfriend, and now I'm wondering what she was thinking. I did not find this book to be amusing or light-hearted. Parts were downright offensive. Other parts were severely misinformed. And the author's insistence that pregnancy was nine (10) months was distracting, irritating and annoying. She arrives at the conclusion that pregnancy is really, contrary to common wisdom, ten months long by stating that each month is four weeks long, and pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, so one is pregnant for ten months. Does the author really think that all 12 months are 4 weeks long? Oh, I forgot, beauty is much more important than substance to this author, as is evidenced by her obsession with making her husband still find her attractive even though she's disgustingly fat at nine months pregnant.I would not recommend this book to anyone. It re-emphasizes silly stereotypes and injects a negative way of thinking about a beautiful time in one's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left wanting to toss it across the room","review":"I read everything I could find about being pregnant, since it was my first time. By the time a friend bought me this book, I was hoping for something fun and lighthearted. This reminded me of every other fact filled book out there. If you want something fun, this isint it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grain of salt","review":"I'm trying to take this book with a grain of salt. It's not that well written, and I've noticed typos. (It actually said BRIAN instead of BRAIN once. I almost closed the book then and there) In some ways it's been funny, but in other ways I find the author very annoying. She's trying so hard to be clever, and I think some of her advice should not be taken seriously. I don't like her anti-natural birth and anti-midwife stance. Pregnancy books should encourage women to make their own decision.I'll probably keep reading it, but it's hard to for me to take the book too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Guide for a Good Friend","review":"My wife was given this book early in her pregnancy. I know many reviewers say that you need to have a sense of humor to appreciate this book, but this book was not that funny and did nothing to \\"guide\\" us through our pregnancy. All it did was scare my wife by talking about all the bad things about being pregnant. This is a good book to read if you don't want to get pregnant or are jealous of those that are."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent complement to other books","review":"During my first pregnancy, The Girlfriend's Guide provided something that I couldn't find in any of the other pregnancy books out there: real women's perspectives as well as a sense of humor. Now that I'm pregnant again I've been rereading the book and am reminded of why it was so important to me the first time around. A friend also gave me another book this time which I adore. It's a book of real women's stories of pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period, called Pregnancy Stories. Reading Pregnancy Stories and The Girlfriend's Guide along with the more clinical books out there (What to Expect, The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth) allowed me to get a very well-rounded sense of pregnancy both from the perspective of professionals and from other women like me who were living through its ups and downs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Author Vicki Iovine presents the joys and pains of pregnancy with great humor and reassurance. This book will certainly abate the anxiety and fears of any woman who just finds out she is pregnant. The book was rather smug at times; Iovine denounces breastfeeding and balks at women who are determined to get in shape quickly after giving birth (ironic since Iovine is a mere size 4 when she is not with child). Besides these and a few other shortcomings, this is a great read and a must-have for any pregnant woman who wants a little girlfriend advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"This is the BEST pregnancy book ever! I read it when I was pregnant with my first child and re-read when I was pregnant with my second and will probably read it with each subsequent pregnany. It was so nice to have a \\"girlfriends\\" point-of-view and down and dirty advice. She speaks the truth and she would know after four kids. I also have her second book \\"Girlfriends Guide to Surviving the First Year\\" and that is just as good! This book is much better than all those medical mumbo jumbo books that just make you worry more. This one will ease your mind and just make you laugh. Hold on to your belly when you read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicki Tells It Like It Is","review":"What a hoot! No more scary pregnancy books as gifts to new moms! This lady tells the absolute truth about pregnancy with a wit and humor that only your best girlfriend could rival. Try her other two books as well. I loved it and this wasn't even my first pregnancy! This lady shoots straight from the hip about stuff those other books don't, like how to get you maternity outfits together without looking too wierd, and the truth about your figure afterward. Buy it without any fear of regret, smiles guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time moms!!","review":"This book is THE best for first time moms!!!!!After reading so many baby books on what to expect, I loved the humor & \\"women talk\\" of this book. I was laughing so hard I couldn't put it down!!! The advice is useful and funny and the book is great to share with your hubby & girlfriends.Definately give this as a gift -ASAP- if you know someone is expecting!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be titled &#65533;Cheerleading Squads Guide to Pregnancy&#65533;","review":"o.k., I admit I have laughed out loud reading this book. I've read about Vicki's 20 girlfriends who've been pregnant and all of their trials and tribulations with pregnancy & delivery. However, for those of us who have supportive husbands who DO want to have children (and didn't \\"knock us up\\" by accident) or for those of us who already have imperfect bodies and don't obsess about outgrowing our size 4 jeans, some of her banter is really irritating. The book is a good one to add to the collection but it's not the one to refer to for anything too serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome if you want the mom to be to freak out","review":"My wife read the first 2 pages and was too freaked out to read any more. I've read it and it reads like a horror story of everything that could possibly go wrong - perfect if you like to \\"Keep Fear Alive\\" - is this book sponsored by Fox News? Avoid if you'd like to stay sane."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Title: A Rude, Uninformed Housewife's Rant on Pregnancy","review":"A shockingly non-scientific, pop-culture pulpit on pregnancy. Vickie Iovine delivers a snarky and pushy book full of misinformation, anecdotal tales, and rude remarks. It personally offends her when women make pregnancy/birth choices that differ from hers. She promotes things that are actually unsafe for you & baby (drinking wine or a coke, for example) and derides things that are scientifically proven to be helpful, such as moderate exercise during pregnancy. She apparently feels no need to actually research any of her supposedly \\"factual\\" statements, and in fact on page 75 says (quote) \\"If you want something more statistical or analytical you could have read any one of a million other books on pregnancy.\\" That is the ONLY advice this author gave worth a hoot - I suggest you RUN AWAY from this book and choose something more scientific and classy (and less derogatory towards the male species, perhaps)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just well written, but also extremely informative.","review":"Recommended to me by a Girlfriend of mine, this is by far the best pregnancy book I have read. I wanted to REALLY know what was going to happen and that the way I was feeling and the things that were/are happening to my body were indeed normal. The Girlfriends succeeded in comforting me and providing insight into what is to come. As a first time mother, I did not know there were so many things I should be asking my doctor. The Girlfriends pointed me in the right direction. I have even caught my husband reading the book on several occassions. Thanks to Vicki Iovine and all the Girlfriends out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recomend . . . Awesome","review":"Vicky's book is great. I found that I could relate to most of what she wrote about - with the exception of having size 4 clothes in my closet waiting for me! I received this book as a gift . . . and have since purchased it as a gift for a newly pregnant friend. I'm also reading the next installment - guide to the first year - so far - so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first reference for 1st time moms and even return moms","review":"This book is great for that new mom who is just a bit apprehensive about all the changes her body will go through. Vicky Iovine takes you through each change from the humorous side...and does a great job at it. She gives great \\"straight-up\\" advise and she tells it like it is. This book does not dive deeply into medical terms or references for potential medical problems. For those kinds of questions, I recommend \\"What to expect when you're expecting.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one pregnancy book, buy this one","review":"I'm an OB nurse and this is the book I buy for my pregnant friends! It presents information you can't find anywhere else and keeps you laughing the whole way through. The style is contemporary and hip and will make you laugh at things no one has ever given you permission to laugh at before."},{"rating":"2","title":"best gift for a pregnant friend","review":"I was told about this book by one of my pregnant cousins, she loved it because it didn't sugar-coat pregnancy. It explained the things that happens to a women's body in a straight-forward and humorous manner. Since then I have given to everyone of my \\"pregnant girlfriends\\" and they've loved it! Vicki Iovine rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of great information and advice in a humorous style!","review":"I got this book from my mom after we found out we are pregnant with our first baby. I love Vicki's style of writing - it really does feel like a girlfriend is sitting down with you and telling you all the things you really need to know about pregnancy and babies. She offers fantastic advice and I've picked up many a handy hint.The only thing I don't particularly care for about this book is her handling of the husbands. I think her attitude plays down their role in a pregnancy and makes them out to be idiots who can't figure anything out, will never do anything right, and don't deserve to be a part of the pregnancy. I feel like husbands are an integral part of the whole process and should not be dismissed or disregarded.Overall, I would still recommend this book because the advice and information is invaluable to a new mommy-to-be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!","review":"I purchased this book based on some very favorable reviews on this website and because I'd heard this book was sooooo funny! Well, it was insulting to me!I'm not pregnant yet... But, while we're waiting, I'm reading everything I can about pregnancy and childbirth.I was sooo excited when I bought this book! I just knew I was in for a treat! Well, I quickly determined that I'd just wasted [my money]. Not one to abandon a book...I read all the way up to chapter 5. Then, I just couldn't read another page. It was insulting to read her \\"professional\\" opinions. I wish I'd borrowed this one from someone! I sure would love my [money] back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't find this book very funny","review":"This book had some useful commentary and I liked that she used her friends as examples, but mostly I thought the jokes were pretty obvious and cheap. I didn't find it clever at all. I also couldn't believe that she recommended no exercise during pregnancy. Exercise kept me fit and relaxed during my whole pregnancy and it was very easy to get back in shape after delivery. Overall this was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud","review":"I got this book as a Christmas gift while I was pregnant last year. I had horrible morning sickness but this book actually got me laughing. So, so true! I highly recommend it. When so much of what you're reading is serious, this is great. And the information is helpful as well. It's a great buy for yourself and an even better gift for any pregnant woman (try to get it to her early in her pregnancy so she can follow it through each stage)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"This book is the worst pregnancy book I have ever read. The woman who wrote this book makes you feel as all pregnancy is going to do for you is make you fat and ugly and there is nothing you can do about it. I was disgusted reading the part about how your husband will make love to you out of mercy. I strongly recommend reading other books. This book was not funny at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who can't do anything without their \\"girlfriends\\"","review":"I found this book cutesy and annoying. This writer is not my \\"girlfriend\\", thank you; she's an author with a gimmick who hopes to make a buck.I'm happy and relaxed about my pregnancy and all of its not-so-appealing aspects without someone to tell me to feel that way. Although I suppose this book would appeal to the sort of woman who can't do or feel anything without her girlfriends telling her what to do or how to feel -- if you're that sort, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"These generalizations are untrue and very annoying.","review":"Hey, \\"Girlfriend\\", not everyone hates pregnancy, gets hemmorroids, has a beauty-obsessed husband and gains 40 pounds! Regarding exercise, I don't know anyone who stopped because they didn't look good in their leotard. Vicki, wear a big shirt and get over it! Kudos to the reviewers who kept exercising as it makes the rough parts of pregnancy more bearable.For those of you unfortunate enough to be reading this book during your 1st pregnancy, don't be too alarmed, Vicki exaggerates like there is no tomorrow. I had a rough pregnancy but I do realize that some women enjoy it. My question to Vicki is, if you hated it this much, why did you have so many children?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I got this book from a friend, who is also pregnant, same time as me, and really wanted to enjoy it...after reading all the \\"standard\\" pregnancy books, I was looking forward to a good laugh and different information.The author's views are very personal and honest...but it left me feeling agitated, let down, and angry at all the negativity in this book. Not a lot of useful information, and the tone is more of a gripe session about pregnancy, and all the \\"horrible\\" things that go along with it...in her opinion. It was somewhat depressing, and not enlightening or helpful or at all. Totally unsupportive of anyone wanting to do natural childbirth, and no \\"celebrating\\" the beauty and wonder of pregnancy...if you're just looking for something to read, that may give you a few laughs, and you can get into the mind set of not taking anything in this book seriously, then give it a try...it was just too much of a waste for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I read when I was pregnant","review":"This was given to me as a gift during my pregnancy, and is now the number one thing I recommend to pregnant women!

It puts humor into pregnancy, but is informative. I did refer to it throughout my pregnancy. No, I did not buy \\"What to expect\\" because I heard that it lists everything that can go wrong.

Yeah, pregnancy is hard, but it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"book was never received","review":"I ordered this book on 3/3/03 but never recieved it.

Although there were some good tips, the author's \\"potty mouth\\" took away from anything of great value written here & she definitely did not write this for the average woman in America .If you have any amount of class, not to mention want a more informative medical guide to pregnancy, get a more informative book like \\"What to expect while your'e expecting\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book.","review":"What a complete waste of the precious little time a pregnant woman has to sit down and read! Fortunately, I realized this early on and tossed the book in the trash. I don't understand why anyone would find it appealing. It's really cynical with very juvenile humor. It makes pregnancy sound like the worst thing that could ever happen to you -- you'll be miserable, your spouse/partner will be unsupportive, will hate the changes in your body, etc. (God forbid if you think about cutting your hair! What?!) For me, pregnancy was such an amazing time, only surpassed by the experience of raising my little girl. Please don't waste your time or your money on this book. I would avoid the What to Expect books as well. They will just make you worry. Hope this review is helpful to you. Relax and enjoy your pregnancy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I got this book as a gift.I found some of the advice out-dated (stirrups?!) and not relevant.While some areas were cute and entertaining, I found that this book lacked any useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"sure, if you like yuppie pith","review":"I also purchased this book thinking that it would be a welcome respite from the more serious tomes I picked up when I found out I was pregnant, but the writing was mediocre at best and I just couldn't relate at all to Iovine's audience. More than that, I found her book to be just too pithy to be even readable. Her tongue should be pried from her cheek.Pick up the Hip Mama's Guide and other books by Ariel Gore instead, you are guaranteed a far better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars?","review":"There is a reason this book is less than $0.50 used. At best this is a lame attempt at humor, at worst it is very offensive, which is a shame because it is a good premise. Its assumations fall under the heading of misery loves company. So if you are looking forward to a miserable pregancy join their club. But please, for heaven's sake do not give this book to anyone, not even as a gag gift. I am speaking from experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but dated","review":"I found this book very amusing but since the book is 10 years old some of the info is dated.

I'm glad I didn't waste my money. The material in this book is dated (stretch pants?), somewhat sexist (assuming that your partner is a man and that he will be of no use except to bring home the bacon), and slanted (but in all fairness every book is, really). I particularly don't like the authors view on excercise -- which states that you needn't bother because you're going to get fat anyway. Well, yes, you probably will get fat if you eat M&Ms every day. As far as useful information, there is really only the list of things you will need for baby. Which as another reviewer pointed out, you can get in any other pregnancy/baby book. If you are looking for an entertaining pregnancy book I recommend A Bun in the Oven by Kaz Cooke (available on amazonUK). Not only is this book truly funny, it actually contains very useful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous Look at Pregnancy","review":"I read this book in the week we found out I was pregnant & laughed through the whole thing. I give my husband much more credit than the author gives men in general, but it was still an entertaining, easy read. I recommend this book as a supplement to all of the serious, practical reading that you'll do throughout your pregnancy. I am glad I read this book before other books and articles scared me into thinking that I must be doing permanent damage to my unborn baby by not eating vegetables every day. It's a unique look at pregnancy, and I recommend it for every mom-to-be who wants to not take herself too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy : Or Everything Your Doc","review":"I am from the Caribbean and even though some of the information did not apply because of the cultural and economic differences, I found the book to be so very comforting in this my first pregnancy! The author is a bit 'raw' at times but she suceeds in getting the message across that it is natural to be unnatural when you are carrying that precious bundle.I truly enjoyed the author's sense of humour. I have lent this book to a friend and she read it in a flash. She is going to order one. I am definitely going to recommend it to others. This 'comfort book' as I call it, is a gem!Maybe the author could do a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for Moms-to-be","review":"I received this book as a gift before my first son was born - it made me laugh out loud! Now I give it to all my friends who are expecting for the first time - they have all loved it as much as I did.

If you want to laugh, this is the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for 1st timers","review":"This is my first pregnancy, and a friend sent me this book because she got it as a gift for her first pregnancy.

I'm not an avid reader, but couldn't wait to get home from work and relax while reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read this if you want advice from a mean \\"friend\\"","review":"This book made me cringe throughout. She advises against exercising during pregnancy (and if you do, and have a miscarriage, you will NEVER forgive yourself!?!!), is anti midwife, doula, and natural childbirth, tells you that you will never have your body back, are a crazy hormonal nightmare to be around, and will always be fat with saggy breasts. I wonder why this woman chose to have four children. She seems to loathe pregnancy and childbirth. I know it is meant to be a humorous book, and I like to think of myself as having a decent sense of humor, but I found very little of this book amusing. I am glad I don't have a friend like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is VERY negative","review":"I was given this book by a friend, she said it was hilarious. There were funny parts, but more than funny I found it to be negative. Look, we all know pregnancy & childbirth are not a walk on the beach. I did not learn anything I didn't already know from this book, and found the tone to be extremely negative and it seemed like it was intending to frighten. I think fear is the worst thing for an expecting mother & it can make pregnancy & childbirth that much worse.This book was not informative, enlightening or helpful to me. There were funny parts, but the laughs I had were far outnumbered by the times I felt like the author was trying to scare me to death.If you want a funny light look at pregnancy & childbirth, I recommend Belly Laughs by Jenny McCarthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"This is an awesome book!!! It has a lot of information but ties in some humor also. Very Well written!!! Thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Superficial Fluff!","review":"That about says it. Apparently the author's definition of a \\"Girlfriend\\" is a skinny, superficial fashionista for which the worst part of being pregnant is -gasp- gaining the extra weight needed to grow a healthy baby and not being able to fit into Chanel suits in the mean time. If this is you, you might like this book, otherwise find something else to read. I personally found this book to be kind of depressing and insulting. It certainly didn't teach me anything useful about surviving pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this woman an authority on pregnancy?","review":"The woman writing this book has no credentials except that she herself has been pregnant, and knows other women who have. You're better off saving your money and reading the opinions of random strangers on pregnancy internet boards.Her take on home birth? \\"Childbirth is messy - why do that to your sheets?\\" None of her Girlfriends have ever refused an epidural, so why would you?Her take on exercise during pregnancy is \\"Why bother? You'll get fat anyway!\\" As though exercise has no relation to health at all.In general, she seems to think that pregnant women are all hysterical, irrational shrews who can't control themselves. Sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me.I like \\"Sex and the City\\" as much as the next person, but I don't turn to it for actual advice. Sure, you might find it entertaining, but you're better off with Harry Potter if that's what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"offensive and NOT informative.","review":"This book is terrible and offers advice that is quite backwards. It will shame you for exercising and only encourage and fuel terrible sexist stereotypes, about both men and women. If you have a head on your shoulders, go elsewhere--unless you are looking for a laugh AFTER you've had the baby. But seriously, it's not funny. Someone could use this book in a sociology class looking at the nasty side of gender roles in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any first time mommy-to-be","review":"This is what it should be like when you have no idea what to expect the first time you have a baby. This book covers all the gore and surprises that are in store for any first timer. I have given my copy to many and have even stopped pregnant women in the book section to tell them about this one. A definiet must have on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtably the best (non-medical) book on being pregnant!","review":"Vicki captures the good, the bad and the ugly of being pregnant in a way that only a good \\"girlfriend\\" would. I read all of the \\"What to expect...\\" books and every other piece of literature I could get my hands on during my first two pregnancies (10 and 7 years ago) and still wasn't totally prepared for the miracle of childbirth. Vicki reminded me, in a comical but direct way, of the little things that we experienced moms tend to forget when it comes to having that wonderful baby growing inside of you. If 10 stars were an option, The Girlfriend's Guide would get it from me! I'm 6 weeks into my third pregnancy and plan on re-reading this everytime I need a good chuckle during the long months ahead! A sense of humor is a must in order to fully enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I received this book as a pregnancy gift, and I can only say that I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I applaud the concept of examining the lighter side of pregnancy, but I found this book to be completely superficial. Iovine is clearly OBSESSED with her physical appearance . . . she mentions repeatedly throughout the book how thin she was before her pregnancy, and most of the pages are devoted to her ongoing concerns about her looks during and after pregnancy. Of course this is a concern for most pregnant women, but I hardly think it's the most important issue raised by the life-altering miracle of pregnancy and childbirth! Isn't motherhood supposed to make us a little less self-absorbed?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Girlfriends guide to pragnancy","review":"This book is a sick idea by one woman and her various friends. Absolutely do not let this be the only book you read if you are expecting since it is the author's unprofessional point of view. She offers no real medical information and offers no pros or cons to any of her experiences. Her testiomonial that drugs, doctors and the epidural are her best friend is an example of a women who gives up all her own power and instints to an easy way out of pregnancy. The book offers no alternatives in point of views other than her own and after all, this does not work for everybody, only her."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"secret\\" information","review":"This book claims to have information your doctor won't tell you. The only new information I heard was inaccurate (i.e. there is no benefit to exercising while pregnant and that you will actually hurt your baby if you exercise). I know she says these things are only the opinion of her and her Girlfriends but unless you want the opinion of shallow, below-average intelligence people, don't bother with this book. All the \\"secrets\\" were covered with actual medical backing in \\"What to Expect...\\" and \\"Mayo's Guide...\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could give it 0 stars","review":"This book had such potential to be really really great and fun to read. That is until the writer started adding all of her thoughtless, judgemental opinions. I didn't buy this book to feel judged and sneered at. I couldnt believe how judgemental she was on nursing, natural childbirth, unmarried mothers, etc. Maybe someone should tell this ex playboy bunny that her breasts are actually for nursing and not to be used to exploit herself only to write a mindless book once the flash bulbs are burnt out. I also felt like this book should have been published in 1950 based on all the time spent on making excuses for husbands who arent interested in you because of how \\"huge\\" you get. I dont have any girlfriends who are this unaware, so there for this is not my guide to pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with False Info & Negativity","review":"First, Iovine dedicates an entire chapter to why you should not exercise during your pregnancy. She is WRONG!! Please, read the book, \\"Exercising Through your Pregnancy.\\" A myriad of well-designed scientific studies have proven that exercise is not only NOT HARMFUL, but BENEFICIAL for both Mom & baby. (Not that Iovine cares about science...)Second, she jokes about it not bringing a couple closer together. That was not my experience.Lastly, she discusses an OB manually extracting the placenta. YOUR OB SHOULD NOT DO THIS! It is DANGEROUS! Educate yourself & don't waste time with this book. (See \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth\\" for all the real facts on stupid OB procedures.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emphasizes the horrors of pregnancy.","review":"While the author is very funny about many aspects of pregnancy, she portrays the pregnant woman as a helpless victim of the medical system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, I laughed. But I was horrified at some attitudes...","review":"Vicki Iovine's advice seems to be: get to the hospital, get the drugs and get the baby out. A holistic approach, this is not. If you are planning a home birth, steer clear. The 'foolish man' attitude to partners wore a bit thin after a while too.Forget this book, and get Vicki Iovine's Diary instead. It's got all the funny bits (copied directly from the above book) to do with fashion and feelings, without all the dodgy healthcare advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather disturbing view of pregnancy","review":"I found this book to be annoying at best, and rather disturbing on the whole. Absolutely NONE of the \\"10 lies about pregnancy\\" were true for me when I carried and gave birth to my two daughters. As a whole, I found it to more of the tripe that encourages women to view pregnancy as a disease that requires medical intervention, rather than a natural process that usually turns out well when intelligently managed in concert with an midwife or obstetrician. I would never give this book to a pregnant friend, since the overall sarcastic and pessimistic tone would likely fuel any anxiety she already had about the birth process. Frankly, I discreetly discarded this book quite soon after receiving it as a gift from my mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"For women who want to smack their girlfriends","review":"I felt that this book used \\"humor\\" to disguise its condescending message. I accept that other women make different choices in their pregnancies than I would, however the author seems to think that the choices I would make are just foolishness, without backing up her claims with any facts.I know that this is \\"The girlfriend's guide,\\" but if I wanted to just hear another woman's opinion, I could talk to my real life girlfriends. I was looking for a funny, informative book about pregnancy and \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" just did not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"Where do I start...While the author does provide some useful information, I was extremely offended by some of the things she said. For example, she tells us not to worry about finances, since that's for your husband to worry about (I handle the finances in my family, and what if there is no husband???). She tells us not to exercise during pregnancy for several reasons, including \\"you're going to get fat anyway\\" and \\"you're not going to look good in your leotard\\" (I think I'm going to look GREAT when I'm very pregnant). She tells us to remember to get a pedicure since your feet are going to be in your doctor's face (I personally couldn't care less what my doctor thinks of my feet).Apparently the author only wants married women to read her book, since she constantly refers to the \\"husband\\" (even though my understanding is that 1/3 of all new mothers aren't married). And she preaches non-stop that epidurals are the only way to go.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"***Horrible Book***","review":"This book was so bad that I couldn't even finish it! The autor is extremely judgemental, bossy, and claims to be much wiser than she is. I liked Jenny McCarthy's book, \\"Belly Laughs,\\" much better. Jenny may be crude at times, but she always talks about her own experiences, personal opinions and starts most sentences with the word \\"I.\\" On the other hand, Mrs. Iovine dictates what everyone should do and starts all of her sentences with \\"You should,\\" and ends each sentence with \\"if you don't, you should be kicked out of the Girlfriends club.\\" Everytime I tried to read this book I felt defeated, bad about myself and angry - not a good thing for any pregnant woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dumb book for a dumb public","review":"If you consider yourself a smart woman, please stay away from this pseudo literature.

How embarrassing for herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally someone tells the truth!","review":"I highly recommend this book to all women when they get pregnant, especially first timers. Most of the other books tell you what your doc tells you. This book tells you the nitty gritty of what is happening and what is going to happen. The good and the ugly. And the book is funny. It made me laugh and realize all the weird things I'm experiencing everybody else is too and may be too embarassed to talk about. I've read it front to back at least five times. My husband kept asking me what was so funny when I was reading it, so he read it too. He loved it!! It's making the experience fun, and not at all scary. I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Honesty about Pregnancy (with lots of humor)","review":"I wish Iovine was my girlfriend. She tells it like it is. I read the original in 1997, while pregnant with my 2nd child. I could not put it down. My husband even read it, and laughed as much as I did. It is not a \\"medical\\" book, and makes no claim to be. But it is brutally honest, hilarious, and right on. I've had 3 children, and Iovine has it right about pregnancy! I would also recommend all her other books. They are perfect for the once-uptight mothers to be(like me.) Through her books, I learned to relax and take whatever pregnancy threw at me with a laugh and a smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I read this book while I was pregnant with my first baby.

I think I would rather go with Dr. Miriam Stoppards New Pregnancy and Birth Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the mathematically challenged","review":"The author's insistence that 40 weeks equals 10 months is not only blatantly wrong but should be embarrassing for Iovine, who has a college degree. After thousands of years of women being pregnant for NINE MONTHS, we shouldn't shelve common sense and believe the \\"Eureka\\" moment of this woman, who also ignores single mothers-to-be in her book, by repeatedly referring to \\"your husband\\" throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for women seeking ignorance","review":"If you want helpful, real and informative information about pregnancy and birth, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The book is based on one woman's negative and ignorant view of a beautiful and natural process. At one point she compares the mess of childbirth to a pig slaughter. It is disturbing to read absolute lies and medical misinformation. Her viewpoint on husbands are a flashback to the 1940's when the dad's were not involved in the pregnancy/birth process at all. This book preaches ignorance!It is shallow, immature and at some points completly WRONG in her misguided advise. It is sad to think that a first time mom will read this book and get such a negative perspective of what can be a happy, healthy and empowering time is her life. In short, this is THE WORST pregnancy/birth book I have ever read and I would not recomend it to any woman who seeks knowledge and truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIRLFRIENDS GUIDE TO STUPIDITY","review":"NUMBER ONE: SHE SAYS DONT EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY?

I wouldn't dare pass this book on to anyone. If you are a woman that has decided to have a homebirth, don't waste your money. This chick is totally for using drugs and thinks your nuts if you want a natural birth. If you're a G-D fearing woman you'll be appalled by her suggestions of what your husband should do if you don't feel like having sex, and her choice of words leaves a lot to be desired. She also has tape set on the market referring to the first year of motherhood. She just repeats herself from this book on the first and 1/2 of the second side of the tape. Luckily, I didn't pay for that set either. I've decided to ask family and friends not to buy me any pregnancy or baby books. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"You have to buy this (and the baby bargains book!) for your girlfriend who's just told you she's expecting her first baby (don't bother if she's already had kids). It's hilarious, entertaining and informative. Definitely something to read while your pregnant, you won't have the time to read much once the baby is there (or you focus on the more advice heavy books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy","review":"I was very unhappy with the quality of this book.

I just expected it to be in better shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those desiring responsibility in pregnancy.","review":"I found this book to be chatty and fun, but not full of much solid information uponwhich to base informed birth choices. I must say, however, that it doesnot promise to be the birth book for the Earth Mother. If you don't want anepidural, this book is not for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pregnancy Book EVER.","review":"If you're pregnant, someone will undoubtedly recommend this book to you. DON'T DO IT. It's only funny or clever if you, like the author, are a rich & skinny former Playmate, and it includes lots of worst-case scary crap which, instead of discussing in any meaningful context (or even using real terms to describe things), she pretty much just writes off as, \\"Blah blah scary stuff, I don't know what it's really called, I'm just a woman, what do I know, maybe ask your doctor!\\" Not useful -- either discuss it intelligently, or don't bring it up at all!Plus, she has a whole chapter on how exercise is bad for pregnant women (not true) and if you dare go to that prenatal Pilates class, it's your own darn fault if you miscarry. WTF?I bought it after reading the first chapter, but it goes steeply downhill from there. RUN AWAY from this wretched, stupid, awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books I've actually thrown away","review":"Granted it has a few good parts, but most of it is trash with terrible advice -- for example, there is a whole section devoted to why a pregnany lady should not exercize. TERRIBLE! Exercize is a wonderful thing for an expecting mom! It speaks terribly of men, assuming that they are all arrogant pigs (or at least trying to convince you of it!) I could see it taking an already hormonal woman and making her terribly upset with her husband or seeing things so negatively that false problems begin to be created. I kept trying to find a use for this book, but in the end, I didn't want to encourage anyone to read it by even giving it away. I threw it in the trash and felt much better about that; I feel that with all of the terrible advice and opinions that it offered, that is where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining but low on content","review":"The Girlfriend's Guide is written in a breezy, engaging style, but for a first time expectant mother, it provided very little information. Worse yet, it seems jaded. If you favor unchallenging chick lit, then the Girlfriends' Guide is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not My Girlfriend","review":"As many other reviewers have stated, this book is VERY negative. I don't understand how Iovine went through 4 pregnancies with an attitude like hers. She tries to be funny, but comes out harsh and judgemental. She would probably hate me if she were my girlfriend, as I did not gain more than the recommended weight during pregnancy, did not have morning sickness (lucky me!), and my husband found me MORE attractive during pregnancy. It is truly a very enjoyable time in my life - nothing like what Iovine described. And I am planning to have an unmedicated birth - another thing Iovine advises against. This is just to show that 70% of her \\"girlfriend\\" advice does not apply to me, and at times was very offensive to both me and my husband. If you want a positive view of pregnancy - don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I didn't find it funny or informative. The only useful thing was the checklist of what to buy for the baby. You can find that in many other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting Dads &#65533; don&#65533;t get this book!","review":"For you expecting dads, especially first time dads - DO NOT GET THIS BOOK FOR YOUR WIFE. If it shows up at you house, I would suggest it should conveniently disappear into the lost-and-found abyss.It creates far more anxiety than anticipation. To begin with, your wife will be off balance hormonally and will have very understandable fears of pregnancy. This book, while somewhat humorous, takes the most miraculous time of a woman's life and turns it into a miserable, bleak, depressing experience - triggering neurotic thoughts of abandonment, hopelessness, and misery. You will spend most of your time undoing the dour predictions rather than rejoicing in this wondrous time together."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are other, better books","review":"My best friend and I were disappointed in this book. While seemingly written to be humorous, we strongly feel that the underlying message of this book is to encourage and to validate being bitchy or whiny during pregnancy. It wasn't a book I could share with my husband because he was offended in the first chapter. If you want good books that answer your pregnancy questions, try \\"What to Expect When You are Expecting\\" or Dr. Sears' \\"Birth Book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED this book...","review":"Ok, I think I have a pretty good sense of humor, and yes, I did laugh out loud a couple of times while reading this book, BUT it was the MOST DEPRESSING take on pregnancy I have ever heard. I am pregnant for the first time and therefore have to take whatever she says as truth because I have had no experiences with it myself. I could see if she put it all out there for everyone, the harsh truths of it all, but then made it all seem worth it in the end, but her reasons for getting pregnant again were pathetic and offensive. She has a lazy attitude towards being pregnant and I would NOT recommend this book to any first time moms out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about some of the realities","review":"I loved this book! It's great book to tell you what your doctor doesn't always say. It keeps things humorous but informational.

Happy healthy pregnancy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying- just borrow it!","review":"Thank goodness i had a friend lend me this book. It had some funny personal stories-especially in the beginning. However it gets repetitive fast, and after all is not any medical advise. Some advise i found out is just a lie.

I just had a baby, and have many friends with babies, and none of us had the plethora of problems she seems to have had. Some of the advice is just bad - like exercise doesn't help you have a healthier pregnancy and labor. I don't know any doctor who would agree with that. The book definitely has some funny moments, so read it for the humor if you want. Just don't rely on it for advice or let it give you a negative view of pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, not encouraging","review":"Although occasionally funny (especially towards the beginning), and initially readable with its engaging approach, the Girlfriends' Guide ends up being a discouraging discourse into all the downsides of pregnancy. Ms. Iovine especially spends a lot of time discussing getting fat during the course of the pregnancy and on getting rid of the fat afterwards. Get it out from the library if you must but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Books to read","review":"I bought this book, because so many people have had such rave reviews. While I do like that the author has a laid back attitude, this wasn't the book for me.My husband and I plan to conceive within the next couple of months. After reading this entire book, it made me want to put off trying for a child. In my opinion it didn't seem like the author enjoyed her pregnancy and it comes through in her experiences. I guess I was looking for a book that made light of all the negatives to pregnancy where as this book made them seem even worse.

Definitely a must read for first time mothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am just appalled that anybody likes this book","review":"This has got to be one of the most unfunny books I have ever read. I am just appalled to think that there are women out there who are actually taking this advice. The utter disrespect this woman expresses for her family and herself is astounding.

I like Vicki Iovine's humorous style and it is enjoyable to read. I also like that it gives the non-medical point of view, but so much of the information is wrong that I worry it could be somewhat harmful if this were the only pregnancy book an expectant mother read. If taken in the context of knowing that most of the medical information is probably wrong, and preferably read along with books written by more reliable authors, it can be a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are thinking of getting pregnant - don't read this book!","review":"My husband and I are excitedly looking at the possibility of starting a family. Unfortunately, this is the first book I read in preparation. It started out pretty funny, amusing even. The author is witty and refreshing initially, but after a while, her advice seems jaded, almost bitter. I felt like she was trying too hard to be funny and in doing so, concentrated on the negative aspects of pregnancy. Having not been pregnant before, I was seriously distressed to read that, according to her, you would get fat, have terrible gas, and basically be miserable for 10 months.The more I read, the more depressed I became. I finally had to put the book down and seek a reliable source - my mother (who ordered me to stop reading it at once!)

I gave it four stars because it's a bit outdated and because I don't like the cover (hey if everyone else can be judgemental, so can I, so there!)Having a tantrum,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"I realize that the world was different ten years ago, but it's hard not to laugh out loud when the author regards single-income families as the norm, recommends stirrup pants with boots, bodysuits and large jackets as the perfect maternity fashion solution (and has evidently never heard of GAP.com, let alone the Internet), and name-checks Giorgiou perfume (yeccch!).This book might be fun if you're looking for a good belly laugh, or one woman's perspective on the experience of pregnancy in the 1980's, but otherwise I'd leave it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Big on Childbirth Options","review":"This woman believes there is only one way to give birth, with an epidural administered as soon as you discover you're pregnant. She belittles women who seek other alternatives such as natural childbirth or water birth and outright dismisses people who give birth at home as wackos.She believes any woman who chooses natural childbirth can only be doing so because they see it as a badge of honor and respect among other mothers, not because it's healthier and safer for both mother and baby.This woman strikes me as someone who breaks out the vicodin everytime she stubs her toe and spent hours obsessing over how her pregnancy was ruining her looks forever.Spend your money on a less judgmental, pessimistic book that advocates option."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to feel like crap about yourself, read this book","review":"I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be \\"banned from the universe\\" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not \\"Playboy\\" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big downer on pregnancy-must read if you want to be bitter","review":"I think this lady is so bitter towards men and the size 4 jeans that she can't get in anymore that she wants to inflict her distress on the rest of us! When you buy a book on pregnancy, you're usually excited and not expecting to come away from it depressed! There are some funny parts and some crass descriptions of gas and... on the table, but unfortunately, this is about all this book had going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly annoying, marginally helpful","review":"This book provides little new information and some misinformation. The best parts were about dealing with the father-to-be, and how the most important result of birth is a healthy baby and mom. The rest was a litany of how to cope with the miracle of life from the shallowest angle possible. It's not just about how you look and dress!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacks grace, and joy... who needs it?","review":"Not everyone is a size four... Not everyone is a lot of things that are dicusssed in this book. Borrow this book, but don't spend money on it. Where is the joy in creating a life? Who cares if your waist dissapears, or you have morning sickness! Feel the joy, and grab on to every minute of the experience! Check out 125 Things You Must Know About Being Pregnant for a healthy dose of pride in yourself, joy for your pregnancy, no gross descriptions, and cute colored cartoons. The author of that book \\"gets it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this book if you are cynical and negative","review":"I realize after reading this book because of many friends recomendations, that these women who recomended it all have one thing in common...they are cynical, negative and bitter about the new feelings they are having. Typically these women are very trendy and more concerned with themselvs than with their future child. Some of the things in the book are insightful but often just plain whiny and bitchy. Who needs it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-Out-Loud Hilarious!","review":"This is by far my favorite pregnancy book! As a first-time mom-to-be, I felt really overwhelmed with the enormity of what my husband & I are undertaking . . . Vicki not only put my mind at ease, but made me laugh out loud in the process. I cannot over-estimate the value of laughter in the midst of what can be a very frightening time. Vicki makes the whole experience of pregnancy feel NORMAL . . . something I don't know if I'll ever actually feel again! Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Respite from all of the Factual, Serious books!","review":"Iovine gives no medical advice, or explanation of what is happening through a pregnancy. She tells you that up front. It is a wonderful departure from scary, technical information written in medicalese. I enjoyed this book immensely as I needed to find something lighter, and more relevant to every day life on the subject. To know that you share the same horror as other women to notice your first hemmhoroid, the discovery of how gassy one may become, and to know that we've all coped with public sickness is priceless! To add some fun to your seriousness, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book on pregnancy ever","review":"I don't usually write reviews on the internet, unless a product is especially good or especially bad. This is the worst guide to pregnancy you could possibly imagine. Vicky Iovine has major issues about her pregnant body, and is completely clueless to the needs of the average American woman because she is married to a very wealthy record producer and has no concept of budgeting her money or having to work while pregnant. My girlfriends and I passed this book around a couple of years ago, and were horrified. You will actually dread pregancy after reading this nonsense, which is a shame. Shame on you Vicky - please don't write any more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous...","review":"If you're looking for a humor book, something to make you laugh, this book is right up your alley. If you're looking for a book that actually gives you well-researched, *safe* and healthy advice for you and your baby -- Ms. Iovine's glib and dangerously inaccurate throwaway quips about everything from c-sections to breastfeeding are mind-boggling in their wrongness -- please go read \\"A Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth\\" by Henci Goer instead.Again, this is a humor book. Whether you find Ms. Iovine's sense of humor actually funny or if you find her complete cluelessness about real pregnancy and birth issues laughable, that's your call. But please don't count on this woman for sound pregnancy advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've saved my $$$...","review":"When I read the other online reviews for this particular book, I thought that I, too had to have it so I could enjoy what everyone else was. The problem is after I finished the third or fourth chapter, I became bored with the book. Some parts were funny, but the writing just kept on and on and I got no humor or interest out of it. If anything, I found a cure for the ever present insomnia a lot of expectant mothers get during their pregnancies. And for that reason alone did this book get 2 stars from me--and that was being generous. I say save your cash and buy Jenny McCarthy's \\"Belly Laughs: The Naked Truth About Pregnancy and Childbirth\\" or \\"Pregnancy Sucks: How You're Little Miracle Can Make You Miserable.\\" BOTH were legitimately funny and \\"Pregnancy Sucks\\" also had some informative info enclosed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative advice","review":"I had heard so many good comments about this book, but I was disappointed. First of all, it's almost a decade old. So, many items are out of date. Secondly, she is so negative. In the exercise chapter, she basically tells pregnant women not to bother exercising because they are just going to get fat anyway. I would buy it only for the humor value and some useful items about what to bring with you to the hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupportive of homebirths!","review":"This book was given to me as gift. I glanced through it and immediately was turned off by the chatty street language. I then proceded to thumb the index for midwives and homebirths, something I hold very dear. She dedicated maybe a page to the whole topic and basically said midwives didn't work out for her friend and went on to give a horrible desciption of birth. This author has no empathy for the baby and mother bonding and all the turmoil the baby and mother can go through in a hospital setting. She makes the reader feel like they need painkillers, instead of trusting that their body can give natural childbirth like many women have before them. She makes the birth process sound like war. There was absolutely no loving care or intelligent thought in her language. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated - Needs an Update!","review":"I borred this book from a friend, and I am glad that I did. The humor in this book is often lacking, I have read funnier pregnancy books. The material is quite outdated, such as her recommendations for maternity wear - I can not relate to her outfits, or to her ideas to wear a vest over a big shirt, borrowing my husbands clothing, or to long flowy dresses. Much of the material which was supposed to be funny, I found quite negative (exercise portion, the sex). This book published in 1995 should stay in 1995. Updates to the material are definately in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This book is starting to seem quite outdated, and the author's opinions are downright offensive in some places in the way that they present opinion as fact. As someone who planned a natural birth with midwives and ended up with a hospital induction without an epidural (mind you, I have nothing against epidurals for other people, just didn't want one myself) and who is a big believer in breastfeeding, I probably was not going to like this book from the beginning. The kicker, though, was her stereotypical view of fathers-to-be. Her presentation of men did not ring true to my experience with my husband and was a big turnoff. Yes, there were still a few funny parts, but overall, this book was too far off from my worldview to be a good fit for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, by stereotypical","review":"While there were a few things in there that most women do not talk about, the rest of the book was full of pregnancy entitlement.Tired? Put your feet up and have your husband do all the housework! Just take it easy on yourself - YOU deserve it!While I am all for taking it easy when you need to, this book tries to give any pregnant woman a license to do nothing. I'd skip this book if you were looking for a more informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like having your girlfriend always with you","review":"I loved it. It really feels as if your best friend is the one giving you the advice. It tells you about everything you'd be afraid to ask your doctor in a frank and easy way to understand. It made me laugh out loud. I got one for my best friend and we read it at the same time and we lauged at work about how much it felt like having a new best friend!! Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your REAL No-nonsense Guide","review":"Forget about \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" and \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books.\\" (I've read both, and I couldn't tell you which is more boring or sterile.) The Girlfriend's Guide is the real deal. Vicki Iovine's approach is frank, funny, and a breath of fresh air compared to other pre-natal books. She (and, don't forget her girlfriends!) covers everything from when the baby is conceived to when you bring him home in terms that are UNDERSTANDABLE--the way you'd want to hear it from a friend. Instead of using medical terms up front, you'll see a word like \\"Squishy,\\" with the medical term behind it in parentheses. There are stories about fears, successes, miscarriages, the 9-months' pregnant waddle, what to bring to the hospital for your special day, and reasons why asking your husband if he still finds you attractive in your 38th week is a complete waste of time. BUY THIS BOOK! You will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"better books are out there","review":"there are so many better pregnancy books out there! She made me feel like if I didn't do it her way, I was definitely doing it wrong. The book could be funny, but it didn't make up for her lack of helpful information. I also didn't like the way she treated all partners, assuming they were all husbands and then lumping all men into one stereotypical unhelpful category. If you want an open-minded, tolerant, useful book, try From the Hips (my favorite) or for a more detailed one The Mother of all Pregnancy Books. Both way better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, practical, an easy read","review":"I read this book in a matter of days. The advice is given in with a lot of humor and makes some of the less wonderful aspects of pregnancy seem more palatable, knowing everyone else experiences them. Not for the super serious crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, refreshing book.","review":"I bought this book based on a reccomendation by a friend. I love it! It is so funny and well written. All the serious pregnancy books were scaring me and making me nervous...was I eating enough of this, that or the other, and don't do this and that. But this was light hearted yet insightful and truly the kind of things a girlfriend would tell you. I reccomend this book to all expectant mothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I GET IT -- SHE FEELS FAT!!!","review":"Uggggg. I wanted to like this book, but after being bombarded with her incessant ranting about how FAT she got and felt and looked and about how FAT I will get and feel and look -- I just couldn't stomach it. This woman was miserable. I understand that it's nice to have an author out there to commiserate with, but this woman absolutely despised being pregnant. I read this book back when I was 8 weeks pregnant and I have to admit that it terrified me. Now that I am 32 weeks pregant and looking back on my pregnancy -- I never got fat and although I have been umcomfortable at times, the majority of my pregnancy has been wonderful. Maybe I am one of the lucky few who didn't suffer from every horrible side effect that pregnancy has to offer -- and maybe she did -- I guess I just can'r relate and nor do I want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this for all of your Pregnant Girlfriends","review":"I absolutely loved this book while I was pregnant & have reread it with each pregnancy. I also have bought it for everyone I know who is pregnant. It is the most straightforward book & tells you things doctors forget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman should read this","review":"This is the most refreshing book to pregnancy and every day events in pregnancy. Every minute I was laughing. My husband found som many little comments to be so funny, he had to read it himself! This was a big step for him!!! Every woman either thinking of getting pregnant or is pregnant should read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"I am now stupider for having read it. Seriously a huge waste of energy and brain cells. I am not sure why this woman has 4 children if pregnancy is so horrible. Her warped image of self and body was too much for me to handle. Boo hoo she couldn't fit into her size 4 dresses while pregnant and her husband seems like a gem too. My husband is wonderful and this book acts to stereotype men as sex and body obsessed ignorant blokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy","review":"This was a great book! Great for a little comic relief sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MOST accurate and honest pregnancy book I've ever read!!","review":"I've had 2 children, and am on my third, and could relate to everything the author said.. I've never read a more honest, open, and genuinely funny book than this one. I have recommended it, to people who don't even have children yet!! Whenever I feel down , or just need a good laugh, I just pick up this book, and flip to any page, and just start my reading. I LOVE this book. God Bless Vicki Iovine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The manhating, yuppified, self centered guide to pregnancy","review":"All I need to say further is that in one chapter of the book, Ms. Iovine has the nerve to say that you should should expect your husband to cheat on you if you don't have sex with him regularly while you are pregnant. She also suggests an extra stitch after an (in her world) obligatory episiotomy to \\"tighten things up down there.\\"Furthermore, in Ms. Iovine's world, single women apparantly do not get pregnant, nor do nonbody obsessed women, or women who have more things to do than whine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by negative tone throughout...","review":"Everyone told me to get this book. Once I did, I was very dissapointed by its negative tone. Could have used some more humor, less bitterness."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD FOR COMEDY ONLY","review":"This book should be read for the comedic aspects ONLY. Mrs. Iovine might mean well, but I think she is misinformed and makes too light of what interventions in hospitals can mean for mother and infant. To counter the effects of this book, I highly recommend a trip to [...]compleatmother[...]and find out about birth from a completely different perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reassuring and hilarious; a must-read","review":"I haven't stopped laughing since I started reading this book a few days ago. Vicki Iovine clearly knows what's on the minds of moms-to-be, and anyone wondering about the joys and mutations of pregnancy will enjoy this book. I certainly have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Funny! The Dad-to-be should read it too!","review":"Vicki Iovine does a fantastic job lightening the mood for pregnant women. She tells it like it is and lets you know you're not alone in the whole pregnancy ordeal. Of course this should not be the only reading you do about pregnancy, but when you're sick of all the medical mumbo-jumbo, pick this one up. I shared many chapters with my husband and he laughed along with me! I'll be picking this one up for my pregnant girlfriends in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy is Not Pretty, But it's Pretty Funny","review":"Buy and read this book, but supplement with a \\"real medical\\" tome such as What to Expect If You Are an Expectant Nazi. Girlfriends Guide is for the more mature, easygoing, realistic mother-to-be. Uptight people without the maturity to see the humor and warmth in pregnancy may be offended (as evidenced by some reviews listed here). Shining through the flippant tone and humorous anecdotes comes Iovine's sincerity and best wishes for her audience. Sure, she has her opinions and they may not be everyone's, but most of the \\"real, medical\\" books on pregnancy are filled with opinions, too. So buy this book AND a \\"real\\" medical book and alternate. I promise, you'll come back to this one more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it with a grain of salt.","review":"What you have to remember is that this is one (or three) women's personal opinion. I listened to it on tape and enjoyed some parts for their entertainment value. I did learn some valuable thing like what to pack for the hospital. The section on epidurals completely precluded not having one which is a valid \\"and safe\\" choice for both mother and child. The section on exercise during pregnancy was nonsense - every woman should stay active and exercise if possible during pregnancy. This is a book to be taken lightly, not seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a fear-based pregnancy, this is a perfect book for you!","review":"I read the last chapter of this book right before I went to sleep. I had nightmares for a few hours and then woke up at 3 am and couldn't go back to sleep. I shouldn't have read the pages and pages of writing coming from fear right before I closed my eyes! This book touched upon most women's fears - the things they make up about their bodies, husband having flings, labor and delivery being so painful that there's no way that anyone in their right mind could ever have a natural childbirth, a future with no sex. It took me hours to go back to sleep (8 am) and get this all out of my system. There are so many more empowering pregnancy books out there - this one isn't one of them. I'm grateful that the experiences of my girlfriends are so different and more conscious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"clever book","review":"this book is written in the genre of nanny diaries (in the whiny way cynical people complain). Does make me feel better about hating my pregnancy. It's good to know things will get better in the future without all the preachy hallowed vessel mantra (pregnancy is awesome. you'll love your baby. just let nature take its course. you are sacred.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"i read this while i was pregnant and i found it to be outdated and annoying. put it this way, i LOVE to read, and very rarely dislike a book. i threw this one in the recycling bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but not worth the money.","review":"The friendly funy tone can be entertaining at times, but the author's obsession with her weight and cellulite really ruined this book. It seems like her main concern with pregnancy was how much weight she would gain. It is good to have a realistic view of your body. However, Vicki Iovine's portrayal of the pregnant woman's body is NOT at all helpfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truely Poor Experience To Read!","review":"Please don't believe anything this woman says. She is negative, condescending and makes pregnancy sound like a horrible experience for everyone. Although some of the stories are humorous, you are still left with the feeling that you are fat, your husband will never find you attractive again and if you don't have the same miserable experience that she did then you aren't normal. A HORRIBLE BOOK TO READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT read this book","review":"I bought this book for myself when I was about 4 months pregnant, and thought that it was the worst book in the world for a pregnant woman to read!! I really hated the part where she said that when my husband told me that I was still beautiful that he was lying and when my friends said that they couldn't tell that I was pregnant, that they were just being nice. From what I understand, this woman is not a doctor, and I certainly wouldn't want her as a 'girlfriend'. There are MUCH better books to be read of there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A limited viewpoint presented","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. It was given to me as a Christmas gift and I have heard other pregnant moms recommend it. The author says \\"I have always thought of pregnancy as divine permission not to exercise.\\" She even lists her top 8 reasons why you shouldn't exercise during pregnancy. The author also gives misleading information like that if it is your first baby, chances are you will have an episiotomy. Episiotomies are rarely given these days. She also seems to equate midwives with home deliveries. While some do deliver at home, most midwives deliver at hospitals or birthing centers and have 24 hour physician back-up. The author also described a girlfriend who chose natural childbirth as a cavewoman who had something to prove. Really disappointing viewpoints expressed in this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy with a smile","review":"This is hands-down, the funniest book I have ever read! I have read many books on pregnancy, but this one is the best on telling it like it is! Finally, Vicki and her girlfriends tell you from a \\"human\\" point of view on what to expect from pregnancy. If you're looking for medical advice you need to look somewhere else, but if you need a mental pick me up on your views of pregnancy, read this book immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging and Depressing","review":"When my wife read through this book she got depressed -- not only because of the negative, simplistic tone, but also because it seemed to mirror the back-handed compliments and \\"encouragement\\" she was getting from less supportive, less friendly, passive-aggressive acquaintances. The jokes on the cover of the book are a clue, ranging from a cartoon of a stretch mark to one of ugly \\"maternity chic\\" clothing. My wife's a good sport, but the hormones do rage and emotions are unpredictable when a woman is pregnant. There is no reason to risk it with this book. I sure wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicki Iovine needs to fire her editor!","review":"This book was a real disappointment. After reading the raving reviews I thought I had found a wonderfully helpful book on the\\"inside scoop of pregnancy\\". I am sorry to say that it did not come close to living up to my expectations. Not only is The Girlfriends' Guide poorly written, but there are mistakes riddled throughout the book such as taking an antihistimine for dry skin! I felt that this was a highly opinionated book that lacked in research and wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book IS a joke","review":"Sure, read this book if you want a good laugh--and that's all. I picked up this book in the bookstore and read through it during my first trimester, trying to find some good books to guide me through my first pregnancy. I was so offended I put it right back on the shelf. Her advice on breastfeeding, midwives, and exercise and diet during pregnancy, is just plain ignorant and represents her lack of knowledge in these (and other) areas. Reading the part about her getting dressed up to see her obstetrician was, like another reviewer commented, creepy.There are so many other excellent books to choose from when you are pregnant, that offer real advice (NOT scary information, like others have commented). What a woman needs when she's pregnant is positive encouragement and useful information during a joyous but at times anxiety-ridden journey in life.This book is just a joke and an insult to the beautiful experience of pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"The author criticizes anyone who made different choices than her even though she clearly has no real education regarding birth and evidence based care. She feels like getting a bunch of unecessary tests that may harm her unborn child is a good thing. I think she needs attention or has other unresolved issues. She's not my girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"misinformation and discouragement for the pregnant","review":"don't waste your money! I started to read this book when I was pregnant and could not put it down fast enough. If you want to be discouraged and misinformed, then by all means, read this book. Otherwise, try to find some other source of accurate and inspiring information. Pregnancy can be trying enough without someone telling you how miserable you SHOULD be. It really can take away from the pregnancy experience. I got this book as a well intended gift. Though grateful for the thought behind it, I wouldn't recommend wasting the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, accurate and fun to read","review":"I enjoyed The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy because it made me laugh, it made me nod my head in agreement and most importantly, it made me realize I really wasn't crazy with some of the things I was thinking, feeling and doing during my pregnancy. If you can laugh at yourself, you will enjoy The Girlfriends' Guide. Not everything Ms. Iovine says will ring true for you but I imagine many things will. If you like books like this one that contain the \\"real truth\\" about pregnancy, you may also enjoy We're Pregnant!, a realistic, down-to-earth look at life as expectant parents from the viewpoint of both an expectant mother and an expectant father. The two books together will give you a true idea of what to expect as your pregnancy progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"My suggestion - Don't buy it !!","review":"This is my first pregnancy and I was looking for a humorous, yet informative book. \\"My Girlfriend's Guide\\" wasn't it. I don't understand why this woman had as many kids as she did if she didn't like pregnancy. The text is very disheartening and negative and made me worry more than laugh. She paints husbands, in general, as worthless dolts who sit around for 9 months without a thought or care in their head. I'm sorry that's the kind of man she married, but my husband is 100% into this. And last, but not least, I realize it's the \\"Girlfriend's Guide\\", but if I read the word \\"girlfriend\\" one more time I think I'd lose my mind. Do yourselves a favour, buy the Complete Idiots Guide or The Everything Guide. They're humourous and informative and they don't make you feel like you've made the biggest mistake of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for laughs, not for facts.","review":"This book belongs in the humor section, not where someonemight actually take it seriously. While the author doespoint out some of the humorous aspects of pregnancy and birthher general tone is that of negativity. This book is achildbirth educator's or midwife's nightmare, a doctor'sdream-come-true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of falsehoods","review":"This book has some light-hearted moments but it has more bad advice than good. The worst is the section on exercise. The final point she makes is that you shouldn't exercise because if there turns out to be a problem with your baby you will always wonder if it happened because you exercised during pregnancy! This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read and there is absolutely no medical evidence to support such an outlandish claim. For this reason and other perpetuated myths I give this book one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative","review":"I didn't read the whole book, skipping a few sections here and there but I did read a good part of it. I found this book disapointing. I thought she focused too much on all the negative parts of pregnancy. I do think it is good to know about the negative things too, but I left this book feeling bummed that pregnancy would leave me incontinent with a body that would never be remotely close to what it was (which did not prove to be completely true). I felt like I already knew about hemroids and all that crapy stuff already anyway, so I guess if you know absolutely nothing about pregnancy this book may be helpful. Just don't get too bummed because not EVERYTHING will happen to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies.....RELAX!","review":"This is the best book I've read about pregnancy (I'm a first-time mom devouring everything out there, too). It is not clinical; it is, however, a *funny* and also realistic guide to everything that you are going through! For us nervous first-time moms it is really a chance to relax with a \\"friend\\" and listen and learn from her experiences and those of her friends. (I actually got this book from a friend in Spain, and was halfway through it when I realized it was from here in the States!)BUY THIS BOOK!! You won't regret it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't bought it","review":"The author is totally self-centered and vain. She seems to be more concerned with looking good than taking good care of herself (and her baby). Don't go to the gym because you don't look good in your outfit?! Give me a break. Not everyone of us is a size 4 and wears tights and leotards. I feel sorry for her because her values seem way out of whack.All her girlfriends seem equally selfish. One gal wouldn't take pain medication because her husband was promising jewelry!? What a materialistic, brainless twit.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEGATIVE!","review":"This book dwelled on all the negative things of pregnancy. I don't think the author enjoyed her experiences much at all and then wrote about all her negative feelings. Talk to your real girlfiends who are excited about your pregnacy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pregnancy book out there","review":"Waste of time. I found this book to be shallow and the author highly self-absorbed. I was looking for a lighthearted book with solid advice from women who've been through pregnancy- I wasn't expecting brilliance- but I was still so,so irritated by this book.Granted, she states a number of times that she is no medical professional, but that is no excuse for blatant misinformation in a book (unless maybe it's marketed as a memoir, but certainly not for this \\"guide)! Anecdotal or not, it is completely unacceptable and lazy to say that x, y, or z is normal and could happen, but that you have no idea why and nothing to substantiate your claim. Research? Fact-checks? Editors? Blows my mind what gets published these days, especially by LA socialites.Can someone please point me in the direction of a pregnancy book that doesn't insult my intelligence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute book, but definately anti-natural.","review":"This book has some cute advice and is very funny in places.What I didn't like about it was how pro-traditional medicine it was. Like the reviewer Shannen below said, it is very one-sided and anti-natural anything. The witches-midwife comment really bothered me, as well as the comment that natural childbirth will make you ugly because it will break all the blood vessels in your face from straining so hard. I think the author is really off base.All in all, I would not recommend this book because it tried to make me feel like a freak about being a natural parent. There are a lot of options for pregnant women and epidurals aren't the only choice, as the author implies. I believe that women should make the best choice for them, not what the author spouts as gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"This book was a gift from a friend. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it. It was very negative, very uninformative, and very superficial. I particularly disliked her attitude toward her husband. Not all husbands are like hers. Mine actually was helpful and rubbed my back every night of my last trimester. I also didn't like her advice on not exercising. She is not a doctor and shouldn't be giving out advice like that. It is important to stay healthy and fit so that you can actually get through the labor. Overall the book was a letdown and I am telling all of my girlfriends to not buy it. The best book I have found is by Glade Curtis. It goes week by week to let you know how you should be doing, how your baby is, and is based on actual science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the First Time Mom To Be","review":"I would definitely not recommend this book for a first time Mom. I read this before I got pregnant and ended up in tears. I have a great self image, but by the time I finished this book, I was sure that I would end up fat, lumpy and unlovable. I was sure that my husband would never want to touch me again. I have told all of my friends who are trying to conceive to leave this one on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"almost made me adopt","review":"I tried hard to appreciate the humor of this book- but beyond that, it didn't highlight a single positive thing about being pregnant- in fact it almost scared me out of it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who's considering or experiencing pregnancy for the first time- stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me","review":"I read so many great reviews about this book and was very excited but, I just felt the author was very pretentious. I don't know, I assume it's just me but, I did not like it at all!!Hearing about her \\"supermodel\\" friends and their pregnancies and all the name dropping drove me crazy! It's not an audition to be on the \\"cool list.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"real life advice","review":"This book is wonderful. After reading every pregancy book I could get my hands on I was overwhelmed with feelings that I should be exercising all the time and eating wheat germ on every meal. I was thinking that there was no \\"real\\" advice until I read Vicki. Even my husband read it and enjoyed it. She made me feel happy to be pregnant rather than scared. Her introduction alone is wonderful. I highly recommend this book to any woman who is pregnant and looking to read something about pregnancy that will not make you feel bad and will definantly make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NON STRESS, FUNNY BOOK","review":"I LOVED IT SO MUCH I AM PLANNING ON BUYING ALL THE OTHER BOOKS SHE HAS PLUBLISHED. NON MEDICAL OR STRESS RELATED MATERIAL. BUT FOUND IT CONFORTING, EASY TO READ, FUNNY AND GREAT HELP TO MAKE MY HUSBAND UNDERTAND I WAS NOT GOING CRAZY. I TRULY THINK ANY PREGNANT WOMAN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK IS ONLY BECAUSE THE THINGS IN IT ARE TRUE AND FUNNY, WHO NEEDS MORE STRESS..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud!!","review":"As a thirty-something pregnant with my first, I had every book under sun. This one made me laugh so hard that my already compressed bladder had to struggle!This book is great for a funny look at pregnancy. For example, it instructs husbands in no uncertain terms that a gift should be given to his wife upon the delivery of the child. The section on urgency of bathroom use made both my husband and I laugh, because I too had been ready to fling myself from a moving vehicle to \\"go.\\" For the most part the book made me laugh. When it got a little more \\"serious,\\" like in the section on maternity clothes, it wasn't very helpful (or funny).This book is a great break from the standard books on pregnancy. If you are looking for factual info, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid tips for the oblivious","review":"Not exactly \\"The Thinking Women's Guide to Pregnancy,\\" this vapid tome was the single worst and least helpful book we bought to educate ourselves on pregnancy. This book will not help you unless you view pregnancy as an unfortunate condition that needs to be coped with rather than embraced. And the \\"coping with\\" is make-up tips from the author-model. If you are at all into natural childbirth (and fall on the breastfeeding and cloth diaper sides of the issues) then this book will mostly just offend you. If, on the other hand, you think women who forego drugs are wacky leftists, then this book will help you feel good about being oblivious."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've burned it, but it wasn't my copy.","review":"Really. Though some have found this book immensly helpful, I found the author/narator's obsession with her physical appearance grating. The advice to forget about excercise because you'll get fat anyway was ludicrous. Also, as an admittedly biased first time mom who gave birth at home with midwives in attendance, I didn't really get anything out of the 'trust you doctor' vibe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fluffy read, but not a lot to learn here","review":"This falls under the entertainment and not pregnancy/childbirth education heading. The book focuses on the author's experiences and is unabashedly biased. It's a good background on what to expect with regards to symptoms, tests, etc.. It's also rather funny in some parts; however, I don't beleive the author ever intended for this to be a medical reference (although it's very medical-focused). Buy it used, there are tons of copies out there. Don't use it as a reference when making your decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very opinionated","review":"I put this book down on my third week of pregnancy. After reading a few pages, I noticed that most of the information did not relate to how I was experiencing my pregnancy. I tried to be objective and began to read it five weeks later and still could not relate to the information Ms. Iovine was telling women. Some of her statements are silly, childish and not reflective of what an adult would or should say to another adult. I would not even share her information with a teenager who is pregnant. Her recommendations can be found in other books that speak to its readers in a more intellectual voice. Others may rave about this book but I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and thoughtless","review":"First of all, what form of low-life are these \\"girlfriends\\" married to? They all sound like refugees from the fifties with their thoughtless ways.Second of all, I have never found a more depressing book in my life. It makes assertions from, 'no, you and your husband will never find your body sexy again,' to ,'get a good male O.B. because that's the only male touch you will have in your last trimester because you will be just too unappealing'. The one or two laughs this book gave me is not enough to make me finish reading it. I prefer to feel as if my life has not ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter is excellent pregnancy exercise!","review":"Despite any negative reviews this book may have received, I found it to be very helpful--not necessarily in the technical sense, but in the girlfriend sense. I do not have any friends in town that are in the baby-production stage of life, most of them being out of their child-bearing years or just not interested right now, and my entire family lives in other states, so I was kind of on my own. With this book, as well as others (Birthing From Within, What to Expect When You're Expecting, etc.), I felt like I was armed with just about everything I needed to make informed choices for the births of my children--along with my midwife."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is humor?","review":"hey hey hey Girlfriend...! how supa cool are you! NOT. This book was so dumbed down it was embarrassing!! It also struck me as narcissistic. How strong are those maternal hormones anyway -- if you are just obsessed with how fat your ... gets or whether you are going to have gas. I found it to be just the market a shallow, mindless highschool cheerleader may be looking for. I, on the other hand, was much more interested in the development of the baby inside of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I read this book when I was pregnant with my first baby. I thought it was hilarious! It is my very favorite pregnancy book. I have loaned it to friends and I am going out to buy another copy now that I am pregnant again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air","review":"I read this book before I got pregnant, and it really helped me understand and see a few things about pregnancy that I'd never heard of or thought about before. Coupled with the usual, boring \\"informative\\" books, this one is a nice break to read. I love Vicki's humour and \\"oh well, who cares\\" attitude, letting me know that not every pregnancy is picture perfect. This book is also the only one my husband will read without yawning and looking bored.I've recommended this book to everyone I know who is pregnant (which lately seems like everyone), and those who've read it love it too. As someone else's review said, she says in the book that it is not intended to provide medical advice, so it serves its purpose perfectly. I would recommend this book as a side to the other more medically informative books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I enjoyed this book because of its straight talk and because it wasn't nearly as scary or confusing as some others. The only problem is that it isn't as informative as some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really tells it how it is...","review":"This is the best pregnancy book I have read so far. The author is really blunt and tells it exactly how it is. It truly is like talking to your best friend. You get the dirty truth on everything. You hear the good but you also hear the bad. The author uses curse words every now and then that I could probably do without but then again so does a good friend of mine now and then. This book is by far worth every dime you pay for it. I am going to purchase one for any of my friends and relative that become pregnant in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Could be Done Without","review":"This book is largely humor with very little useful information on pregnancy. One of my biggest pet peeves was the way the author kept referring to pregnancy spanning 10 months and correcting those who say it's 9 months. Yes, a pregnancy is 40 weeks long, but months (except for February, most of the time) have more than 4 weeks and they do start counting 2 weeks before you actually conceive. Thus you are only pregnant 9 months! Also, I largely objected to the occasional use of profanity in the book. I disagreed with the discouragement of exercising, good nutrition, etc. She did not directly say not to do these, but condoned slacking on issues I feel are vital to a healthy pregnancy. Look elsewhere for a good reference on pregnancy with useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hated this book","review":"I didn't even finish reading this book. I felt it was negative, thoughtless and assumed that all women hate thier pregnancies, are miserable, and have hundreds of horrible sympotms. I felt it was an insult to people who view pregnancy and birth in a more natural and postive light. I'm sure it was trying to be \\"tounge in cheek\\" but I think it failed. I was looking for honest advice woman to woman, meaning wisdom, not a bunch of whining and negativity. I could not believe the author has something like 4 or 5 children herself! I hope she raises her children with more sensitivity than she went through her pregnancies. It took me a long time to get pregnant and I view it as a privilege not something to moan and whine about at every new turn of events. I would not reccomend this book as a source of information to anyone. Maybe as a joke book or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and somewhat condescending","review":"Who knew that you could be made to feel like an outsider when reading a book about pregnancy, written by someone who calls herself your girlfriend? Apparently, girlfriends wear leggings and say don't exercise, you can be sloppy for 9 months and have an excuse to gain. I pretty much despised this book because it told you what to think. If you want a good read that is straightforward and modern, read \\"From the Hips\\". Its great info written by 2 women with exerpts from many women as side notes, not as the main text."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HECK!","review":"ALL I CAN SAY IS SHALLOW. HAVING A BABY IS NOT ABOUT A TEA PARTY WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS, ITS A MEDICAL THING, NOT A JOKE. WHAT A DISCRASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demeaning to women","review":"This book included very few facts on the true experience of pregnancy. It assumes that women are not strong enough to handle the most incredible life experience with grace and dignity. The \\"medical\\" advice is based upon the patriarchal medicalization of birth for the convenience of doctors.I recommend you pass on this book and find one that trusts women to be strong enough to celebrate the birth experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful, what a bad joke!!","review":"This is a great book, if you put yourself always first.Great for women who want to have the most drugged birth, pain killers galore for post - partum. no breastfeeding for breast implants compromises and nanny 24/7.Great to read at the spa before meeting your plastic surgeon who will take care of you after childbirth.It leaves the beauty of this time out.It does not honor our bodies, our ancestors that birthed for all those years before us.I am sorry but should be burned on a fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Informative!","review":"I highly recommend this book. Very funny, informative, but do take the advice on exercise and nutrition with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Fun Read","review":"Loved this book. It's a fun and refreshing balance to all the reference books you read when you're pregnant. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Vicki Iovine is not afraid to tell you what the parenting magazines and books will not. Your husband may be turned on by your pregnant body, but then again, he may not, and that's OKAY. You may not feel like sex for a while, and that, too, is OKAY. She offers good advice on how to work through the glitches. So many sources will make you feel guilty: you are a failure if you don't breastfeed, if you don't have a drug-free birth, if you don't have your kid sleeping through the night in his/her own crib, blah, blah... this book will let you know that you are not alone, you are not in a competition to see who has the best pregnancy, and it is highly entertaining. It is personal advice, not medical; for medical advice, DO NOT buy what to expect when you're expecting, which is a horrible book, buy any other book, like your pregnancy week by week, or better yet, just ask your doctor about any specific questions you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I afforded this book 1 star because \\"none\\" was not an option","review":"With so-called \\"girlfriends\\" like Ms. Iovine, one does not need enemies. One thing is to be able to find humor when one is overwhelmed by one's own insecurities during pregnancy, birth and the postpartum days, and quite another is to trivialize the whole experience to the point of no return, which is what this book offers pregnant women. The perfect gift for women who view pregnancy and childbirth as a major inconvenience to their busy lives and who would rather be doing something else with their time. If pregnant women want a true \\"girlfriend\\" they may want to turn to books like \\"A Good Birth, A Safe Birth\\" or to others written with sensitivity and good research backing their advice. For humor, they can always turn to good old Dave Barry books which can always provide a good belly laugh...pardon the pun."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK she's funny, but very cynical & dangerously inaccurate.","review":"This book is clever and after four births (everything from being knocked out to completely natural childbirth) I admit I recognized most of the experiences she describes. However, anyone with girlfriends like this should get birthing advice from somewhere else. Few women ever have a chance to do anything even half so important as giving birth to a child and they deserve far better support and advice than they get in this book. They should get the Birth Book by William and Martha Sears. Cynicism does not enhance a beautiful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"False infomation from a selfcentered viewpoint","review":"This book was mildly funny, and easy to read. If you are reading for any real pregnancy advice or information, please get another book. The book seems an attempt to justify the authors own opinions based on her personal wants - not on actual facts. She justifies getting her hair dyed saying the stress of grey hair is worse than the fumes, but then indicates exercise is too dangerous? If you want to stop all exercise, eat whatever you want, ignore all health advice and have a fully medicated or planned csection and want support for your choices - this may be the book for you. If you are interested in risks and benefits of different choices during pregnancy and birth - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for those who want to schedule their births","review":"This book gets one star because it is very funny. I disagreed with most of the content but the author is hilarious and I giggled my way throuh many baths while pregnant. What I dislike so much about this book is that she seems to push her view of birth on the readers. If you are an upper class woman who wants to schedule her birth and load up on the pain killers then this book won't offend you. If you want to deviate at all from this narrow view then this book will frustrate you. I don't think all women need to birth at home. But I do think that pregnancy and birth are about balancing your baby's health and your sanity. This book tells women they should be very selfish in their birth and baby experiences and does not look at the possible consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author gives the straight facts?","review":"Please. In what universe? I have yet to see her write a book that gives facts. It's \\"The World According To Vicky,\\" which, to my knowledge, is not yet the accepted world view of the World Health Organization -- which, by the way, would find most of her views on pregnancy and childbirth pretty darn UNHEALTHY."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could have done ZERO STARS, I would have","review":"If you are at all interested in the notion that pregnancy is a natural, blessed thing - then don't bother with this book. Iovine says things like \\"went the frontier woman route until she decided she didn't have anything to prove to anyone\\" (almost the exact quote) when referring to a friend's decision not to have natural childbirth. This book needs to be updated for a variety of reasons (besides the awful fashion references) in order to further discuss the facts vs myths on breastfeeding, the pros and cons of augmented birth (she practically glows over a pitocin drip at one point) and a ton of other things. If you want to be discouraged and cynical - this is a read for you. If you want to feel empowered and knowledgeable - try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book makes you dread pregnancy. The entire book takes a \\"half-empty\\" look at pregnancy. It is pessimistic and even nasty. The author has nothing good to say about pregnancy and harps on weight gain, veins, stretch marks, cellulite. She makes you beleive you will be hideous for the entire pregancy and for months afterwards.Also, the book is repetitive and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expectant dad's perspective","review":"I'm fully aware that as a expectant dad, I'm not in the \\"girlfriends\\" club this book is aimed at; however, I've read all the \\"What to expect...\\" type books that my wife has bought or have been given to us, and this was the worst of the lot and the only one I actually found offensive. I thought it might give some insight into what my wife is going through, but instead it told me that I'm an insensitive clod who doesn't really care what she's going through. And that men are just lying when they compliment their wives' changing bodies (not true!) among other absurd stereotypes. This book is a great way to plant the seeds of doubt in a pregngant women's mind and create division between expectant parents. If that's what you want, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inaccurate information","review":"The chapter on excercise is absolutely misleading. The author not only says that excercise can endanger your pregnancy but even hints that out of shape flabby women might actually have easier labors! If you read this book, PLEASE take it with a grain of salt and remember that author is NOT an expert by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"No girlfriend of mine...","review":"I was reading this book (a gift from a friend) while 5 months pregnant and at the gym on an elliptical trainer. It's not well-written and not my sense of humor so I'd been skipping around and did find some parts informative. I was absolutely floored, however, when I read her reasons to avoid exercise when pregnant. Are you kidding me? No ob/gyn today would recommend this unless health problems exist with mother or baby and/ or a pregnancy is high risk. Totally irresponsible to 1) ignore that study after study shows exercise is, in fact, beneficial and recommended for pregnant and nursing women along with the majority of our obese general population and 2) try to induce guilt about what could happen to your baby if you don't follow her moronic, baseless advice.I wrapped up 25 minutes on the elliptical and then headed into a Cardio/weight class for an hour, tossing this book in the trash as I went. Never felt better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be fun. I was hoping it would ease some of my fears and tensions but it did the exact opposite. It scared me! Some of it is funny-but she really focuses on some mediocre stuff that most likely the majority of us wouldn't even worry about. I felt depressed after I read it-then I realized it was just a book and I am not going to let one lousy book get me upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo Helpful","review":"I couldn't put it down!!! I was done within three days. This book helped me because I am young and lknow almost no people who have recently been pregnant. She talked about all the stuff your gyno wont tell you or that you are too embarassed to ask about it. Her format was excellent and very funny too. This is a scary time and uuncertain time but she made it a little lighter. I thank her very mush for writing this book. I would suggest this to anyone who is pregnant!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"Girlfriends unite! This is the one pregnancy book that I could get through without worrying if my baby is going to come out with two heads or not at all. Iovine's blunt talk about being pregnant and having a baby is quite a relief from other pregnancy books. While I wouldn't take all the information to heart - some of it is dated, even for the mid-90's - it was a fun, relazing read in the cesspool of pregnancy books. Again, I wouldn't follow some of the advise - drinking a glass of wine, borrowing old furniture, etc. read it as a way to smile through all the changes that are happening. Then make your husband read it - he'll wonder what's so funny anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This book did nothing to make me feel empowered or capable while preparing for birth. I can see why some people might like this \\"in your face\\" approach to prenatal advice but it totally turned me off. Additionally, I think it is irresponsible to tell pregnant women not to exercise. If you believe you are capable of having a happy, healthy pregnancy, and are interested in natural childbirth at all, skip this book. It's depressing and (to someone newly pregnant) overwhelmingly negative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book, Do not purchase!","review":"I am now 6 months pregnant but I ordered this book very early in my first trimester, at 5 weeks pregnant, along with the Mayo Clinic's Pregnancy book. What a difference!The Girlfriends Guide was no help at all, just the opinions of one lady, that frankly, sounds like a dum dum. Plus her kids are teens now, so this book is probably outdated, though she states this is an updated version of her original.First off, she thinks no exercise is the way to go. It may risk miscarraige, this scared the crap out of me. She says take up knitting, this is the time to be lazy.The advice about highlighting hair, and everything else, was inaccurate and just her opinion.I wish I didn't buy this what a rip off! Buy the Mayo book or what to expect when expecting, those books are at least helpful. I don't need someone to tell me that I will look fat in mirrors and blah blah blah, I am like, duh!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tickle your funny bone with this hysterical book.","review":"I received this book from a girlfriend. What a terrific gift! Five minutes later I was in tears from laughing so hard. Vickie Iovine tells you all of the secrets that everyone forgets to mention BEFORE you get pregnant. She doesn't claim to be an expert, she just tells you everything that your doctor doesn't. I was so glad to get a book that didn't make me feel like I had to be an MD to have a healthy child. The funniest part was when she talked about the need to eat RIGHT AWAY when hunger hits. I had the exact same experience of going crazy looking for a piece of candy even though my husband & I were on our way to a restaurant. He thought I was insane. But after reading this book, I realized it's just what prenancy does to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"be prepared to laugh at yourself","review":"Vicki Iovine may not enjoy being pregnant but she certainly knows how to laugh at herself when she is. I enjoyed this book because I, too, can laugh at myself. Some of her descriptions of pregnant women and the things they do were painfully truthful-when thinking back to those days, I have to admit I probably did them too! Vicki gives some insights on what to expect and what you'll feel like. I found them to be helpful. Overall, I enjoyed the Girlfriends' Guide and found it to be a pleasant relief from some of the more stick-to-the-facts, medical terms-only pregnancy books. If you like Girlfriends' Guide, you should also read We're Pregnant! which describes an entire pregnancy and delivery from the eyes of both parents-to-be. The father's comments are really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"for fun only","review":"I bought the book for myself. It's fun to read - humorous and friendly. BUT frankly speaking, it's a joke comparing to other books I bought, such as the mayo clinic guide. This book has too many personal views instead of critical/scientific truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, different twist on pregnancy","review":"I bought this book for myself, after a friend told me she'd get it for me and then never did! Anyway, I get annoyed with traditional pregnancy books (What to Expect, etc.) because they can be so dry. You don't have to worry about this with Vicki's book! Reading it is like sitting down with your girlfriends who will give it to you straight. She tells it like it is, with a good dose of sarcasm and humor, and I really appreciated that. I now buy this book for all of my out-of-state first time Mommy girlfriends when they find out they are pregnant.I wish she'd come out with an updated addition of the book, however. Some of the information seems a little outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Reassuring!","review":"There are women who say that pregnancy was the most fullfilling and wonderful time of their lives. And then there are the rest of us. This book is wonderfully reassuring to all of us who have ever thought, \\"I will NEVER do this again!\\" Most pregnancy books focus on the development of the baby, whereas this book focuses on the Mother. The advice in this book is not nearly so important as the fact that the book just makes you laugh, which is truly a gift during those trying days of morning sickness or those 3 a.m. trips to the bathroom. I would never have survived the emotional and physical roller coaster of my first pregnancy without this book, and I highly recommend it to all of my pregnant friends. The only book that beats Vicki's Pregnancy guide is her guide to the First Year of Motherhood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pregnancy Book Ever","review":"For my first pregnancy I bought every book I could find and read all of them. This was the only one that really tells you like it is while giving you the support and humor yo need to get through those nine months. I couldn't even wait until my baby was born to read \\"The Girlfriends Guide to the First Year of Motherhood\\". Buy these books for yourself and anyone else you know who is expecting. I read parts over and over. They deal with all kinds of issues as well as lots of things none of these other books talk about - especailly the fears and insecurities you might have. It was fun to read and very true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and informative","review":"My doctor recommended this book to me after saying that she read it herself and enjoyed it, often finding herself laughing at many of the parts she identified with. In contrast to what many other readers thought, I felt that this book was honest about the changes your body is about to go through over the next nine months. Although she does at times give bad advice(ie it's okay to drink alcohol to take the edge off on occasion and not exercise), the author does let you know ratherly candidly what your body will begin to both look and feel like. I didn't agree with some of her advice (such as drinking during pregnancy), but overall feel like the book was worthwhile and informitive. It gives you information that other medical books won't, but this also works it reverse. It would definately be a good idea to get yourself a medical book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful for first timers","review":"This book fills in all the missing DETAILS about pregnancy that aren't in the \\"other\\" books. Breaks all the bad news firmly but gently and doesn't apologize for the facts. Doesn't pull any punches. And not at all clinical. Written totally from the perspective of the pregnant woman; doesn't suck up to the medical community at all. Only chapter I had some problems with was the one on fitness/exercise during pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and brutally honest, but fun and easy to read as well","review":"I'd heard good things about this book, and all of them were true. The author tells you all the horrifying and wonderful things you need to know about pregnancy in a fun, funny way. I have to admit to being a great deal more nervous about pregnancy after reading this, but I also felt better prepared. The one thing I remember most about the book was that is said most women have \\"pregnancy amnesia\\"---as soon as labor's over they \\"forget\\" all the terrible parts of pregnancy. This, the book argues, is why your mother, grandmother, aunts, and friends will deny everything the book tells you about pregnancy: they've all forgotten it themselves! I found this to be very very true. Definitely pick this book up. It's a fast, easy, fun read and even if it scares you a little, you'll be well prepared for what's ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias view, not very positive.","review":"As a first-time pregnant \\"girlfriend\\", I did find the book to be quite humorous for the most part. However, I do feel the book offers no support for women who strongly choose natural childbirth, homebirths with midwives and a truly important issue like Nursing.I only read the first few chapters and felt I had to stop reading because of its negative feelings and comments against homebirth, midwives and nursing. Iovine makes women out to be a weak sex who can't handle childbirth without the help of doctors, drugs and technology. For obvious reasons women are the selected sex for something as beautiful as childbirth.I do prefer literature that sees pregnancy and childbirth as a \\"rite of passage in one's life and not a medical condition\\", as put by those who believe in Birthing from Within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tops the list of books to avoid during pregnancy","review":"If you have any interest in drug-free childbirth, homebirth, avoiding a c-section,or simply being empowered to understand your choices during birth, please pass right on by this one. Her characterization of \\"natural childbirth moms\\" as looking exhausted and unattractive after birth as compared the the perky, well-rested ones who chose drugs is not only offensive, but seriously, VERY unrealistic.

She appears downright ignorant about the benefits of breastfeeding and natural childbirth, unaware of the fact that not all of us are a size 4 and live in Hollywood, and she is insulting to families and men (for example, when she makes statements like \\"men who are involved in the pregnancy have too much time on their hands.\\"Check it out from the library if you're curious, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book.","review":"I am pregnant with my first child. I found this book among many copies of it, in a used book store. I read the first few chapters of this book when I finally threw it away. I found this book to be extremely negative, and quite horrifying. It scared the life out of me because of all the BAD things that were immediately mentioned about being pregnant. \\"Girlfriend, let me tell you about all the stretch marks, barfing, hemmies, swollen ankles, veins, psychosis, marriage problems, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.\\" I threw this book away so that at least one more pregnant woman would be safe. I suggest you not buy this book. Try Jenny McCarthy's Belly Laughs. It is light and funny, yet informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but doesn't empower women at all!","review":"I can't tell you how much I despised the content in this book. Yes, it is funny or I would have given it only one star, but funny does not make up for the fact that if does not help ease women's fear and anxiety about pregnancy and childbirth. It bascially tells you to go to the hospital ignorant of anything but what they tell you and get ready to get strapped to a monitor, be given pitocin, and have your water broken and then get a C-section because you \\"failed to progress\\". Women have a right to know their options. Iovine only recommends giving birth in a hospital. Why? Because you might not get all the interventions in a birthing center. Yes, there are no awards given out for natural childbirth, but maybe some women who \\"fail\\" because they had a c-section might have succeeded if they had educated themselves with another book and given their bodies a chance to do the work. Please don't make this your only pregnancy and childbirth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is funny, but not very helpful.","review":"This book has a great sense of humor about pregnancy, but has some really stupid advice in it. I do not agree with the author that you should quit exercising during pregnancy. Her theory is that you are going to get fat anyhow so why bother exercising. Exercise during pregnancy can help alleviate some of the more nasty symptoms, like one of the author's favorites... Hemorrhoids. This is not a good book for people who are going to take the author's advise seriously. It is also not a book for anyone who is thinking about natural, unmedicated childbirth. It is perfect for the always on a diet, can't live without hair dye set though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a sad approach to exercise (and to your own body)","review":"I have to admit, I read only a couple of lines in a book store and that was quite enough. About the question of excercise the advice was basicall: \\"Dont do it, when something bad happens you will blame yourself for the rest of your life and you won't look good in a tight sports outfit anyway. Just enjoy the time you don't have to excercise.\\" So, I conclude from that: Women excercise only to LOOK good in and out the gym? What about excercising for FEELING good, energetic not to talk about that it might be healthy? We do everything just for the looks? What a sad statement the author made about herself with just these few lines. I can't say anything about the rest of the book, but I hope it has more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatable with just the right amount of humor","review":"This book did not make me feel like I was killing my baby at every turn. It was an honest take on pregnancy from a normal gal. I found her chapters funny, and relatable. I appreciate that she did not try to make blanket statements, nor did she try to be an expert in pregnancy and advice.

I just started the third trimester so I could affirm the advice/observations about the beginning. I found the adivce about what to take to the hospital very helpful as well as what is essential to prepare for the baby.My only critical observation is that the author is so clearly a woman of privilege that the book could be insulting to women without the kind of financial and lifestyle resources that Ms. Iovine has (along with her Girlfriends)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book -- Lets you laugh and relax a bit","review":"I've read a couple of pregnancy books that were too clincial and found that I needed a book that combined real-life advice with a little laughter.

The author skips all the bull and tells us first timers how it really is. The book is full of laughs and stories that you can actually relate to making you feel like you're really talking to your girlfirends. It made me feel so much better about my pregnancy. Just knowing that the changes happening to your body are normal during pregnancy eases the stress and puts your worries to rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Fun Book","review":"I LOVED this book!!! I was somewhat ambivalent about my pregnancy for many reasons, one of which was because I had never planned on having children. I just wasn't into all of this \\"baby love\\" stuff that many other women are. Well I read, and read, and read all of these pregnancy books and just got more and more depressed. I just couldn't relate to any of it; I needed the \\"real deal\\" in straight up, non-sugar-coated, words.Well, then my girlfriend sent me this book and I was thrilled. Finally I'd found a book, and a mind-set, that I could relate to, and with that, I comfortably settled into my pregnancy. Vicki Iovine discusses very frankly and humorously everything about the feelings and changes of pregnancy. It is very personably written and I found every last page engaging.This is an emotional book, not a text book, and that is precisely what is so good about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic to my life!","review":"I found her completely old-fashioned in the way she described how husbands to be acted. I thought this was geared towards older mothers to be. I am 24 and could hardly relate to a lot of her topics. The exercise philosophy is crap and could scare a lot of women unnecessarily. Nearly everything that I've read encourages women to keep up their exercise routine for as long as they feel comfortable. This book is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy is a MUST HAVE!","review":"My best friend gave me this book when I got pregnant & it was one of the best things she ever did for me! There are so many things in this book that are essential for every pregnant woman to know but is afraid to ask. What to Expect was boring for me to read & a bit depressing - I felt it dwelt too much on what could go wrong. On the other hand, the Girlfriend's Guide is a totally enjoyable & quick read!

I feel sorry for any woman who reads this book and takes it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone who believes a beautiful childbirth is possible.","review":"I found this book very offensive as it is extremely negative about natural childbirth and suggests that anyone who wants to experience an unmedicated childbirth must be nuts.

Not only does it portray birthing, nursing and a mother's right to advocate for herself during labor and delivery as negative, it provides misinformation.As a birth educator, labor doula and mom, I HIGHLY discourage reading this book to anyone interested in obtaining objective, evidenced-based birthing and postpartum information.Stick to Sheila Kitzinger, Dr. Sears and Penny Armstrong (to name a few) as strong birth education authors. All of these will provide a thorough, evidence-based approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a hilarious and welcome read during pregnancy.","review":"This book is an honest, open view of pregnancy as experienced by Vicki Iovine and her Girlfriends. It was a welcome read among all of the serious reading that I did throughout my pregnancy. I would literally laugh out loud while reading certain passages. I have also bought it for many of my Girlfriends upon learning of their pregnancies, and bought myself a new copy for my third pregnancy because my first copy seems to have disappeared. Share the wealth! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get all dolled up for your obstetrician?

This particular book gives being pregnant a whole new meaning. It shows that there can be humor involved for the long nine months. It gives you the answers to questions that you would never ask, ie. what in the world are hemmoroids? This book is just plain fun to read. It also reassures the pregnant woman that it's ok to eat, cry, laugh, scream, vomit, and take a nap all within a thirty minute time period. I highly reccommend this book to any woman who is pregnant especially for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of All The Books, This One Delighted Me!","review":"After reading all of the how-to and what's-what books, read this one just for the fun of it. Delightful and funny reassurance that everything you're going through is universally shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book that helps alleviate common pregnancy fears","review":"When I first discovered that I was pregnant I became slightly paranoid about what to expect and took the whole pregnancy thing almost too seriously. This book basically helped me lighten up. I found out that it was okay to laugh at myself and all of the strange emotions and cravings instead of worrying myself sick. The book offers great advice on everything from how to curb morning sickness to how to put together a decent-looking maternity wardrobe. I would recommend this book to all who are pregnant whether it's their first or last baby. Now when I experience those moments of paranoia I look back on this book and have a good laugh at it and, most importantly, myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very light hearted and humorous - very true to life.","review":"I have read this book and loved it so much sent it to a pregnant girlfriend.It was a very light hearted approah to pregnancy and its triumphs and downfalls that I have now read it twice in a month.

The author was really funny but at the same time she was very informative. Whenever I was afraid that something bad or strange was happening to me, this book calmed me right down.

I would have liked to see it as more of a month by month book."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this one if you're looking for the facts of pregnancy","review":"This book was condescending in it's tone - \\"Don't worry your pretty little head about it! Get a c-section, it's easier to schedule your birth!\\"A c-section is MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY, and should never be discussed as an option for anyone unless there is a medical indication.It also included such gems as \\"dressing up for your Obstetrician, even when you don't care what your husband thinks of you anymore\\", and the \\"watermelon diet\\".Stay away from this one if you're looking for factual information on pregnancy and childbirth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious book for those who are pregnant","review":"This book is horrific and really not helpful to any woman is a serious thinker.

So when I finally did get pregnant, a mother and girlfriend gave me this book. I loved it. I read it along with my regular what to expect reading, but this book was so much more lighthearted, that it made a great companion and kept me from worrying too much about the process and eventual outcome. I think that every new mom could benefit from reading along, its funny, not too serious, and quite helpful. Keeps this period light and helps you to stay focused without becoming neurotic about everything in the process. Great for urban moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than you need to know...","review":"I thought this book sounded like what I needed to hear. Well, I'm 6 1/2 months pregnant, and I got freaked out by most of the stuff in this book. Granted, I had an awful first 4 1/2 months of pregnancy, so perhaps I wasn't in the best frame of mind. However, reading about things that can happen during pregnancy and childbirth that are just horrible does no one any good. Sure, you could say, \\"I want to be prepared for everything,\\" well, I'm sure this is not possible. I had nightmares after reading this book. I know Vicki, you had the best of intentions, but it was just too much info for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put My Mind At Ease","review":"After reading all the text books on pregnancy I was left feeling overwhelmed. Could going for fast-food more than once a month really harm my baby? What about mild \\"spotting\\"? I read the other books for facts, and I read The Girlfriends Guide for comfort and peace of mind. Vicki takes the severity of our concerns and levels them with humor based reality. Well Done"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!! I Love This Book!!!","review":"I think that I've probably read all the recomended stuff.All the factual,common,bland,doctor stuff. Now I havefinally found a book that does not scare you intosubmission! Vicki gives just enough humor to make a scary,and somewhat akward, period in a womans life, so muchmore enjoyable. Her insight and experience is greatlyappreciated and sorely needed. I'm recomending it to allmy friends!

Vicki Iovine takes an Erma Bombeck approach atthe non-medical truths that all expectant couples share. Itmakes you double over with laughter and is impossible to putdown once you get started. Very reassuring for nervous orfirst-time parents-to-be. Just as the title says, expect tofind here all the advice that only girlfriends (and notdoctors), have the time to give you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read a negative book-- this one's for you!","review":"This book is full of such helpfull advice as: you'll never lose the weight while you're breast-feeding, you'll have excess skin, gain weight all over your body and will need at least 9 months to lose it! This obsession with body changes and inability to lose weight may stem from the fact that the author is a size 4 and 1 extra pound seems like 10 to her. Not only is this book depressing, it does not accurately reflect a normal pregnancy. The author lists countless symptoms and insists that these same symptoms occured to all her girlfriends. Let me tell you-- you might experience half of those! I wonder why the author chose to have 4 children in 6 years (NO KIDDING the rhythm method didn't work for her!)She certainly didn't cherish the pregnancies! Clearly I'm a minority opinion here, but I don't know what other readers found humorous about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"for \\"cute\\" little Moms","review":"While I found parts of this book humerous, I didn't really find it informative. It assumes that you are a well off, married, and thin. The comments on maternity clothes implied that any normal women could get by wearing a few fat clothes (size 10, for many of us size 10 is a REALLY good day) and her husbands clothes until she' ready for real maternity outfits. Although I'm not sure that I can handle a completely natural birth, she ridicules anyone who thinks they might like to try it.In short, her many of her experiences and advice simply do not apply to me or my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $, borrow it from the library","review":"The reviews on here rave about this book. I do not agree. The book was amusing and funny (also a bit scary) but I certainly wouldn't follow the advice in it, unless you have a lot of extra $ and time to throw around. The advice and information wasn't very practical. If you want practical advice and a down to Earth conversation about pregnancy talk to your own friends, you're much more likely to have something in common with them than Vicki Iovine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would never recommend","review":"This book starts off funny but quickly the author gives many of her own opinions which are contrary to what any Dr will tell you not to mention a bit out of date. She suggests having an alcoholic drink now and then and she encourages to not bother to excersise. It is just like listening to your girlfriend who has a major complex about weight and has a non supportive husband. It gets old fast and not to mention a bit depressing. At the half way point I had to stop reading, I had had enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny for a few minutes, but this gets old","review":"I was expecting too much from this book. I wanted either a good laugh or some tangible, valuable information: I got very little of either. Everything I read, from stretch marks to fashion ideas, I had already read somewhere else or heard before from my own friends. The humor--albeit funny for a few pages--got old for me; lots of \\"pregnancy guarantees gas\\" and \\"you'll look fat with short hair\\" jokes. I thought her rationale for not exercising was ambitious though she left out the benefits of light exercise. I also know so many women who get their figures back in far less than nine months. Other than that, the material pretty much covers the obvious, and I sort of felt like I'd been duped. Like when we all bought pet rocks. What were we thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Offensive Pregnancy Book I've Read","review":"Ok, so I admit upfront that I only made it halfway through the book before I was so irritated and offended that I couldn't go on. Morbid curiosity got me that far and would take me no further. The author states numerous times that her husband didn't find her attractive in later pregnancy. Fine. Then she went on to state that she kept coloring her hair throughout pregnancy because her husband would've divorced her otherwise. Presumably, she was joking. Nevertheless, the entire book took this tone. One woman mentioned made sure to paint her toenails before going to the OB so that when her feet were in the stirrups, they would look pretty. How flipping shallow. The book got worse and worse until I couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to expect if you have no self esteem and view pregnancy as a burden","review":"After reading this book as a newly-pregnant woman, I decided that I would view my pregnancy and body in the exact opposite terms of this author. So far, so good. The ten point list on the inner cover tells you everything you need to know. The idea is that pregnancy is painful, disgusting, depressing, fattening, sex-ruining, and uglifying both during and after. And that about covers the whole message of the book. One of the only blessings she says you have to glean is \\"a visit from the titty fairy\\". How crass! My boyfriend still jokingly says that to me now! If you are a thinking woman, do what I did and stay away from this book, and keep having sex and feeling beautiful. Don't take the lowest common denominator route and pay attention to drivel like this.PS, I'm still pg, but I read another review in which the reviewer also ignored the book and has an awesome, fit body after pregnancy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the biologist.....","review":"\\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" is good for kicks-sort of like slapstick comedy. It does lack biology and medical facts and is mostly based upon the author's opinion. If you want a light fun read, then this may something for you. My personality and the relationships that I have with my husband and friends are quite different than Vicki's, so I could not relate with most of what she wrote about. It is not a horrible book, but if you want factual information then this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, WONDERFUL,TERRIFIC, A TRUE MUST READ","review":"To everyone who is bashing this book--why would you buy a book called \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" and expect it to be a medical tome? Vicki never claims to be a medical expert-just a mommy who has been through all of the weird and wonderful things that happen to all of us when we get pregnant. I read this book BEFORE any of the serious stuff-even before \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" and remember more from it than any other book I've read since. I keep \\"What to Expect\\" by my bed and refer to it frequently, but when I need a good laugh or to be reminded that I am NOT insane, I turn to The Girlfriend's Guide. I plan to have a natural childbirth, but have a healthy grasp on reality. I may not be able to do it by myself, and Vicki's book sheds a humorous light on a difficult situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly silly silly- and not very helpful","review":"not a very good book.

Because she wasn't yet a mom and surely didn't read the book (or have the experience to know that it contained pure crap) I believe it to have been a thoughtful gift and the title sounds like it would be perfect. However, in truth this book is little more than one woman's exaggerations of what pregnancy and child-birth entails. At best, Cliff's Notes could narrow this book into a stand-up routine, albeit a pretty lame one.After realizing how worthless this book was to me, I attempted to donate it to the public library.

She is extremely cynical about every aspect of pregnancy, and gives advice that very few women could use. She spends much time male bashing and degrading fathers.

Great job.....I need the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag","review":"I love this bag, it is very durable and it gets tossed around a lot. My only complaint is the lack of rigidity.

He is a great tenor saxophone player but does not seem to have any real direction with his music. With out Trane's music to feed off of, charles's music has grown stagnant . He has had some brillant moment to be sure over the last 39 years since Trane's death but not enough !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct Jazz Transmission fron the masters","review":"Listening to Charles Lloyd is hearing a direct transmission from the masters of Jazz that Lloyd studied under and worked with.The list is too long to mention but to name but a few Oscar Peterson,Joe Zowenall,Tony Williams,Herbie Hancock,Keith Jarett,Jack DeJonette.The list goes on and on.Other than seeing Jimi Hendrix.I have never felt such an atmosphere of a true musical genius.His comand of time is astonishing as he works with Zakir Hussain on tabla and Eric Harland on drums.When you first see them on stage they look quite stark but from this trio completely based on the formation of a cosmic rythmn section flows a symphony of the freeist and most beautifully harmonic music I have ever heard.Charles Lloyd reminds us of the basis of Jazz and this free musical tradition, that he came from. That the \\"beat\\" is the alchemy and the very soul of this profound music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Vermont","review":"The 44 pictures shown in this booklet are the work of the Late Roy F. Heinrich and Herbert Morton Stoops, the present artist. Both of these men achieved fame among the best American illustrators, and their work has been seen in both books and magazines. All of the historical episodes portrayed in this series are drawn from a study of Vermont history. Both artist, after graduating from more commercial forms of art, have taken a keen interest in illustrating this series and have been painstaking in their research to make costumes, characters, and all points of the historical background in accurate accord with old times. The drawings are mainly of Early American Government, Settlers and Indians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivated","review":"It honestly took me awhile to get into this story. It seemed like a typical sappy love story, from the go. I thought it a waste of time so I put it down but found myself reading it under duress -- I didn't have anything else to read.To my pleasant surprise, the story improved dramatically and by the end I desperately wanted to see where everything would go. Though, a persistent frustration was the lack of chemistry. If I weren't told of their affections I would not have guessed it, except that it was obvious that Tetrok and Nyota would end up together from the initial meeting.I was also disappointed to find that there has yet to be an addition to the story, leaving things incomplete.I can guess what's likely to happen but this one surprised me so I'd much rather read it. The second book would have definitely been more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturn's Child","review":"This book was wonderful. I am anxious for the next book in this series.

Ships going from planet to plant, seeking other species as well as other places to colonize. Also imagine a species of people thousands of light-years from home, crashlanding on ap planet humans have landed on for the first time. The captain of this human ship (Dragons Egg) and the prince of this alien race find that they both can communicate telepathically. But soon their communication becomes more than mere comradery. Soon these two become, if not quiet lovers, very much more than friends. And becuase of this union, tragedy and a new life are created. A child with extra ordinary powers from both parents. Her name is Saturina and this is just the beginning of her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I hardly ever read a book that I just cannot finish, but this was one of those rare instances. I tried, really tried to get into it, but I never made it past page 50 or so. The characters didn't strike me as believable. The world-building was clunky at best. But the worst offense of this book was in the writing. Most of it was passive voice and overstated motivation to try and make the characters seem real. I can see why Nichols grabbed a co-author on this one. Too bad it didn't help more."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"Whoever is interested in postmodern American fiction, including the likes of Kathy Acker, Lynn Tillman, and Walter Djong ... find a refreshingly critical account in this book by Robert Siegle.

However, when playing the disc there is an enourmous problem: the whole thing is entirely in Mandarin Chinese and there are NO SUBTITLES! In ANY language. Presumably the same applies to the other nine DVDs in the series.Quite why Amazon didn't see fit to mention this in the product description I don't know. So, unless you happen to be fluent in Mandarin, just get a good book of Go Seigen's games and play through them yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Novels I've Ever Read","review":"This book rivals my favorite book of all time, Middlemarch, in the author's ability to fully render his characters' interior lives.

A little too stiff for me. I did like the characters but at times the reading got a little too much like work just trying to get to another part of the story that was a little more fun and not as much work.

This book is an exception to that rule.I would not recommend this book to anyone, not even my enemy.From my point of view, this author does not appear to have enough experience in consulting. Most of the stuffs he mentioned in this book were common sense/knowledge to even anyone not into computer. He failed to provide any significant info. His style of writing was like hiding info from the reader or he does not have any experience whatsoever on what he's writing about.Please don't waste your time on a book where all the author has to say is that you have to work hard to be a successful consultant -do I need to buy a book to tell me that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty well not the best","review":"This book is not the best on the subject, I was a little upset about this purchase.

Books such as \\"Beyond Managed Care\\" is a much better alternative.Basically, you will not be much more knowledgeable about the challenges and issues facing the hospitals, which drives the direction of management, but just learn about general management. But for that purpose, there are better books by authors such as Peter Druker."},{"rating":"2","title":"History That Reads Like a Novel","review":"DEEP RIVER is about much more than a Missouri bottom-land farm, although that farm and the author's family who worked it are central. Hamilton delves back in time to the days of Indian tribes and of slavery, and along the way spins some great stories about Frank and Jesse James, Blind Boone (a virtuouso pianist), and other colorful characters. He gives a memorable account of growing up in rural Missouri and of his school days. I found the book absorbing, and relished the author's shrewd insights and morsels of wisdom. It's the nearest thing to Thoreau's WALDEN I've seen in a long time, and it too deserves to last. Not incidentally, Hamilton, for many years the editor of THE IOWA REVIEW, writes like a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF Not Flambeau Plastics USA - Chinese Flambeau Trading Co","review":"The product is advertisted as a Flambeau Plastics \\"Outdoors 3003 Tuff Tainer\\".

I could not find any customer service numbers to call and complain so I threw this item away."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Flag","review":"Stars and Stripes, The Wave is the 2nd type of purchase I've made, but the 1st over the internet. I wasn't sure it was even available, since the product debut in 2004. The price was reasonable, but I have purchased a similar product for less. It was given as a gift, to the Department of New Jersey, American Legion Auxiliary President, as a gift, under Americanism, which highlights the history of The American Flag and how it should be displayed, etc. I was really pleased at the speed of delivery, the condition of the product when received and the quality of the product. I think this product should be in trophy stores, catalogs and wherever flags and banners are sold. I gave my first purchase to a Past Department President and it is used at their Senior Center daily. I'd love to buy one for myself! This product is THAT GOOD! Thank you for making my purchase at Amazon, a most enjoyable one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how in the world....?!?","review":"This is the only book I have given a 1 star rating for. I borrowed this book from the library for my son (thank God I didn't BUY it!) and was horrified to discover all the mistakes in it. And it's from a reputable publisher too. How the author could have made the mistakes that he did in writing this book is beyond me. Surely most of the info he needed for this is given on the Air Force Web pages. From the moment my son opened the book, I found myself explaining that there ARE women fighter pilots and that the air force base in Virginia is Langley, not Largely (?!?!). How many other errors there are, I do not know, but those two alone were enough to bias me against the book. I see another reviewer found quite a few more. I guess if we want to find out more about the Air Force, we should just check out their web site. DON'T buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed In Husqvarna YTH2348","review":"After 3 hours of use I had to remove the deck to remove an obstruction. While doing so I observed a very poor bearing design on on each of the three blade mandrels. The ball bearings are not designed to be dust free. I am sure I will have to replace soon. I am considering returning back to Lowes and buying a real like the cub cadet 2500 series mower.I cannot believe the other review that rated this 5 stars was an actual consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husqvarna, a good value","review":"I own a Husqvarna tractor with the Kawasaki engine in it so it is a little different than this one. However, the review that criticizes this tractor is not valid in my opinion. THe cub cadet is a giant piece of junk. It is now made by MTD with the Cub colors and name on it only. It is not a true cub cadet anymore. MTD does not make high quality power equipment, they are the low end at best. That person obviously does not know power equipment. Is this the same as a top of the line Simplicity or Deere, no but it is much bettr quality than any MTD product out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk after 2.5 seasons","review":"It wokred fine for 3/4 of the first season. Then the first bearing meltdown occured. I fixed it The bearings have been ok since. Early into my 2nd season. The blade pulleys failed. They have a very poor design for attaching the pulley to the shaft. It is a 12 sided star design. The pulleys round out easily destroying the pulley and the shaft. It costs $65 per roundout. I'm on my third set in 2.5 years and need another. I am giving up and getting a real mower.Don't waste your $ on this poorly designed mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money in the least.","review":"I also own one of these 'tractors'. We replace spindles two or three times per year. We, too, have been told repeatedly that we must be hitting something to cause the breakage. I disagree 100%. We mowed this grass for years with a push mower and never bent a blade or hit anything. Then, we had a Wheelhorse and it worked fine for years. This mower is just a bad design and we will never own another one. And yes, we have it serviced by a professional yearly and have had the spindles replaced by a certified Husqvarna repair professional, so they are torqued properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"PIPE DREAM IS SMOKIN'","review":"As I turned the last page of the book, I felt so overwhelmed. The way the author took us through the entire story from the jail visit, in the beginning, to the courtroom at the end was riveting. I felt emotionally connected to the characters as the author showed us the emotional rollercoaster that all of the characters were on throughout the book. It will be my pleasure to meet Solomon Jones in March at THE \\"EBONY EXPRESSIONS BOOK CLUB\\" of Newark, Delaware, where he will be our featured author.I can only end by saying, \\"I will be reading his next book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"Pipe Dream is a true to life story of corruption and addiction. Black, Pookie, Clarisse and Leroy are four crack heads on the run for a murder neither committed. When Councilman Johhny Podres is found dead in a crack house it turns out to be a high profile murder case and the cops need someone to pin the murder on. Black and Leroy are the target eventhough neither could have been in two places at the same time.I waited awhile before I decided to read this story because I didn't want to read about crack addition but after opening the book, I became engrossed in the lives of Black, Leroy, Clarrise and Pookie who were plain everyday folk who got turned out on the life destroying drug crack. Hats off to Solomon Jones for writing this realistic and emotional treat. I wish the author much success and look forward to your next release. Thanks for keeping it real.God's Blessings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely --A Pipe Dream!","review":"I was unable to finish this poorly written first attempt at a novel. The characters were thin and stereotypical; I had no desire to find out what would happen to any of them. After only 3-4 chapters I called it quits. I doubt that I missed anything in the remaining chapters. The story of crack addicts and the ravishing effects of crack is a story should be told but \\"Pipe Dream\\" is not the vehicle for this message."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it","review":"I could not get into it and I found myself not feeling sympathetic for the druggies.

I also use it for bench press, incline press decline bench press and military press by using the DF9500 Flat, Incline, Deline bench also by Deltech Fitness. The sides come solid welded so the only thing you have to bolt together are the inside cross members. This thing is very strong and stable. I lift a lot of heavy weight so I need a solid rack.

As one of the few prime lens that I own, this one is tack sharp, fast, compact, and in a tight spot--I can get everything. Even my feet!The review that really turned me around was from J.best\\"takeahack\\". The fisheye look is not for every photo. And he is right. Changed my mind. I'm keeping my fisheye and I'll sell the MC-36 and the LensBaby.BTW, please please protect that front lens element. Remember we can't use a protective filter on this leans. I use it. Clean it if needed, and put it in its pouch. That is why I give the lens a four ( wish I could do a 4.5 or better). It is a great piece of work, but I'm always afraid of damaging that front exposed element."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens!","review":"This is a great little lens! It is small and compact, still it has heft and feels solid. Works great on my D90 and produces pictures that I have never dreamed I could take.

Great for landscapes!Buy it and you will be amazed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens but...","review":"I bought a Tokina 10-17 mm and started shooting with it. I liked it but I felt it was not sharp enough and I heard about the colour aberrations.Therefore I went to bring it back to B&H; and I upgraded with the Nikkor 10.5This is absolutetly more sharp and fast. The only two things that I found bad are:1) the lens is much more difficult to keep clean than the Tokina's one;2) why the hell Nikon decided to produce expensive lenses like the Wideangle 12-24 mm and this Fisheye in crappy plastic?! For keeping down their weight? Fck the weight issue and give me some old time, long lasting great metal body lenses!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On of the best lenses I use","review":"The Nikon 10.5 I find to be one of the best wide lenses made, it is an F2.8 that is usable at F2.8, unlike the Rokinon which I found to be soft. The flare into the sun on this lens is manageable and depending on where the sun is in frame, like sunset, I find this lens has far less flare then other wides I own. The rear gel is not a great option into the sun on any lens I have used and this lens is no different to me on that, but inside the canyons in a city, the rear nd can be great at allowing thick nd filters for longer exposures."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this lens!","review":"I really like the look of a fisheye picture - it gives a really fun perspective when you are playing around, taking pics.This is fantastic - automatic focus, really high quality. I have a lot of different lenses, and the Nikon lenses are the best. The Tamaron and other \\"generics\\" are great for zoom lenses, but when you want something special, go with the real deal. The types of pictures I like to take with the fisheye don't always allow for the time to set up the shot, do the manual focus, etc. This solves that.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisheye Fun","review":"The lens works very well - it does not make the pictures extremely round, but enough for special effects"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glass, but....","review":"I recently purchased this glass from Amazon for my Nikon D80 and D200, but unfortunately, it did not fit on the D200 as it should have.

An example and one of my favorites, is where Maxx is small and he dives into the sink and then fights the Black IS with a ladle. One whole half hour episode with Hammer Head is missing. Some, maybe most of the lighter moments, which help to counterbalance the more gloomy and serious ones are gone, making the video seem very heavy. As you watch you can actually see where they cut due to the jumpyness of some of the sequences. It seems like every other second was cut from the series.

Something that nobody else has mentioned is that this book has got some humor in it, unlike Shadow of the Xel'Naga (don't read that one). Maybe it's just me, but I found this pretty funny in parts. Mike Liberty is a great character, very believable, and generally likable. The existing characters (Raynor, Kerrigan, Duke, Mengsk) were all kept the same and were very well portrayed, with the possible exception of Raynor. The descriptions don't quote the Starcraft manual, and they were well written. I enjoyed this book a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for StarCraft fans.","review":"Jeff Grubb strikes me as a very talented author. He created a good science-fiction novel based on the story of the game. However, it seems like his efforts to stay loyal to the story also acted against him. After all, even though Blizzard created an outstanding story for the game, it is designed as a backdrop for several different campaigns. It is hard to connect all of that into a novel. The author did a good job by creating a character that will connect all of the pieces together but at times the character's actions don't make sense.His descriptions of the Zerg and the Terran ghosts were wonderful.He does need a new editor though. There were some too obvious grammar errors and at least two occasions where wrong character names were used."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book was based almost line to line to the game.

This is the first exception. It is basically a summory of the Terrin campaign missions through the eyes of news reporter Mike Liberty. (hence the title) While I found the plot from the game quite good, the second way through it just is boring. if you have ever played and beaten the Starcraft Terrin Campaign (and if you are looking at the book I don't see how you coulnd't have) then you know the whole plot of the book. I have already read other Blizzard novels (Warcraft: Day of the Dragon being one of them) and I have to say, sadly, this does not live up to the standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love StarCraft, than you'll love this book!!!","review":"Hey StarCraft fans. Love StarCraft but can't play it? Than get the book and read it before you play it! This story is about a reporter who travels with the Terran Confederacy (later the Dominion). The beginning is a little slow but as the story progresses, the story quickly unfolds and you start feeling the excitment of the #1 game in the U.S. If you are a Terran fan like me, than you will like this book because it describes in great detail about how the Terran kick some alian butt!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and insightful","review":"I played this game a long time ago and now reading the book brings it all back. The book is basically the terran missions with a little extra 'padding' if you wish.

The differences are that one is a book and the other is a game, also, the other difference is that the book retells the battles through the eyes of a witness who experiences all of this in his own opinions. Aside from that, this is a recommended book for those who have never played the game and wish to read the experiences instead. If you have played the game, you might be a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"This book is a real disappointment. To StarCraft fans and not.

This book is infantile and very little thought was put into writting it. Either Jeff Grubb is a really bad writer or he just got lazy and decided to get paid for doing nothing. This is worse than the stories in the Blizzard manual that come with the game. The first WarCraft book is actually faily good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but Could be Better","review":"There are several points made in the book that get the reader to think about how they view races.

Shujhat has a sweet hand for non clasical/filmi/folk music. However the Shahana was clearly an imitatation of the same raga rendered by the virtuoso sitarist Shahid Pervez Khan. Shujhat did a good job in following the the basic frame work of Shahid pervez, but obviously and conciously did not attempt to play the intricate patterns of the raga as Shahid Pervez did. I give kudos to Shujjhat who has made a brave effort to walk in the footsteps of the great Shahid Pervez. A reccomendation for all Indian classical music listeners is to order The Immotive Sitar by Shahid Pervez this can be ordered by amazon.

The handle that came with my rake broke trying to support its own weight on its way to the roof. I didn't even use all three extensions. I managed to finish the job using lumber, hose clamps and duct tape. I returned unit to Walmart for a full refund and wouldn't consider purchasing another one. This is a very flimsy design. I can't see a tool like this making more than a single season even if you were one of the lucky ones that got a better handle. If your going to take a chance on this unit, buy it from someone who will let you return it without a hassle. It wasn't worth the 39.95 I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"snow rake","review":"This is one tough rake. i broke my last one. the arms that come out on the sides really support it. the 4 lengths of pole let me get up on my colonial roof a ways. Very nice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really came in handy!","review":"Many of us can relate to this tough winter. To date, we have had more than six feet of snow and were concerned about the weight on the roof. This snow rake did a really good job at getting a lot of it off the roof and without any damage to the shingles. It has a good extension reach and is light enough to allow you to work with it for extended periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent roof shovel for price","review":"The shovel does it's job on the ground. The 20ft extension is a great addition and it will allow you to clear to the top of your roof if it is a light snow. However, if you need to get on top of your roof( stand on it) to clear a big snow fall (heavy or ice),the shovel doesn't allow you to push the snow off-you can only pull the snow down-which I think is a design flaw. Any clearing of snow which requires you to get on the roof will requires an additional shovel. For ground work it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 ft reach","review":"I bought this for the 20 ft reach instead of a 16 footer. Good thing because I need the extra 4 feet to reach the top of roof. It does the job and is built fine with three way fastened onto thick plastic shovel type part. It's pretty wiggly as expected when you are using all four poles and holding onto the last three feet. Doesn't seem to mar roof. I have different roofs the fancy styled asphalt shingles & metal roofs. A Great upper body workout!! Maybe too much so... Just finished pulling more heavy wet snow off of roofs. (I know pull it off when the snow is dryer not when it's raining on it.) I'm getting ready for the next snow coming tonight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but it works...","review":"This rake seems to have a nice design and is fairly light weight. If you just use 1 extension piece it's pretty sturdy and looks like the photo on the box - a straight pole. But we were very surprised to see how much bow there is to the pole when you've got more extensions attached to it. The longer it is, the more the rake \\"dips\\", and it becomes pretty awkward to position it where you want it. It felt something like trying to land a great big fish with one of those old fashioned long bamboo poles!But at any rate, for us, it was still a good purchase because it allows us to reach every inch of our 1 story home's roof. (So we can drag down all the big cotton piles which accumulate from our neighbor's cottonwood tree and never seem to blow off.) I'm sure in winter it'll work great to scrape just a few feet of snow away from the edge of the roof/gutters - because we'll only need 1 extension to reach - but it's still August, we're not anxious to test that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE quailty control of arm angles","review":"This support arms for this thing suck. Plain and simple. The arms that attach to the pole then the blade are not bent properly at the ends thus they don't lay flat against the pole to ensure a good fit. I've posted three pics detailing what I mean. If I had a vice, I could probably bend them properly to get them on the correct angle, but I don't.And I reversed ends as well as tried both sides to ensure there wasn't a left/right arm or that I had them backwards. I didn't. This is how it is.The only reason I didn't return it was because I really need this thing right now in Colorado. And the positive reviews of it is the only reason I spent the money.TERRIBLE QUALITY CONTROL for a US made product. If it was $20 in the clearance bin at WalMart, I'd forgive it. But for almost $60 delivered? Inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"For years I borrowed my parents' roof rake which was flimsy (now cracked) and difficult to break down and reassemble. This was better than expected because it is strong and because it is meant to break down and then be reassembled.

The author pushes the characters through a variety of tales, ranging from 007 spy type adventures, sf, and sword and sorcery fantasy.Concept-wise, it reminds me of Wilson's Schroedinger Cat Trilogy, displaying how different choices can shape our surroundings in a variety of ways. Ultimately, though, the author intrudes too much, dragging the characters through the tales instead of letting things play out in a natural way, leaving a disconnected and at times confusing narrative.Although not entirely successful, the work is short enough that a reader interested in experitation with narrative forms might find a few nuggets here and there.

Rather, says Brill, H's films on the whole are hopeful, affirming, generating conventional suspense and working toward a happily-ever-after ending. Works like Psycho and Vertigo, Brill contends, are exceptions to more typical works like North by Northwest and The 39 Steps, which are quite upbeat and happy. According to Brill, Hitch is really an ironist whose occasional subversions of his generally hopeful outlook have received more critical attention; but that doesn't mean his whole ouevre is one of despair or pessimism. Brill argues magnificently in many well-informed essays; though his citation of Trouble with Harry as the quintessential Hitchcock film is a bit hard to swallow. Highly recommended for Hitchcock fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When ordinary life is thrown into chaos","review":"There are only 36 plots, all derived from the Greek mythology.

Into this cookie-cutter formula she places a memorable character facing the double whammy of his retirement from teaching at the university and his wife's revelation about an old affair.Unable to accept either facts, Howard Woods throws his life into chaos, running head-front into situations from which he cannot extricate himself. Having fun, he is lonely. Needing his wife back, he realizes that it is too late; she's restored her life without him.I can just hear the great discussions in reading groups around the country, debating the impact of old affair, of truth-telling, of middle-age crisis, of balancing a life filled with grief and humor.Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novelty but good nonetheless","review":"Yeah... great novelty although 'Game and Performance' by Deux is truly great.

This 1 pound bag will last me quite a while--just a small amount of pepper can season a lot of food (noodles, vegetables, sandwiches, meat loaf, etc.). The bag is not made to be resealable, so I recommend using a storage container for storing the pepper corns until they can be loaded into a grinder--the inside of the container size should be about 2.5 x 2.5 x 5.5 inches (or larger) to hold the contents of the bag.

The single strap is nice because the double straps on other models bunch up behind the knee making it uncomfortable (pinch!!). I don't give them 5 stars because I think they need more gel and some more velcro on the sides to hold the straps better for smaller legs like mine. If you're a big guy the sraps will hold fine.

It also contrasts and compares with modern traditions that are most likely similar in food ceremonial character with the ancient Manichaeans.Also, the book is good for the scholar of Manichaeism or ancient Mediterranean religions, to give deep insight into the ritualism of this major religion, active during the time of early Christianity. I think understanding this tradition is important for students of Christianity as well, as I feel its aesceticism and ritualism as well as priesthood may have effected the Christians of the Roman Empire.

The cover art was interesting and well done, very colorful, and it caught my eye. This guy has quite a tale about being in the Peace Corps in Morocco, among other things. There is a fascinating account of a meeting Mr. Moran had with Paul Bowles. He writes of personal experiences that were sincerely entertaining, and the man knows how to write. There is a sense of surrealism of this period of time, from 1981-1984 or so, that mirrors a similar mood of the early Reagan years. For a testament of the changing world around that time period, \\"Younger Than That Now\\" captures it as well as can be done. This book deserves to be read.

Haig has become a \\"must read\\" for me and I certainly enjoyed The Kingmaker. The plot, however, seemed less realistic than in his first 2 novels, both of which I give an unconditional 5 stars. Drummond also becomes a more violent character, or at least more people get killed than in previous Haig books. The book went from 5 stars to 4 for me in the final 100 pages,as the bodies started dropping and the President's best friend became the leading candidate for the biggest U.S. traitor sinc Benedict Arnold. Still, The Kingmaker is first rate , but I hope Haig returns to less grandiose story lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like Sarcastic Whiners as Protagonists","review":"Major Sean Drummond describes himself on page 92 as \\"...whining complainers like me.\\" The book is written in first person singular, and you can tell why Major Drummond is single from his complaining. If you see humor in Drummond's attitude you'll possibly enjoy the book. I found the writing style tedious, the plot torpid, and finished the book only because a friend recommended Brian Haig. I don't.I wouldn't put Haig in Daniel Silva's, Michael Connelly's, or John Grisham's league, but they are listed as \\"Customers who bought this book also bought ...\\" I can vouch for Silva's merit as a writer of top-notch thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a remarkable thriller","review":"Each time out, Brian Haig gets more accomplished as a writer of thrillers. In Sean Drummond he has created an engaging protagonist worthy of the complex and timely plots he constructs. JAG lawyer Drummond has so far travelled from the the atrocity-scarred Balkans to the turmoil of the Korean peninsula and now, in The Kingmaker, to the chaos of the Russian Federation to find the truth behind the allegations of treason levelled against his latest client, who just happens to be a former Academy classmate. An altogether thrilling ride, with some remarkable insights into who actually controls the political landscape of present day Russia."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love legal, espionage novels!","review":"Haig has created a very interesting legal beagle in the character of Sean Drummond. A novel written in the first person, this is a very effective tool for this story. I love the humor Drummond directs not only to everybody else but to himself. Enter his partner, the amazing Katrina, with a quick mind and an amazing body that interests him but thank you, Brian Haig, for not making a romantic connection between the two. Those tired stories of guy meets girl in a work situation and immediately they get into bed is so predictable and boring. The twist in the circumstance of the old flame is good plot. I thought Katrina and her alliance with Alexi was a little on the far-fetched side. Too much, too soon. A little unbelievable in the end, with the treatment of Drummond, but then it's fiction. Good characterization.I'll be reading more of Haig's books. He's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller","review":"See book summary above.Brian Haig is one of my favorite authors. This novel puts him in that field of great thriller writers. His novels are well researched and his writing style draws the reader in.The protagonist, Sean Drummond, is very likeable.

The setting is mainly school in the Bronx, the genre is realistic fiction, and there are 167 in the book. The main character in the story is Tyrone.This book is about a class that wants to do poetry. The story tells about the poems they about wrote their stories and how they got their ideas for their pomes. One of the issue in the story is a girl wants to have a baby so she feels loved. Another issue is Tyrone thinks he doesn't have a future so he doesn't know if he should stay in school or drop out. He thinks he is going to die at a young age and won't have a chance to get a good job and raise a family.I am giving this book 2 star because the book was really hard to understand for me. There were too many people talking at once and too many poems, also the slang made the book hard to understand. I would recommend this book for people in high school or above because it hard to understand for some middle schoolers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me, you've read this before.","review":"I'll make this as short as possible and get to the point. This book is exactly like those movies where a teacher takes inner city school kids under their wing to learn basketball, math, you name it. Here the plot is just the same, only with poetry. The thing is, the book is so short and there are too many characters that you can't make a connection with the kids, or remember their names. It has all the high school clichés that we are far too familiar with and in the end, they all come together and learn to tolerate their differences through the magic of poetry.Think of it as \\"Dead Poets Society\\" in the Bronx."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not advise this book!!!!","review":"Many people had different opinions on the book Bronx Masquerade by Nikki Grimes. I for one did not like it. Other than the main character, Tyrone, you don't really know what is going with the characters. You hear from each character once and that's it. It's pretty annoying. When you only get a little from each character, it makes it hard to get sucked into the book. Even though Tyrone speaks a lot, you still don't really know what is going what's going on with him and his problems. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bronx Masquerade in review - By Molly Hall","review":"The book The Bronx Masquerade an honest novel. The book provides us with such an in depth look into the characters lives. Starting off in the book you don't quite know what to expect, but as the story continues we find ourselves lost in world, not so far from our own. The author Nikki Grimes has such a way of expressing each character with completely different personalities. The book The Bronx Masquerade is an unbelievably well written book that shows us that even if it seems that you are from completely different worlds, they may not be as different as they appear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bronx Masquerade","review":"The Bronx Masquerade is basically about 18 students in a high school slowly starting to learn about each other and themselves through poetry. Yes, I know that sounds cheesy, and that's exactly what this books largest downfall is. A horrible, horribly obvious cheesiness that makes you cringe in pain. But! There are good things too. The characters are very well developed, and none are exactly written like each other. Although many of the characters completely change unrealistically fast and easily, the plot is otherwise set at a good pace, and the poetry is well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!","review":"This is a such a great read for all ages from one-infinity.

Add to that suspenders, plus maybe a padded belt, all in the hopes to help disperse the weight and what kind of restricting torture devise have we created for ourselves? Well all that changed with the Nailers Suspended Tool Belt. Finally somebody was thinking when they designed this one! The pouches ride where YOU want them. They don't always have to be in the front. Pouches are big enough without overkill.Cell phone holder is a big plus. With the suspension system, and pouches \\"loaded\\", it does feel almost truly weightless.

Unless you have a sink like the people who gave this 5 stars, do not buy this. In theory it sounds great, but... First, there is nothing that holds the roller in place while the water is shooting at it. If you just let it hang the water forces the roller against the side and it stops spinning. You have to try to hold the roller in place with one hand while you hold the washer in the other. Second, if you use it in your back yard, especially if you were using white paint, it will leave your grass with paint residue on it for days. I can't say if it kills the grass or not because I used it over a patch of crab grass and didn't really care.

I was also a little disturbed when the unit was accidentally tipped one night and did NOT turn itself off. Fortunately I was in the room when this happened and no harm was done. The real problem though is the heater simply stopped producing heat after 3 weeks of very light use in one room.

Also, the thermostat that it uses it more like a thermocouple (in a toaster oven) than a thermostat, where the heater goes full blast for a time and then goes off for a time. Turning the knob doesn't seem to affect this cycle much. It would be much better if it had a way to reduce the current flow through the coils (like low-med-high) and have it stay on.

I have read a lot of sci fi and fantasy books, so I don't need to be spoon fed by any means, but I spent a large part of my time going 'WTF?!' while reading this book. I could have laid it down in the first 20 pages but I pushed on and pushed on in hopes that one of the characters would spark my interest. After 250 pages, I finally realized I was only punishing myself and just gave up. I absolutely love Jacqueline Carey and when I saw her positive review on the front cover of this book I figured it was a slam dunk. No such luck for me. This dry, drab, morose sucker is going to be shipped off to Paperbackswap ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful in every way","review":"I bought all three books based on the strength of the reviews. Foolish me. Poor writing, thin characters, and horrible plot devices used to move the story along it's slow meaningless progression.For the reviewers who state that this is not a gay fantasy, well, let's just say that it is, and blatantly so. I put down the second book about the time when the secondary character within the course of one or two paragraphs completely changed his personality under the flimsiest of pretexts, just to put himself in the submissive position. Lazy lazy writing.I threw these books in the trash. I've never done that before, but I honestly can't think of anyone I'd inflict these books upon. Run away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I only read about 40 pages before I gave up. The characters are unlikeable, and have a great \\"fall\\" with out you ever understanding how society worked and why the \\"fall\\" is a bad thing. It's like they chopped off the first three chapters of the book and started in the middle. Further, I know that in the fantasy world, the use of different words for common stuff is standard, but it helps if there is enough of a description that you can figure out what that new word means! I read over 100 books a year, and in the past 10 years there have been about 4 books that I didn't finish, this is one of them. I have better books to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfyingly different","review":"Ms. Monette's first novel is a wonderful, sprawling fantasy set in a wonderful, sprawling city. The protagonists, Mildmay and Felix, have very different and very convincing perspectives and voices, and the world they move through is delicately evoked, alternating disturbing brutality and flights of gorgeous fancy with an equally unflinching eye.This is the story of a magician and a thief, neither of whom are quite what they seem (and neither of whom conform to genre stereotypes) thrown together by external manipulation and forced to learn to rely on each other, despite their social and philosophical differences. In the process, the reader is treated to a grand tour of a magnificent fantasy kingdom and the heights and depths of human grace and depravity.This is, in short, a damned good book, and an honest one, and one I didn't mind reading twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this but...","review":"There are many things which interested me about this book before I picked it up: discussions of the excellent world building as well as the nontraditional romance - - but the slow pacing and the extreme amount of back story/explanation of the 'world' in the first few chapters were so dense I couldn't get past them. I was not engaged by any of the characters, there are many introduced and none seem to be fully fleshed out. So little interest did I have that I'm sorry to say I didn't even finish the story. I'd definitely give the author another try though, - the world is very well thought through - so I may pick up the second novel and hope all the problems I had with the first are resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"I'll keep this short.

I tried to adjust it with some pins to make the straps tighter but it didn't work out. It's also not very thick. I play in an adult floor hockey league and some of the guys can shoot pretty hard.

After calculating the ideal enclosure volume, I fabbed up a sealed, damped enclosure out of MDF, with the car stereo and all three speakers in it. The other two are Pyle 6.5\\". Using the equalizer built into the stereo, the sound is very good, much better than I expected, with lots of solid bass. The stereo uses an old ATX computer power supply I modified. I get plenty of sound, more than enough to fill my 1000 square foot garage with music loud enough to yell to be heard, and clear enough to enjoy. Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon sounds excellent with this set-up, all the hearbeat lows full and clear, not muddy, and the screaming highs have great presence, not artificial-sounding.Don't get all hyped up about brand names, In subwoofers, the enclosure is the key.For bass on a budget, this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any reader of any age.","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a while.

Momo shows how much Micheal Ende really has to share in his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for children","review":"A friend recommended that I buy this book to share with my grandchildren.

I read the book in one session.I would recommend it to my friends and family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"How can this book be out of print? It should be a bestseller!Momo is a deeply philosphical fairy tale that is more in the league of The Wizard of Oz or Beauty and the Beast than the likes of Harry Potter. The story illustrates how many of us rush through our modernized, fast-paced lives without stopping to actually enjoy the beauty of the present moment. With all the hassle not only is time stolen, but also the essence of life: the heart.This book is truly a masterpiece and one of my all time favorite books. I just wish there were a better English translation. I've read both the German and English versions, and the translation simply doesn't do it justice. Still, read this book whichever way you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ende masterpiece","review":"This is a great book in every way. The story of the little orphan girl, who ends up having to save the world from the terrible Grey Men, who want to steal people's time, like all of Ende's books is the work of a genius.And even better: Unlike The Neverending Story, in this case I would dwefinitely recommend watching the movie too. It really captures the magic of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond wonderful","review":"Maybe the reason that this is the hardest Michael Ende book to find in English is that it really is telling children a lot about the real nature of the society, particularly the wonderful \\"free market economy\\" part of it, as well as \\"productivity\\" and \\"gross domestic product\\" and the rest. It is a dangerous book, it really makes you think about all the benefits of the new global religion of consumerism.Momo is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. It is a children's book, and I read it as a child, and it made me look differently at the world. It does not take its intended audience (children) for fools and treats them as they deserve (as reasonable, open-minded children, not bigotted, senseless adults). It has great comedic moments (stories of Girolamo) and has wonderfully created villain (the cigarette smoking gray men), as well as cool characters like Caseiopeia. it is a perfect children's novel and will keep you reading and re-reading for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible fantasy for all ages","review":"This one was a gem. I admired everything about it: the simple storytelling, a richly created atmosphere, the symbolism, and the darker implications. Momo is truly a wonderful and memorable character, I especially liked the chapter when she plays make-believe with her friends. The things that the men in gray represent are very obvious and this made them all the more frightening. I was a little uneasy about the way the novel sometimes switched between old fashioned fantasy and modern reality, but suppose this was just to drive the implications closer to home. All in all, this was excellent, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT A ROCK, IT'S A CENT","review":"Senta Berger lives with five men in a cave, one of which is gay.

Visually, the print was a nice size and it flowed. It was a strong tool that aided me tremendouosly in my bible reading/study. I can't imagine trying to study the bible without this helpful reference tool. With that being said, I eventally needed to order one for myself and after months of reading back and forth the various Strong's that Amazon offer, I chose this one. I could not wait to get it, but was so disappointed when I did. It is extremely packed with too much information with too small a print on each page, so that from a visual standpoint, it is like walking into a hoarder's home. It was just too much and because each page is so jammed pack with such small print, it is just hard to know where to land the eye, where to begin. I just put it down and felt so bad, so disappointed because I have always wanted one and to finally purchase one and get one like this was a tremendous disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the old","review":"The concordance, I must say, was in new condition.

I will go back to the older version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strongest Strong's Dictionaries","review":"The Hebrew dictionary in the \\"The Strongest Strong's Exhaustive Concordance\\" is not the same as the original dictionary.

Thanks for reading. God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Recommened","review":"I thought this was a good Strong's until I went to look up a word and knew immediately that Mr. R. Kohlenberger and James Swanson had changed the number for a word that needed not be changed. So having one word that referred me to the wrong number in the Hebrew there is no way I would trust using this Strong's to do my studies. I have been a Bible student for many years, so I knew better when I saw this BIG mistake, but for a new student, they would never know the difference. So this is why I do not recommend this book. Get a different Strong's, preferable one that is unabridged and complete. If you can get the older ones, do so. Now I did like haveing the Nave's in this book and the other features, but you can get them seperatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Strongest Strongs","review":"I wouldn't buy it if I had it to do over. John R. Kohlenberger III states that Strong's dictionaries are flawed by a methodology of the nineteenth century that has become known as the root fallacy. Then he sets up two straw men using the English words 'butterfly' and 'pineapple'. But I believe that his thinking on that subject is flawed. He also dates the writings of John between 90 and 100 A.D., so that he can say that John wasn't talking about the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. I guess if that doesn't bother you go ahead and buy the Stongest Strongs. I am not saying that he didn't make any improvements on Doctor Strong's work.J.

You can't help but love that little car. Anywho, the kids are basically a team who enter Speed Buggy in races and events and they have a garage for Speed Buggy. In their adventures, they end up thwarting villians along their way. Villians range anything from cattle rustlers to take-over-the-world types. To sum up, if you enjoyed Speed Buggy on television through the years, you will more than likely still enjoy it. I know I have and still do.

The dashing writing style and the author's light touch are well-suited to the subject, interspersing biographies of dandies, witty (of course!) quotes by famous dandies, examinations of various aspects of dandyism, and little scenes between two fictitious dandies. It is so evocative of the spirit of dandyism that I, who am in many ways the opposite of a dandy, began wishing that I were a little more like the historic and fictional bon vivants that inhabit its pages. My only criticism is that photographs are sometimes a little misplaced in the text, so that you are reading about Thomas Wainewright and looking at Benjamin Disraeli, but this is infrequent, and is a very small flaw in a gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic fall arrest system","review":"Whether you feel the need for extra safety, or for OHSA compliance, this is a neat kit with all the essential components.

But the sound quality and performance has been very impressive for the price. The remote could be designed a little more user friendly, and more inputs would be useful.I shopped around before buying this and found that in order to get something with better specs, performance, and features I would have had to spend at least $150 more.

If the recordable disk is successfully identified and a recording session undertaken, the same frustrating lack of dependability surfaces during the finalization process.When all aspects of a recording session do function properly, the CenDyne 48x12x48 external drive produces a solid audio product.

You see beautiful scenes, but don't know whereabouts in the city is the place you are seing. Disapointing. I was looking forward to buy the whole colection (Paris, London, Prague, Rome...), but after this one, I might stop here. Moreover, there are important places in Vienna missing in this DVD. Vienna, city of Strauss' great Blue Danube Waltz, being Danube itself a symbol of Vienna... hold on!, the Danube river is not in this DVD at all! Neither is the Belvedere Palace and Gardens and many other places.If only the music matters, ok. If you would like to see Vienna in a video, forget about this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful audio-visual treat!","review":"Beautifully filmed and arranged! They show some of the best known sights in Vienna and some unusual ones as well. The soprano singing an aria from the Magic Flute is exceptional (couldn't find her name, though). Note that this is not a documentary - it is a musical journey. If you like listening to music and would like some great visual stimulation as well while you do, this is for you. The images are lovely and fit the music well. If you know the old Naxos series most of those were very good as well but you didn't know what you were seeing unless you stopped the disk and went to the menu. They fixed it in this series by inserting a simple slide with a little information at the beginning of each section. As this is not a documentary per say, no more than that is needed, in my opinion -just enough to give some info without stopping the flow of music. No talking! Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy this DVD","review":"I like this DVD. Exactly what I like -- watching all the beatiful scenes, classical architecture, people, and culture, while listening to classical music. Hope I could tour Vienna in near future.

The flipping techniques are very good and easy to follow and understand, however it seems like they talked mostly about how the knife was made and pacific cutlery and less about the history of the knife and fighting techniques. Dan Inosanto does not give a very good history on the knife in this video is only maybe 5 seconds.And goes the same with fighting techniques. The book gave a more detailed info on the history. The entire video is only 45 min long. To short for me, but not bad. Its not the worst video Ive ever seen, but I am sure the other DVD by the military guy might be better.

I had a hard time to change the blade but managed to do it. Then later when I wanted to change the blade for cutting some other things, the blade change pin got stuck. No matter how hard I try, I couldn't push it down to release the lock. I even tried to use hammers and other tools but couldn't get it unlocked.I have to commend the customer service of Amazon.com. I emailed them and quickly got a replacement saw. But the new saw arrived with exactly the same problem.

So many of the rationalizations made me giggle out loud because they were so honest, or I'd thought the same thing at one time or other, or it just made sense logically. I loved it.The book is an \\"easy/ quick read\\" size. It fits nicely in a purse or car (for moms waiting for little and big darlings to come out from school or whatever).I'm going to give it to the gal I sponsored last year in the RCIA program and suggest to our Director that she recommend it to all the folks in RCIA. I think it would be great for them to see how much alone they are NOT - in their thoughts and concerns and feelings and anxieties, etc etc etc. The tone is so inviting, light, and very thoughtful. It's a beautiful journey so beautifully shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nielsen: Saul & David, Op.25","review":"Nielsen: Saul & David, Op.25 is a biblical opera written by Danish composer Carl August Nielsen. Niemi Järvi leads the Danish National Radio Symphony Orchestra on this 1990 Chandos Records recording from 1990. The sound quality is truly superb and it sounds as if one was watching this in person. The booklet contains all the lyrics and well-written music notes. Truly a magnificent recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality at a small price","review":"I've tried at least three of those cheap half-moon shaped \\"hearth rugs\\" only to see them melt if the tiniest spark sat on them for a few seconds. Most aggravating of all was that they also seem to walk - never staying in place. My new Jardin stays in place - never melts - is very thick - and the colors are a beautiful addition to my hearth. I have already recommended this to my friends. You won't be disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD to end excuses for the couch potato!","review":"This dvd is similar to the Leslie Samsone dvds, which I really like. It is like a brisk 2 mile Leslie Sansone DVD. The lady directing it is energetic and a little crazy which makes it fun, she makes a good team with George Foreman. This was the first George Forman DVD I got and it is a good DVD to start with. Now, don't think because I mentioned it is good to start with means it won't make your heart rate go up! it is short (30 minutes) yet time wisely used to get your energies up by the time you are done. If you like Leslie Sansone, you will like George Foreman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"George Foreman makes exercising (ugh!) fun.

Also, I do not think it works very well. The cool mist does not do a good job. I had to buy another humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy","review":"We placed this in our bed room and as soon as we plugged it in the thing started making this terrible sound. I thought that it might be that we just plugged it in and that it needed time to suck the water up and start working...WRONG! Several hours later we went up to bed and found that it was still making the noise, we had to unplug it just to get some sleep!Another thing that I didn't care for was that it didn't have an on/off switch, you just plug it in for on and unplug it for off. There were no setting switches either, so you have no choice if you want a little or a lot of humidity. The base of it was also a bit cumbersome to carry when full. I highly suggest you find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"It tells the story brilliantly","review":"We have used this Haggadah for more than 20 years. The saga is told brilliantly and evocatively. We have only 13 copies. I keep trying to increase our stock.I will give one anecdote to illustrate the clarity and power of Levin's Haggadah.

But the torque setting clutch is not perfect. Occasionally it stops in the disengaged position after driving a screw, and the motor will spin but the bit won't move until you whack the next screw enough to knock the clutch into engagement. Not an overwhelming problem, but this torque setting mechanism is not as trouble free or effective as that on the Milwaukee cordless driver/drills (which I also own).In addition, I would like a bit more trigger travel to make it easier to get the speed you want, but that seems to be true of variable speed drivers and drills regardless of make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing work is difficult","review":"This book is disturbing because it deals with a disturbing subject. Readers be forewarned - if you have dealt with any of the issues that Kate has dealt with this book will stir up a lot of emotions. I recommend this book for anyone who is or has been in a relationship with a sex addict and wants to begin the journey towards personal healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It! Save your money.","review":"Coming Through with Grace is the maudlin tale of a failed marriage told by the self-absorbed protaganist. The story revolves around the author's relationship with her husband who engages in various unsavory activities. With each foible, the protagonist purportedly learns more pearls of self-awareness and insight which she doles out in dreary succession. The plot rambles and the author's conclusions are trite and derivative. The only grace to be had with this book occurs when the reader gives thanks that the dreadful tale is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not functional at all","review":"Because of the handle's round shape it is difficult to hold this teapot level when hot. You can't support the pot with your pinky (because the pot is hot) and otherwise the weight of the pot will twist the ring shaped handle in your hand - spilling tea everywhere. The spout also tends to dribble, so (assuming you can actually hold the thing) getting tea into a cup is an added challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fur Real is terrific","review":"I received my white fur real yesterday. She is terrific in her mannerisms. The fur does not feel like real fur but everything else about her is wonderful. I took her into the office to show and everyone raved over her.

One wonders if toy companies do this on purpose. Right before the holidays they hold a toy right under children's noses, via commercials, and then parents end up paying top dollar for these toys. I feel as though these toy companies have the capacity to make enough of these toys to go around as I am sure there will be more than enough available after the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Furreal","review":"Disappointing..cute at first,sounds too mechanical,kids werent very interested after the first hour of play,returned it to the store and kids never missed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism","review":"Firehouse Down is a blend of stark realism mixed with pure emotion. Anyone who wants to know what really happened during the Ground Zero rescue operations from a real firefighter should read this book. It is emotion filled along with some rather funny episodes that show what the volunteer fire service is really about. Some of the vivid details are frightening, as are the descriptive overtures about the fire service. I came away crying happy tears knowing there are people like Jonathan Wright putting their lives on the line to protect us all. A wonderful, elaborate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds","review":"This was a great album considering it was their first! I like Amon Amarth because over all they talk about Ancient Germanic tribes and stuff, but each album talks about a different part of it. For instance, in this album, Amon Amarth sings about the Death of Baldur, Ragnarok, and how warriors go to Valhalla when they die in battle. The song Burning Creation is by far the best. The only down side to this album is that since Amon Amarth was young at the time, the songs do sound very similar in terms of constant riffage and double bass beats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Concept, Clumsy Production","review":"There are so many books about FLW that any new one has to be special to rate my buying it. This atlas purports to show a great number of his works together with enough information to let Wright fans find, and, if possible tour the buildings. Good intentions here are somewhat undone by poor photo editing and printing. Some of the images are wonderful, but many needed help (i.e. image processing) before being sent to the printer. In some cases the printing is at fault, because one can feel an excess deposit of ink on some images and not others. I feel sorry for the author! Her publisher really let her down. If this book was re-edited by a Photoshop professional and the printer properly supervised, it would be great book indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted!","review":"This company was great to deal with. The boomerang not so much. It was exciting to have a real wood boomerang. My son was thrilled because they are so hard to find. However, we only threw it a few times before it hit the ground and splintered. We weren't particular abusive and we used it on a grassy field. It couldnt take the fall I guess. But hey, the 5 times we threw it -- it came back like a champ! The company was kind in its customer dealings after the fact. My best advice is if you are going to buy this -- might as well get two so you have a back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disatisfied with the toy!","review":"The toy lasted only two days, we went to the park to use it and it dropped a distance of about eight inches and broke right in half!

I only got to throw it 3 times and it never came back, I could deal with that because it was a little windy outside. On my third throw it went up in 1 piece and hit the ground in 2 pieces, I was pretty disappointed it didn't last longer than a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing it's only 30 bucks!","review":"The thing that bothers me about this keyboard is that Belkin felt the need to move some of the keys.Of course they are the ones you use most: the zero key on the 10-key pad is half the size of any regular keyboard, the enter key is moved over so that you hit the \\"\\\\\\" all the time, and the \\"Delete\\" and \\"End\\" keys got moved too.All in all, if you're a major computer user at work or at home, I would chose one that is more mainstream and user friendly.

It was not for me, I just handled the purchase of the item. I saw it when she opened the box, and was totally dissatisfied. She said it was alright, and kept it. The legs were protruding through the packaging on arrival. The stand was bent so it wobbled when stood on a hard floor. It is standing on deep carpeting where she put it, so she said it didn't matter. I was not happy with this item at all, and wouldn't have paid more than five dollars for it.

I was told by my FIL (contractor) to get the Milwaukee since \\"they're the best\\". I've used it only 3 or 4 times now and it spits out oil (from the motor vent). I guess it's only a matter of time before all the supposedly sealed oil leaks out & burns out the motor. Would NEVER purchase another Milwaukee product. I really thought this to be the last drill I'd ever need but now expect it to start smoking in a few more uses. Perhaps I got their only lemon but this tool was way too expensive to take another chance. Back to Sears for me cause on-sale I can get a corded 1/2\\" drill for < $100.

The wooden handle is loose, and will fall off after a few uses. Also, it looks like the surface is nonstick . . . it's not! The eggs I used stuck to this pan worse than a unseasoned cast iron skillet. I strongly advise not to purchase this product, as it is horribly put together. Even experienced tamago pan users will find difficulty with the wiggling handle and sticky cooking surface. It is everything it should not be. Don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not as nonstick as I wanted but...","review":"Well, this pan is NOT as nonstick as I desired. It's smallish, and I had eggs that stuck when I scrambled some in it - the first time. I groaned.That said, now I love it. I bought it for omelets but I'm USING it for hashbrowns and burgers and chopped sirloin steaks. It fits 2 burger patties in perfectly, which is something I need occasionally. It makes hashbrowns LIKE A DREAM - Nice little square patties that are on par with Waffle House's and cute burgers that look and are sized like Wendy's. When you cook anything with more oil, like the hashbrowns or burgers, clean up is easy.So, I'm giving it a 4, because I am so happy with it and I'm finding it quite useful, even if I still feel like I need a good Japanese omelet pan.If you've bought one and aren't happy with it, try it with hashbrowns and you might feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretful purchase.","review":"At first, I was very happy with this purchase. The pan is smallish but the perfect size for making 4-egg tamago (which is the amount I always make). As long as I oiled the pan between layers, the tamago turned out perfectly. However, after just three or four uses, I started to notice rust spots. These spots have grown over time, making the pan practically unusable. If I had known then what I know now, I definitely would not have purchased this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"works very well","review":"I haven't had a problem with the pan yet.

Why would Cathie Pelletier, as K. C. McKinnon, try to hide her real name of Pelletier in CANDLES ON BAY STREET when her previous book, the paperback for DANCING AT THE HARVEST MOON, tells us that the author is Cathie Pelletier? (Gus says he works at a bookstore. Maybe he should try auto mechanics instead.) Last month I just watched a rerun of an interview with the author of this book, on a TV show called A WORD ON WORDS, and it sure didn't sound like she was on a deadline when she wrote this! Just the opposite. It's a lovely book and my book club in Salt Lake City adored it so much we went looking for all the Pelletier books as well. A terrific writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, I gave as gifts","review":"Not many books grab me to the point of buying them as gifts for others, but CANDLES had so many poignant moments that I just had to share it with my sister and my daughter.

I think however, some of the elements of the book were just too predictable. This is kind of one of those books you either like, or you don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I thought I had purchased","review":"The description on the dust jacket made the book sound intriguing and mysterious. But once I started reading, it was your run-of-the-mill romance. The \\"mystery\\" was more depressing than shocking, and that made the last half of the book was slow and predictable. What disappoints me is that I paid for a hardcover book, and it took me only an hour to read it.The afterword in the book described the basis for all the characters. In my opinion, the book was too autobiograpical. It is a work of fiction, and the story became bogged down with the references to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book; it had me going","review":"I was thrilled to read a 'love story' about that didn't turn out to be sleazy! I'm not into explicit sex in books, and the fact that the main character didn't follow the flame of his past was a great plus for me. And considering that the book is based in northern Maine, and I have lived in Maine all my life, made it easier for me to visualize the setting (though I've not been to northern Maine before). All in alll, a refreshing book to read. Read it in one sitting while at the beach last summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"I picked it up at the store the other day because I read \\"Dancing at the Harvest Moon\\" and enjoyed it. However, there is no comparison! I can't believe all of the glowing reviews on here. Did we read the same book? I wasn't looking for a book as boring as everyday life, but I also didn't want one that seemed like a Disney movie! I have to agree with the guy from Tennessee. I found myself wanting to laugh and I don't think that was the point. I think Ms. Pelletier watches too much \\"Party of Five\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Great reference book for detoc as well as understanding basic principles of health. I would have liked more practical use information, but in all, this is a great reference book.

This is a nice summary history of a brutal dictator who had people executed. It also explains his plodding military campaign that was ultimately a success. It is clear that the author does not put Franco as a heroic dictator or right wing fanatic, but as a leader of his times who skillfully evaded the tenacles of Nazi Germany. Franco was a more skillful politician than soldier.This is a great read for those who desire to know more about Franco and Spain. It is not lengthy, so can be read in one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a strange book","review":"The Coffin Tree was very confusing to me. The author repeatedly jumps from one time period to another and does not explain exactly what is happening at a specific moment.

The band is ultra tight in their playing and Simone is dead ass spot on as usual (although a bit mechanical or unemotional while singing, she just just kind of sits there like a rock). The cover of memories from the broadway show Cats is an odd inclusion but Simone's vocals really stir my heart. The included videos are decent but the additional \\"making of\\" for them really are a waste of time, nothing happening here just move along people.

Before that one gave me problems, I bought a second one which after a couple of years would just shut down on power loss, giving no clue of why. Its the transfer circuit which no doubt is cheaply made. I've taken these units apart and they are crap.

This is quite frustrating (and frankly inexcusable), especially when I use this device with all of my high-end equipment. Another faulty characteristic of this device to note...it makes a frequent and EXTREMELY annoying high-pitched beep every time it clicks off (so unless you're deaf, I strongly urge you to take this into consideration).

In particular, it focuses on the military career of the most important German generals (i.e., Guderian, Rommel and Manstein). The book describes their involvement in the main battles of the war (with the help of a few excellent maps). The author is extremely successful at illustrating the great exploits of these brilliant men, and the tremendous difficulties in which they operated, especially as the situation degraded and Hitler interfered more and more with the conduct of the war.

I use it on my desk, plugged into an AC adaptor, so that is not usually much of an issue. What IS an issue, is that the area where the AC adaptor plugs in gets very hot after many hours of use, and the CD player malfunctions- it stops spinning fast enough and stops playing with an error code.Update: It's now died, the malfunction is permanent, not just when it is hot.

The first book was okay, but this book \\"Shadow of the Xel'Naga\\" was a waste of time. There was also NOTHING about the Xel'Naga! Want to know how stupid and comic book-like this book was?

This book isn't even worth handing over 5$ and I am sorry I wasted my time reading it and my money buying it. My advice is if Gabriel Mesta writes another book based in the starcraft universe is for him to put more into the world and less into game acuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"This book is as dumb as they come. If they're not going to write something catered to Starcraft fans, why write a Starcraft book? Especially one that has nothing to do with the game.

This book, although not as good as the other two in the series, is a fun read and a must to any Starcraft player. When ranking the book, I am naturally going to give it high ratings because of my love for the Starcraft plot. Despite that, however, I do feel this is a good book and provides readers with a great deal of excitement. The plot begins with the discovery of a Zel'naga (however it's spelled) temple. Zerg, Protoss, Dark Templar and Terrans converge on the location in an epic struggle to control the strange object. This book does not further the plot of Starcraft, but it is definitely a fun read to any Starcraft enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author doesn't know much about the StarCraft universe","review":"I've been a fan of StarCraft for about 14 years and never have I come across anything StarCraft related that was as awful as this book. The author clearly knows very little about the StarCraft universe, claiming that Protoss have 3 fingered hands (they have four fingered hands), goliaths are armored suits used by soldiers (they are assault robots), and Duke believes the Zerg and the Protoss have formed an alliance (extremely highly improbable as the ugly battle between the Zerg and the Protoss had just recently finished at that time).The only known characters mentioned in this book are Kerrigan, Edmond Duke, and Arcturus Mengsk and the author couldn't even manage to be accurate with them. Shame on Blizzard for allowing this book to be considered canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of the Starcraft series as we know it.","review":"If you're addicted to Starcraft books, reading this book will take you off the addiction. It stinks. It's juvenile and it doesn't follow any of the Starcraft rules or things established in the game.It's also as shallow as a 'straight-to-video' ka-ka-fest, with it's \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" ending. I'll never read another Starcraft book again. In fact, I'll never read a Gabriel Mesta book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job. This would make a great movie.","review":"A lot of people didn't like this book because the story has nothing to do with what happens in the game, but in my opinion that's what makes this book better than the first one. This book goes beyond the basic battles of the game and depicts the kind of life the civilians in StarCraft universe would live. The husband-wife team created new creatures and tried to explain certain things about Zerg. Some points they make are very interesting, some I wish they'd never done. They build Edmund Duke's character a lot better than Jeff Grubb did. They don't follow the combat rules of the game very strictly and that makes a more realistic and enjoyable battle scene.The book starts out very interesting and the ending is also good. However, the middle section is a little monotonous. I'd like to conclude by saying that this book would make a very nice Hollywood blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it only a half-star, I would.","review":"One word: Disappointment. Okay, maybe two words: Boring. You would think from the title that this book would delve into the Starcraft background. Xel'Naga - the creator of the Protoss and Zerg. But in fact, there's nothing here about the races. No background, no insight. It's almost as if the author didn't research the Starcraft universe and filled out a \\"Sci-Fi Mad Libs\\" where they said in this formulaic story <insert alien race name here>. Example: \\"And all of a sudden three aliens lunged at her. It wasn't long before <insert alien race here> infiltrated the old man's shack.\\"It also seems to be written by a juvenile.

Horribly disappointing. I didn't think the book could be as bad as everyone said it was, especially since the first book was good. My mistake.

Not everything needs to be described \\"..like..\\". I might have been reading a Hemingway novel, the way every sound and smell was being related to something else. Space opera really doesn't need such details, I believe.I felt no sympathy towards the community of victims, perhaps because their story was so broken up. Star Wars can get away with alternating stories between chapters because the characters are actually ones you care about, but I think it utterly failed here.In short, I was very disappointed with this book. I had expected much more from Kevin Anderson, given his ability to adapt to existing storylines. I suppose if this book was targeted towards teenagers (who form the majority of Starcraft players), it might explain a lot, but where were the characters we knew and actually cared about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the first one, but not by much.","review":"I enjoyed Shadow of the Xel'Naga more than Liberty's Crusade, but still less than I expected to. The plot was original this time, not just lifted from the in-game storyline. However, the series seems to be written for little kids instead of avid StarCraft fans. Nevertheless, the book is enjoyable and the battle imagery greatly improved from Liberty's Crusade. It was refreshing to read about SC units acting quasi-real, instead of just in the context that you see them in the game. The story line is original and the ending is neither predictable nor boring. If you didn't like the first one, I would give Shadow of the Xel'Naga a chance, you might like it better, however, speaking as a long-time SC fan, the authors take too much liberty messing around with unit traits and abilities.

It gives you what you need to know and simplifies things so that you don't have to search round and round for it in the textbook. It's unfortunate Dressler feels the need to sell his supplements and as a result has to make his textbook so crappy. And yes, it really IS that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a companion guide!","review":"The text is not a good tool for 1Ls to learn crim law by itself. Most of my classmates and I found the text to be poorly organized and written - especially for those just trying to grasp the intricacies of crim law. Probably a better book for studying statutory interpretation or philosophy of crim law. Prepare to become intimate with the MPC if you are assigned this text. I highly recomend a companion book for the text, one keyed to it such as Blackletter outline by Dressler or the Understanding Crim Law companion by Dressler. I used both and they saved me from utter confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless waste of time, money, and effort","review":"It is a shame that professors force their students to shell out big bucks to buy casebooks that don't help.Even if you scored high on your LSAT and you have great reading comprehension, you will spend hours deciphering Dressler's philisophical babble. And when you finish your reading, you will realize that you retained little or nothing.This is because Dressler does not clearly state the important concepts and conflicts of Criminal Law. He circumvents the important information that Criminal Law students need to know, and can only help to learn this information through inference. It's a glorified and expensive game of \\"hide the ball.\\"The overwhelming majority of students are confused by the book and the more successful students are those who avoid it entirely.If you are forced to buy this book, I recommend reading only what is necessary to get by in class and learn Criminal Law through a hornbook, outline, or other method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Textbook in Law School","review":"I'm a 2L now, but I wanted to stop by and give my thoughts on this horrible book. There is entirely too much philosophy, as others have said. For the reviewer below, I don't want to offend you but most of us aren't in law school to spend long hours pondering over why we punish criminals. I just want to know the black letter law so that I can take an exam, score well, and hopefully get a decent job out of law school. This book is not helpful in any of the above.I couldn't believe some of the stuff I read in this book. More often than not, I found myself asking what place any of this stuff had in a Criminal Law text. You'll see what I mean when you start reading. Much of Dressler's \\"teaching material\\" consists glorified fables and short stories which really have only a tangential relation to the subject matter.

His book is the most complete and accurate account of the Bielskis I have read. His descriptions of each of the brothers who were \\"partisans\\" during the German invasion and occupation of Belarus from 1941 through 1944 are what I have known and read in other histories of Russia and Germany during that time period. The book is most often written chronologically...and when it skips to a different time period, the reader is made aware of this. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the German occupation of Soviet territories during WWII; the carnage of Jews by the Nazi \\"Final Solution;\\" the Bielski family, in particular the 4 brothers who survived and helped countless other Jews to survive in the forests; and the Soviet/Russian partisans who played a vital role in driving the Germans out of Belarus, Lithuania and Poland."},{"rating":"1","title":"the ends don't justify the means","review":"they killed innocent jews even after they were liberated. another sad story of blind faith, absolute power corrupting absolutely and \\"spin\\".a book should be written about the family who suffered after the husband and father was shot over a pair of boots.how was it that they were allowed into america after being labeled war crimminals. did someone look under the table?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Very Little","review":"Should really be titled the true story of three men who ran away from the Nazis and hid in the woods.

So I purchased the book \\"The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 Jews\\". This filled in the blanks for me. The book becomes a little dry when it lapses into simply repeating historical records; it's better when it gets into characterizing each of the brothers and describing their different personalities. The movie and the book are good complements to each other--the book tells the facts of their story, and the movie captures the drama, passion, tragedy and horror of the Holocaust. It is difficult to watch but well worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to the Human Spirit","review":"Where was the History of these people in my books?

As a travel guide it is not inexpensive but it does not contain such basic information as lodging options near major train stations, suggestions for low cost lodging away from major tourist haunts, the quirky eating options I've always found in Fodor's other books, or the standard opening times for major sites. For example, Vatican City sites are not listed except in the most superficial way. And, how jaded a traveler must you be to consider St. Peter's a plain church with no important art, as this writer describes it? Michelangelo's Pieta is there!

Like \\"Flies of Memory\\", \\"Oracle\\" is written in a very inventive and sometimes startling style. It also rattles along at a cracking pace and is an almost perfect blend of thought-provoking time travel yarn and political thriller. Let's face it, all sci-fi devotees love the time travel theme, and this one is better than most. The attention to detail is exceptional - one of Marcus' biggest problems is coping with lower case letters and non-Roman numerals for example. I also felt an immediate empathy with our reluctant hero Tom, who drinks real ale and knows which bridges have speed cameras on the M1! My only adverse criticism would be at the occasionally heavy-handed politics, which some may find irritating. Overall though, an extremely entertaining read, which leaves the way open for a fascinating sequel (please Ian!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marineland rules!","review":"I have a 55 gallon with the 400 series filter (the one that uses 2 elements), and I like them.

Warning-this one isn't for those who want an uplifting experience. The incendiary guitar powered techno-rock of NIN succeeds as usual in evoking a powerful sense of dread and foreboding. A carefully chosen setlist and multimedia artist Bill Viola's eerie projections jerk the viewer\\\\listener back and forth between calm and unrest in a cinematic fashion almost like a concert version of Apocalypse Now.Outstanding cinematography, dazzling 5.1 sound, remarkable musicianship and the strangely compelling music and presence of Trent Reznor. It's pure genius..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another reason to continue","review":"One of the most valuable releases. Professional, different, involving. As Nine Inch Nails always was. Performing live is one of the best things Treznor can do, but recording it is his mastery as well. People have different tastes, but I think, that this DVD is well balanced for a newcomer and a devoted fan. Trent Reznor presents something that is coherent, but nihilistic at the same time. He blends chaos, madness, hatred and pain with beauty, fragileness, weakness. And it’s true. And it’s beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Briliant","review":"AATCHB is Trent, Robin and Danny doing what they do best, entertaining the masses with deeply provocative tones. This will always be my favorite mix of artists for NIN, Trent's emotion rich vocals accompanied by Danny's soul reaching Bass and Robin Finck who is incredible; his performance is enriched with so much emotion its possible to feel it just watching him alone. A definite Plus for any NIN collection, Buy IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trent's right","review":"So on the little transparent slip that comes on the inside of the DVD flip-out-box-thing Trent writes that watching this DVD is \\"almost like being there\\" or something of that sort. He is very correct. It feel likes you're at a NIN concert, I mean there are moments when you sort of snap out of it and go \\"woow okay, gotta stop singing along now...not reality\\" but you know, for the most part i'd dub it excellente.Oh and Trent clonking his head with the microphone during Piggy (not sure but i beleive that's the one?) is just classic. Does anyone know what's up with that?And another thing...definately check out the review above, the secret land of special nin things that those instructions get you too is wonderful. WONDERFUL.If you're obsessed with NIN and like looking at Trent for hours on end this is a must have. If you're just an average NIN fan, you'll most likely still find this DVD to be quite the ass kicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIN's Amazing Live Performance","review":"This performance carries much of Trent's genius and shows the true level of his worksmanship. He is very much a brilliant showman, and he literally will go down in history as one of the best rock acts ever. Nine Inch Nails work very hard to transport you into another world, rather than just some group on stage saying \\"good night los angeles!\\" This DVD covers the most of the best NIN songs, and features the art of Bill Viola, one of the world's most famous mixed media/modern electronic artists. This is most certainly something that will not disappoint any NIN fan.DM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"On Closure we got a taste of live NIN, but the quality was quite bad cheapening the effect. So naturally Trent recorded his next big tour, Fragility 2.0. This time not only is the song selection great, but the visuals and sound quality themselves are top notch too.The extra are great, most of them are hidden, they include the video for The Day The World Went Away, Marilyn Manson showing up and NIN's cover of The Beautiful People, and a live performance of Reptile.The only problem I have with the set is switching DVDs after Complication. I have to get up...and that's not a good thing. I'm just lazy I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpeice! THANKS NIN!","review":"Don't hesitate, buy it! You wont be dissapointed. They spared no expense in quality. I recomend the dts because of the better sound, but you will need the decoder. How ever in the dolby5.1 version you can use the multiple camera angle view in real-time and the dts you have to select the different angle straight from the main menu and can't switch back during playback. This is due to the lack of compromise in quality. There are about 100+ still photos on the second disk and some hidden fun as well. Even if you only kinda like NIN, buy it. It was such a great show and they captured that live energy and put it on DVD. I get riled up every time I see it.On a side note. If you were at the gorge in George WA, there is some great live footage as well as some stills. And on the dts one of the songs was shot entirly at the gorge. VERY COOL! I can see myself from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"All that could have been is lacking \\"BackStage\\"","review":"Well I have been waiting forever for this DVD. I have been a NIN fan since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" as far as the packageing is concerned it was VERY well done. The live show was EXCELLENT to say the least. I felt like I was onstage with Trent and the boys. The song selections were good, and of course like i said before the performances were EXCELLENT. This DVD is missing something though like backstage content and interview content. If your looking for a DVD performance of live NIN this is your DVD but if you want more than just live footage I would suggest \\"Closure\\" it has ALOT more content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"This concert was excellent. I usually prefer a more polished, studio quality production over rough live performances. But the raw energy and excellent production quality of this DVD overcame its small imperfections. If you want to see NIN in its natural state, check this out. And look out for the rumored upcoming Downward Spiral DVD release that was previously only available on VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This DVD is one of the best out there. Well worth the price too!It captures NIN on stage and at their best. It's complete in terms of song selections.What prevents me from giving this a 5 star rating is the way the concert is split in half by the 2 DVDs. I mean, they could've let the song ended nicely on the first DVD and then continue on to the second but NO.....they had to do it abruptly.Trent and his obsessions with double Cds and double DVDs...geez."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo-fan","review":"NIN fans be warned, this is a must-buy. The sounds and vocals on this DVD are brilliant. The only downfall I could find with adding this DVD to my NIN collection was that none of the film clips were on it.

To me that was a real dissapointment!! Another thing, and this is a major complaint -- this is a two DVD set with the cabiliblty of having 4 hours of material. Between the two dvd's there's only about 2 hours total of material including the comentary.Although the concert footage was so good that it does make it a must have for hard core fans like myself. The picture quality was near perfect and the audio was loud and clear in a 5.1 digital mix. There's also 4 songs that the camera angle can be changed for different viewing. Save some money and get 'Closure' by NIN on video.NIN lowers the bar on DVD releases, what a scam!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG NIN FAN - - - BUT THIS DVD DISAPOINTED ME","review":"I like Trent Reznor work but he let it me down with this dvd if you already have the cd don't make the same mistake i made don't buy the dvd i assure you the cd is much better than the dvd Trent Reznor doesn't offer anything new here is a waste of money the reason i bought it was because i was very impressed with marilyn manson god guns and government dvd and i was expecting same thing with and all that could have been i was so wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"And All That I Remebered....","review":"For someone that actually went to see this concert is was a great way to relive it.

It's amazing that this was shot entirely on miniDV, edited on Final Cut Pro, sound mixed with Pro Tools, and DVD created on DVD Studio Pro.

Great production, almost catchy-yet brutal songs and a sound that could alternately peel paint of the walls and satisfy even the most critical b.m. fan that requires a great sense of melodic annihilation. I won't go into specifics, but take one look at the album cover and you know that there's something special here.You may hear some familiar influences but Azaghal do their Norwegian comrades pround (with influences that range from Darkthrone to Mayhem to early Emperor as well as the defunct Finns Thy Serpent). Codex Antitheus is a formidable beast rife with plenty of auditory evil and destructive capability. All hail these Finnish demons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"If anyone is considering purchasing this book, please, save yourself the agony.

It also wallowed way too much in marriage counseling, a subject the author appears to be familiar with.Post is making money off of his name, but he sure isn't making a name for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentialy A good book, but . . .","review":"First let me say I like this book. However there are a few small items that make the book a touch annoying.First the author drops anecdotes or examples in bold print in the middle of his paragraphs. The anecdotes/examples would have been much better placed at the end of the paragraphs instead of mid thought.Second the writer comes off sounding very pretentious with references to staying at friends beach houses and going to cricket matches. Great that you have a life that affords you cricket matches and Beach Houses; but can you stay focused on helping us poor slobs who want to do the right then when we go to a kegger? I found his references to a life most of us won?t know a little distracting ? like manners are for rich people.Finally, The best thing in this entire book is the tipping section - who and how much to tip - this section alone has saved me the cost of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"I love fantasy books but this book really bored me.

The characters are addictive and the story is fast-paced and a wonderful adventure.I really enjoyed the two worlds in the story: The dark corners belonging to the theives and the majestic cities of the Magicians guild. It's a wonderful first book in the series, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy, magic and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the entire trilogy!","review":"The Dark Magician Trilogy is a wonderfully told tale of a young street urchin, Sonea, who in a pall of anger at the treatment received by the Guild's Magicians, suddenly learns that her burgeoning powers are much stronger than those of the magicians'. The Guild, rulers of the city and surrounding burroughs, are equally surprised, for never before has a slum-dweller been found to hold such power. The search begins for Sonea, through the streets and underground of the slums, for it is forbidden for anyone to have powers without the Guild's permission and training.The Dark Magician Trilogy, is a cozy, well-told story with just enough tension to keep you reading, but with none of the annoying pomp and circumstance that some series fall prey to. Highly recommended read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slower than syrup in January flowing up hill ...","review":"I'm on page 315 of 365 and have kept reading because I'm stubborn. I also kept thinking, \\"something's got to happen.\\" Unfortunately, it never did. With all the good fantasy out there, please don't make the mistake of starting this trilogy. I was constantly asking myself, \\"where is this going?\\" Maybe that will be answered in the last 50 pages, but come on, what's up with making me wade through 315 pages with no real goal or direction? Sad, sad, sad. Very mundane, vanilla fantasy. This book adds nothing new, unique or exciting to the genre. If you're looking for good fantasy, read the Fionavor Tapestry trilogy by Guy Gavriel Kay, anything by Salvatore, Illium by Dan Simmons was wonderful and unique (Sci-Fi that reads like fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing on all levels","review":"I stayed very optimistic while reading this book, but after a while of forcing myself to turn page after page, i realized there was no reward for my patience...and the reasons for my disappointment arrive on all levels; unlikeable characters, very slow pace and worst of all, the author paints absolutely no visual picture of the setting, along with a bland style of writing. Adjectives are too often repeated and the vocabulary of this novel feels severely limited. This may have been done to make this book a quick, easy read but the level of simplicity is astonishingly severe.This book lacks everything required to make a good fantasy novel; imagination, engaging prose, exciting adventure and richly painted characters and setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"Well, this is one of those books where the title hooked me. I enjoyed the read, though I have to admit that the premise is nothing original: A slum girl discovers she has magic when a rock she throws at some magicians actually gets through the barrier they held and hits one of them. She then tries to hide from them as they search for her.Still, even though the plot isn't very original, I could not help but enjoy the read. The characters feel real and the book doesn't seem long and dragged out. I give it a 4 out of 5, simply for the lack of originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much lip pursing!!","review":"I liked the books, but I agree about the cat and mouse pursuit being too long and drawn out. The crap with Regin in the second book was also drawn out too long also.But what's up with the pursed lips? Do all these medieval authors throw in the phrase \\"___ pursed his/her lips\\" when they can't think of anything else to say? Lips were \\"pursed\\" at least 23 times in this book! Maybe she learned how to use a different phrase by the time she wrote the other two books of the trilogy, because lips are only \\"pursed\\" 13 times in the second book and only 6 times in the third!There is a lot of grimacing and dread too!!I like books based on medieval times (I know these are fantasy on another world, but it is still medieval like times), but the overused phrases really grate on my nerves after a while! Looks like she got her style of writing from Michael Jecks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a teen-age girl....unless she has taste.","review":"This book was just so sappy and slow that I could hardly finish it. I have read A LOT of fantasy and this is just weak stuff. I suppose that it's great for someone who doesn't enjoy serious content, but this read more like a teen-age girls diary and the heroine was so ridiculous that I won't be reading the rest...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"By the other reviews I was expecting something fabulous. Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be quite as good as everyone else thought. This book was quite a bit longer than it should have been, as were the rest. I found myself skimming over parts because I would get bored. The characters were predictable. There was nothing that made me truly care about the characters and what happened. The last book in this trilogy was by far the worst. The ending was abrupt and ended in a way that it would make it impossible for me to want to read about the characters in this book again. If you prefer depth and strength in characters I would recommend Elizabeth Haydon, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, Anne Bishop, and Robin Hobb. If you like easy predictable reads than this is your type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is a well written beginning to a new world for Canavan. It's definately not high fantasy, but it's a good read for someone looking for an escape, or for younger fantasy readers. The plot and characters are strong, if somewhat predictable.This is a nice read from a new series. It gets a bit dark at times, and the later books get darker, but it's an overall easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"The world setting is fairly common, the language decent but alas, the story was broken. The chase scene occupied the bulk of the book but was barely interesting. The characters are dead and do not evolve. Even David Eddings whose works I grew past liking them, is much better than this. If you are interested in a similar storyline, try Harry Potter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big miss","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love fantasy trilogies.

I have been trying out new Sci-fi/Fantasy authors for awhile and i am usually dissapointed so it was a very nice suprise to find myself really enjoying the TBM trilogy. I even found myself staying up till 4:30 in the moning to finish the last book.My only complaint is that the third book could have had a better ending, which is the reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5. It was rushed and left me with unansered questions plus i would have liked a better outcome for Akkarin.I'm really looking forward to more books from Trudi Canavan. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Terrific book series by Trudi Canavan with great characters and a fun plot. While shallow at times in the treatment of some characters, you will find yourself attached to a few of the characters quickly. As a bonus the story, while built on the common 'simple person becomes something great' framework, is done in a way that seems original and doesn't leave you feeling as though you've read this before with different names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why focus on the city?","review":"I am always on the lookout for good fantasy and my oldest daughter had bought this book and she liked it, so I started reading it. The first few chapters got me interested, but the plot became quite obvious. I agree with other negative reviews that the main characters are unrealistic and... dull.The fantasy part is too limited, in my opinion. Much effort is spent on describing the city, its classes, economy and geography. But magic hardly seems to help or influence the city or its rules. The same story could have been written in a world without magic, where Sonia had some other special talent.I give it 2 stars, since I was curious enough to finish reading the first part. But even though my daughter has bought the following books, I will not spend time on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly amazing","review":"When I first read this book I fell in love immediately. As soon as I finished it I ran to my local bookstore to get the next one in the series. I have since read the trilogy numerous times.The story is set in a city called Imardin, the capital of Kyralia. During the purge (The annual purging of the city streets of the poor into the slums)the protaganist, Sonea, throws rocks at the local magicians. When one of them passes through the magical barrier, panic abbounds. Sonea goes into hiding believing that if the magicians catch her they will kill her because they do not want the poor to ba magicians in their guild. Meanwhile the magicians begin a search, intending to offer her a place among them. And so begins the story.The story just keeps getting better as you read it, which is saying something as the start is so captivating.I would most definitely recommend this book, indeed the series, to anyone looking for a truly mesmirising read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and uninvolving","review":"I picked this book up while on vacation on a recommendation from a bookstore employee. That was a mistake. The pacing is awful. The author takes the entire first half of the book to set up the plot (which is fairly thin anyway, and shouldn't take one quarter of that amount to set into motion). If the characters had been explored and expanded, that time would have been well spent. Unfortunately, the characters seem flat and unengaging throughout the book.This novel feels like a short story that has been padded unmercifully into a much longer work. I certainly will not pick up the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and derivative","review":"This novel is not particularly well written, and unfortunately, the plot flows along rather obvious paths. The characters are not developed in a meaningful way, and even the protaganist comes off as one dimensional. All in all, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Magicians Trilogy: dull and without humour!","review":"Although it starts off nice enough, I found the book boring. It isn't bad that when you read enough fantasy of SF, this one doesn't stand out, and after 50 pages one can already outline what is going to happen before the end, page 462. I must admit, the author has good writing skills, but that is it. After 170 pages, nothing changed, the characters are dull and don't develop, the scenery doesn't alter and there is an awful lot of repetition of the storyline, while by now you know how it all is going to end, namely good. Otherwise there wouldn't be a part 2, let alone 3, which I am NOT going to read. I'd say that this story could have been written in one book, so the trilogy is just a moneyspinner. My advice is; there are some great fantasy books out there, so do not waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinishable","review":"I have to admit at the outset that I haven't finished the book. I read the first 70 pages or so, hoping that it would get interesting, but it hasn't. The characters are bland and nearly identical; I had an extremely hard time telling them apart. The dialogue tends to do the bare minimum job of conveying plot information without having much wit or spark. Plot, magic system, and setting alike seemed disappointingly generic. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning to all Adult Readers!","review":"I got this trilogy this year on the strength of reviews I read here. I guess I am a little dense, and have to have things spelled out to me, so I will say flat-out that this book to geared towards young teenagers. Not adults. I say this as a person who adores Harry Potter and likes the Unfortunate Events series; I am actually a fan of juvenile fiction, but this is not a cross-over series. Just a warning, I'm sure that when I was thirteen, I would have loved these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good children's book","review":"This is not a book for adult readers. The characters all seemed flat. They all used the same simple vocabularies and simple sentence structures. Their motivations in life were simple and predictable. There are good guys and bad guys. Many real people are more complex than that. The book is 465 pages but probably should have been edited down to 50 to 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak vanilla story","review":"I kept waiting for the story to get interesting but nothing happened. Basically keeps the same tempo through out the novel.The storyline is very basic. It is told in a total linear fashion following just one story thread. Trudi poses no serious dilemmas to her characters. Everything is soft balled. For instance, Cerny is faced with having to kill a target for the thieves. At first it seems like a real moral choice. Trudi then immediately paints the target as such a villainous scoundrel that the choice becomes a vanilla trivial one.I felt robbed on so many levels after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I really liked this book. While I agree with some of what other reviewers noted about the predictability of the plot and the \\"fantasy staples\\" included in this book, I loved the characters and wanted to see what happened to them next. I don't have time to read as much as I would like (although I have an audio book going in the car at all times), but I read this book in one weekend. I had picked The Magician's Guild up at the bookstore on a whim, but have ordered the next two in the trilogy and can't wait for them to arrive.Perhaps the storyline is a little juvenile as one reviewer noted, but I must be a child at heart, as I can't wait to read the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Fantasy","review":"A friend lent this book to me.

The grinder has a nice weight to it, the switches and speed setting have a sturdy feel to it, and the tool has plenty of power.

But that's OK because the price is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The discussion of mourning","review":"I think I expected this book to discuss the concept of mourning and memory more but it also discussed friendship with the inclusion of letters and poems. I cannot say that I disliked this book but its cover lead me to believe it was going to be a different focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"the geology nerd's first choice","review":"If you're looking to find a specific small town in Europe or Africa, the Times Atlas is better because more of its pages are devoted to road maps and the maps are more cluttered. This DK atlas devotes many of its pages to physical geography, inset explanations of interesting phenomena (e.g., Niagara Falls), and satellite photos. The night-time satellite photos are very useful because they show population density. The Great World Atlas is nice for planning trips, figuring out whether a potential vacation spot is near interesting geographical features such as a group of hills, and thinking about regions of the world.This book would make a fabulous gift because of its lavish printing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A doctors opinion","review":"Quickly and succinctly, unless you are deficient in zinc (which this product provides), it will not help you overcome or prevent an infection.

If I use it aggressively when I've either been around sick people or feel something coming on, I've stayed well. I also find one tablet is a good energy lift for afternoon slumps.The only complaint I have is the packaging. I wish the creator of this product would be more mindful of the environment -- especially since she's a school teacher and garbage pollutes the earth for children. The tubes are not recyclable in many areas of the country and the lids aren't recyclable anywhere.And, each tube contain only 10 tablets. I'd like the company to make larger tubes AND offer refills.

A suporting cast of gays and straights who chide said protagonist for being such a child.Drugs, drugs, and more drugs.Oh and lots and lots of sex, and a growing desire to be a father amidst all this?!So much of the book is told in a near stream of consciousness that at times is, well grating.

Maybe that was the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"witless wit","review":"Most fiction is a form of self-indulgence these days but nothing is more self-indulgent than this absolutely goofy book. Cummings' hasn't yet mastered trivial literary niceties like plot, character, narrative drive, and any actual facility for writing.

But the book is...not so good. It's not entirely terrible, but it is very disappointing. I'm very glad that I picked it up at a thrift store for a couple of bucks, rather than buying it new.I just don't really care about what happens to the characters - not even our main character/narrator feels even remotely sympathetic, and I just can't bring myself to feel invested in his life. The writing itself isn't too bad - but I also wouldn't call it good. Descriptions and dialogue are often trite or forced, and beyond that the writing is simply unspectacular.But worst of all, despite all the sex and drugs, it's just plain boring. You'd think with all this drama and depravity going on, it would at least be titillating or exciting, but it's just not.

I watch this movie whenever I need a pick-me-up and it reminds me that we all struggle at times in teaching, but that what we truly want (better lives for our students) we can still achieve through hard work and dedication. It reminds me why I entered the teaching career and encourages me to keep going and to never give up. I have readThe Essential 55: An Award-winning Educator's Rules for Discoveri the Successful Student in Every Childafter seeing this movie for the first time, and it gave me so many ideas for my own classroom.

Ron Clark is in the inner city, where kids act tough and stubborn, and often get into trouble. Ron was told not to expect much. But his determination to hang on and somehow inspire these kids won out in the end...to the surprise of the other teachers and the principal.Rather predictable storyline, but it's inspiring.If you enjoyed \\"Mr Holland's Opus\\", chances are that you would also enjoy the \\"Ron Clark Story\\".

The characters have hackneyed thoughts and feelings and little dialogue. It is billed as 'another Alex Jensen mystery' but the secondary character, Jesse, is predominant. This is my first Henry mystery. Maybe I am missing something that happened in the previous books. I was bored. And felt irritated and patronized."},{"rating":"2","title":"True-to-Life Intrigue","review":"Sue Henry knows how to keep a good mystery going without losing her audience. At the same time, she is able to weave true Alaskan scenery and high adventure into the tale while painting a true-to-life canvas of the Northern lifestyle. \\"Sleeping Lady\\" keeps the reader guessing up to the very end -- not a boring page from cover to cover.

When I checked the control unit, the dust collector started working as I inspected. The plug wasn't tight at all and smelled like burning plastic.The store again replaced this unit and the last one seems to be working properly.

The unit was not dropped or mistreated in anyway. Well, I decided it was just a fluke so I orded a second unit. It can and again seemed to be fine. About the second or third time I used it somehow I shorted it out and it also died. I remember I was adjusting the antenna on the receiver unit and touched it to something metal and WHAM!

The traps do *not* stay together. Every single day I'm having to put them back into boxes, which is irritating. I could even forgive this if they'd actually *caught* anything - but considering I'm still having spiders crawling across my room when I have two traps set up within five feet of them (that are supposed to \\"attract\\" them with some really bizarre-smelling glue), they're not getting the message. They haven't caught a thing, except my fingers when I'm trying to put them back together. Unfortunately, I bought 2 boxes and the second box will have to go in the trash without being opened.

The setting is a camp for children of war criminals, dignitaries, and political figures, and serves as a brainwashing facility for the Communists. Beautiful imagery, great acting, and a wonderful soundtrack, tangled together with the now-standard Balkan war film provide a great viewing experience. The only complaint is that it is slow in a few spots, and the English narrative is somewhat forced. Overall this movie is highly recommended, and a worthy addition to any film buff's collection. If you managed to see \\"Before the Rain\\" or \\"No Man's land\\", then you will love this film the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"dismal and oppressive","review":"A most troubling film. It graphically depicts the inhuman sadism and brutality of a Stalinist-era holding center for war orphans, which is really a horrifying prison camp. It has some stylish photography, with artistic shots of clouds and sky, but generally it is shot in subdued earth tones which are as barren and bleak as the childrens' lives.Into the midst of this distressing and frightening environment comes a beautiful young boy named Isaak. He is strangely serence, and provides the few moments of peace in this grim film, but even his presence cannot dissipate its stark inhumanity.If you like unrelenting futility and hopelessness, then this is the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had been looking for this forever!!","review":"My cousin had one at his house and we were visiting in the summer, and I couldn't believe how well it worked.

If you have smaller hands, you might want to check for hand fit before purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Smooth","review":"At first I wondered how a tool could be so expensive compared to others but then after reading some reviews I decided to purchase it. This tool is incredibly smooth and powerful for an angle grinder.

Heinlein","review":"The award-winning novel which inspired this film has long been misunderstood by the people who usually characterized Robert Heinlein as a \\"right-wing Commie-hater\\" and nothing more. Unlike the STARSHIP TROOPERS movie, which totally missed the point, the focus here is squarely on the lead characters who are classic archetypes of science fiction, well played by a talented cast in the true Heinlein mold. I was wonderfully amazed to see, 5 years after the Berlin Wall came down, how timeless this story really is. It's not about Cold War politics, folks; it's about love, loyalty, and persevering in the face of impossible odds. Buy it, enjoy it, study it; then read the book.

With the Dremel Advantage, I can just stick it in where I need cut, and follow the contour of the doorway/box and cut out a nice smooth opening every time.The adjustable depth lets you not cut too deep, and the variable speed keeps it from getting out of hand.I love this tool, and very much worth the price to save a lot of labor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dremel Rotary Saw","review":"The Dremel Rotary Saw is a great tool.

I liked the Mozart, loved the Mendelssohn -- they were sheer delight. As with my other LPs I eventually sought to find a CD replace and bought this. It is a mild delight for the Mendelssohn and a time-killer (or worse) for the rest. I guess this isn't my kind of music (I always run the other way when Beethoven goes into variations) but the performances are also lackadaisical. Witness the basset-horn pieces, which should fill you with happiness but only make you smile a little. I've played it a number of times but, seriously, I doubt I'll ever play it again. Sad. The competition for the Mendelssohn pieces is not fierce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Much like her last album 'Beautiful Collision' in sound, but the songwriting is a little more adventurous.

It covers the key controversies of Presidential power, state vs. federal and legislative battles between parties. It does an excellent job of looking at how the role of the Speaker has changed and focusing on the two most powerful speakers Henry Clay and Sam Rayburn. It is very easy to read and quick for those with a good background in US history who can focus on the complexities of the house. I agree with many of the other reviewers that for those who have a major interest in US history will find this lacking in substance as the author could have gone into much greater detail. Overall though it provides a decent summary and can be used as a jumping point for finding what other areas in US political history one wishes to read further into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch!

I own multiple volumes of his on Jackson, Clay and Webster. He is the man when it comes to Andrew Jackson biography and his place in the history of the United States. That being said, only his clear narrative writing style saved this book from a lower rating. This was not the study that I expected it to be. The lack of reference material and just not putting the House of Reps in its place in our government has this way below expectation. There are so many forceful personalities and history to work with I was just flabbergasted by the lack of real punch I get from his other work.

It is a dry, factual account of House history that leaves you feeling like you didn't learn much about the real history of the institution. In my opinion, it paints an excessively flattering and superficial portrait - probably because it was sponsored by the House's 1999 History of the House Awareness and Preservation Act.

It is an impressive work, but a person who wants to learn Amharic today would choose a newer book.

I love her humor, and I love the fact that she gives substance to chick lit. I gave up on this book after 130 pages though. I tried, I really tried, but nothing grabbed me. I found 'Behaving LiIke Adults' too slow paced, too rambling, too long. Nothing clicked for me from the first page. There were a few golden moments; I loved the image of Holly farting all the way to her date with Stuart! I just didn't want to see her as a victim, even though she was. When she deliberately mis-matched her clients for date night I just thought \\"no\\" I can't take 350 more pages of this! I'm sorry Anna. I remain a fan. Honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing rambling","review":"This is the first book of Anna Maxted's that I have read and I was unimpressed with it. The book tended to ramble on with the main character never being able to make solid decisions, even before the \\"incident.\\" The supporting characters I found to be obnoxious and detracted from the plight of the main character. Her relationship with her boyfriend was a warped, dysfunctional, much of the bantering in the book could have been shortened. I ended up skipping to the end just to find out what happened. Please save yourself the grief of plodding through this book and pick up one of her other books if you are so keen on starting on her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Anna's best work","review":"I read Running in Heels and Getting Over It and was looking forward to reading Behaving Like Adults. The first few chapters or so were pretty good, then it all went downhill. I found myself skimming through at least the last 100 pgs, I just wanted to find out what happened at the end. I agree with other reviewers that there was no warning that the book is almost entirely about Holly's rape and how it messes up her life -- even looking at the cover and the description on the back it seems like a breezy chick lit book. It's def not! The book isn't horrible, but I am glad it was a gift and I didn't pay the 15 bucks for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Even though I loved both of Anna Maxted's first two novels I was extremely disappointed in her third, Behaving Like Adults. For lack of better words, this novel was annoying. I forced myself through because I kept thinking I would eventually enjoy it and I was stuck on a plane. The main character, Holly, is frustrating and there were no truly likable characters in this novel. Even though Maxted continues to deal with tough issues, her heroine acts pathetic and doppy most of the time. In her first two novels, I was able to relate and understand the characters and their motives, but in this book the characters are just caricatures and they seem silly. Save your money and wait for the paperback...I wish I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This was the first book I read by Anna maxted, and it's not going to be the last.

This time the book is a bit grittier and a little more daring for the romantic comedy genre, but she pulls it off.Aside from being a little predictable, the book handles tougher issues that this genre seems to overlook. And she doesn't handle it with a tooty-fruity, happy ending frame of thought, but with real feelings that her readers will definitely be able to relate to.This book made me even cry a lttle and I thought this was the best of the three that I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time Anna!!!","review":"I really enjoyed to first two books. I thought they were great stories that I could relate too. Plus I've been on an English Lit kick lately so I figured why not get the third book too? Well I gave it my best shot and it just didn't come off good at all. I tried to get into the story I really did, but no matter how much I tried it just wasn't going to happen. I gave up about a quarter into the book and started a different one. Oh well. Better luck next time Anna...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Wow, I really hated this book. None of the characters were well-drawn or relatable. Some authors have the gift of writing so that you can really see what is happening. Maxted isn't one of them. I never got a sense that Holly or any of her friends were real people, so I never cared about what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"I agree with a lot of reviews on this book, it tends to ramble on and on and on. When I first started the book, I wasn't automatically brought into the book, but I thought I would read some more and maybe something would catch my attention. I only got to page 58 before I just gave up! Holly makes very light of what happen to her in the beginning and then talks about it to her friend like she allowed Stuart to have sex with her. It made me very angry with Holly that she could do this to herself. I had invisioned Holly as a strong woman, but after that her imagine to me was just a girl who isn't true to herself. This is my first book by this author and I do hope her other book I got is not like this or else I have wasted $12 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you Boring too?","review":"Ok, so this book is boring because it is very slow, I have been reading this book for awhile now, yes not interesting either, and nothing new has happend.

The cover blurb says something about a guy being a bit of a 'cad'. Then I read it and discovered it was about rape. I really have issues with a rapist being called merely a cad and the blurb telling the reader nothing about the main topic of the book. It's very deceiving and I can see by the other reviews that I'm not the only person affected in this way.Really bad job by Anna Maxted and I tossed this one in the trash and promptly gave away the other books of hers that I owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such high hopes...and such lows","review":"I was excited to see that Anna Maxted had written a new book.

I could barely finish it and found myself just skimming through to the ridiculously stupid ending. I felt no empathy for the characters. It was contrived and at times, seemed like storylines taken out of \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\". I wish I could say more but I don't want to ruin it for those who may have the courage to want to read it. All I can say is, that while I was reading it, I kept thinking of what the publishers thought when they read the book.

During a recent trip to Thiruvanamalai, my uncle told me how the yogi would call out to people at the temple with a stern \\"come here\\", bless them and send them back on their way.This book is not about \\"miracles\\" in the traditional sense. Instead it celebrates the life of the hidden yogi and reveals intimate details of the interactions that he had with different devotees.

Every time I would open the door, there would be moths visible on the bottom of the shelves, or flying around. I would squash them, but there were always more to take their place. MY husband got tired of my complaints and brought home a box of these moth traps. Safe? Effective? Non-toxic? I doubted its ability to work...but I was so wrong. I put one in the closet several months ago and to date, I have about 135 dead moths clinging to the inside of the trap! That's an enormous amount of moths from one little closet. I haven't even used the second trap yet because the first one seems to still be working! I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's somewhat effective, but there are better options...","review":"I found these traps to work fine for the first 2-3 weeks, but then they stopped catching moths. I don't know if it's because the glue got less sticky as a result of dust, or if the pheromone strength wore off. Another problem with this trap is that because of its shape, the moths will fly into the corners and explore the trap, but they might not necessarily go inside and get stuck on the gluey surface.I also tried the Cupboard Moth Traps and I think the Cupboard traps work better than the Springstar traps. The traps are flat, so the moths get stuck almost immediately. Another advantage is that if you notice a moth flying around, you can grab a trap and try to swat at the moth and get it stuck on the surface--you can't do that with the Springstar trap. The trap still has the problem where it seems to lose its effectiveness after 3-4 weeks, but overall I'm quite happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far...not a single moth...","review":"I get pantry moths from bird seed and have used many brands of pantry moth traps in the past.

I also enjoyed the fact that no one is safe, regardless of how big an actor or important a role.... the ending left me a bit cold, as I seem to remember the ending in the original being far more climactic, but, I was thankful that they left out the requisite \\"5 Years Later...\\" ending that you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"where's the fullscreen version","review":"I can't find Assault on Precinct 13 on fullscreen that suck.

At times, you can literally feel the tension oozing out of the screen. The movie remains dark and overcast, with all of the action taking place at night, but never becomes depressing. The chemistry between Fishburne and Hawke is particularly strong, and provides the basic foundation for the entire script.It gets four stars because of the many loose threads left hanging at the end of the movie. A few such loose ends I could deal with, but there were just too many questions swirling around me head as the credits rolled. However, perhaps that was the intention of the director.In any case, this is a very enjoyable movie that I recommend highly. Fishburne himself is worth the price of admission.

No cell phones, no communication ability of any kind in the 21st century? The woods and CGI snow, etc. While it is true that Carpenter's original was a take on the John Wayne western, Rio Bravo, it should also be noted that Carpenter was trying to say something about urban fear and paranoia (sp?) at the time. You didn't have to be a cultural anthropologist to see that the faceless gang symbolized the rampant fear of street crime at the time. Remember old Charles Bronson in the original Death Wish anyone? Instead here we have a cast with recognizable stars and a script that gives a few of them a chance to say a few interesting \\"cool\\" things and yeah, there is high tech gunfire galore.

The only good thing I can really say about this movie was, that the sound quality was very good. If you have a good home theater system, you'll be impressed with the sound. Worth a rent I guess, definitely not worth buying.

And, frankly, I liked it a lot. It wasn't the most intelligent film out there, nor even the most intelligent action film out there, but it was smart and creative enough so that the audience is still close to the edge of their seat throughout the entire movie.If you're looking for a movie that you can just relax and have fun watching, this is a good one. But it's probably better rented than bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Assault On Your Brain!\\"","review":"This is another attempt to \\"remake\\" a minor classic film. The original kept you on the edge of your chair, this film makes you want to fall out of it!

It may be dated, but at least it is more enjoyable than this piece of muck."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This is a pretty entertaining movie that has its moments. Haven't seen John Carpenter's original, which I'm sure is thoroughly enjoyable like his other movies, such as Escape From New York. There's no element of campiness in this remake, but it may be lacking that extra element of catchiness that would warrant a wholehearted endorsement. Good performances from Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, Gabriel Byrne, and John Leguizamo, especially the latter, who stands out in a positive way. The seige mentality element of the story adds to the appeal. Definitely worth a look.

It is disappointing to note, however, that these new items were not incorporated into the main work.Arranged alphabetically, the Encyclopedia remains the most invaluable reference resource for the Arthurian Legend.

The potential darkness of mother love is brought to a whole new level by Marie's mother--we fear her, we despise her and yet we yearn for her and love her in the same way Marie does. The book delivers a hopefulness one can only feel when a young girl learns that her survival is not only inevitable but necessary.I believe a story as dark and challenging as \\"Marie, Marie, Hold On Tight\\" is one we don't often get to see in today's marketplace.

Like the best of Stephan King, Brown Davidson forces us to experience the unspeakable.And it makes for an unforgettable read.

The pull-the-tabs feature definitely adds to the story, especially when Patch finds an unexpected surprise in the rabbit hole & when he dreams of chasing rabbits. The illustrations are bright without being gaudy & appeal to both my daughter & me. I did think that a page of the story seemed to be out of order, but figured it was due to the desire to keep all the pull-tabs on the right-hand pages.

If you want to know about the trails look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference that can answer all of your questions.","review":"A good reference that can answer all of your questions is HIKING THE GRAND CANYON by John Annerino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Infomative","review":"John Annerino gives his readers an abundance of information about the trails and geology of the Grand Canyon. My husband and I especially like the compact size of the book - great for tossing in a daypack while hiking the canyon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly enough detail on basic information","review":"This book is full of intersting tidbits on the history of the canyon (who was the first person to run the canyon rim-rim, geology, ecology, people history and so forth) - this makes up well over half of the book. The rest of the book skims the trails offering less information than can easily be found on the net. I am planning a trip to GC and am dissapointed that I will clearly be buying another book to give basics like for starters - a diagram of the trails."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Acid Jams,Vol.2' (Rubric Records)","review":"2-CD's worth of otherwise (I assume)unreleased tracks by artists Lucky Bishops, Bevis Frond, Adrian Shaw and a few others. Cuts I liked best here are Tony Hill's (of High Tide)\\"Tide\\", the lengthy,thirty-minute \\"Desert Sands\\" by Adrian Shaw and Rod Goodway as well as Bevis Frond's tripping \\"Deep Space Divers\\". 'Acid Jams,Volume 2' is a decent collection of some very decent psychedelic / jam pieces by the previously mentioned artists, but it's certainly not something to flip over. It's okay to pull off the shelf every now and again for a spin. Do check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable; bearings going after just one year","review":"Not durable; bearings going after just one year. Did work pretty well making smoothies though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No honor to Lightfoot","review":"If you like Gordon Lightfoot then you won't like this. Listen to music samples before you buy. The tribute by the Cowboy Junkies (The Way I Feel), is superb and complements the original and would be the only reason to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Tribute","review":"A Real Tribute; I put this disc on again recently after Gorden came up in conversation. I really like the CD, and although I would pay the price just for the Cowboy Junkies number, I happen to think the Blue Rodeo number is fantastic. I have to give a Big Kudos to the Hip as well, fantastic. Really I enjoy all the tracks on this CD.I would have liked David Francey to make an appearance on the disc. I'm not quite old enough to have the originals engrained in my brain, but I have them and I have no problem listening to these versions, even if they don't become my favorite. I thank all the musicians for participating in this great project. Maybe I should have given it 5 stars. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot is WEAK","review":"I did not like this album at all. Most of the songs seemed thrown together, where the artists had a couple days to make sure they knew the lyrics and could change the song around to their own style.Overall, each song just made me say, \\"Lightfoot did it better.\\"In hindsight, I wish I hadn't spent the money on this particular album. Better to buy more acoustically pleasing and original material."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reviewer from miami doesn't know what he's talking about","review":"solid CD--varying quality, as most tribute CDs are. I'm not sure why the Miami reviewer feels his/her OPINION of particular songs is more valid than the previous reviewer's. These are individual opinions; there is no \\"correct\\" view of a song. Get over yourself and enjoy the music--or not--without pronouncing that someone with a different opinion from you is \\"not a real fan.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a pointless book","review":"This would have to be the most useless book yet on the subject of British Railway History and the use of the word 'atlas' in the title is grossly misleading. The maps tell the reader nothing. It would seem that the author has filled the book up with mostly irrelevant photos to bulk the book up a bit. Fortunately I didn't pay a lot for the book. I would guess that the title would be suspect today under the trade descriptions Act. If the reader is looking for a seriously good historical railway atlas hunt down a copy of Jowett's Railway Atlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I bought this for my mom because her library didn't carry it. I had gotten it from my library and thought it was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money","review":"I have to say that this is not a very user friendly product at all. I took a chance buying it because I didn't see any reviews posted. Initially I had trouble loading the software because of the quicktime verison that I already had on the computer. Then I had troubles seeing the entire product because you have to set your computer screen at a higher resolution than we have. There are also mulitple windows that open when you open the program... one window doesn't even have anything in it! It doesn't come with a users manual and it's difficult to add pictures or navigate through the software. I don't recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"After reading the other review, I went against my better judgment and I took a chance on this software because I imagined the potential coolness of it. It was a [$30] lesson. As someone who is fairly computer-savvy, I figured I would be able to figure this out pretty easily. I didn't have any trouble loading it onto my computer but was very disappointed with the product. You can't change the font size or type, you are limited to only a certain amount of space per line and it isn't easy to navigate from one page to another. What a rip-off. Run from this product. Get a traditional baby book until someone writes a decent electronic baby book (potential business idea?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Off with regular baby book","review":"Sounds better than it is. I was excited about my first child and went on a buying spree. This one is kinda a dud. Sounds nice, great ideas, but poorly designed. I could do better with a word processing program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baby Gift!","review":"I LOVE this product! It's easy to use, I can save pictures of my baby and catalog them, I keep track of her accomplishments and growth,and it's so much fun!
