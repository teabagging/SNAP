This is not true for me. I bought the bag for my D300 which is fitted with a Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G lens. In my case, I have wasted my money and will be forced to purchase another bag since this one is too small for that combination. Buyers should be advised that there are restrictions applying to the bag when the buyer is purchasing it for either the Nikon D300 or the Nikon D200 camera should those cameras be fitted with any lens greater than 3 1/2 inches in depth. Quality and design are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon camera bag","review":"The item came across country (to WA) in a week of ordering it, as described. It is a decent bag for the money, just don't plan on carrying much in it. I can easily put a D-80 w/ 18-135 mounted, a 70-300vr, and a 105 micro AIS in it. It can use a shoulder strap pad.

Plus there is still room in the side, front and top pockets.The bag I recieved looks alot like the one pictures (Nikon lining). However, the sides and bottom are hard case (nice!)with rubber feet on bottom. Someone else also posted about the Nikon logo on the front... mine was a full metal badge that looks a lot better.Either I was sent the newer model of this bag, or Cameta Camera sent me a better one because the one I ordered was not in stock.

In the pictures, the colors were perfect, the water bubbles were frozen in time...not a blur in the shots. This is an amateur photographer getting professional looking pictures.Lastly, my father-in-law spent $800+ on a digital Cannon blah blah blah with a \\"super whammy\\" lens.

This book is a sad example of this growing nonsense. Any man who claims that a foreskin saved his marriage is eithier in denial about that marriage or overestimated the trouble the couple was suffering in the first place. The inactivist movement will stop at nothing in making circumcised men feel like victims. This book is a shameful example of this. She interviews a handful of women and concludes that uncircumcised sex is bettter based on that tiny sample. This is a pathetic attempt to make the world fall into the inactivist camp. I find it hard to believe that she did not go into the psychological and physical pain that many intact boys feel due to mis functioning foreskins. I know several young men that have been cut in thier early 20's and they have no regrets. This book should be taken with a big grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this originally a Master's Thesis?","review":"Being a great fan of Lindsey Davis's \\"Marcus Didius Falco\\" historical mysteries, in which we get to meet the heroine of this book, I had expected great writing, a fast moving tale, and -- very likely -- first person, either told by Vespasian or Caenis, or perhaps a mutual acquaintance. I'd expected fictional devices like flashbacks and witty conversation on every page.Instead I got rather worshipful, not too well-characterized third-person chronological narrative of a former slave who became an emperor's mistress. Long passages were without conversation (or very much human interest). My conclusion was that this book was derived from the author's Ancient History MA thesis or PhD dissertation, not the best source for exciting fiction.The Falco novels are a thousand times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Around the course","review":"Another L.

George has the ballad feature on Nancy and Never Let Me Go (the Livingston-Evans tune)and the tempo soon goes up a bit. The local rhythm section is led by pianist Julian Joseph. I must report that the 2'nd track is one of those piano in the middle numbers.

So Hercules must rescue his beloved princess Deianira (Leonora Rufo) from the curse that Lyco has put on her, and according to the oracle, must go down to Hades. Two friends accompany Hercules, one them is very funny. After many adventures, the hero fights a stone monster, gets a golden apple and a concoction from a flower, they return from Hell. Before the end there are some incredible, delirous and chaotic scenes in a graveyard with some creatures getting out of the tombs that become living deads and zombies and others like flying vampires all attack Hercules.

From 6.-8 times to 1 night waking and naps were longer and more quality once he has learn how to fall asleep on his own.

Well, that might be true. The author has 4 children, but the problems she seemed to have with No. 4 are hard to believe.

Well if you take your baby to bed far too late, if you have no routine and if you think feeding is the only way to make your baby quiet, maybe this is your book.I am more flexible than that and think most of the ideas in that book would fit on about 3 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"Unfortunately, Elizabeth failed to enlighten me with any profound secrets \\"guaranteed\\" to get my child to sleep.All the options she offered, while gentle, have all been previously mentioned in other books/literature I've read.I had already been using/trying the methods she's described for my situation.Sadly, I'm still right where I started - sporadic sleep, and now $...poorer for having bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I started reading this book because a friend recommended it but the start just talks about how horrible the progressive waiting method is and how traumatic it is for children (untrue btw).

I started reading the NO-cry sleep solution yesterday and applied what I learned and last night she slept for 3 hours the longest the shortest was 2 1/2 hours and today took a 30 minute nap! I am so pleased with the results from this book, I cannot wait to finish it and apply it to our daily lives so that WE can all sleep through the night.

Although I did NOT take the time to log everything the author suggests, I did make mental notes to myself and kept track of our progress. After only a few days, our son started sleeping from 8pm-5am with two 15 min awake period for feeding. Now, after only 3.5 weeks of putting to use the suggestions in this book, he sleeps from 6:30pm to 6:30am with only ONE awakening for food....that's 12 hours with only ONE time up in the night!

I am strongly opposed to cry-it-out methods but was going crazy with a baby that would not nap during the day. At all. Reading this book not only taught me that I was letting my baby get overtired (and therefore too wired to sleep)but, more importantly, it felt like sitting and holding the hand of a (very wise) best friend. She affirmed my beliefs about how I wanted to raise my baby. I knew after reading this that I was making the right choices and my conviction had never been stronger. Using Elizabeth's suggestions completely turned his sleeping around. Now, at two and a half, he's still a wonderful sleeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep at Last!","review":"It really works!

Please re-think your strategy and call your editors!This book is simply a huge laundry list of things you can try to get your baby to sleep. No method or structure is offered. Sleep deprived, first-time parents need immediate, structured, clearly-defined, and PLEASE, TO-THE-POINT HELP.If you have a fussy, non-sleeping newborn, and you don't have time to sift through (and try) a huge laundry list of ideas, do NOT waste your valuable TIME and money with this one.

Elizabeth Pantley is a GODSEND!!! For the first 8 months of my daughter's life, she was not sleeping very well at night. She would wake up every 1-2 hours, making me (her mommy) VERY exhausted! But since implementing what I learned in this book, my now almost 9 month-old is sleeping SO much better! The only other book I would recommend would be The Baby Sleep Book by Dr. William Sears, as that also has some practical advice not found in this book.

Everyone is happier and sleeping better- no tears necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"I bought both of the \\"No-Cry Solution\\" books but ultimately found them largely unhelpful. There are a few good tips, but they really perpetuated the problems we were having much longer than necessary. What we needed was a solid program not little adjustments that created more bad habits or perpetuated them. While the author encourages parents not to enter into certain bad habits, other things around nursing and sleeping, etc. seemed to make our problems worse. In the end, \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" and \\"The Sleep Easy Solution\\" were the two books that were life savors for us.

She has a number of ideas to try for babies in many different circumstances. I have started using some of her techniques and my baby quickly began making progress, she falls asleep at 7:30pm every night and only wakes up a couple times in the night.

When I did the first sleep log, my baby woke up 12 times during the night and had only one and a half hours of naptime. Now, three weeks later, she naps for three or four hours and only wakes up once or twice (I think this is due to genuine hunger and will probably stop when she starts solids).

I eagerly awaited this book, as my kids' sleep problems were affecting my every day life and relationship. Unfortunately, they still are. Ms. Pantley admits that her \\"solution\\" takes a lot of time and effort, but just about all she suggested, we have already done. One big difference is that we refuse to allow co-sleeping, which Ms. Pantley raves about. That's her choice, but it won't happen in this household. From all the other positive reviews, I suspect she has helped many many people. That's great, because I know what it is like to suffer from children's sleeping problems. But I found no helpful advice and didn't like the know-it-all tone of the author. The reason why I did not give less than 2 stars is because I know our case is a bit special since our problems are bigger, with twins. That said, I still found no new solutions in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The No Sleep Cry Solution","review":"My husband and I tried the techniques recommended in this book. We followed them religiously for two and a half months. Although it is gentle (we aren't comfortable with crying it out), we found it completely ineffective in making any progress toward better sleep. Our son continued to wake up 7-8 times each night. We were able to soothe him back to sleep quickly each time, but we were never able to move through the different stages toward less intervention. After months of not getting more than an hour of sleep at a time, I was the one crying.I found Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child to be more helpful and effective (although more difficult to read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emty book. Total dissapointment","review":"My 16 month old baby wakes up couple of times a night. Doctor recommended this book to me trying to fix the problem without letting the baby cry. I thought I'd finally start sleeping thru the night finally!Started reading and realized that I was on page 22 and got no useful info so far (just that this helped my kids to sleep, I promise it'll help yours .....). Pretty amazing how you can take one phrase and turn it around so many times to fill in 22 pages! So somewhere in the middle of the book was my destination: I found out that if my baby is over one and wakes up twice a night, I shouldn't be doing anything about it because it's normal for child that age to wake up a couple of times. So there: If I didn't spend an hour of my time reading, I would've spent it getting more sleep. Sorry to say but waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only book I've ever thrown away!","review":"My wife read this and started a sleep diary, had us increase bedtime rituals (same lullabye CD every night), and had us rushing to the crib at the first sign of baby stirring... basically setting up several crutches so our daughter relied on us to put herself back to sleep. This works if you're willing to walk around like a zombie the next day because you've gotten up five times between 2am-6am. After reading other sleep books, my tired wife is of the opinion that baby may just need to fuss a few nights in order to learn better long-term sleep habits... yet she still has a hard time shaking the 'bad mother' feeling this book gave her.

My daughter could not be put down, even if she was already deeply asleep, without waking up and bursting into tears. I finally went with the Ferber method - after reading his book, which I thought was excellent - and my daughter is sleeping incredibly well after very few tears.

As a mother of two, soon to be three, who was walking around in a fog for 17 months after 2nd child's birth, this book is nothing short of a God-send. When we filled out the log that the author recommended, he awoke 8 times, one of which was a 3-hour nursing session. By the third day, he woke up only once after 10 hours of sleep. I was practically dancing all day - so excited about getting sleep. I've read so many books that promise to change your life, but this one actually delivers. The author has been where we are and her advice is thoughtful, practical, ingenious, well tested, do-able, and sympathetic. This book really has changed my life. We thought we would cave when baby #3 came along, but now that we can sleep and have skills to help all our children sleep, we have hope and confidence - crucial assets for any mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to sleeping at night again!","review":"I took this book out from the library when my now-6-year-old was 6 months old. I held little faith, initally, and felt completely downtrodden when I kept my first sleep log and realized my daughter was getting up 15 times a night, at least! I gave the book and its methods a chance, as it seemed to go hand-in-hand with our parenting style (gentle!) and didn't require us to force our daughter to lay in a crib crying for hours. Within 1 week of using Elizabeth Pantley's methods, my daughter was sleeping for 3-5 hr stretches. Inside of a month she was (mostly) sleeping through the night, and without any guilt on my behalf!

I didn't know that it was better not to keep a baby awake later in the evening in an effort to get the baby to sleep later in the morning, for example. Once I learned my baby's sleep cues and actually let him go to sleep we were all a lot happier in this house. I also learned my baby's natural nap schedule, which has helped me in planning our days together.However, I can't give the book five stars, because it didn't help my baby stay asleep at night or go to bed in the evening. We ultimately had to let him cry it out to get him to go to bed at night, and now he's doing great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a book","review":"The author claims that her advice is working for attached parents as well, although throughout the book she claims that it's not normal for babies to fall asleep on the breast. Her method IS a kind of sleep training, and as it often doesn't work, parents end up using CIO on their babies, in order to break the breast-sleep association, which is clearly wrong.Also, in case anyone is wondering why the book has so many 5 star reviews, here's the secret - the author periodically posts messages on her Facebook wall, promising free book packages for those willing to write such a review. I have witnessed at least 3 of these posts, you were supposed to contact her by email for more details, as she deleted the request after 5 minutes, so that no trace would remain of her actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Inane","review":"This book was absolutely the most useless book ever.

I was severely disappointed and still completely sleep deprived.Not only did it not offer any solutions for getting my son to sleep, it only served to making me feel more guilty for even considering letting my son \\"cry it out\\". The whole first chapter is a diatribe on why parents are cruel if they let their child cry at all.If you really want help your child sleep through night, try Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.

The full night of sleep is contingent on seeing that they got all the naptime hours of sleep they need. NOT THE CASE FOR MY HIGH-NEED CHILD! I didn't find this book helpful at all.

Instead of going down at a reasonable 9 or even 10:00, she would keep us up until midnight or later. If we tried putting a drowsy baby in her crib she would instantly be wide awake the second we let go of her. I had been looking for a book that would help us get her down earlier. But this book, like Healthy Sleep Habits, just emphasizes \\"finding the window\\" to get her to sleep. If it was that simple I would not be reading these books. Initially this book appealed to me because she is against crying it out, but the solutions she provides are not what we needed. If you are a cosleeping breastfeeding mother (which I am not) these tips may be helpful.

It is our job, as parents, to get to know our children. During the day and at night. We can encourage them in healthy sleep, but there are a variety of reasons why a child wakes.

It was a very valuable tool in helping us get more sleep. There is work to do to change sleeping habits, and this book helped me do it. When I did the work the book prompted me to do, my daughter started sleeping 5 straight hours, then 6, then 7. She slept 11 1/2 straight hours last night! But she is almost 4 now!

He has been falling asleep on the breast. I tried to do what the book says to phase it out. But he would cry immediately after I take him off the breast. He has figured out what was happening and pretty much cried like somebody was trying to murder him. No amount of holding him, rocking him, walking made any difference. Although the book tells you what to do in theory, it didn't work for us in reality. We are pretty much going to have to do the cry-it out method anyways. There are some small amount of useful information in the book so I'm going to rate it 2 stars.

This book showed me that I'm not the only one with a poorly sleeping baby who don't want to use CIO, even if many people suggested it as the only solution to my problem.

I say this because her method can take months to implement, and her strategy basically involves doing all the things you want to get away from doing in order for your child to get to sleep independently (rocking, holding, walking, etc. etc.) Therefore, who's to say that the baby actually LEARNED to sleep through the night, or merely grew out of night waking? This book could also possibly be accurately called Do Everything You Are Already Doing, Just Wait a Little Longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Tizzy Hall's \\"Save Our Sleep\\" instead","review":"I disliked the way this book was written very much - it's all over the place and the author seems to be terrified of giving advice in a confident way.In the end this book was just a drawn out, disorganised version of Tizzi Hall's book: \\"Save Our Sleep\\".

I might consider trying to let her cry since the Pantley method seems to be not working for us. And we just have to do something since we are totally sleep deprived.But i would never say this book was no help at all.

Go ahead and pat yourself on the back for being superparent, I'm going to sleep -- all night. Although some of the ideas in the book are good to incorporate with other getting to sleep stragegies, the absolute \\"no-cry\\" theory is just that for the vast majority of children and parents: a theory. The author is almost completely uneducated in any sleep science and it shows. The book is far more of a support group than a guide. \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child\\" is a much better resource for getting children to sleep.

It is obviously geared to the typical American couple that has taken attachment parenting too far and do not mind being in bondage to their baby. If you do not co-sleep with your baby, wear your baby, demand breast feed your baby well into the toddler years, this book isn't for you. This book offers no \\"in-between\\" solutions in getting your baby to sleep through the night. You still have to basically \\"grin and bear it\\" and get up quite a bit with your baby (even with a twelve month old). And who has time for the never ending sleep logs? Elizabeth Pantley constantly emphasizes never letting your baby cry for even a minute. Well, I have news for her... babies cry even when being rocked and held."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's got the time for this?.","review":"This book is too long.

I tried it after a friend introduced me to attachment parenting and I thought I would try it. Well we had children around the same time and while my 3 year old is happily sleeping through the night and potty trained, hers is still completely dependent on mommy, in diapers and wont' sleep through the night unless she is sandwiched in between mommy and daddy.

It was so poorly written, I couldn't believe it could be published.From a getting your baby to sleep perspective, this book was useless.

It has some helpful tips about setting up a bedtime routine, but there's a ton of unsupported conjecture that passes judgment on anyone who lets their baby cry.The author writes as if she knows that when your baby cries and you don't immediately go to his side that he feels abandoned and terrified. How, exactly, does she know that?!? That's a ridiculous statement not supported by any science, and it's an irresponsible way to scare new parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"This book is long winded but offers no real solutions.

The opening chapter on safety is a prime example: 13 pages repeating in a variety of ways that pediatricians recommend babies sleep on their backs. But the big problem with the book is that it really offers no \\"no-cry solution\\" to getting a baby to sleep through the night, just amorphous talk about \\"flexible routines,\\" comfortable sleeping environments, and so on and so on.

But \\"crying\\" is not even in the index! Although this book has some good ideas and is easy to read, the author seems to assume that your baby does not cry when set down and/or falls asleep easily and is primarily a guide to pre-sleep soothing techniques. However, her parenting philosophy is a nice counterbalance to other sleep authors who are more critical of attachment parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a happy baby, not a quick fix, read this book!","review":"If you want a quick fix, go read some other book. But to me (and I've read several sleep books), it's like the difference between losing five pounds right away (but not keeping it off) and losing weight slowly (and keeping it off for good). If you utilize other books, like the ones which recommend hard-line CIO, you may get that five pounds off in time to wear your bikini to the beach next weekend, but you'll put the weight back on.

Stupid mistake. Reading fiction on a kindle is one thing, but Pantley has reproducible charts and forms in her book and there are multiple places where you are told to skip ahead to a certain page depending on which circumstances best describe your child. Admittedly, I'm seriously sleep-deprived, so maybe my grasp of technology isn't at its best right now and there might be ways to make the Kindle more functional, but for a book like this, I'm wishing I had paperback.

First of all, I found the suggestion of holding your baby's mouth shut to keep him from rooting for your nipple utterly laughable. Secondly, the other suggestions in the book were no different than any others that I've heard. You can get them from any sleep book, some of which are much less expensive. I also felt that this book was geared towards those who co-sleep. There was advice from those who don't co-sleep, but most of the testamonials were from those who do.

The cry it out method was not for me. I have, admittedly, tried it and was left with an exhausted, wiped out baby the next day. Elizabeth's suggestions are wonderful.

The book is loaded with suggestions for encouraging babies to fall asleep on their own, nap longer, etc. Maybe something in it will work for you. But for me it was useless--perhaps worse than useless. After I read this, my 6-month-old woke up more often and resisted sleep more strenuously than before I started applying Pantley's tips to encourage him to sleep through the night. (Maybe he guessed that I was trying to pull something over on him.) If her plans don't work for you, Elizabeth Pantley concludes that you're not following them with enough discipline. While her suggestions seem common-sensical enough, executing her techniques can be involved. The whole exercise starts to feel like a convoluted magic trick, where the magic never works but because the steps are so tricky, you can never be sure that the fault doesn't lie with you.

I was a dedicated follower of attachment parenting from the birth of my baby until she was 6 months. When my baby was five months old, someone at an attachment parenting meeting recommended this book. After following Pantley's method for one month, my baby was sleeping for 30 minute stretches and waking up screaming. This just didn't work for us.Also, it's badly written and has that opening chapter of emotion guilt-garbage. How can you subject a sleep deprived parent to pages of circular and self-referencial emotional arguments? Now that's cruelty.I do feel that the emphesis on scheduling might be enough to help a great number of people. It's no miracle, however.Do what works for you, what feels right.

But it didn't work for us. My baby simply refused to sleep on her own. Pantley recommends putting baby in her crib when she is almost asleep, but our baby just woke up screaming when we did that, everytime. If not, she would wake and refuse to go back to sleep, unless she was held. Maybe our baby is a high-need baby, in which case perhaps this doesn't work for high-need babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE the no-crying approach!","review":"FINALLY, a book that makes sense to sleep-deprived people! I always thought there were only three options when it came to sleeping with a baby in the house: 1) You just get lucky and have a natural-born sleeper; 2) You can let them cry it out; or 3) You can just deal with the constant night waking.Thanks to Elizabeth Pantley, I realized there is a gentle, loving way to teach my daughter to sleep without a single tear! After a few nights of following our sleep plan, my daughter started sleeping through the night. This was accomplished without ONE single tear!!!!Unlike in other books, there is no strict format to follow. You can adapt the ideas to fit your child and at your own pace. No more feeling guilty for not just letting her cry it out and being tired all the time.

Our baby was extremely stubborn and we ended up using a gentle method of the \\"cry it out\\" and it worked charms for us. Once she figured out how to fall asleep on her own, that was all it took. So, after 3 months of failing with this book, it only took a few hours of crying to work for us. Too bad I wasted 3 months in my mind. The book might work for you, but good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The book is a complete waste of money. It is full of common sense tips and offers no good guide for putting your child to sleep. Pantley tells the reader about a group of mothers who achieved success by using her tips. However, she does not offer anything new, e.g. look for cues that your baby is sleepy and etc. Buy this book if you want to read about the sleep habits of the author's childlen and a bunch of random kids. I was very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us.......","review":"I tried this method for over two months with my then 11 month old son. We went exactly by the book and it didn't work at all. We didn't make ANY progress in the 2.5 months we attempted this method. Although it seems like a great approach for those who practice attachment parenting, such as I do; but as a full time nursing student and single mom~ I needed any extra minute I had to study. I attempted this method over my summer break, and like I previously stated, it didn't work for us, even though I did exactly as the book said. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense and any other sleep book will help you more","review":"We have had significant sleep issues with our baby. I have read a few books by now and this one was really not worth the money to me. It is a mix of common sense and partly some very odd theories that seem way too self made. No scientific research is quoted to support this method. I bought this book because it was recommended by Dr Sears and I really like The Baby Book. It is hard to find a 'method' that will match all babies. I would recommend the Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child book. It has been of the most use to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cried...","review":"This book is nice in theory. I really wanted this book to work! I was desperate for this book to at least help a little. It didn't. This book was judgmental, made me feel like a bad parent, and didn't work.Instead I recommend, \\"Healthy Sleep Habits Happy Child.\\" My son actually cried LESS with the cry it out method then with following the ideas in this book.Good luck fellow desperate parents :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best bet for Canadian parents","review":"I agree with what a previous reviewer said. This book is not the best option for Canadian parents. Pantley doesn't make any mention at all of the Canadian Paediatric Society's recommendations about infants and sleep, nor does she reference other Canadian health authorities like Health Canada. She also fails to mention the top-notch sleep disorders clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto or to talk about the work of leading Canadian experts on babies and sleep. Most Canadian parents would find Bonny Reichert's book In Search of Sleep to be a lot more useful and relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned my no-crier into a crier","review":"I so much regret buying and using this book, words cannot describe. My 8-month-old son was a bad sleeper: he'd only fall asleep in our arms and would wake frequently during the night. Following the advise in this book made everything worse. He now takes hours to go to bed at night. And he wakes more frequently. And he cries at all times. This is something completely new. And it is very hard to console him. I guess many people were helped by this book, but beware: it might not be good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER let your child \\"cry it out\\"","review":"OK, Some of the ideas in the book are not new BUT the book does give you encouragement... \\"why not start tonight\\"The book describes how a crying baby that is left alone may feel. I could NEVER do that to my child.The book is good at letting you know YOU need to WORK to help baby... create sleep logs, plans, check and revise. OK, not that you don't have enough to to. BUT , you CAN help your baby.Often funny and witty, it is a very useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"I was absolutly disappointed with this book. What annoyed me most was the repeated \\"if you read this book then...\\" Besides that there was nothing really new in that book and I find it strange that the author gives advice like: take away your nipple again and again if you do not want your baby to fall asleep on the breast. Excuse me, but what else would you do? To present that as a big new way of not letting your baby cry means to assume that every other mother is really stupid. Sorry, there are a few nice ideas, but I think you could put them on a maximum of 10 pages, the rest is just cheating you out of your money.I do not let my baby cry and this book defnitly did not help make my nights more quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I'm a new mom and at about the 6th month my daughter started waking up a lot throughout the night and napping poorly during the day. I couldn't bare to hear you cry, so after much research I thought and hoped that this method would work for us. I followed the steps and tried every tip in this book with hopes that eventually it would work for us. I'm sorry to say it did not. My daughter was just stubborn. The only thing I did did work, was introducing a lovey (baby loves that). At about 9 months of nothing else working, I finally used the Ferber method and worked wonderfully for us. Baby learned to sleep on her own in 3 nights, and much to my surprise and delight, there wasn't a lot of crying, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place. She's been sleeping a solid 10-12hrs per night with almost no night wakings, and her naps are also great. So although this no-cry method might work for some, it didn't for us, my baby was just different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver!","review":"This book has been a lifesaver! My son was waking frequently at night and my husband and I were at a loss about what to do. Crying it out seemed to be the only solution that was offered whenever we asked doctors and other professionals for help. We're still working on transitioning our son to his \\"big boy bed,\\" but I can't tell you how much set naptimes, bedtimes, and wake times (all suggestions set forth in Pantley's book), along with earlier naptimes and bedtimes have helped SO much! It seemed so strange to start putting my son to bed at 6:30 at night, but the bedtime struggles have ended and he falls asleep so much easier. He's a much happier little boy - and we are much happier parents. The other night my husband and I sat down to watch TV and I couldn't remember the last time we'd been able to do that since our nights have been filled with bedtime battles for so long. We plan on continuing to use Pantley's no cry solutions as we work on transitioning him into his own bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I co-sleep and breastfeed so I needed a good sleep book that was in line with my philosophy. This book has been very insightful so far. I plan on using it to craft how I handle my next baby too- before mistakes are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Realistic techniques for helping your baby learn good sleep habits without the trauma of those horrible crying/screaming sessions. The author doesn't offer quick fixes, but learned behavior over time that helps your whole family enjoy restful nights. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a relief!","review":"I had no idea that my baby's sleeping patterns were so exceptional until I read this book. My son sleeps 6-8 hours every night, but we logged his sleep patterns...just in case changes are ahead (just as the book recommends). The book is chock full of solid, kind advice on how to sensitively get your baby to sleep through the night. The best advice? The step-by-step instructions on how to get your baby to self-soothe and go back to sleep when he wakes throughout the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my sanity!!","review":"When my daughter wouldn't sleep, I knew there had to be another way than locking her in her crib & letting her cry. I just couldn't do that. Thankfully a friend recommended this book & it has literally saved my sanity. My daughter sleeps better, sleeps through the night, goes to bed eagerly (all things I thought would never happen) & we have a lovely time doing it - established rituals - no crying it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts","review":"Very easy to read. Its difficult for me to make some of the adjustments she talks about but its a process. I never realized just how important naps were. Love that she has a table with recommended times for sleep based on child's age. Worth giving it a shot if \\"crying it out\\" is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah right, 'no cry'","review":"It's 3:15am, and my son has been awake for the last 2 hours. While this book gives great suggestions - introduce the lovey, baby massage, etc., none of these things seem to work for my almost 2 year old. I think this book is geared more toward infants/younger babies, not toddlers. I would say you have a better chance of getting suggestions from an online forum or a local mother's group."},{"rating":"2","title":"self soothe","review":"I have read this book twice. At first I admit it sounded so hard to follow the bedtime log considering that I am a single mom. I tried every step in this book but last night I was too exhausted to continue. I usually have a set routine as in the book first a bath, then a massage, her formula and off to rock to sleep. I was creating a problem by rocking her to sleep, which is good however if you have to do it every single night for the baby to sleep then it is a problem. It is important to emphasize that your baby needs to learn how to self soothe themselves to sleep and then you can begin all Pantley's steps. I didn't realize because I was so sleep deprived that I had the best intentions for my baby but I was adding to the problem. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Finally, a book that approaches sleep with the baby's best interest in mind! Being a first-time mom, I had no idea that baby's sleep was so different from adult sleep. I learned a lot about sleep cycles and the reasons why they don't sleep like adults. This information helped me to change my expectation of sleep and to be more accepting of the night wakings when they did happen. This book also helped me find a gentle way to help my baby sleep through the night. I recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work no matter how hard I tried and wanted it to","review":"Not every baby can fall asleep with these suggestions, which while not harmful per se, only set up an environment that will 'allow' baby to fall asleep. It will not work for babies that are simply NOT wanting to sleep no matter what- and I tried VERY hard for months and months with 2 babies. In the end, the Sleep Easy Solution, a 'cry' method was the savior. It only took 1 night of 20 minutes of crying, whereas the \\"no-cry\\" method had baby and me and husband all crying for hours and hours every single day and night, because baby was exhausted and desperately needed sleep, she just could not let it happen. I gave this book 1 star for the guilt it induces in parents who actually need to use a 'cry' method."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have patience...","review":"My 2 month old son had been sleeping well until I had my gallbladder taken out and all was lost. In desperation, and not wanting to try the \\"cry it out\\" method, I tried this book. Many of the suggestions are helpful, and if you are patient in the middle of the night to get up every time your little one whimpers, this is the book for you. I stuck with it for a bit, but ended up having to try other things. I do think this is a good start for parents, but you definetely need patience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Sadly, I wanted this approach to work but it was more frustrating then helpful. I was turned off as soon as I read the section where the author encouraged mothers to hold their baby's mouth shut after breast feeding to stop them from wanting to suckle more. Not my idea of a gentle approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have loved for this to work for us","review":"I have twin boys and I would have loved not to have to go the cry route. I bought this book with that thought in mind - no crying. I swore up and down I would NEVER let them CIO. I tried to follow the book but with 2 babies - it didn't always work for us and actually my sons began to wake up even more often after trying to follow this plan.After much soul searching I decided to try one of the \\"other\\" methods and I now have 2 sleepers.I think that if you can take the time - weeks to get this in place - it is a great idea - our sleep deprivation was too severe by the time I got this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally somewhere to turn!","review":"I was so happy to read this book and know that someone felt as I did, that I didn't have to let my son cry himself to sleep. Elizabeth Pantley's book was a great source of support for me as I worked with my son. I started working with my son at 3 months using suggestions in the book and he has been sleeping through the night since 4 months. I can finally get him down for naps without him needing me to get him to sleep. I found the book to be very practical with lots of different suggestions so that there were several options to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true miracle","review":"My baby was waking up 8 to 10 times a night to breastfeed. I was so sleep deprived I could not function. I don't believe in letting a baby cry himself to sleep so I was living with a situation that was taking a toll on my life and my marriage.After a month of following the ideas in this book my baby sleeps 8 or 9 hours, wakes up once to breastfeed and then sleeps 4 more hours. I am a new woman, my baby even appears happier, and my darling baby never had to cry it out. I'm quite proud that we took the high road.I did not do the logs at all (not my thing) but I have several friends in my support group who did and found them quite helpful.In our group this book has become the only one for sleep issues. I'm amazed that so many people with so many different kinds of problems have found answers here, but it seems to work for everyone. All of us have been able to get our babies sleeping without any crying. We praise this book all the time and so I recommend it to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Sleep Solution","review":"This book promises a new look at the problem of getting your child to sleep through the night - without crying. However, there's nothing new here. All you get with this book is the same old \\"follow a routine, put your child down for regular naps\\" deal. There are no guidelines for HOW to put your child down for regular naps - you're just supposed to do it. Somehow your child just isn't going to cry. You know, I'm sure this argument holds water: if your child sleeps well during the day, she'll sleep better at night. I'm not arguing with that, it's just that I've heard it before. This book is a waste of money, and promises solutions that it just doesn't deliver. Here, let me save you $10: follow a regular schedule, ease your child into naptime and bedtime by reading to her, or taking her for a walk, or anything to get her sleepy and used to the idea that it's almost time to sleep. There. Feel better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad it didn't work","review":"I think this book is wonderful philosophically, and I believe that her method has helped people, and it did not work for us. After trying for 3 months, I finally had to admit that my baby's sleep had not improved. I wrote this review because I want other parents to be willing to stop trying after a point if it does not work. The book is so incredibly well-regarded right now that I think it is hard to finally say \\"It doesn't work for us!\\". But it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What About Working Mothers?","review":"After 7 months of not sleeping through the night, I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I read The No-Cry Sleep Soluition and tried to follow the new bedtime plan. The problem is that a major part of the plan is the daytime schedule. As much as I would love to be home with my child all day to get her nap routine and early bedtime in place, I CAN'T! My daycare tries the best they can, but if she doesn't stick to the schedule they don't force it. And since we don't get home until 6:30 pm every night, a bedtime before 8:00 pm is out of the question.Elizabeth Pantley's ideas sound great, but they don't work for parents who have to work full time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So This is Sleep!","review":"Before I read this book, my daughter was up all night long. I could get her to fall asleep, but I could not get her to sleep.Reading this book, I was taught what to do to get my daughter to fall asleep and stay asleep. Elizabeth Pantley's tips were wonderful. A true good night without having to make my daughter cry herself to sleep. All my daughter wanted was to learn to fall asleep, but she needed me as her mother to help her learn. This book helped me teach her what I have forgotten long ago;) Since I've been falling asleep on my own for years!A wise book, written with love and care. Tips from bedtime routines to white noise. If you co-sleep, that's fine! Breast-feed or bottle-feed, that's fine too! Anything goes because this book is aimed at all parenting styles.I will forever be grateful to this wonderful author and mother. After all, she is the reason why I'm finally dreaming! And I wake up relaxed and ready for my day after a wonderful nights sleep.Goodnight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Harvey Karp's \\"Happiest Baby on the Block\\" is Faster/Better","review":"I have been through all of these challenges. Dr. Karp's \\"The Happiest Baby on the BLock\\" is also a no cry sleep solution, but he has been doing these technigues, the 5S's as a pediatrician for over 30 years. Let that speak for itself. Why reinvent the wheel? He teaches on how to teach the child to sleep and how to wein them from the assistance. I had a colicy baby (extreme was the diagnosis), and the only thing that worked IMMEDIATELY was the 5 S's by Dr. Karp. I cannot imagine how well it would have worked for a baby that did not have colic (ah but a faint dream). I would not waste my time with all these other things. I recommend the DVD for quick tools to learn, but get the book so you can get more understanding into why it works (after you get some sleep that I guarantee you will get)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my baby","review":"Although I am avidly against the cry it out solution for my baby I found no success with the techniques in this book. The best use I found for this book was as a toy for my son when he wouldn't sleep. These techniques may work for babies who actually want to sleep but my son has inherited my husband's trait of going and going until you drop. Oh well. Wish I had the same trait then the lack of sleep wouldn't be such a concern for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way we should have been taught!","review":"We need to throw out the info from the 1950's and get with the times. After reading seven sleep books, this one has the right approach. No cry it out, no baby's love to bang their heads, no baby's love to vomit. Baby's have minds, emotions and feelings. If you can train your dog with positive reinforcement then your baby will be a piece a cake. The more we understand our babies the more they'll become in their lives. And I think the world will be a better place because of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried both Ferber and No Cry method and Ferber wins","review":"I must say I wished I tried Ferber method before No Cry method. It only took us one night and 20 minutes of total cry time for my daughter to get sleep trained. No Cry method just did not cut it for our daughter nor us, the parents. We spent hours and hours trying to get her to sleep when all she needed was for us to tell her to go to sleep Ferber style. And she did not get tramatized for life because she cried for 15 minutes straight...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad if you have ideas on what to do","review":"This book was helpful in the sense that 1) our child is only 2 months old, 2) we hadn't started sleep training at all, and threfore had no ideas, and 3) with 2 stay at home parents, we were not sleep deprived. It gave some good ideas for us to keep in the back of our minds when we get into sleep training her. However, if you rely on this book 100% with the tecnhiques on a child that is ready for sleep training, all you're going to train them to do is sleep only when in your arms. I would never be cold or callous to any child, but if I ran to my infant at the first sound when she slept, I'd never leave the side of her crib.as a brand new parent, there are some good ideas, so it isn't totally useless, but if I had more experience in the sleep training department, the book would have been useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantley's book is a pantload","review":"My 12 month old son cried hysterically for over 1 1/2 hours when I attempted Pantley's method. It was a horrible ordeal for both of us. After realizing that there is no such thing as a \\"no cry\\" solution, I looked elsewhere and found myself reading the revised version Ferber's book. Up to that point, I had been adamantly opposed to allowing my son to cry it out as I though it was barbaric. Turns out my understanding of Ferber's method was incorrect. We are on day three of \\"Ferberization\\" and it is going well. Sure, it is hard to listen to my little guy cry but as his mom I must do what is best for him. I recommend saving your $$$ on this book and buying the Ferber book. It is a fabulous, informative, and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but did not work for us","review":"Did not work for my baby. My baby has woken up every 1 1/2 to 2 hours since birth(he's now 7 months old!) and I have tried everything except letting him cry it out for longer then 10 min at a time. I got this book a couple months ago w/ high hopes but to no avail. My baby does not go back to sleep w/ out breastfeeding which I am tryign to work on and gets very very upset and wakes himself up when I try to insert my finger to remove him as stated in the book. Even w/ repeat times of doign this it didn't work. I tried everythign mentioned and already had been trying the majority of it for some time before getting thsi book.

He went from sleeping 40 minute-1 hour stretches to 7 hours stretches in a just two months! And without letting him cry it out.

After reading it from first page to last, I promptly returned it. It was a waste of 3 good hours (which I could have spent sleeping). I am a professional researcher and was sorely disappointed by the lack of any studies. Elizabeth Pantley's children are not going to predict the behaviour and problems other children might present. I hate the tone of the book as well. It looks down on parents who are concerned about SIDS and choose not to share their bed with their child.

I have read Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child and took away many things that have helped my 4 month old sleep 10+ hours each night. It was straightforward and clear.The No Cry book just told me that I was horrid if my baby cried, s/he would grow up to be non-trusting, full of hatred for the human race and unable to connect on a decent level with other human beings.I don't think so.

Authors should stop generalizing! The authors talks about \\"her research\\" but she never explained what her research consisted of, what articles/books she read, did she consult with experts?

When I would wake up in the wee hours with my son, I couldn't remember all of the methods she described, and it wasn't like I could read the book right then! If you are really committed to this type of method, I would think it would work pretty well, but in my completely exhausted state, trying to remember several different steps to help my baby back to sleep made me more frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical help for gentle sleep","review":"So many parents have heard of all the \\"sleep-training methods\\" and want some kind of system that will help them achieve sleep without bad effects on their babies.

All the quotes are called \\"Mother-Speak\\" and in one section I'm lumped in with babysitters and nannys as a potential \\"helper\\". I'm not a helper - I'm the father. I also didn't like being told that I can't sleep next to my infant son because I don't have the \\"mother's instinct\\" not to role over on him.I take a very active role in my son's life as do many fathers.

(For the record, this was not always the case...I had to figure out my own ways of getting her to sleep, with no help from this book. Part of this consisted of crying it out.)I REFUSE to believe that \\"crying is bad.\\" I will not be made to feel that I am a bad mother, and that my daughter will grow up resenting me, if I let her cry for 5 minutes (or even 15 minutes.)I also refuse to take my baby for a ride or rock her every time she needs to sleep.I'm not saying that I'm a perfect mother, because heck no I'm not, but too much of this book is common sense.

When she outlines her steps to getting a child to sleep, she says that if the child won't fall asleep using her strategy and you are getting frustrated, just to go back to what you were doing before. By doing this you are only teaching your child that all they need to do is cry and get picked up and put down for a long time and eventually you will do what you have always done to get them to sleep (which wasn't working for you if you are trying this new method). Of course you don't want your child to cry himself to sleep, but you also don't want to cry yourself to sleep either. Your baby needs a well-rested and sane mother most of all. Whatever method you use to get your child to sleep, you must be consistent and this book does not embrace that and encourages you to backtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem","review":"I was able to wean my child at 2.5 years of age, but continue to co-sleep.

He would start to dose and I would remove the nipple. After a few times he would jerk himself awake and bite down because he was affraid I would take it away!- Doesn't really go into changes in schedules and traveling that well.Overall the one thing I did get from this book, was to improve his naps and this would improve his night time sleep. I ended up doing a more gentle Cry it out method and it has turned my 8 time-a-night waker into 1 time and with only 15 mins of crying MAX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"My wife and I were struggling with sleep a few months after our son was born.

My daughter started out as a great sleeper and as time went on we started having more and more difficulty understanding what she needed in sleep. We knew that Cry-It-Out was not for us and Pantley provides TONS of ideas to address sleep problems that are not harsh or uncomfortable. She encourages you to try different things until you have a plan that works for your family. We found some of her suggestions useful for us and others didn't work for our daughter. One thing I loved in particular was that we were able to follow Pantley's advice without night weaning or moving our daughter out of our bed. These philosophies fit with our parenting style but would fit with others, as well. Without having a prescribed \\"you must do x, y, z\\" plan it was easy to understand what my child needed. I have recommended this book to many of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book has helped me and my family get much needed sleep. My baby used to wake up every hour and a half. Each night I kept thinking I would not make it through the night. This book teaches you gentle ways to set a daily routine. It is also a book that any mother can read as it is written for every single case there is. I love it. I love it. Two weeks after I started using Pantley's method I saw major improvement in my child. This book has definitely been a life saver for me. A month after consistently following the same routine my child started sleeping more and more.Definitely the best purchase so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"The less sleep solution","review":"I really didn't want to let my daughter cry, and turned to this book for help in eliminating the *one* middle of the night waking that she still experienced. After reading the book and trying Pantley's approach, my daughter is now waking EVERY TWO HOURS@!! And, some nights, refusing to go back to sleep in her crib or my bed. She will only sleep in my arms on those occasions. In desperation, I have had to let her cry, something I swore I would never do. I blame this book. I didn't know how good I had it. I also think it is highly irresponsible and somewhat cruel to go into such graphic, heart wrenching detail about what a baby *might* feel upon waking in the night. Where are the facts backing up her statements?I wish I had never bought this book, and I recommend that anyone considering this so-called solution get the book out of their local library rather than throwing money away on a purchase. If it works for you, great, but it is by no means fail-safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A No-Cry Solution for Parents and babies!","review":"We purchased this book with our first child who was notorious for not sleeping. What struck me the most was her clear explanation of the many reasons babies may not sleep: allergies, teething, temperature, hunger, etc. In narrowing things down we were able to recognize allergies as a key problem in both of our son's sleep issues. As she noted, babies are awake for a reason, they cry for a reason, it's our job to respond to them. We wouldn't expect a dog to be trained in a night or a week so why would we expect that out of our child? Through her gentle weaning techniques and a lot of love we now have 2 loving confident toddlers and two well rested parents. When teething hits we're up again from time to time but they settle back into their patterns of a full 11 or 12 hour night of sleep easily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE HER!","review":"I loved the 10 day approach.

Despite having been recently released, it is basically someone's narrated vacation video from the 1980s (judging by the clothing of the Northern Europeans at the resorts where parts of this were filmed.) Having been to Greece, and in particular, Crete, for an extended period of time, this dvd failed to capture any authentic sense of the land or its people. I could tolerate a cliched look at Greece if the cinematography was even semi-professional and 'pretty', but this was a joke. At one point, there is a montage of windsurfing stock footage that seemingly has no place in the dvd.

Things happen too brusquely. It has a beautiful photography, though, interesting scenes and characterizations. But it needed more minutes. I want to believe that it wasn't Ford's intention to tell the story this way, but the film is failed nontheless.I can't help compare it to Hawks' Hatari (great classic) or Huston's African Queen (good) or many other great directors take on the African splendors.As a homage to the best director in film histoy, John Ford, it is a mandatory film to be watched, and respected as what it could have really been, another great classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"Clark Gable and Grace Kelly are not only my favorite actor/actresses, but they were phenomenal working together in this film!

Pluses: Temp range for perfect milk temperature highlighted (140-160 deg. F), reasonably priced. Minuses: It should include a plastic protector tube (to prevent inadvertant stabbings...), and it would be nice if the temp gauge went down to 80 degrees. To get a good froth, try dancing the steam wand at the top of the milk until the temp reaches 100 deg.F. As the foam rises, follow it up. At 100 deg.F, push the wand down into the milk until the temp reaches 140-160 deg.F. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow To Measure Temperature","review":"In my short time using this thermometer, it does not read the milk temperature as quickly as I think it should. What this means is that you could accidentally scald frothed milk if the temperature rises too much above 160 degrees.I cannot recommendc this product. It is better to learn the temperature of your frothing pitcher by touch; rater than rely on an inaccurate measuring device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this model!","review":"First, I feel foolish for having bought this thermometer in the first place, seeing as the range on the display is 120-180. This essentially eliminates being able to ensure that milk to be frothed is cold enough. Plus, milk for lattes should never be stretched beyond 100 (even lower if you have a more powerful frother), which, obviously, is below the range of this thermometer. Then there's the responsiveness problem. By the time this thermometer registers 140, the milk is already screeching violently.I bought this thermometer to replace a digital instant-read thermometer that I had ruined by keeping it too close to a hot grill. But I'll definitely be buying a better thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked good for a while, then it died","review":"after three months of use, it stopped registering tempurature. while it worked, though, it was a \\"must-have\\" for excellant froth.

It lags about seven seconds behind my digital probe thermometer, so you need to correct and allow several seconds of \\"coasting\\" time. The instructions say to keep it at least 2\\" in the milk; but when frothing in a 20oz pitcher for a 12oz drink, you start with less milk than that. If this thermometer were acceptably responsive, I'd ding it for not reading 100F, but the responsiveness issue makes everything else moot.This might be a barely adequate choice if you have a very slow steaming machine, or if you're dealing with large quantities of milk.

A lot of people have been claiming that the markings don't go down far enough, though I've noticed it's best to submerge your wand when the needle starts to climb. It's a must have for people who make their own milk and espresso drinks, and it works well - the readings seem accurate and the glass doesn't fog at all. The only other complaint I have is that the clip doesn't attach securely to the pitcher - there's a lot of wiggle, but I've found that if I clip it near the pitcher handle and hold the flat top of the clip with my thumb, that keeps it steady. I'd also like to note that the clip does hold securely to the needle of the thermometer, which allows you to keep the end in the middle of the pitcher for a more accurate reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"really makes your espresso drink a lot better","review":"Before purchasing this, I would just guess as to when the milk was hot enough.

The songs on the Ace release have been gently noise-reduced, leaving almost all the music intact; but the guys who stole these tracks from the Ace CDs have massacred the music in a misguided attempt to get rid of all extraneous noise (you can tell it's a bootleg because of the identical disc clicks & crackles that even their gross de-noising software can't eliminate).Ace have more or less a monopoly of the best B B King sources because they are the only guys with original master tapes of this period.

You can find out how much a cup weighs but the precise weight depends on the type of flour you're using -- for example typo 00 is finer than standard flour etc. Also the author refers to cakes of yeast -- is this a 0.6 g cake or a 2.0 g cake that US bakers use? In addition, when the author talks about flour she tells us that typo 00 is the correct type to use but she then lists two other types of flour (cake flour plus one other) in her standard dough recipe. I understand that the author is attempting to approximate typo 00 which may be hard to find but she should still have given the correct typo 00 weight for those who can get it. The book is well presented and is nice to look at but the recipes are flawed for the reasons mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While the content was somewhat interesting, but I did not feel there were any real new pizza revelations to be gleaned.

This mixer is so quiet compared to my old one and I had absolutely no spatters while mixing my dough (I usually have flour everywhere). Plus, I never once had to scrape the sides of my bowl while mixing. Whenever I used my old mixer, I was always afraid that it was going to come apart while I was using it (it always seemed to be working so hard), but not this mixer.

What I especially did not like was the lack of the Sim-city mode. It's all action/side-scrolling now. The first Actraiser had interesting side-scrolling levels with a nice array of challenges and enemies. The levels in Actraiser 2 are just frustrating. There's nothing wrong with a challenge, but the level of challenge even in Easy mode is so ridiculous it's discouraging. There's nothing wrong with losing lives while trying to figure out a level, but it takes so many attempts to go through a level because the enemies keep coming at you. Trying to work out a strategy to deal with enemies becomes time-consuming, and after you beat one level, you know you're going to have to do it all over again with another level. The time spent trying to master one level sucks all the fun out of the game. If you're a masochist who enjoys being frustrated, this is your game!

My best comparison is Opeth, but with much more tolerable vocals... I don't like deep bellows, and the vocalist here tends to stay in the midrange, not quite like At the Gates, but in a nice, happy medium. The album is very atmospheric from beginning to end, and draws you in in the same way early Opeth did. It changes pace between heavy riffing with some acoustic thrown in... it's a very aurally interesting album to listen to again and again. The musicianship is excellent, but unlike most prog rockers, they maintain emotion for sake of song structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Return For The Finnish Kings","review":"At first listen,not terribly much.

Pretty quick,but not the same.Most of the tracks start out with these beautiful progressive openings,then pick up with accelerative moments and eventually fade out through gentle melodies...outstanding. The best way for you to know exactly what I'm talking about is to listen to: \\"Shades of Deep Green\\" from In The Halls. It's the perfect example and can give you an idea as to what pace INSOMNIUM were using for this gem.Different speed,but the tradition of doomish,artistic lyrics and progressing melodies is definitely there.

I think they are either getting better or remaining the same.I do agree that the number of melodic death bands are decreasing in the new age, and our old bands are dying.

As for the review of this book by Mr. Holm, I doubt he so much as glanced at this fine work... perhaps he should stick to writing reviews of computer games and computer gaming accessories, as he seems to be a prolific reviewer of that genre, and leave serious historical and biographical works to others more suited to the task."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a test of patience","review":"It seems like everyone is trying to make money off of the Holocaust by writing heroic stories or by making overly dramatic movies.

The villain is Osama bin Laden. Yes, that Osama bin Laden. The plot involves the villain's acquisition of tactical, and highly portable, nuclear weapons. Hagberg's book reads like Tom Clancy by way of Ian Fleming. Hagberg's hero, Kirk McGarvey, is back on the scene, and the battle between America and international terror has become intensely personal. JOSHUA'S HAMMER is a fascinating read, especially in light our recent tragedies.

Secondly, it looks as if the whole tape was shot in the instructures bedroom. And a small bedroom at that.There is nothing new as far as the routine goes. There are no new poses, or an ancient mind, body practice. The insructure seems bored with the routines as she is talking, very monotoned the whole time. And her voice is very nasal and just shall we say not soothing. This is just a badly done yoga routine that is horribly overpriced.

It is great for anyone who is trying to de-emphasize meat in their diets and build up the grains, fruits and vegetables. The recipes are fairly easy to follow--a beginner might be left guessing how big a \\"medium\\" zucchini really is, but technique is explained well. The ingredient list is within reach of most supermarkets. The recipes themselves are original and come out looking like the pictures. Many are naturally low-fat and those that are not use the healthiest fats when called for. Butter is scarcely used and I don't think cream is mentioned anywhere. I enjoy reading and cooking from this. My only criticism is negligible: for far-sighted people, even those assisted with monovision contacts or bifocals, the type in which ingredient quantities are set, particularly the fractions, is difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful cooking from a master","review":"Kevin Graham was the executive chef at the Windsor Court hotel at the time this book was written, and the chef at Sapphire when it was published. Under his stewardship, both were among of the best restaurants in New Orleans. His menus were ambitious, forward thinking, and sophisticated. His thoughtful approach to humble ingredients such as beans and whole grains makes this relatively short cookbook a classic.Since the book was published, some ingredients which at the time were difficult to obtain are now more common; think quinoa, for example. There are a few recipes that would be difficult for a novice cook to pull off, but for the most part Graham combines flavors and techniques in very interesting - and useful - ways.This is one of perhaps 10 cookbooks that I'll bring with me the next time I have to evacuate New Orleans. Partly because it's somewhat rare, but mainly because I enjoy it so much, and consistently find something interesting and diverting inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"This book is just not for me. The reason I bought it was to get some ideas on how to cook beans. But I find the recipes bland and uninspiring, based on the ingredients listed. I just find the author's palate hard to relate to. The flavor profile sounds VERY bland and middle American in a bad way, what one would think of really bad American food. The recipes seem healthful enough, but I need my food to taste good AND be healthy. Seriously, check out the pictures/ingredients before you buy it. Usually, when I buy cookbooks, I really connect to the pictures, presentation, and author's palate, but there is very little to connect me to this book.

I myself have enjoyed watching them since they played on the television show Full House. We have about 8 Olsen twin videos, some older videos and some more recent videos. I have found most of them appropriate for my daughter to watch -- both fun and educational. However, this video I do not feel is appropriate for little girls (my daughter is 6 years old). I feel that in this video the Olsen twins have been \\"sexualized\\". The message and/or image they portray in this video is very different than what they have portrayed in the past.

I agree with another viewer that this is really not for \\"little girls,\\" as the twins are portrayed in a sexy light. This is not the fault or doing of the girls -- it is the money making machine/industry that the girls have been enslaved to since infancy. Due to their rapid maturation, the money makers have to craft yet another way to market the girls for their adoring public.

I could be wrong, I'll be purchasing another brand of thermometer to further check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperature markings wiped off with a damp sponge","review":"I bought this because Cooks Illustrated magazine rated it as the best over thermometer and I trust them. This had been in my oven for about 1 year when I decided the food splashes needed to be cleaned off because they were making it hard to read the numbers. I used a damp soapy sponge and wiped the face of the thermometer (it was cold).The temperature markings wiped right off!I didn't put this in the dishwasher or use an abrasive like Ajax. Just soap and a sponge. Now it has no numbers. Now it is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit reading after just a month","review":"Purchased after a test kitchen suggested.

Threw away and purchsed a different brand and style of thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't read anything","review":"No matter how or where I mount this thermometer, I can't tell what the temp is in my oven. I've got a squeaky clean window, so that isn't the problem. I've tried to put it as close to the window without being in the way of the food I'm cooking. I've tried it with the internal light on and off. I've tried different angles by bending the base. I even tried to rotate the thermometer glass (VERY carefully). No matter what I tried, I still can't read the darn thing. I guess I'll try a good old dial type next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"All of the lower rated reviews are absolutely true. I've used this thermometer for several months and it is hard to read the numbers and also the \\"mercury\\" in the thermometer to tell what the temperature really is. It gets dirty with grease splatter and thus it's hard to read. I washed it by hand with 409 and a sponge with the misplaced hope that the numbers would survive; they didn't. Also, when I washed it the glass rod slid in the metal holders / clamps so any calibration that it had was no longer valid. I am now testing how hot my trash can gets in the S. Calif sun. I'm not buy this item again. Burn me once, ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted two weeks","review":"I purchased this thermometer on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated. At first, the thermometer noted that our oven was running 75 degrees cooler than what was indicated by the settings. This contradicted the results we could witness simply from observing the cooking process on various foods. Within two weeks of occasional use, the thermometer \\"broke\\" and the liquid would not move any longer. Despite the Cook's Illustrated recommendation, I have not replaced it and would caution prospective buyers to weigh the possibility of a cheaply manufactured product not performing before they purchase it themselves. If you purchase it locally, at least you'll have easy recourse should you need to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer","review":"I picked this one because it was easy to read, can hang on the rack, or place on the rack.The only thing bad about it was it can break easily if you are not careful. I broke the first one I received because I was baking many items and it got push off or smashed in the oven by the pans. It is best to remember to move the thermometer to a safe place in the oven if you are baking several things. ...like the bottom floor of the oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design.","review":"I, too, bought this because it was highly rated by Cook's. Contrary to their review, however, I find it neither easy to read nor stable. After it gets a little dirty (which won't take long in the oven) it is nearly impossible to read. And if you rest it on top of a rack you will knock it over when you put anything in the oven. If you hang it will also get knocked over. It is accurate though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thermometer","review":"Works perfectly. Tested with an oven that has temp gauge and it was right on the money! Easy to read and very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperature markings wash off","review":"As with many other reviewers here, mine had baked-on grease and when I washed it the numbers washed off. A thermometer is not very useful if you can't read it.I bought it because of the Cooks Illustrated recommendation -- I guess that they never had to wash it off when they tested it. A big oversight on their part. I would choose a different thermometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as it should","review":"Not much to say other than it shows the temp and just hangs in the oven. Plain and simple.

Finally the temperature markings are not engraved and can be washed off if one tries to clean the face of the thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Absolute Junk","review":"The package says that the Taylor 5921 thermometer is \\"dishwasher safe\\". So after it acquired a layer of baked-on grease, I put it in the dishwasher (normal cycle, top rack). This completely erased all the temperature markings. Nearly all of the grease, however, remained, indicating that there was not an excess of detergent. According to the package \\"if it does not clean easily in the dishwasher, soak the thermometer overnight in dishwashing detergent.\\" This thermometer is now useless. It cost me $14.99, which in my opinion is a bit much for the cheap materials and construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return...twice","review":"Even though the description and photograph of this product indicates that it has both Centigrade and Fahrenheit, I was sent a Fahrenheit-only thermometer twice in a row.

I love how pretty they are. After reading other reviews concerning the black marks, we do not use steak knifes on them. (We kept our old set of dishes for that.)

This dinnerware is lovely and I am very pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty everyday dinnerware","review":"I bought service for eight in this pattern about 2 years ago. Except for a couple plates that I dinged (I'm amazed my klutzy self hasn't broken anything!), everything has held up very well. I use these every day and they still look great. The silverware marks a previous reviewer noted can occur, but have been very light and uncommon - unnoticeable unless you're examining your plate in strong light. Everything is of a nice weight - not too thin, not too heavy. The pattern hasn't faded at all. I have bone china I received for my wedding, but this is perfect for common use and is pretty enough for casual entertaining. I love my set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought a Pfaltzgraff dinnerware set in another white pattern two years ago. The comments about black utensil marks on the dishes are correct! We had only used our dishes for a few weeks when we first noticed them. After one year of use, the dishes looked ready for the 50 cent bin at a yard sale. No wonder Pfaltzgraff has to make their own cleaner! I have owned several dishes sets over the years and this is the first that has ever had this problem. My cutlery is high-end, by the way, so that is not the issue. Don't give yourself the grief of this product. To my great regret, when we purchased these dishes we bought another entire dinnerware set to replace breakages. Now I am stuck with both of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic, and more mellow, but no longer nu-metal (mostly)","review":"This CD is more of the same from the band. Disturbed tried, but this just isn't an album that is anything special, or even good. Disturbed was always a band that had a few songs here and there that you could dig and get into. They seem to have lost that aspect here. Most of the music comes off as generic (Stricken), dull (Guarded), Just plain bad (I'm alive), Or all three (Land of Confusion). As time goes on, and the band progresses, I like them less and less. At least it isn't as big of a disappointment as how SOAD has turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed get exponentially worse with each album.","review":"Wow, this band just keeps pumping out the same nu-metal songs on each release. The Sickness was an all-right album, much better than anything Slipknot or Mudvayne could do. Then they're sophmore effort was bassically all the bad parts of The Sickness rolled into one. 10,000 Fists (how original) is nothing, but lame metal for the people over at MTV to play when they think they are playing some real metal. Go pick up the re-issue of Atheist's debut album Piece of Time, that should give you guys a lesson on what metal is all about. I will give it two stars just because the members are fans of Dimebag, a true metal legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed's Downfall","review":"I love Disturbed and their music up until \\"10000 Fists.\\" Unfortunatley this album is no where near the status of their 2 previous releases. Maybe it's the new bassist or maybe Disturbed have just run their course, but this is not a solid Disturbed album by any means. There is alot missing and I really hope they can follow this up with an album like \\"Believe\\" or even \\"The Sickness.\\" Sadly, 10000 Fists led me away from Disturbed and they've fallen big time on my list. This album is not entirely bad, just dissapointing for a Disturbed fan.

They really really suck. Nobody sucks quite like them. They are the definition on wannabe corporate sell outs. They need to listen to metal before trying to create it.

Listen to Animosity, Black Dahlia Murder, Taste of Blood, Origin, TOOL, Pantera, Lamb of God, Meshuggah, God Forbid for starters. Real bands that really have cause to be angry.

I have all their stuff and see them every time they come to town. I think this album is the best metal to come out in the past few years. I just want people to save their money. I bought one of the special edition and one of the regular album. Believe had an extra dvd and art. The special edition only has extra art...NOTHING ELSE. Buy the regular album! The special edition is a COMPLETE WASTE...unless you love McFarlane's work. I feel a little cheated by this one. At least it's an outstanding album.

Well, now I have it and I have to say that it is awesome, and I can't stop listening to it. Just as good as \\"The Sickness\\" and \\"Believe\\" - Disturbed is truly a great band. Buy it now!My favorites: \\"Stricken\\", \\"Son of a Plunder\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Ok, not gonna cover the album here, if you're reading this you know it by heart. Since there is no CD/DVD, DualDisc, SA-CD, or DVD-A release of ten thousand fists, then this is the coolest way to buy the album. Although the only addidion is lots of artwork, and an instert with info on more disturbed stuff to buy, I would say that this is a worthy purchase if you can find it for under $25,(Best Buy for $22.99) because the artwork dispursed throught the booklet is printed on a compination of velum and photo stock, so pages kinda merge together in an evanescent vision, a very cool way to read the lyrics and dedications. If there had been an added track or two, a dvd, or even just an enhansed CD this would habe been a perfect five. So now Disturbed ones, go out and purchase! purchase! Embrace your Avarice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still sick","review":"I just picked up a copy of the album to day, and all I can say is it is another great album from Disturbed, I can't see why people don't like to see bands redefine there sound over time to something they feel is more acceptable to the fans and what they believe they should hear coming from a band that wants the fans to stay with them in the end.Enough complaining about people, on to the cd. It is great, I like every track on it, I am a big Disturbed fan, and have been following Disturbed since I picked up my first copy of Down With The Sickness, Believe was a good follow up, and now Ten Thousand Fists is a great turn for the band musically, and David lyrically. The entire album shows how well they have grown and adapted technically, and through fuzz leaving the band. When the time comes for Disturbed to release their fourth album, hopefully they will have a permanent bassist, and release another great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible....","review":"Disturbed backs up their first 2 albums with an amazing compilation of Ten Thousand Fists. This album leans more toward a melodic/singer side of David and Dan/Mike as apposed to The Sickness.This album has the greatest opening song on any album I have ever heard. Ten Thousand Fists opens up for the rest of the amazing album. I highly recommend this CD for any metal library. If this disturbs you, then walk away...you will remember the night you were struck by the sight of.......... TEN THOUSAND FISTS IN THE AIR!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2005!","review":"Ever since I bought this cd, I can't stop listening to it!

I highly recommend it!Best songs:10,000 Fists, Guarded, Defy, Stricken, Land of Confusion, Pain Redefined"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Same","review":"This is a good album and has more energy, memorable choruses and consistancy than it's predecessor, Believe (which is ultimately equally good), unfortuantely every song on this thing sounds the same - more than usual. The songwriting in terms of hooks might be stronger, but My God, the guitar player must be stinking bored to play the same note on the same string year after year. Good silly catchy Nu metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as good as the previous 2...","review":"Disturbed's last two albums both demonstrated more musical range and sincere ability. Granted, this album may be considered a better real metal album, it is certainly lacking in diversity. To begin with, 8 or 9 of the songs sound very similar to one another.Also, there are only 2 or 3 really good rock tracks on here; in their prior albums, I would occasionally listen from start to finish but with this cd, there is no chance of that.If you are somehow new to disturbed, dont be tricked by this lame offering, go pick up believe and the sickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"stricken with greatness","review":"this is the best disturbed cd i have ever heard, this band seems to get more talented with every record.

While many where in favorite of their debut \\"The Sickness\\", & some what a mix reaction of \\"Believe\\". This album has everything that everyones gunning for. Some good singles like \\"Just Stop\\", \\"Stricken\\", \\"Guarded\\", & The new single off of Genesis \\"Land Of Confusion\\", theres nothing much better than to expect whats coming to this. I must say, Disturbed became popular so fast, they've just keep getting better than ever. I'm looking foward for a next album from Disturbed with their return of explicit lyrics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"This is my second Disturbed album and I have reached the conclusion that they're just not that good of a band. All the songs sound pretty much the same and there's nothing really appealing about any of them--not the riffs, hooks, melodies, nothing. TTF is a collection of one moderately competent (but dull) song after another. Maybe they need to fire their guitar player(s) and bring in someone with a little more creative energy. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish there was a zero stars option....","review":"How long can you uneducated, angsty, teenybopper, morons continue to listen to garbage like this. The only genius in this music is that they've managed to fool you idiots for so long into thinking that each song they produce is actually new.

You all need to be beat upside the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Shut up and sing\\"","review":"I have to say that I think this is a great sounding CD, however, I could do without the anti-war bias. I know many people won't agree, it doesn't matter, this is my review. I am tired of hollywood, the media, and also musicians, harping on what they think our foreign policy should be. Fall in with the appeasers if you want, but keep your opinions to yourself. Had I'd known this about this release I wouldn't have purchased it. I'd rather be a safe hawk than a dead dove.

Until then, I smell sell-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stricken","review":"This album may not be their best at all, but the singles of this album are excellent, especially their lead single \\"Stricken\\", it's my favorite song of them.As \\"K.

Damned rappers you don't have a place near to hard rock & metal music.I'm really sick with some \\"artists\\", like 50 Cent or Kanye West, which in their first week of sales they make extraordinary debuts and the next week they slight down like an album that never sold more than 50,000 cds in a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbed 10 Thousand fists","review":"I have been a fan of Disturbed since the beginning. I own all their cd's and have even met them in person. They are a great metal band. The Sickness is still my favorite cd out of the 3 but this cd doesnt disappoint me in the least. If you are a Disturbed fan then you should love this cd.This cd is different to the fact that Dan Donegon ads some solos to some of the songs and I think it sounds great. He hits the solo in Stricken note for note live. Trust me I was there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"Personally, I love this album. It has a nice hard edge, good lyrics, and I was excited about the remake of \\"Land of Confusion\\" since I loved the original by Genesis. It is not as good but it is nice to hear Disturbed's take on a classic. That said, the album falls down in really one area alone and that is that the songs sound too much alike, with only around 3 songs having a real distinkly different sound to them. That is the biggest holdup of this album. It is still a great album and if you like old disturbed, you most likely will like this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Album","review":"I first discovered Disturbed while playing Guitar Hero 3. The song was \\"Stricken\\". After listening to this whole album, my favorite song is still \\"Stricken\\" - kick ass song!

Very glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of their first two albums","review":"This album definitely has the raw aggression from \\"The Sickness\\" mixed with the melodic vocals from \\"Believe\\". Dan Donegan told everyone to expect solos on their next album, and he did a great job of sprinkling them in when needed. The two singles \\"Guarded\\" and \\"Stricken\\" are great choices for what people would expect from a new disturbed album. However the songs that I believe really shine on the album are \\"Deify\\", \\"Sons of Plunder\\", and my favorite \\"Ten Thousand Fists\\". These tracks really bring out some of the best examples of songwriting in the hard rock genre.Overall I would recommend to anybody who likes hard rock, get this album! You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Thousand Fists, THE Rock album of 2005.","review":"When Disturbed released their first album \\"The Sickness\\" in 2000, Didn't think it would be possible for them to get any better. Then in 2002, They blew my mind again with Believe, a more melodic album. Here in 2005, with Ten Thousand Fists, they have done it again. Easily the best Rock album of 2005. No filler tracks, every song rocks with the power of Ten Thousand Fists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better with every album","review":"Disturbed is proven that they are getting better with every album. This really shows a growth of the band, with more sophisticated music, and sounding less and less like Nu-Metal, and more like a solid rock band. This is a very good effort, but I think that fans that liked the Sickness (which I thought was horrid) might not like this one as much. I also think that they are writing better music with the intent to play what they want, and not to get top 40 airplay....I believe the first effort was aimed at pop rock radio, and thats why it went 3xplatnium. The second album only went platnium, but didnt reach the sales mark of the first, thats because its more mature and much better muscially, with less FM radio crapola. This album is the best of the bunch, and I think that hard rock fans or even Metal fans with really dig this one>...ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"new american heavy metal","review":"well its about time. disturbed finally broke out of the nu metal scene and finally got the publicity they were looking for. this album right here my friends is a true metal masterpiece. maybe not mindblowing, but still pretty dang good if you ask me. every member of this band is extremely talented. david draiman has deffinately got some killer pipes, the drummer is just phenominal, dan donegan and fuzz (lol) lay down some really catchy riffwork and leads. all in all this was a great album, nothing too groundbreaking, but still wicked good enough to be considered a milestone in heavy metal today. i think if these guys keep it up, they could make it even bigger in the metal scene"},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love disturbed","review":"I have to start this admitting that Disturbed is my all-time favorite Band.

I think all three of the albums are strong and great!Ten Thousand Fists features a great array of songs...which my favorite one must be Deify...even though it may be seen as a little too political it's a great tune with an awesome meaning!!! The biggest surprise on this album was to me was \\"Stricken\\"... anybody that has ever been hurt by somebody (and I know we pretty much all have been :-) should be easily able to identify this song!Can't wait for the next Album to come out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rock amania","review":"this album was solid rock and outstanding the guitars in this album plays wicked cool this was the best album and the sickness believe wase'nt to good it was like he was preaching threw his music and thats what made the album boring but only two songs on that album that was good prayer and liberate but this album was hooooooooot.

It wasn't as good asn The Sickness, but they did do a good job and anyone who likes disturbed needs to buy it, or even if you just like to ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I'm a a bit disappointed in this album. \\"The Sickness\\" was so innovative and every song was different. 10,000 fists just sounds the same, song after song. The good news is that I've rediscovered \\"The Sickness\\" all over again and can rock out once again with a truly great album, even if it's several years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worse than the first but so much better than the last!!!!!!!","review":"First off, disturbed is the best metal group out right now, as long as they don't put out any more albums like Believe! And this album is not like Believe at all, this album rocks!! I don't think the band will ever be able to top The Sickness so in lieu of that this album is an ace!!! There is no need to go over each track and rateeach one, they are all really good though some are better than others. My two favorites are probably diefy and the title track Ten Thousand Fists. This album is similar to both of their prior albums, alot of the songs have the flow and rythem that is found in the second album, but there is alot of just thrash metal in it as well. It's is a good mix, I don't want anyone to think that it is a bad thing. Just go buy the album, if you liked the first two you'll love this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring effort.","review":"Was hoping for a return to kick arse music, but after listening several times, I find im just bored. All the songs sound the same, and none really stick out. Disturbed's first two albums were by far better than this one. Seems like they were more interested in getting out a message album (about their dislike for bush, war, etc), and less about rocking. Go back to writing about girls, it makes for better songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-metal is horrible","review":"Your typical nu-metal generic stuff.. Disturbed just isn't that good.

That shows you that this album is littered with some of their best songs. Here are my favorites:Stricken- My original favorite Disturbed song, it's still probably their best song on any CD overall, but I've listened to it so much that some of the others entertain me more now.Land of Confusion- Very good re-make, enjoy listening to it better than the Phil Collins version.Deify- Very awesome song musically, not sure about the George Bush stuff...Decadence- After starting out somewhat generic it gets really cool when they get to the chorus.Ten Thousand Fists- Good openerSons of Plunder- Good times, had fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Awesome","review":"This album is ridiculously good.

Disturbed has changed their sound a little with this album and all the of the songs are completely power-packed. Stricken is a very nice single and it has Disturbed written all over it. Guarded is also very good it has in your face sound right from the get-go. Enough said.

Oh well. sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not work at all!","review":"I decided to try these because I bought some gorgeous hand-crocheted glass bead earrings that unfortunately weigh a ton (10 grams each) and stretch my lobes to unsightly levels. My ear holes are not stretched as I usually wear very low weight diamond studs on a daily basis and rarely any costume/heavy earrings. Maybe it is because these new earrings are fish hook style and not post style, but seriously these things do not work at all and do not stick to the back of your ear lobe.

This works better than a large back as it makes the ear lobe firmer. Not only do earrings not droop but this actually make the earrings sit better on the ear. I wish I had found these years ago. I have allergies to adhesive and these do not bother me. I have given them to all my friends. A jewelry box must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought it'd be","review":"These little stickies don't lift the weight off heavy earrings that you would hope for; it's fine for light earrings where you don't need too much support, but fail to provide support for heavier earrings where support would actually be useful. I wouldn't recommend these because it's just a little piece of tape, but it might be useful if you have torn ears? I bought these as preventative care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"The Lobe Wonder patches make it possible for me to wear drop/chandelier/hoop earrings now with confidence and glam.

However, the earrings and years haven't been good to my ear lobes which have stretched.As a result, for many years, I had begun to avoid big earrings for fear of further stretching. The ear lob support patches have enabled me to begin wearing my favorite earrings again and have greatly improved the appearance of my ear lobes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for torn lobes or protecting them from tearing","review":"I have one torn lobe that restricted my earring use to those with backs. If I tried to wear the earrings that have a wire hook that goes through the hole, it would look odd because it hung much lower than the other ear. With Lobe Wonder, I can now wear any earring and they look great. I find it's also a good idea to use them for both ears if my earrings are particularly heavy. It protects them from any further damage. Great product that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"My expectations were high for this considering how many positive reveiws it has. But this is a complete rip-off! One of my ears has a slight split to it, but the main reason I wanted to get Lobe Wonder would be to alleviate some of the pressure from the weight of my heavy earrings, and to prevent future stretching. This product does not work at all, it did not make my ear look any better, and did not take the pressure off! it still sags. You are better off just cutting medical tape and placing it behind your ear because essentially these stickers are pretty similar to medical tape. But, ladies who seem to have really split ears this might work for them, but for people who don't have severe cases of a torn ear or want to prevent future splitting I say don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lobe Wonder Rip-off","review":"The Lobe Wonder Ear Repair is way too expensive.

The only thing I wish is that I had bough a bigger box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lobe Wonder support patches","review":"I purchased these fo my wife. Her easr lobes are very elongated, and having a surgeon repair them is too expensive at this time. Because they are so severly damaged, she actually must use one on front and back of each earlobe.

The movie recorded on the DVD is a very poor quality copy of \\"Death Force\\" (1978) which was later retitled \\"Fighting Mad\\" (apparently for TV release).After I bought the movie, Amazon appears to have changed the listing to reflect the correct movie, but the quality is still that of a DVD-R copy of a VHS tape, so if you are looking for \\"Death Force\\" aka \\"Fighting Mad,\\" don't buy this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Had more about meat than I cared to know. but contains information to produce authentic Indian meals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Bad","review":"What an abject waste this dvd is.

The patterns are cute, but the first hat I knit ended up too wide and too long, despite a carefully knit and measured gauge. The second hat contained lines of directions which might as well have been in Greek (it took my advanced-knitter daughter and I several hours of experimenting to figure out how to make one minor feature of the pattern work), and several steps that were completely incorrect. Don't buy this book unless you have the time and energy to decipher nearly unintelligible instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For New Knitters!","review":"This book is adorable and many of the patterns are also really cute. My issue with this book is that I thought the patterns were geared for beginners. I have knitted numerous scarves and about 10 hats (mostly on circular needles) but had trouble following the patterns in this book. Once you've really gotten the hang of knitting, I imagine that the book will be great...For what it's worth, I plan to hang on to the book until after I have gained more knitting experience. I just wanted to warn beginning knitters that you might want to consider starting with another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knit Hats!","review":"_Knit Hats!_ is a very eye-catching book: it is bound between a sturdy hat-shaped cover. Inside, there are fifteen cute and fun projects. There is a lot of circular needle work included in this book, so it is helpful to have a good grasp on that before you start any of these designs. There are different designs that are geared towards beginners (a headband, and easy hat designs) and others that an intermediate or advanced knitter could settle in with. Everyone will appreciate the easy-to-understand instructions, and the full-length color illustrations.A fun and special addition to any knitting library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Money","review":"I thought the patterns in this book were hideous. It contained absolutely nothing that I would wear or would want to knit for anyone else. There wasn't a single hat that caught my eye. I think this was a complete waste of my money. I would recommend Cathy Carron's Hip Knits Hat, a book that I absolutely loved. I also wish Nicky Epsteins' hat book was still in print (or that she would release another). As far as this book goes, unless you are planning on knitting for a very young kid who might be able to pull off one of these awful patterns (small kids can be charming that way), pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"hank unvarnished","review":"this is a comprehensive and unflinching account of the life of one of our truly seminal singer/songwriters.a very great deal of research went into this, the density of which is sometimes daunting, but always rewarding.but the work is not a treatise, and it's as gut wrenching as it is thought provoking. i found myself thinking about the nature of destiny and the nature of enduring greatness, as embodied in the songs of this flawed and conflicted man. i read it in two days and it will stay with me in one way or another for the rest of my life. as will hank's music. 4 stars if you've never heard of hank williams, 5 if you have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hank Williams","review":"Very good book.

Holding the L button enables you to lock your aim in one direction, I was dumbfounded when I made this discovery after all these years of knowing the game, then BOOM! Suddenly I'm that much better and had finally beaten the game. I'd say if you're a shoot-em-up kind of guy (gal?) then this will be your ticket home. Big robots, mechs, tanks, shuttle crafts, explosions, etc. The graphics are nice and colorful, the music is incredible, and the game gets better each time you return to face that long-awaited foe you had trouble getting past last time you were cruising through the game. A Konami classic that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it from an Al Green fan - stay away from his 80's stuff","review":"Not that you would buy this, but just thought i'd warn you to stay away from it, should you see it second hand for a dollar and think that might a good use of a dollar.This CD is 90% of the rubbish Green produced in the 80's.

I kept waiting for it to get good but it never did. The hero was selfish and pretty horrible. The female main character was supposed to be strong and independent when the book started but she came across as pathetic and just sad. There were so many unanswered questions with secondary characters also. Like Daniel, it always appeared there was something up with him and it was eluded to several times but never really discussed. Sometimes he was a fortune hunter, sometimes he was jealous and jaded, and sometimes he was a friend to Arlie, it was just off. I don't expect story quality or in depth character development in these types of books but I expect there to be some consistency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Desires","review":"Loved this book. From the start I was captured by the story of the innocent girl sent to live with the sinful rake who was to be her guardian. I read it in one sitting. You just have to find out what happens between Dominic and Arlie, who will give into their powerful attraction first. Hot, steamy, and sexy, Julia Templeton I feel is at her best in this one if you want a hot romantic read. It does not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same book?","review":"Having bought and read this book, I wonder if my copy does not belong to some alternative reality. The previous reviewers have commented on historical aspects of the story and character developement. Well, the authors knowledge of english social history at the time (1810) is so bad as to be non-existant. For a start a single man would have instantly employed a chaperone when acquiring a female ward of marriagable age, and once an unmarried woman became a mistress she would not have been received in society, she certainly would not have become friends with a Peeress. On a plus point the book did make me laugh though that was probaly not the reaction looked for. If you want fluff, sort of Barbara Cartland with sex, this is for you, if you want history read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Collection","review":"I bought this for my daughter and this is a real steal. You get twelve stories from the Little Golden Book collection. The best ones are the oldie but goodies like \\"I Can Fly\\", \\"The Color Kittens\\" and \\"The Wonderful House\\".

Not thin/flimsy at all. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful not-so-little golden book","review":"I originally expected this collection to come just a series of regular golden books, but i was pleasantly surprised to find it as a single higher quality book with golden edged glossy pages.

By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols......I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD....\\"Obviously there is nothing wrong with killing children for the sins of their parents yet christians find abortion to be an abominable?No doubt 150 years ago Koukl and Beckwith would have been providing an ardent theological defence of slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is relative","review":"Believe it or not, everything is relative.

Halfway through, it's painfully obvious that relativism is idiotic and self-contradictory... but it's still good reading. It's also impactful to read how relativism proponents respond to the authors' arguments.

I am completely addicted to the characters, the plot lines and the quirkiness of the whole show. HOWEVER!!!!! The quality of the dvds is very bad.

Now that I am finally ready to watch the 2nd season I have discovered that this set has even more problems. Buy this and watch it right away so that you can return it to Amazon if you discover defects...or even better buy it somewhere where you can return it more easily. Shame on you Amazon for selling 2nd quality dvds...repeatedly. I mentioned the problem in a previous review..so I hope someone is noticing.

Great actors, top-quality script writing, and excellent character development with stories always brimming over with humor, suspense, romance, drama, and sci-fi enough to keep us all entertained as well as challenged. My husband usually figures the outcome of most movies, and loses interest half-way through. But Eureka has pleasantly surprised him, and he's hooked, too. Finally!

This is completely unacceptable. I highly recommend that you skip the DVD's and buy the digital episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD packaging EVER!!","review":"I'm not going to comment on the quality of the show. I haven't watched the 2nd season yet, but the first was an easy 4 stars. This DVD set features \\"eco-friendly\\" packaging, which is fine in it's own right. But the packaging severely damages the discs. The 2nd disc in my set was already delaminated upon first opening. In short, the spindles do not allow you to remove the disc without bending the disc severely. They also grip the discs way too tight, which I believe accounts for the delamination (bending the discs also accelerates delamination). If you look through my reviews you'll notice a couple of other reviews commenting on poor DVD packaging, but this set is BY FAR THE WORST!! If you are a DVD collector I assume you're educated in proper DVD care and storage...if you're not a DVD collecting nerd like me, then you may not know the effects of such horrendous packaging. Take it from me, DO NOT BUY THIS. Rent or download it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"A definite must see for any sci-fi fan.

Look no further. Eureka is fun, fast paced and clever. You fall in love with all the characters, even those you initially thought weren't so important. And watching Sheriff Carter figure out how to save all those egg-heads is fabulous.Now, let's be serious. A town of braniacs isn't going to be as attractive as the people you'll find in Eureka, but come on! This is TV, guys! If they weren't good-looking people, you'd just put on the cookie cutter, boring, done to death network show and not blowing your mind!So really...

Since the whole theme of the show is supposedly centered on science, it would be nice if their version of it made any kind of sense at all. Instead, they seem to reach into the air and pull out a few scientific catch phrases, tie a bow around them, and call it science fiction. For example, in one episode, a scientist, attempting to develop a cell regeneration technology, is accidentally zapped with particles from an alien(?) artifact, which causes gene mutations to run rampant, allowing his brain to control his healing processes (coincidentally making it LOOK like he HAD developed cellular regeneration) and eventually enabling him to perform acts of telekinesis. Huh?I give it two stars for appealing characters, decent acting, and nice sets. But if you have any scientific bent at all, this series is not for you. It will only annoy you (as it has me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Season Two","review":"Unfortunately, the second DVD in this package was defective and would not play.

I mean one level,you have 100 records(which by the way are weapons in the game), the next you have 50 and the next you have zero. You have no control of how many of them can you keep. The game play in hard at best. On some levels, you have more or less time then on other levels at random.

I keep a wrench in my kitchen so I can always boil a batch of water, calibrate it, and then actually measure what I need to. But that is a huge pain and a waste of energy.

For measurements in \\"thin\\" meats, like fish, poultry or even a thin hamburger or steak, well, it always registers less than you would expect. Example: a quarter pound hamburger. Insert it vertically into the burger, the temperature doesn't hit 165. But insert length wise so that a larger portion of the rod is immersed in the food, and suddenly, you'll find you may have overcooked that burger. Maybe it's 165, or even 180. You can prove my point by doing this yourself. Stick the rod into the thickness of two hamburgers, and you realize you've cooked them enough. Try it with one, and you'll cook it for another 5 or 6 minutes; really way too much.

The final set of exercises include a number of traditional prayer methods - the Benedictine method, the Jesus prayer associated with the Orthodox, the Thousand Names of God, Gospel Sentences similar to lectio divina etc.This book works better as a source book for retreat leaders or spiritual directors in that it is disruptive to prayer/awareness/contemplation to break to refer to the instructions.

For example Sticky and Epoxy Eyes. I understand the concept of eye contact, but staring at someone while others are talking and interacting is intrusive and uncomfortable not intelligent!

I used it a few times and it worked fine, and then I went to use it one day and it would only display \\"HI\\". Oddly I bought this to replace the same model that I had used for years which also stopped working with the same \\"HI\\" error, but because it lasted so long I stayed with the brand, but the second one was clearly of lesser quality and didn't last very long at all.

One of the probe cords came out of the package in 10 pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some annoying features","review":"First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm. However, there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm. Good for one burned roast. Granted, a mistake you will only make once.Second, when the timer gets to zero, the alarm sounds, and the timer switches to an elapsed timer. A very nice feature. However, there is no way to shut off the alarm without stopping the timer. It will eventually shut off after one ear-splitting minute.Otherwise, it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Model is Defective","review":"New Model has following problems.1. Times will not key in consecutively. If you press and hold down the key for your minutes, you will have to punch that key for EACH minute. Older models allow minutes to be entered with one press of the button.2. The probe did NOT work and would shoot up and down by ten to 15 degrees.3. Timer blinks and makes inappropriate noises???4. This is a MUCH POORER product than earlier models.5. AND OF COURSE IT IS MADE IN CHINA.6. Company rep was very helpful but when you have a small business and this product was crucial, it is wrecking my business.Probably won't buy again from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor quality","review":"This is my second digital timer/thermometer. The first was a Ploder and the probe died after a couple of years. This product arrived with a broken button, so I can't adjust the timer or temperature. I'm admittedly too lazy to return it, so I'll use it as a digital thermometer without the alarm or timer. Reading the other reviews on Amazon for both this product and the Ploder begs the question: why doesn't someone make a quality digital thermometer/timer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"thermoworks an oven probe that could","review":"I have gone through a dozen probes.

But it worked well and was easy to read -- until it broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy - broken after one year","review":"I put this on my wishlist after my wife dropped my Pyrex model into the soup; after it dried out, it would still function as a timer, but the temperature gauge didn't measure accurately.I was hoping this one would be a good replacement, and it works, but there are a couple of things I don't like about it:* Stiff buttons - especially the power switch. I can't turn it on one handed.* Floppy display - The display will not stay standing all the way up unless you push it forward until just before it feels like it's going to break. This makes it hard to use when placed on the range hood (a logical place to keep it out of the way and still within arm's reach).Other than that, it's okay.*UPDATE*: This timer is now officially broken, after less than one year. The timer button no longer works. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workhorse","review":"I haven't used the probe enough to notice any failures with that---probably only ten uses, so far--but I love, love, love this timer, in general! I've had the same one for many years (could it be ten???) and it never fails us. The beep is loud and insistent (you can't miss it...in fact, your family members may take to yelling \\"BEEPER!\\" at each other, in an urgent effort at quelling the sound. Whoever is closest runs to the kitchen) and I rarely have to replace the battery.It's a deal for what it does, too. I've never burned anything due to forgetfulness and inattention, since buying this timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Until It Stops working","review":"I picked one of these up last Thanksgiving for the turkey and it worked wonderfully. It responded so fast that it I was able to use it almost like I would an instant read. And, unlike the Polder probe thermometers, there is an on-off switch you can use on this unit.The bad news is that while it still works wonderfully as a probe thermometer, it is useless as a timer because it no longer can make any sounds. I use it solely as a back-up to my new Polder at this point, using it when I'm making two roasts at once or need to monitor two temperatures separately (such as white and dark meat of fowl).If you don't plan to use it too often or only need it for the big holiday meals, it's worth saving a few bucks and choosing the Taylor. However, if you have need of a high-quality probe thermometer for long-term use, go with a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gadget for the BBQ","review":"One of our favourite BBQ meals is a roast of Canadian Bacon slow cooked to perfection.

Now I'm surfing looking for a replacement sensor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Taylor Replace Broken Probes?","review":"Sounds like a lot of people who bought this have the same problem with the probe going bad. Mine went bad after the second use. Is Taylor replacing bad probes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for outdoor use","review":"I purchased three of these units, fully expecting them to be less then perfect and I was not disappointed. For the money they should be just fine for any low temp (less then 350f) indoor use. I had to use them to monitor two smokers and the meat. I plugged them in and got them setup in the early morning and all was going well until the sun came out. With the bright sun it was impossible to read. It just looked like all the LCD segments were lit. Nothing buy 8's. Then as the sun got higher and hotter the screens when completely black. Not recommended for any outdoor use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for a disposable thermometer","review":"Using a corded thermometer is a great idea. Put it in your food while it cooks and everything is perfectly done. The only problem is that the trutemp is a disposable thermometer. By the time you use it 4 or 5 times, it will die on you. That means 20% to 25% of the dishes you cook will end up flying blind. If it were only an expensive thermometer it would be annoying, but ruining your dinner makes it unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"heat treating oven thermometer","review":"I use this thermometer in a self constructed heat treating oven to temper bamboo fly rods.

Or maybe they just don't consider my business that important."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one has it all....","review":"A long (oven proof cord to the sensor unit, separate controls for time and temperature roasting/baking, automatic shut-off (if you forget) and a pleasant (but insistant) time/temp alarm. I paid the low Amazon price of $16.95. At the Friday sale price, I think it is a steal and am buying two more as 'stocking stuffers' for next Christmas.My only small complaint is that the probe (which, contrary to what another reviewer stated, does NOT carry unwanted heat to the center of the item being cooked) is a little long and awkward to use if you are roasting a small (1-2 lb.) cut of meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Thermometer is HOT!","review":"I really like this thermometer/timer because you can set it to a specific temperature and your roasts come out perfect!

I just want to emphasize that the probe and the entire unit can last. Regular use with heat over 350 has not killed mine but I don't leave it inside the food in the oven more than about five minutes. It looks like a remote sensor which should survive all eight hours of the pulled pork cookoff giving you a second by second account of the progress. Judging by the other reviews, it won't. When I want to check a temperature, I open the oven door, stab the sensor in, and close the door again, then read the temperature in a few minutes and take it back out. If the probe ever fails, I'll be buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"In theory this should work wonderfully ....","review":"I have one of these thermometers. They should theoretically work well, and mine did for a brief amount of time. This was nice because it would do candy, meat, chocolate and more. Well after about six months of heavy use its primary function now is a timer. Which isn't exactly useful since the stove comes with one. This has an attractive price, and is much cheaper than Pampered Chef's very similar one, but it just doesn't last for long with heavy use. This might be the ideal purchase if you aren't going to use this too often. I seriously doubt it will outlive the battery you place inside of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taylor Digital model 1470","review":"Bought this to get accurate measurements of hot liquids and foods. Has a lot of potentially useful features like countdown timer and target temperature setting and even magnets to mount of the stove if required. However, the main purpose of this is to display the temp, and that it does not do accurately enough.My unit is off by 4*F, on the low side. A good and easy test is to measure boiling water - it should read 212*F. This one just made it to 208*. As well, the unit could use a little quicker update times. My Pyrex digital is very accurate showing 212* in boiling water and makes updates much more often.I sent an email to Taylor customer service. Their reply is that it is within their spec. A warning: their tolerance is +/-11*F in the 158* to 320* range.

I bought 2 new Taylor thermometers, with silicone sheaths, in 2010 as backup and when my original died this year I tried one and then the other with only frustration. I replaced the batteries thinking that was the problem but that was not it. Neither one has worked well or consistently out of the box and the second gives only an 888 across the board display.

I've tried removing the batteries, resetting it in the back and trying to find so me way to calibrate by putting it in ice water. Nothing helps.

I have used it several times in my smoker, grill and oven. But as a prime member I ordered the unit a full 5 days before I needed it and it took 7 to get here. Amazon made good on it.Update 3/26/2012Well this unit has died. 3 weeks ago using the probe in a pork roast in the smoker it gave a reading 40 degrees to low and caused me to over cook the roast. OK so maybe the batteries are weak. Changed the batteries and then yesterday it caused me to over cook a Bottom Round beef roast in the oven and again by 40 degrees. So being the trouble shooter I am I stuck another probe in the meat and got a 186 degree temp vs 146 degree from this Taylor unit.

Having depended on it to work, needless to say the ham was overcooked. To top that off, my aunt stepped on the cord and it pulled away from the end of the probe.

I tried replacing the batteries, \\"power cycling\\", holding down the reset button, and nothing will jar it out of the \\"888\\" mode.

I would warn against this for brewing applications. I thought it would be good for mashtun and lauter tun temperature monitoring, but it did not work out. After being submerged once in the mash, the temperature readings were all way off and I found myself doing too much math to know what the real temperature was. Wanted something quick and easy, and this was not it.Might work better in basic cooking applications though, but couldn't say. A thermometer that you can't get wet is pretty useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great item, but defective","review":"This thermometer worked awesomely for about 6 months (used about once per month).

I've had reasonably good luck with previous digital meat thermometers, but this Taylor model broke the first time I used it. It reads the meat temperature, but it's off by at least 70 degrees and doesn't track evenly, so you can't even use a temperature offset to measure the meat temperature. The timer part works fine, but that's about it. I ended up buying a Rosle digital thermometer and it works great. You can't leave it in the meat while it's in the oven, which was the desired appeal of the Taylor, but it is a well-made digital thermometer and I recommend it highly. Stay away from the Taylor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"You get what you pay for, I guess.

I was able to read the temp withoutopening the smoker. The tenderloin came out near perfect, however I wouldprobably remove it a bit earlier next time. My only concern is how robustthe cable to the probe will be as it is rubber or plastic and subject to the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had 3 - all failed","review":"I've had three of these, and now own none. The first became erratic and untrustworthy; I complained to the manufacturer and they replaced it. The second worked for a while, then it, too, failed. Of course, it failed in the middle of a complex dinner when I was depending on the thermometer for an accurate reading. After several years, thinking that the technology might have improved, I bought a third. It lasted for two months, during which I used it about three times, then it failed. I returned it for credit.It seems like a good idea, and is useful when it works.

One is too far down to see, the other two far up.That's not the real issue though.I used this on my propane grill (which was why I bought it) and it burned through the probe wire in a matter of minutes.

Lately the temperature has been jumping around: 250 degrees, then 310, then 180, all in in the space of a few seconds, so I assume the probe has malfunctioned. In the end I'd say that I got my money's worth since it lasted a year and I used it and the timer at almost every meal. But I'm going to look for better quality for my next purchase. The only question is, is there anything better made out there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little unit...","review":"I was impressed by the ease with which it could be mounted (the thermo unit) outside of the oven itself. It took me a little while to find a \\"spot\\" on my oven door where the magnetic base would attach without pulling on the probe and feed line, but I found one.The numebers are easy to read at a slight distance, the timer and temp alarm are easy to hear, and all in all a superb little unit. No more poking a hole in my tin-foil tent so the old thermometer can stick out of the turkey and NOT be read without pulling the bird out.Why anyone would complain about the unit melting is beyond me, the instructions and even the pictograph of the thing show the unit OUTSIDE of the oven. Read your general instructions people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 month Review","review":"This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one.It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it worked","review":"From the other reviews, I guess I was lucky to get 6 months out of my probe before it broke. Taylor will send me one free replacement -- in 2 months. While the remote feature is nice, most of the time I just need an instant read thermometer, so I'm going to get one of the digital instant read stick thermometers that Cook's Illustrated recommends.

Then when I went to use it again, even thought I hadn't started cooking anything yet, hadn't even put it in the oven (I was just setting the target temperature), it said the temperature was over 200 degrees, and then just said \\"high.\\" That was it. I can't use it anymore and will have to buy a new one.

I use it for everything from baking bread to deep frying french fries. It's a sturdy tool provided that you remember two things:1) The body of the thermometer is not heat or water proof, so be careful where you stick it.2) The probe is not water proof, so be careful not to submerge it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality device - don't buy","review":"I bought two of these and one didn't work out of the box. Not only didn't the unit register any temperature, but the probe didn't work either (I tried in the other unit that worked)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probes are flaky","review":"I really loved the accuracy and convenience and price of this unit, but I cannot recommend it since the probes last such a short time. I have owned mine for about a year, but I only use it for roasts and turkeys, so it's only been used about 6 times. Now the cord has come out of the probe (in spite of gentle use) and I cannot locate a replacement. Silly to have to replace the entire unit.

But, I'm sure it will work just fine. Considering when I turned it on it read 72 degrees in seconds (which is what I keep my home thermostat on)So, I don't think it will have any problems reading the temperature correctly. But,What I was disappointed about was my old thermometer had a place to wrap the cord around. Though the old on did not have a timer. I suppose I could have shopped around more. But, It will probably stay in drawer until next thanksgiving anyway. It does look nice and I love how it the display tilts."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"It is our second one.

This simple little gadget makes me smile everytime I use it because it is just so easy to set and walk away from without a worry. I do kind of wish you could set the timer and the thermostat at the same time but on the other hand it may not be as easy to use if this was the case either.Durability is very important to me too so I want to be clear I have only used a dozen or so times but I have no reason to think it will not be at this point. I am most concerned about the probe based on other reviews but so far it has worked perfectly even in hotter then 350 oven. The part you stick into the meat is kind of long but I have found ways to make it work without too much trouble so far.If the probe fails me I will write a follow up review but for now I just can't give it less then four out of five stars if for no other reason then how perfect the user interface is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone Prime rib","review":"I purchased this thermometer with the hopes of a perfect medium prime rib. With all the special features, I thought this would be perfect for our dinner. Unfortunately, the internal temp was wrong. The thermometer read 100 degrees farenheit. We decided to recheck it in another area of the roast, the temp read 148, so we removed the prime rib to what I thought was medium well to well. I guess this thermometer gives you a general idea of the temp but this was after we played around with the probe a bit.

It becomes tiresome to get things new that are poorly made and have to spend the shipping to return them if you want a replacement. Given that it didn't work on arrival, I'm not crazy about getting a replacement. I just have to hope it will work better. There should be a law that requires the manufacturer to pay for the return.

I thought the probe had gone bad but decided to go with this lower priced therm/timer as a replacement. It worked okay for a few months. The default temperature was set at 122 degrees and would always beep like crazy when I turned it on. We started using the timer as a \\"time-out\\" timer but this feature only lasted for a couple weeks (used about once a day) and then the buttons to set the timer and start/stop quit working.

As I read it I took over 80 pages of notes, so provocative and inciting are his thoughts. His insights on the imagination and aesthetics is worth the price of the volume. But more importantly, Hillman lifts soul out of the interiority of the individual and places it in the textural life of the cityscape.

There are a few descriptions of the early stages of the construction and a wonderful description of the launch, but not much in between. Sanders spends a third of the book describing the Navy crew and some collateral issues that may have been intersting, but not really about building a ship. I wonder if any of my co-reviewers remember any discussion about installing the machinery or putting on the propellers. To be brief, I think the book lacks focus. According to the jacket, this is the author's first work. He has edited books previously.

There's a simplicity to the voice, and also a sliver of ice running through it. This is not a frothy romp through a 20-something's giggly misadventures. It's a slyly devastating book of the very real anxiety and fear, expectation and pain of becoming an adult. No one gets out of this book unscathed, least of all Strawberry herself.This is an unvarnished look at a young woman's missteps, small successes, disappointing failures.

Her anecdotes were long-winded and most could (should?) have been trimmed extensively.

I myself have struggled with my career aspirations and with trying to mesh reality with my dream of what I thought adulthood would be like, so I had high hopes for this book. I found the first few chapters engaging and compelling and then I began to get . . . bored. The author teases you with the hope of upcoming revelations but then never gets around to making any sort of point. The whole book is rambling and disjointed and lacks any sort of a central theme. I also feel like the author contradicts herself by gladly embracing that which she earlier purports to reject (i.e., a glossy magazine lifestyle). Also (and I know this is a petty point, but I can't help it) her tendency to begin sentences with \\"For\\" (as a synonym for \\"Because\\") drove me absolutely CRAZY! It sounds so artificial and stilted! Overall, a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I normally don't write reviews but just had to when I saw all the negative feedback below. As a 25-year-old, single New Yorker working in the publishing world - I thought this book was dead on with my experiences, fears, thoughts and everything else going on in my life. I don't think the author was trying to make people feel sorry for her (as one reviewer suggested) but rather being very honest about the thoughts in her head. I thought the author described perfectly how the choices and freedom that women have today in terms of career can sometimes be a curse instead of a blessing.

After a while, I just was tired of hearing about her exploits with this person, or that boy, or this friend. The book felt to me like the kind of conversations you have with your friends after a couple of beers: You think that you are being quite deep and insightful, and sometimes you are, but more often you are talking just to hear the sound of your own voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great disappointment","review":"This book is a never-ending flowery journal entry. As a woman of 25, I understand much of what Saroyan is trying to get across. The pressures a woman in her 20s encounters come across well. Unfortunately, one has to wade through a poorly written, self-involved tribute to a young woman's own inside jokes and frequently revolving groups of friends. There are many other books out there that accomplish this book's aim without making the reader suffer so much. Saroyan has promise, but this book does not fulfill it. This is a book written for a good friend, who will sit through your rambling until you get to a point because they love you. I, however, am not interested in the souvenirs Saroyan bought at Mt.

With each separate hormone (including estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, human growth hormone), he lists the signs of a deficiency and the signs of excess, explains what forms the hormone comes in, how to take it and where to get it. He also tells why natural hormones are vital and synthetics are dangerous.

The side-effects were horrible (severe headaches, rashes, hives, and depression.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent resource book about hormones","review":"This book was recommended by my longevity physician, and I can understand why. It is a great guide to anyone using or considering natural hormone replacement therapy (which is a gift from God and Nature by the way...) This publication is not just about menopause, it is about female (and male) hormones across the lifespan. It helps you to self regulate by learning your own symptoms. And at these prices, everyone should have a copy in the family medical library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Information, Solid Advice!","review":"I am 41, already have osteoporosis, and was in desperate need of some reliable information on hormone therapy. I read this book from cover to cover like a novel. It makes hormones and their effects so much easier to understand. Now I know how to recognize deficiencies and excesses of the most important hormones. Based on Dr. Reiss's recommendations for working with a physician, I found a doctor that understands my needs, conducted thorough testing, and is prescribing exactly what I need. I bring this book with me to the doctor's office, and I refer to it regularly now. It's going to be one of the most well-used books in my home library. Thank you, Dr. Reiss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read","review":"Natural Hormone Balance for Women is one of the finest books ever written for women living with ovarian failure(menopause). It describes very clearly the benefits of replacing ovarian hormones with bio-identical hormones (exact replica's of what the body naturally produces), and the benefits to the body. Dr. Reiss' passion for creating a true ovarian hormone balance is apparent and he more than adequately justifies every point he makes. His knowledge and respect for appropriate healthcare for women is also clear. Unfortunately, he does not offer any advice on how to extend the functional life of the ovaries, only how to supplement after they have failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart decisions","review":"Women my age -- and the physicians who serve us -- need this information to make smart decisions about hormones.

But the Dr.s assumption that American women's imbalances are due to not having several children I find insulting. I think rather than menopause being easier for women who have had several pregnancies I think it more likely to be more related to diet and lifestyle. Nevertheless I was able to use his information on the several hormones (not just sexual hormones) and their interrelations to good use.

After making only a couple batches of fudge and penuche I noticed the numbers are flaking away. They are bold and large but I can see that won't make a difference if they all disappear. The steam from the boiling candy seems to soften them so they flake right off. It does have a heavy duty clip and the bulb of the thermometer is well protected but that's the only good thing I can say. It also is less accurate (water boils at 204 instead of 212 degrees on it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat little gismo","review":"This is quite a nice thermometer.

Otherwise, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Numbers came right off the scale into the candy I was making. Impossible to avoid because the scale must be submerged in order to read.

I then tried rubbing higher numbers with my thumb - numbers that had never even touched the ice cream custard - and they rub right off. I'm not impressed. Yes, just like with the others who have seen the numbers vanish, I only washed by hand.For those people who said \\"the numbers rub off, but I can still make out faint etchings in the metal, so I give it 5 stars\\", your reviews are useless.

I've noticed no disappearance of markings (something that seems to bother a lot of reviewers of lots of other fine items that I've never experienced.It's extremely accurate and couldn't be easier to use.The best part? The price!!! So what if the markings (if you really need them, scratch them onto the metal yourself) wear off for whatever reason. Go buy a new one.

I read the Caution on the package before using and did not scrub the thermometer as they recommended and just soaked it to loosen the toffee before using again. I find it hard to believe that you can wash these in the dishwasher when the paint smeared so quickly. The thermometer is worthless without the markings on it.

They really didn't care that my family ate ink in our food! Also, she told me to shake it to make the liquid in the thermometer to join together again.

Most arrived with the red alcohol temperature indicator having separated. I tried repeatedly to consolidate the liquid by placing them in a freezer followed by placing in an oven to no avail. I even tried spinning them at the end of a rope (the equivalent of placing them in a centrifuge) with no effect. The one thermometer where the fluid did not separate was used in one lab where we made peanut brittle. When the thermometer was cleaned, the numbers on the stainless steel backing came off. This purchase was a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere for a usable candy thermometer. I purchased digital ones to use in the food lab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice.","review":"The first sign of trouble was that the clip kept falling off. It fell off when I took it out of the package, and every time I picked it up. I tried to make it tighter, but it wasn't possible. It fell off in the caramel I was cooking.The next problem was that I overcooked two kinds of candy because the temperature must have been incorrect. These were the only two batches of candy I made using this thermometer. It broke while I was washing it after the second use. I was carefully handwashing it and the tip broke off. I have used a cheap glass thermometer for years and never had one break. I am now using my old cheap one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate, difficult to read","review":"I had this sitting in the drawer for months and finally pulled it out while making fudge. I cross tested with my Thermapen and the temp was significantly off. 5-10 degree it seemed.Also, the readout was hard to gauge. There's such a wide range, it's difficult read without sticking your face up to it, which of course means your face is over molten hot sugar or oil. Also, while it kind of seems like a good idea, the readout lists the candy making stages for soft/hard crack etc, but it removes numbers for the labels.I'll keep this around for frying where I'm not that concerned with the temps, but for candy making I'll stick with the Thermapen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbers disappeared","review":"I used my Taylor candy thermometer for a few years and yesterday I managed to wipe off the numbers.

Nothing worked right and I decided I just wasn't good at making candy and gave up. At that time I accidentally washed the numbers most of the way off with a soft washcloth in warm soapy water. I noticed before they were completely gone so I can still just read them. If it had worked otherwise I would give it two stars. Well, this year I've decided I really want to figure this candy thing out and I read somewhere that you should calibrate your thermometer if you're having problems. I put it in a pot of boiling water which is around 212 Deg F (just a little lower with our altitude) and this thermometer read 187 Deg F which is WAY off. No wonder my candy kept burning or breaking!

As others have said the numbers wear off quickly. Last night it apparently cracked somewhere while sitting in a pot of oil and leaked the colored alcohol into my food. I also find the clip to be poorly designed, it won't hold tight to my pots. Instead the thermometer leans at an angle into the pot with the bulb sitting almost at the very bottom. There was no way to have it vertical hugging the side of the pot. Overall it was functional while it lasted, but was always annoying to use. I've burned through a handful of their digital wired thermometers due to the wired probe failing for whatever reason. At this point I won't be wasting any more of my money on Taylor products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until I had to buy a new one","review":"This was a great deal, and it worked so well.

The Death and Return of Superman is probably one of the greatest stories ever told by DC Comics. Alongside Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and \\"Tales of the Spectre\\" I enjoyed the story. Then, they decided to make a video game for it in 1994. The fighting in the game can be very difficult. Especially when you fight Doomsday in the 2nd level. But, you are able to play as the original Superman, Steel, Superboy, the Eradicator, and the Cyborg along different levels. I reccomend this game to rabid S-man fans. 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that definitely needs improvement","review":"While this book does a good job telling you ABOUT clothes, fabrics, care, it does next to nothing when it comes to suggestions on starting a person's wardrobe, a dress scheme or plan, etc. Sure, they dedicate a chapter to those subjects, but they just end up rambling about concepts rather than some concrete suggestions.

I know enough to know I don't know much about clothes and fashion, but in the entire book there was maybe one or two things that were news to me. The rest was obvious stuff. And the no-brainers?

I paid a couple of dollars more, but that gap is still there, and it is just as big as before. Is there really another size, or is that just on the box? It's inexpensive, so there's no use making a big deal over it. Just a couple of dollars more, but they should deliver what they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old one was much much better","review":"I chose Superwide Sport Grip (by seller's picture and description).

Pressure Points is no different, showing off the bands skills once again. Heart and Soul is a classic and tracks like Make it Easy and Blazing Love shows a new side to the band. These are deep songs, and it takes a while to take them in, but it is worth the work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm not as big a fan as I thought","review":"I hadn't purchased the 'pressure points' cd or heard any songs so naturally I couldn't judge it. I came to the online reviews to get some info on a band that I enjoy. Of course I was delighted to see all the favorable statements made and felt it was time to check it out. Maybe I'm stuck on what they've done previously but this one doesn't do it for me folks. Some refer to this as progressive but I view it as commercial crap. Reggae is suppose to be reggae not Crystal Light pop. There was a review where JBB was called the best band out(matter of opinion). I do think they're very talented. More talented than this cd suggests! Maybe next time JBB. Until then I'll be listening to Groundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"JBB is up sh*t creek","review":"JBB is not the same. They lost their bassist, their keyboardist, their sound man, some of the horns. Its not the same. The JBB of old was a roots reggae revival, of new a poppy excuse. If you want to hear some white guy doing roots reggae try Groundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, moving in a new direction","review":"I've been listening to JBB since 1999 and have seen them several times in NYC. This album is what you've come to expect from JBB - serious horns and rhythms. However, what I didn't expect was the near absence of Kevin Kinsella on vocals. He formed the band in Ithaca, NY and was lead vocal on the past four albums. On Pressure Points, Elliot Martin sings 80% of the songs. This gives the album a much different feel than previous albums. Martin is a great song writer and explores material not approached by Kinsella, but his vocals are overproduced on several tracks. It almost gives these tracks an old 311 feel (not that 311 could approach JBB musically). Overall, a good album that takes JBB in a new direction. One question...why no songs by Silas? Time to Move On was hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving in the right direction","review":"Funny how a lot of people don't like change or growth. I saw JBB at The Independent the other night and picked up the new CD, after a few days of listening, I think this is one of the best JBB albums to date. Have things changed since Among Them? Sure. Are they just a great roots reggae band now? No, they are much more. Sure, if you want to here the standard reggae arrangements, maybe you are not going to get Pressure Points, but if you are looking for innovation, for forward development, look no further. They are gong on some next sh%t here and it is well worth checking out. Stand out tracks are What We Gonna Do, Blazing Love and Heart and Soul. This is not the JBB you grew up with, this is JBB grown up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forward Roots","review":"I was wondering how this album was going to be after I heard that Kevin Kinsella only had 3 songs on Pressure Points. But I have to say Elliot \\"El Ras\\" Martin, really holds court taking on the majority of the song writing. What We Gonna Do, Blazing Love and New Blood, stand out as instant classics. And the tracks that Kevin does contribute are very strong as well. Buy this album, learn the songs, and then try and catch em live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing Music","review":"I have seen JBB live a few times but this is the first album I've picked up. After hearing Blazing Love on itunes (not sure why you can't hear tracks here?) I was hooked. And now that I have given the CD a few spins, I can say that all the tracks are solid, with Blazing Love, Pressure Points and Heart and Soul being the stand outs. If you love reggae, funk, soul, or just want to hear some amazing original music, check this CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressure Points","review":"You have to be a fan of JBB or of Reggae music to purchase this CD.Even though JBB is an american band they are playing with the heart and soul of a band who is from Jamica. This is on CD that you will put in and not skip any. This is a good into CD for John Brown's Body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"The air pump seem to work despite it cheap appearance; I found the ball to be fun to use, but the ball does not support much weight. As long as you dont put too much weight on it, it may work fine. I tended to sit on it and lightly bounce up and down while watching TV or working on my computer. While doing this, it appears I put too much weight on it, the plastic stretched and my ball developed a puncture. The ball did not burst; but it did deflate rapidly. I would suggest you consider other resistance balls. One that state how much weight they support. Be aware that if you bounce on it that this effectively put more force on the ball and that the ball need to support several times you static weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Workout","review":"The ball blew up pretty easily with the pump provided.

Two hours into the cook, running at about 225 degrees, I lifted the lid to baste and picked up the thermometer to wipe the smoky residue off the face to make it easier to see whilst looking through the top vent of the smoker. I was shocked to see that the numbers on the dial come right off onto the damp towel that I was using! Not on one, but on both thermometers. I have no idea if this is normal, and I know that Taylor usually has an excellent reputation, but if this low heat causes the ink to release, how does it work on really hot grills???I may have gotten a few from a bad batch, and I have already contacted Taylor about this problem.As usual, your mileage may vary, but this was my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one use!!!","review":"I bought a Taylor just like this but is was a square oval shape but same design.

I think that the author spent to much time describing the surrounding and the situation in the beginning of the book. i liked the way she handeled all the situations, especially when they went down the waterfall . she was very resourceful and was prepared to handle anything and everything that came her way. I liked the way that the author used reality in this story to describe the trip and all of the trials and tribulations that she and her family stumbled upon. The author had a wonderful way of connecting to his readers, it was able to pluck a heartstring, she handled many situations that I could not even imagine with a certain degree of grace and poise. I thought that it was interesting that this novel was based on a true story, and that tis really happened to people.

If you are so concerned about these \\"insane crazy people\\" then get away from them. Reading a book while imagining these people seems extremely obsessive and histrionic in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE","review":"This book is a disgrace to all vampyres, it is not stated on any facts, let alone there are some. You should not write a book when you know nothing about the subject, this book should be discontiued, it is a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying writing style","review":"While this book has some good information in it, I found the writing style extremely annoying: overly simplistic and chatty. It just doesn't fit the subject matter. The examples given are fictious and soap-opera-ish. It just felt like he was talking down to his readers- another reviewer used the word, condescending- and I concur. It is a shame because the subject matter could be very helpful in one's interpersonal dealings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personality Disorders put into practice","review":"People who drain you dry- or otherwise just suck the life from you. Whatever analogy you want to use, the \\"emotional vampires\\" the author is referring to are those people with personality disorders.Each chapter discusses a \\"vampire\\" aka personality type (borderline, obsessive compulsive, narcissitic, etc-). The author reviews how to spot or identify one of these predators, how to deal with them, and how to recognize whether you yourself demonstrate a possible personality type. Equally helpful is how the reader can understand why people tend to act like this-Although most \\"vampires\\" are in reality a mix of 1 or more of these types- I found it very useful and helpful to understand why people act like this and how I can not let these type of people get to me on a daily basis.I also found it comforting that the \\"vampires\\" I interact with in my life are out there-worldwide- and that I'm not the only one dealing with these types of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacking","review":"I bought this book because I am dealing with a Histrionic co-worker. This book helped me identify what her disorder is but didn't quite help with a solution. As I have to work with this person 8 hours a day, I can't just \\"leave the relationship\\". I was hoping for a bit more guidance on dealing with her without having to look for another job."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it wasn't focused on work environments","review":"Overall, the information about these types of people is great. But the book focuses almost entirely on encountering these types in the work place, not in personal life. I deal with a histrionic cousin, who maintains her blond hair and Jaguar, while crying to me that she doesn't have enough money for food or medicine. Her non-stop need for me to take care of her has drained me. While I was able to get a lot of understanding from the chapter on histrionic vampires, I had to take the workplace solutions offered and try to tailor them to personal life. I would have liked the book better if it dealt with both personal and professional types and offered solutions for both.And I do agree with the others that he does take the vampire analogy too far. It seems to me he almost felt obligated to talk about vampires when it wasn't appropriate to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Caving!","review":"I had been neglected by my own father who was a \\"narcissist\\". I felt responsible for this and now I know it's his problem not mine. I feel so much better.A girl had been manipulating me, guess what? She was a Histrionic one! I was shocked when I saw how similar to the book she was, and how stupid I had been.Finally, I noticed I was a passive-agressive/people pleaser SOB who never confronted anyone/anything. Now I know my flaws and where to work on. No amount of prayers, or church goings (which I had infact done) would solve my problem. WE are the ones who can do something about it, as long as we have the correct tools to do so, and Emotional Vampires, without a shadow of a doubt, provides them.It's downright scary/irritating how oblivious we can be of ourselves (weaknesses), and how easily manipulated we are, when not aware of this.If you liked the concept of personality disorders you will probably dig this one: Personality Disorders in Modern Life - Theodore Millon"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grand Master of Disorder Speaks.","review":"Gee, I work with two vampire personalities but I have to tell you that this book by Bernstein has to be, by far, the finest non-technical description of personality disorders that I've ever encountered. It's for both the layman and the psychologist and, best of all, it's self-help. I can't say enough about it. It reads like deja vu for anyone who has ever suffered the attentions of self-promoting, self-worshipping, narcissistic psychopaths. His advice is sound but they're so crazy you can't always use it--yet you will feel better after reading his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity & insight for dealing with people who drive you crazy!","review":"This is a book I will never part with. I have gained so much insight into some of the impossible people I know - and a bit of insight into an issue of my own (perfectionism). The author is a genius who not only details the various kinds of \\"vampires\\", but gives very effective, practical advice on dealing with each and every variety. I think the best advice he gives for dealing with ALL vampires is \\"pay attention to actions, not words.\\" Another invaluable directive is \\"Ignore tantrums\\" (a common vampire tactic).Unless you've been living in a bubble, you will recognize at least a few people you know among the vampires described, and you will better understand what motivates them. More importantly, you'll learn how to keep them from draining you dry. If there are vampires in your life, BUY THIS BOOK!!!! It's money well spent. Possibly the best book purchase I've made - and I've made many. Many thanks and much praise to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark types can't hide in the light...","review":"Any really good book, especially a reference like this one, is truly illuminating. This book sheds light on some of the most destructive and least-understood types of people who draw the life out of you. In addition, you might see some things about yourself represented here, but it's all for the best; this kind of a book can illuminate your own personal darkness as well.Whatever you get this book for, defense or self-discovery, it will leave you well armed against all of these \\"Vampire\\" types; narcissists, obsessive-compulsives, paranoids and the like, as well as giving you a strong reference for seeing them before they sneak up on you in the dark of your own trust or naivete. This will give you a chance too, if you are already involved, by choice or accident, with many of these dysfuctional creatures of shadow.This volume is great, and in my humble opinion, can be the cross, stake and holy water in your arsenal against dark, albeit very common, forces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, sweet and to the point...identify those energy thieves and breathe easier.","review":"People are not simple and it's challenging to manuever through days of endless interactions in this every day world. This book defines behaviors and then offers checklists so that you can identify basic motivation in others. Whether others are acting unconsciously or with intention, you have the tools to identify energy-robbing behaviors so that you can react with awareness or avoid the stinkers altogether. The reading is easy, well organized and easy to understand. I love the checklists...they are not comprehensive, and we definitely need to avoid labeling others...but they allow a peek into the thought processes of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Vampires- Letting Light in with a Lighter Take on It","review":"I grinned wryly. I sighed with relief that someone understood. I cringed as I saw my own behavior occasionally. I enjoyed the story line. For once I had fun and felt a bit of hope while researching personality disorders.Emotional Vampires is written for the lay person. It's easy to read, flows smoothly, is sub-divided well, and makes sense. The reader is reminded that the chapters do not offer a diagnosis of clinical personality disorder but are a way to assess for disordered behavior and relationships that follow recognizable patterns. The checklists are hilarious and spot-on. The recommendations for survival are honest but they are not a panacea, mainly because avoidance may be the only sane response to the behaviors and attitudes of Emotional Vampires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerily accurate","review":"The tone is tongue-in-cheek, but the criteria the author lays out surprisingly spot on! For anyone who's been emotionally drained (as I've been for the past few years), you'll recognize the diagnosis immediately. What I like about the book is the author's pro-active stand in offering solutions to present problems, rather than pleading with us (as most self-help books tend to do) to empathise with the aforesaid vampire's emotional problems. Understanding their problems is one thing, allowing yourself to be trapped by those very problems is another. Worth the investment, if only to know that you're not mean or mad by wanting to get rid of these (apparently) sweet and loving creatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck - Too Cute, Too Generalized, & Too Damaging","review":"I have a problem with any writer dealing with a complicated issue who makes sweeping statements like, \\"If you do X, then you're a Y,\\" etc. People are not that simple. Life is not that black-and white.It's annoying that somebody who professes to be a professional healthcare provider would make such generalizations. It's irresponsible.This book isn't about helping others. It's an ego-stroke for the author on how \\"cute\\" a writer he is and how all-knowing he perceives himself. And the writing isn't all that \\"cute.\\" It's a forced exercise on how many times he can apply the vampire metaphor.If you want a book that will help you, don't buy this one. All you're doing is putting money in his pocket.There is far better help available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Informative Read...","review":"This is a wonderful book in particular for lay people who know nothing about personality disorders. I am a psychologist and much of it was very basic and more of a review for me, but I can see how this book would really help initially educate those dealing with difficult people who have personality disorders.

The vampire, vampire, vampire thing was carried WAY too far. There is a real need for a book on personality disorders written for the layman, but this book appears to have been written with a second grader in mind. As a matter of fact, many second graders would probably feel insulted by the condescending way the author addresses his audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had read this a year ago","review":"I would have saved myself so much misery from having fallen into a nest of narcissistic vampires.

Everybody knows people who suck the life blood out of you, who take advantage of your feelings of love or affection and make your life miserable in an attempt to feel better about themselves. Like the vast majority of self-help books this one tells you things you already know in your mind but tries to give you a kick in the butt to actually have the heart to do something about them. If you are in a situation where this is happening to you, please give this book a try. You owe it to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserably written, condescending, trite","review":"Any valuable information contained in this book is completely lost in a muddle of infuriatingly CRAP writing.

Just like a vampire, this writer can bite me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful information but makes light of a very serious issue","review":"This book has very useful information but its overall style is so flippant that it undermines its usefulness. Having been the victim of a character with personality disorders - I am of the view that it should never be joked about. That serves to undermine the very serious nature of personality disorders and their effects on others. It is very difficult for the lay-person to really know what is going on with these characters and the effects of their actions wreak havoc in the lives of normal people and are potentially life-threatening. I don't recommend this book - I think it only serves to make healthy people make room to accept personality disordered people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"For a few dollars more, you can get a better quality cable.

Did the same thing on two different monitors that worked fine (both before and after trying the Cables To Go cable) with a different VGA cable.

It's a bit of a depressing story. Not much insight into the art form itself. There are however several interesting examples of how Wrights drawings were influenced by Hiroshige prints. Mostly its a sad tale of the desperation of a toxicly inflated ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"water pressure switch with low cutout","review":"This switch has much more hysteresis (too much variation on cut in and cutout pressures - a bad thing) than the similar Square D switch. I bought it to cut power to sprinkler valves when pressure drops too low, to keep pump from cavitating. It could not be adjusted for a proper low pressure cutout (around 30 psi), with about 40 psi cut-back-in, and stay on at regulated higher pressures (up to about 60 psi). I have since made modifications with springs, weights - you name it, but can't get what I want out of it. I should have spent more money for the Square D, although my experience with them is that work is needed to make the low cutout temporary - when it cuts out, it usually requires a manual reset, which is also not what I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"light romance, no dark plot here.","review":"A widow is faced with her past as she meets up with her first love, the man who was likely to have married another way-back-before she wed---only he didn't. They marry for convenience at first. She hopes eventually it will become more. Only his agenda is more primal than the stuff of her dreams.Nice easy-reader romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsaking All Others -- Not the Best","review":"While there was nothing horribly wrong with the plot or characters, I just found it dull. Granted, there isn't alot of room for details in a short story book, so I don't grade it too harshly. The problem was that the characters were your run-of-the mill hero and heroine, their reactions were so very typical. The plot was dull and a bit cheesy, much like the dialogue. It wasn't absoloutly terrible, it's just not really worth reading. You're not really reading anything new, although the author did effectively make Saskia come out annoying. Ah well, I've read better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nes version was better!","review":"This game sucks and was not worth the plastic this turd was housed in.

I've been lucky enough to enjoy his quick wit and sharp mathematical thinking for the past couple years. This book was read as preparation for my math classes next year. It is very well-written, following a favorite teaching style of mine-simplicity and analogy. Mr. Carlson makes math easy enough to understand by connecting it to things that I already can associate. I recommend this book to students and teachers alike, especially in the Plymouth-Canton community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Movie don't play the Game","review":"this game is bad.

I listen to and purchase a lot of mixed albums but this is by far the worst mix I have ever heard- from the first title to the last, the music sounds like it is running on slow mode, it took me a few minutes to realize that this was actually the mix rather than a bad dup of the CD. I would recommend no one purchase this CD; you may get more enjoyment on the latest release of Barney (yeah the purple dinosaur). I will agree that the original was good but this \\"Screwed & Chopped\\" mix is a disaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karla Bonoff's performance","review":"I am ordering this CD particularly for the Karla Bonoff track. I've heard her version of First Noel and there is none that come close to the beauty that she brings to this standard. Her voice is heavenly. Whenever you hear Karla sing First Noel, it will calm you, relax you, and wash away anything negative and put you in a peaceful state. I'm sure the others are good too, however, Karla Bonoff's track is in my opinion worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy!","review":"I saw this CD in the store today, and was outraged.

There are no words for how truly offensive to Christians this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An appealing tour of an amazing American town.","review":"This book gives an intimate portrait of the town of Concord, Massachusetts through the seasons. Instead of presenting a collection of sterile, pristine landscapes and monuments, Kennard prefers to portray the town as a living, working place populated by citizens of all ages who are actively engaged in their community. There are generous helpings of the town's classic New England beauty and its rich history and culture, but they do not overshadow the book's essential humanity. Quotes from the more celebrated of the town's past inhabitants are mixed with quotes from present-day townspeople to give depth to the photos. By the end of the book the reader feels less like a tourist who has just sped through to check off the must-sees, and more like a visitor who's been welcomed into the heart of Concord's everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacie 1TB USB Hard Drive","review":"Hard drives either work, or they don't. This worked for about a week and a half until it failed and had to go back to the manufacturer. I am guessing that the controller failed and that the disc itself is OK. At least customer service accepted the return for repair readily, although the service telephone number that they provided wasn't working and I had to use another number to get through. I have used a bunch of other USB drives and they have all held up for years. I had read about reliability problems with these and had hoped that I would be luckier.

I lost about 300 Gb of photographic and video material when a LaCie drive failed on me.If you do video or photography, the drive will heat up since it will be accessed constantly by the computer. A drive should have more than just a heat sink -- noisy though it might be, a fan can save your drive. Or the must have a very good heat sink. LaCie doesn't not seem to measure up on this count.I would be particularly wary of a large drive in a compact enclosure.

You won't get that here. Most of the book is about how to use VBScript to write ASP code. Unfortunalety there is an error in the authors code for about every 5 lines. So if you plan to learn VBScript be prepared to use 48 hours for debugging the authors examples in addition to the 24 hours.

This book turned out to be more advanced than expected. If you are going to buy this book, make sure you know HTML, some JavaScript, basic SQL, and VBScript. Through the examples I was able to pick up the SQL and VBScript knowledge with a fair amount of effort. The thing I disliked about this book was that it stuck to the topic at hand. Several times in the book the authors said...that a certain topic was beyond the scope of the book and if you want more info look elsewhere. Another bade thing about this book was that you cannot complete examples using free downloadable software (MS Personal Web Server). On the other hand, the IIS/NT Server topics were over my head. You will learn a lot if you type in all of the sample code and try to follow along with the examples. On the downside, this book seemed to skip from topic to topic without any real transition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pages","review":"Dear Sir,I have just returned from the US of A .

The authors should pay you to read this book. With VC++ 6.0, chapter one, listing 1.1 SysAllocString(L\\"Hello, ATL!\\"); that L is a type cast to OLECHAR FAR *. The same orthgraphy is in the source code. Listing 1.2: it seems that the #include should be for Hour1Server which was created on page 6, not Day1Server. Also no idea what a Day1Server_1.c is but it is referenced later on page 53 in chapter three. Too many forward references in chapter one to concepts that they say will be explained in later chapters like five or six. This is not a stepwise refinement to learning ATL.

I purchased it with the intent of being on my way to understanding the fundamentals of ASP programming; unfortunately, like many other reviewers have pointed out, the authors could stand to enroll in a few high school level English classes. If you don't have an intermediate to advanced level of VBScript and HTML knowledge, don't buy this book! Save yourself some money and master VBScript before tackling ASP, as doing so will prove to help you immensely.

I slogged through 5-1/2 'hours' (chapters) and realized the whole book was going to skim over the main points. The chapter on gathering data from the user should have helped me; it gave a couple simple examples, but not enough information to customize to what I need.I took Active Server Pages for Dummies out from the library and, though I've never wanted to read a Dummies book, find it a lot more systematic in its approach and a much easier read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaos","review":"This book fails its purpose.

I would recommend learning VB Script first and then this book may be more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needlessly complex due to writing style and mismarketing","review":"This book is made needlessly complex by the author's writing style.

Buckley devotes 50+ pages rehashing character developments from the first books, the supposed intrigue wasn't the least bit engaging, and the only romantic tension that exists is between Ursula and Brockley. And then, the reader is only supposed to feel sorry for how guilty she feels about Fran's feelings. The title is also completely inappropriate.

Not only doesn't it have a seconds timer or a reset feature, but it has the nasty habit of starting itself while it jostles around in my briefcase.Imagine my reaction when, while passing through a security checkpoint near Ground Zero last week where they x-ray your bags before letting you pass, an alarm started going off inside my briefcase! I was practically tackled to the ground by security.I still keep it in my briefcase, but I've removed the battery for my own safety. UGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love these books!!","review":"Make you think and keep you on your toes! Extremely discriptive and well written...I have not read a Francine Rivers book that I didn't like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating trilogy by a top-notch author","review":"Francine Rivers is most well known and loved for her excellent novel, Redeeming Love, but many of us who like to think we are in the know prefer her Mark of the Lion trilogy. We follow the story of Hadassah from Jerusalem to Rome, where she is taken to be a slave in a wealthy Roman household. We watch Hadassah grow in her faith in the face of growing persecution for Christians. The books are chock full of history, fascinating characters, and wonderful plot lines. As my sister says, if she was marooned on a deserted island and only allowed to take one thing with her to read, it would be this trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can hardly put it down","review":"I think this is the crown jewel Francine Rivers has written. The story is very inspiring and also reflect a lot of the issues we're currently dealing with. Definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in reading Christian novel. Just do not read it before going to bed. You will have trouble putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read!","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down! The author takes you on a emotional journey along with the characters. Rivers expertly draws a parallel between ancient roman society and modern society. It ends in a cliffhanger, so be sure you have book two in the series. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This books are very well-written!!","review":"Those books are very, very good. I recommend anyone to read them. Rome with its morals, the destruction of Jerusalem and the defeat of the Germanic tribes. Way to go Francine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Christian Fiction Yet!","review":"This series, particularly the first book, has been life-changing and is the best written Christian fiction I've ever read! It is terrific historical fiction, and while I think women are Francine Rivers' main audience, even my husband read this series and recommends it to his male friends. The reading is not difficult, but it's a powerful story! Be warned - there is a description of the seige of Jerusalem at the beginning where a few of my friends have stopped reading, but do read on! The story continues to build, until the end where I was telling myself \\"O my gosh!!\\" over and over for hours when I finished. (Don't read the end ahead of time!) I also strongly suggest that you avoid reading the introduction for the second book that is in some later versions of the first novel! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strength through the eyes of a woman...","review":"What a series. The main character and her tribulations are just breathtaking. She believes in God and Christ and never lets go. This was the first series from Francine Rivers I've read and it's truly a work of art. She shows Hadassah as a strong woman that is not beaten down by the pressures of the Roman Empire. I could not step away from all three books once I got started. By the end of the first book I knew I had to go on because I was crying so hard. I knew when I got so envouled in the story line that it felt so close to home. AMAZING series. You don't have to be a \\"believer\\" to enjoy this series just someone that needs a book to read. I have never liked reading but I'll take a F. Rivers book any day and this has to be the best of hers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Francine Rivers is Awesome!!","review":"As a busy mother of 3, it had been a long time since I had felt enough patience and focus to sit still and read a book. First I read Atonement Child and I was so rivetted that the first time I spotted the boxed set of 3 for the Mark of the Lion series, I bought it immediately. What an epic story!!! If only someone could make a movie of the series that would do it justice. My only complaint is that the story ended... I wanted more. My next purchase will be the Lineage of Grace series and Redeeming Love. I can't wait!! Thank You Francine Rivers, keep those books coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life affecting fiction","review":"I have never experienced any characters quite like those of Francine Rivers'. When I close the cover of her books I feel as though the heros and heroines have actually passed through my life. The lessons of Hadassah and her servant's heart are ones I will never forget. This series is a must read and not limited to just women. You will wear the dirt of the Roman road, smell the salt of the sea, feel the adrenaline of the gladiators and breathe Hadassah's prayers. You will be changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above Reproach! Nothing 'fiction' about it.","review":"Francine Rivers rises above Historical-fiction with this series. This book brings the pain, joy,triumph, and fustration of the characters to the very heart of the readers, making every thought and emotion anything but 'fiction'. Marcus, Julia, Hadassah,Rizpah,Theophilos, and Atretes- their falls and their triumphs will glisten with hope for the reader inside the reader's heart for days afterward. Granted, some parts really go into detail making some pages tedious, but other than that I enjoyed every minute of my 'lesson of forgiveness and trust and love' as I read the Mark of the Lion series."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Exciting, realistic... I could not put it down\\"","review":"Though it may look long, the pages fly by, as you live with the characters in Jerusalem, Germania, Rome and lastly Ephesus. It's got everything, murder, betrayl, war, love. The characters are realistic, they all have weaknesses and make mistakes. It is thrilling to wonder, what we would do in the same position. A book, everyone will enjoy, if not only for the experience of reading something different for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stirring Assessment of Self","review":"An unforgetable journey into the past, this series, so meticulously researched,forces the Christian to evaluate his or her own faith: Could I be a Hadassah? Well worth reading -- and more than once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion","review":"This is undoubtedly the best series I have ever read. Francine Rivers is an exceptional author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion series","review":"Fantastic story. My father in law is a history professor, and he said it is quite historically accurate. I pondered the spiritual thoughts and examples of the characters for weeks afterward. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series ever!","review":"I LOVE these books. The characters are written so well and you feel like you are getting to know them as you read. the stories are inspirational and show an example of the love of God all throughout the books. You HAVE to read these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute \\"Must-Read\\"!","review":"This is hands-down my favorite book series of all time. The writing is great, the message is amazing, and the history is enthralling. I've read them twice now and each time I'm almost heartbroken to say goodbye to the characters.I highly, highly recommend these books.My only warning would be that they do have some rather graphic violence in them so if you are bothered by that these books may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A good friend recommended this trilogy to me and all I can say is, \\"Wow!\\" These books are exciting and very well written. The author sends her Christian message without crossing the line to preachy, which I really appreciate. The series is definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing trilogy...","review":"Wow! These books changed my view of Christianity and its origins entirely. It is one thing to hear about ancient Roman culture -- its depravity, immorality, and feral pursuit of any and every pleasure -- but it is entirely another thing to walk through that culture with characters like Hadassah, Julia, Marcus, and Atreides. My eyes were opened to the reality of their existence, and history came alive to me. For the first time, the art, architecture, and writings that I have studied from Rome became meaningful, showing that these were real people struggling with real issues and real temptations, much like those we struggle with today. These are unbelievably amazing books. If only there were a fourth one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know how to describe them","review":"The only thoughts that come to mind when I think of this trilogy, consist of overused words, but they are all true! Captivating, inspiring, realistic, page-turning. I have read the first two books many times, with Sure As the Dawn running a little behind. Hadassah really inspired me, and sometimes her story comes to mind when I face my own trials. Rivers was unafraid to address some issues other Christian writers seem to shy away from. As Sure As the Dawn was my least favorite of the trio and would probably be a four star. The other two make the five stars, because Hadassah and the Valerian family were well characterized and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series I've ever read","review":"The first time I read this series, I stayed up all night to finish the first and second books. In the second book I cried until my eyes were puffy and my throat was sore the next morning. The second time I read the series, I discovered so many things I had missed, cried until my eyes were puffy and my throat was sore the next morning. The third time I read the series, I skipped straight to my favorite parts and cried some more. If I had another boy, I'd name him after Marcus...Even though Hadassah is so close to perfection, her character is an inspiration to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every one should read this","review":"This was the best series I've ever read. I couldn't put them down, and I know my friends got tired of hearing about it. I fell in love with the characters. I cried when they cried and I smiled when they smiled. It was not only interesting, but I learned a lot too. Now when I read the Bible it helps me picture things more acurately. It made the Bible more real for some reason. I will definately read the Mark of the Lion series again."},{"rating":"2","title":"No comparison","review":"This series is my all time favorite out of all books I have ever read in my life! The first one is an awesome introduction to the characters but the second one is definetly the best! One of my favorite things about Francine's style is she never fails to bring her readers into the depth of emotions that her characters are feeling and dealing with. I love the passion she has for God personally and how she reflects that in at least one of her characters. I bought this series many years ago and have read it at least once a year ever since. To this day I have yet to find even a single book or Author for that matter that even compares. She simply doesn't write books fast enough! I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who loves the Lord and loves historical fiction. These books have some great insights to the termoil between the Jews and Romans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"This is a great series. I like it so much. Everything was so lifelike, it was soooo good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"While I found the writing and the stories in these books engaging and interesting, I was bothered by the unrealistic characters who were often too perfect and often behaved in manners that seemed to be uncharacteristic. As is often the case in this type of Christian fiction, both the characters and the author seemed, at times, hypocritical. Perhaps this was intentional, but it was quite a put-off for me, mostly because it seemed to be an accident of the author's personal biases.I was also troubled by the historical research; many things implied to be true of this period and of Christianity in this period were just plain false. When I read historical fiction, I expect things to be actually based on historical truth.In the end, I have enjoyed reading the books for their stories, but a few of the other characteristics of the books would lead me not to highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such good books, I read years ago and now reading again! :0","review":"I chose five stars because I think Francine Rivers is an excellent author and these three are her crowning jewels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A historically accurate and fascinating romance","review":"Rivers excells in historical fiction. These novels, though bitingly real, surpass the general idea of \\"historical romance.\\" They are an excellent read and a tribute to the author's hard work, dedication, and fatih."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I am only half way through the 1st book in the series but WOW! The first few chapters are spent developing the characters. I have quickly found myself not wanting to put the book down. I can hardly wait to see how the story unfolds. It is wonderful how the author incorporates Christian themes within a fiction book.Another positive is that I think that this series would interest my husband as well. It doesn't seem to be written specifically for one sex or the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing books she has written","review":"I have to date read all but one of her books (Liotas Garden). The lineage of grace series, and (the ones on the men) were great. My first book was redeeming love, which I loved. Now the top of my favorites of hers was this series. I have a 2 year old, and found the time to get all three of these books read in a couple weeks. they are that good! You will keep the character Hadassah in your thoughts for a long time. now i'm on a book frank peretti \\"this present darkness\\"...it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story you'll want to read over and over!!","review":"I have literally read this book (or series) three times and plan to read it several more. It is such an inspiring story that captivates you and forbids you from putting it down (even the 2nd and 3rd times through).It deals with how to LIVE the Christian life, how to witness to those you love by example and through love. It is very inspiring and beautifully written. I would have to say it is the most excellent period piece I have read to date. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - exciting & realistic!","review":"I was in Spain visiting a friend & she loaned me this series. I read the whole thing in 2 weeks!

I would highly recommend these books to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"These well written books describe the life of Christians 24/7/365 through good and bad circumstances. The reader becomes one with the characters because of the descriptive writing of the author. Every Christian should read this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reevaluate your walk","review":"One of the most powerful books that I have ever read. A definite must for any new Christian or anyone who questions their walk with the Lord.This is a series that will forever impact your life. I read it 2 years ago,and I am still talking about it, and recommending it to friends. It brings to light what loving the Lord with all you have means. Worth spending the money and time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good books with minor annoyances","review":"I definately enjoyed these books and even stayed up until four in the morning to finish the first one. I loved the characters and discovered that I do have the potential to become a romanitic. Hoewever, there were some phrases that were so overused that they became distracting. The men \\"raking their fingers through their hair\\" and \\"smiling sardonically\\" nearly drove me crazy. There are synonyms for sardonically and other ways to show distress than raking your hair. I really did enjoy the books though and would recommend them to anyone who can stand some repetitiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing books","review":"I am not partial to fiction but these books are amazing! If you love to be entertained, are interested in history and religion, and are open to a life changing story, get these books! You will not regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion","review":"I love, LOVE these books. Francine is by far one of my favorite authors. These aren't like many Christian fiction books. She's a truly remarkable author, and her characters have a lot of depth and it makes you feel like you're right there with them. Once I start reading these, I can't put them down until I finish all three. They're such gripping and amazing stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion Trilogy","review":"The best series I've read. Francine Rivers is the best at capaturing a reader's interest and adding biblical principals all in a way that will grip your heart and make you feel wonderful for months and years on end afterwards. Her books are truly memorable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Put Down","review":"I am just in the first book of the trilogy, but find it difficult to put down. The way that Francine Rivers develops characters and describes the area in which they live give me a sense of being there. This is the 4th Francine Rivers novel I have read, and look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"The entire trilogy is wonderful! You have to go from the first book straight to the second book, though, to keep from freaking out (the second was my favorite). I feel like I understand more about the Roman Empire now and the similarities between our world and theirs. Very convicting. You will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion series","review":"I started reading the first book as part of a book club. Even though the first one started a little slowly, I stuck with it and after it picked up, I just couldn't put it down. I read the second book in less than one week. I started the third one last night and I am pretty sure that I will finish it in about a week. The story is absolutely captivating! I highly recommend that series to anyone! France Jackson (Memphis, TN)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"What a beautiful expression of the meaning of Christianity. Amazing to me are the parallels in the life of a slave in 1st century Rome, to my own life and my own struggles. Francine Rivers brought me ever closer to God through this book. I recommend it to anyone and everyone! May God bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful amazing journey back in time","review":"i have had the books 3 times and loose them when i give them out one too many times to friends who i dont remember..the books are awesome.makes you think of your own life and walk with God and also the story telling is so vivid and real...its hard to believe it is fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mark of the Lion -See it for what it is","review":"This is a great series and Francine Rivers is my favorite author. In this series you will learn a lot about historic Roman times, the worship of numerous gods, and the beauty and truth that comes from holding on to beliefs in the mist of overwhelming obstacles. Books 1 is great, Book 2 is unbelievable, and Book 3 is good. I have read the series more than once as I learn something new everytime I read. One of the most powerful themes is the meaning behind \\"Mark of the Lion\\". It isn't what you think it is. GET THIS SERIES! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best books ever!","review":"These books, set in the first century, are probably the greastest fiction books I have ever read (and read multiple times!). I absolutely love history, especially ancient history and the Roman Empire, and these were an excellent description of the times. The characters in the book are incredibly well developed, and the trials each go through in order to know Jesus are absolutely riveting! You simply cannot put them down! Even the second time through and knowing everything that would happen, I still had a hard time putting them down! It is rare for me to read a book more than once unless it touches me and leaves an impact, such as this series does! You will not be disappointed with these powerful books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story!!!","review":"This another beautiful story from Mrs. Rivers. Its a great work of art. I could actually picture myself walking down the streets of Rome while reading the book. I like the way she was able to relate the characters to the events taking place in the world now, especially the Christendom. There is nothing new under the sun, but the Word of God stays forever, never changing. I did learn a lot from the stories, and the most important is that God is with us, no matter the situation we are going through and that thought keeps me going through, knowing that everything works together for our good. Mrs. Rivers, you are blessed.....and u have been a fountain of blessing to me too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Two Volumes Were the Best!","review":"Volume 1: A Voice in the Wind was absolutely wonderful! I stayed awake many nights to find out what was going to happen next. I couldn't put the book down. Volume 2: An Echo in the Darkness was a nice follow-up to Vol 1. Also very intriguing and difficult to put down. It had to be the fastest I've every read a book! Volume 3: As Sure as the Dawn was a little more predictable than the other two books and a little annoying. The only drawback to the books from a Christian point of view is that the author seemed to only use miracles to bring unbelievers to Christ. Even though, I would highly recommend the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever series I have read","review":"You will want all three books. Be warned though, once you start reading, you may as well forget housework and anything else you have scheduled. Very seldom have I devoured and recommended a series like I have this one. The first book will take you about 100 pages to get into the historical aspect but it is WELL worth it. I have read all of Francine Rivers works since this series and although all of her writing is good - this is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Seems","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to find something for my teenage daughters to read that had a Christian theme and did not have obscene content. I read the first 50 pages of this book and it had more obscene descriptions of murder and rape and vile things that no one would ever want to read about than just about any book I have ever read. I couldn't finish reading it because it made me sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion series","review":"Hooked me in 1999 and I'm reading As Sure as the Dawn right now (for the 17th time). These books never get old. Few stories are as well written or as intellectually stimulating as these novels. They have a depth and a quality to them that resonates. I don't know why, but I can't seem to get enough of them. This is one of the few Christian series that actually strikes a bit of reality and isn't based on a perfect world; yet the conclusion is unutterably satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great example","review":"I could not put this series of books down but once I was finished there was one thing that came to mind and that it is an amazing example for any Christian. I grew up in a very disfunctional \\"Christian\\" home and I had very few good models to look after. But while reading about Hadassah and her actions it was almost as if I was there. Now I get it, now I understand and I am so thankful for Francine Rivers for using her gifts in such a blessed way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful trilogy!","review":"This is Francine Rivers at her finest!

It was flimsy and the switches were hard to work. It literally fell apart in my hands today, right in the middle of the kitchen. The face plate came off, the soldering came apart, the wiring separated - the whole nine yards. This is a cheap piece of kitchen tech, that not only failed to work right, but physically contaminated the food that I was cooking for my Chef. This is a terrible, horrible, piece of the equipment, and I would not recommend this to anyone. The only reason this is getting one star is because zero is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought this \\"instant-read\\" thermometer because I thought I was getting a great deal. However, unlike other instant read thermometer's I've owned, the temperature gauge on this device slowly crept up by 1-2 degrees a second until it reached the temperature of the steak I was cooking. I couldn't hold my hand over the open flame long enough to get an accurate reading, so I had to let go of it. Then when I pulled the thermometer out of the steak, the cap and wired connection broke off in my hand, rendering the thermometer broken and useless. Horrible quality, I wish I would have spent the extra money to buy a better device."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of shipping","review":"The item I received was totally worthless. Occasionally, it produced another reading besides 62.4F.

If you cook, BBQ, or anything like that, get one. They are great. The only reason for the four stars instead of five on this one is that it doesn't have a temperature guide printed on the actual thermometer case, it is printed on the packaging that it comes in. Who actually keeps the packaging? If it weren't for that it would have five stars because it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than thrilled","review":"The first thermometer I received was defective and was replaced. I don't understand the logic behind a thermometer that doesn't automatically shut itself off and has to be manually turned off.

It is designed to open so that the battery can be replaced, but easily comes open when pulling the thermometer out of a piece of meat or even out of the protective sleeve. All that holds the top to the probe are a couple wires once it is open, so it would be very easy for it to get damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teriffic","review":"works great! Just what I needed and the price was right too! I would reccommend this thermometer to everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and inaccurate","review":"I bought this thermometer at a grocery store. It takes a very long time to check the temperature, and does not seem accurate compared with the in-oven probe thermometer. Now, I just use that probe thermometer to stick into a couple different areas of the meat/chicken after I pull it out of the oven, to ensure the meat is cooked everywhere. I stopped using this \\"instant\\" read thermometer that takes a full minute while it slowly counts up to the temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth the Cost ($10)","review":"It worked great until the battery ran out. Once I replaced the battery, the temperature read only as \\"LL.L degrees\\" and wouldn't change no matter how hot or cold the thing I was measuring. The parts are barely held together - when I was swapping out one new battery for another to see if that was the problem, the temperature gauge mechanism came out of the metal needle with barely a tug. I had to toss it out after only using it about 8 times. If you cook meat regularly, invest in a better quality thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK until Not OK","review":"Thermometer worked great until the battery gave out. Installing a replacement battery was no problem: just flip up the tab on the side of the soldered holder to slide out the old battery. However, in the process, a solder point to one of the sensor wires tore loose and converted the item to garbage. I was being very gentle, too. We're going to buy a sturdier product this next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thermometer","review":"I bought this thermometer to replace an analog thermometer. Overall it works well, just turn it on and test the meat. I did have an issue where the thermometer got a bit too hot on the grill and got stuck on 888.88. I had to shut it off a couple times and let it cool down. The temperature on the grill was probably close to 700 so I can't really fault the electronics for acting a bit sketchy because I left it in the meat too long. I wish the probe was a bit smaller, but besides that this is perfect for anyone who wants to grill perfect steaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken on arrival","review":"I wanted to get a digital candy thermometer for increased accuracy when I cook.Some reviewers suggested that this thermometer was unreliable.

Most of the time the LED display would blank, so I had no reading.It is in the trashI'm back with my mercury thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough to use - waste of money","review":"It reacts way too slowly. You can't leave it in whatever you're measuring since it's not liquid proof or heat proof. So you stand there with the oven door open watching it slowwwly climb to the actual temperature.The diameter of the probe is bigger than necessary, so it pokes a large hole in the food.The switch is too delicate to last.

Perhaps water isn't fatal to it, as you can open the case and dry it out. But forget about the thermometer if you get any kind of oil into it.

It was a great story and a lovely conclusion. As one of my favorite characters, I'd still have preferred to have a proper burial for Jean and the emotional story intact rather then digging her up and putting her in X-factor for the sake of making a splash. It also establishes the first hideous convolutions of the Phoenix story, establishing that Jean Grey actually merged with a cosmic entity on the shuttle while leaving her old body behind in a coccoon in the Hudson. This is the beginning of the many complications of the Phoenix concept, once extremely elegant.Thankfully they have moved towards a cleaner and simpler explanation in recent years with Grant Morrison's [i]New X-men[/i] and Greg Pak's [i]Phoenix: Endsong[/i]."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rebirth of Jean Grey","review":"These were a series of stories that not only saw the return of Jean Grey but also the birth of the Goverment backed-mutant team X-FACTOR.

It arrived in a timely manner, and contained the expected food packet and egg container. The egg container was expected to contain a mixture of very small triops eggs mixed in with detritus. What is troubling is that the egg container held only the detritus and no eggs.I am very familiar with the eggs of related branchiopods such as artemia. No eggs of any kind could be found in this package. I set up the hatching container and poured the detritus mixture in anyway. After a week in recommended hatching conditions, no tiny triops naupilae could be found, living or dead. I therefore concluded that this package contained no viable eggs, if it contained any at all. A call to the company requesting warranty clarifications was never returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived fast and 6 triops hatched","review":"I'm very pleased with this mini-kit. It comes with very specific instructions that MUST be closely followed if you want your triops to hatch. I used drinking water and got about 11 triops after 24 hours and then a few more after 48 hours, but they do eat each other depending on their size (the first ones to hatch tend to eat whatever hatches after them) so 6 of them made it to live on as adults. I followed the advice on the care sheets that mentioned placing a small piece of carrot in the tank that helps the triops grow faster. The carrot is useful if you have trouble crushing the food pellets that come with the kit. The small triops will eat the carrot so you can be sure that they're getting enough food."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THEM!","review":"Found the best way to grow them is if you already have an established aquarium use some of that water.

The main problem was with the ending - the resolution took just a couple of pages, and then the story ended. I've read at least three books by Rice and this is a problem with every one of them.

So if you exert enough pressure on the blade to get a good clean scrape on the ceiling, the handle ends up bending until it is unusable. I helped this some by cutting an inch off each side of the blade, making it around 5 inches wide. So now less pressure is needed and the bracket does handle the pressure as long as you are delicate with it. I've done 2 small bedrooms and now the blade needs sharpened because it is also a low grade steel. I wish this tool was made with better quality so I could give it a higher rating.

I think that the year in which the story takes place (1943) is a little hard for the children to grasp. Kids in the year 1999, would like it if they had more journals in there time, not more than 50 years ago. The best part in the book was the end, when Mrs. Leitstein gets married to a man she met in Texas while she was there for short visit. I loved it when Katie got excited when asked to be the bridesmaid!! Another is when Katie's mom gets hit by a truck. The accident brought her closer to her mom than she ever was before. After that she stopped writing about her mom and how annoying and mean she was. Her mom never let her wear lipstick, but after the accident Katie's mom actually let her wear lipstick and Katie felt much better!! I liked the meaning behind the story.

The author adds nothing that is not already established about Collins and the period other than an exponiential flight of fantasy. Even his most basic facts are wrong eg that there were 3 warships and artillery used by the fenians in the Canada 'assault' and, fatally, that Randolf Churchill became Prime Minister of Britain!

Christmas in the South is a wonderful collection of short stories from Southern writers, but they have little or nothing to do with Christmas or even winter for that matter. Many of the short stories, like those you read in High School and College, leave you confused at the end and are worthy of group discussions to figure out exactly what (if anything) the writer was wanting to tell us.

The horror is played straight and there are surprises around each corner. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic monsters are back, finally, in a new series","review":"This is the first new novel I've read in years. I've been a fan of Mr. Rovin's books for over 20 years and I was excited to come across this book by accident. Being a fan of old-time movies I didn't hesitate to buy it. It's a FUN book, featuring other classic monsters beside the Wolfman. Look for other classic horror references sprinkled throughout the book, but don't let it distract you from the plot. Though I felt the prose lacks \\"immediacy\\", especially in the action scenes, the story moves right along. The best characterization is Lawrence Talbot, whose tragic fate looms over the work. It's a fine effort, and I look forward to the next one in the series. I hope Mr. Rovin does one about the \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\". Also, I'd love to see a sequel to or continuation of the characters/events in \\"It Came From Outer Space\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun homage","review":"Corny, but I liked it a lot.

He ties together all original tales and brings them forward into the present time with plausible explanations. He solves some of the unexplained mysteries from the original tales (ex. why Bela turned into an actual wolf rather than a wolf man in the original film). It does get a little gory towards the end.

The way Kevin Smith brings out the emotional, religious, and often turbulent side of Daredevil's world is truly astounding considering the fact that this is probably his first take on a comic book hero, period. I'm not going to give away too much of the story without spoiling it, but I do want to say that Smith does one hell of a job giving some kind of credibility to what I think is one of Marvel Comics' lamest villains, lol! THAT alone moved me to give this collection five stars along with the superb artwork of top-notch team Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti, who are at their best at complimenting the writer's vision with their highly refined style. Definitely buy this collection if you don't want to go through all the trouble picking up these issues individually."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetative","review":"I just started reading DD and collecting all the trades I could lay my hands on, in other words I read \\"Guardian Devil\\" and \\"Born Again\\" within a week of each other.

Unfortunately, the story and graphic novel was extremely boring and lame. there is no comparision to frank miller's eighties work in terms of intensity and impact. Frank Miller was brilliant because there was a cleverness to the words and the impact in emotional thought to Daredevil or Batman in Miller's work. THe christian theme was extremely ineffective and the drawing, which was pretty good, was destroyed by the terrible coloring. It was too dark and I dont mean the story.

I can not reccomand this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Rehash of Frank Miller glory","review":"I'm sorry but all the smoke that gets blown up Kevin Smith's... for this book is unjustified. First, the only reason I gave the book 2 stars is because of the great art(coloring included). I bought this book on a recomendation from a friend and was close to being offended. Having read and loved the Frank Miller DD run it seemed to me it had been done before. Gee, Bullseye killing DD's love interest, where have I seen that before? I don't mean to be rude, but that is just one (of many) instance of similarities. Also, didn't I read recently that Kevin Smith wanted to have a challenge? Why doesn't he try to make up his own characters instead of ripping off people that worked hard for their name in this industry.

This paperback (why it isn't a Hardcover is beyond me) tells a story of mythicism and religion without being too serious or confusing. The readers were confused enough by the Daredevil run involving the costume change....Shudder. Kevin Smith is an emerging writer. Quesada is there already. This seems like a truely promising run by two very special artists, but as we know, Smith leaves after this story ends. So without a doubt, pick up this entire story and savor what has been made.

I'd have even forgiven that, but the reason it doesn't work is ONLY it's copy protection! Yes, you paid good money for it and the people who ripped it off for free from the Internet have no problems at all.The game itself is OK, nothing spectacular. It is quite difficult, but not impossible. You spend most of the time as Wolverine, thankfully little time as Iceman (awful). Nightcrawler is a real treat, he's done better here than any X-men game I've ever played. If you have XP and can find this for maybe $15 it's probably worth it.

The characters don't even move their lips when they talk (how 15 years ago is that?),there are really no items to collect along the way, and the missions seem kind of pointless. It is by no means as engaging as Rise of Apocalypse, the story is kind of stupid too. The characters don't have that many powers, and there are very few features to the game. I LOVE X-MEN in general, movies, comics, the whole bit, and I hope they come up with another game in the near future that is way better than this one.I don't get how this could have happened, the game was made by the same company that made the X-men 2.Now if the movie sucks too, I'll have wasted the past 6 months waiting for both the game and the movie.

My boyfriend and I beat this game in 3 days, with less than 20 hours of total gameplay. I might like it more if I could play ONLY as Nightcrawler, and not have to switch characters, since he has the best moves IMO, but that's not the case. I did enjoy it while I played it, which is why I gave it 3 stars for fun. But it was over way too quickly, and I feel it was a waste of money, so it gets 2 stars overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game STINKS!","review":"Boy, I'm glad I didn't buy it. I played it at a friends house and that is all I needed. This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played.

Don't waste your money on this horrible game like my poor friend did. Get X-Men Legends 2 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners, but not an advanced piece.","review":"As a student of ecopsychology, I picked up this work expecting to find in depth discussions about theories in psychology and ecopsychology.

Tokens are hard to see and property prices could be more easily accessible.UPDATE 26/9/10: Now that I've spent more time with it, I'm lowering my rating. The game program is simplistic: eg. offering low-rent blue property(s) to complete a computer player's set for almost any higher end one+$$$ to complete your own high-rent set (thus with the deal highly favorable to you), almost always works virtually ensuring your win. The program very annoyingly interrupts your deal-making constantly with its own often silly (eg. bargaining for a very few $$ difference or making ridiculous/meaningless offers such exchange of same-set properties which really makes no difference to any player) which is very frustrating. The program provides little challenge and you can easily end up with a win average of 90%+."},{"rating":"2","title":"DF's break out!!","review":"What an excellent dose of musical delight.

I emailed company a couple of times asking if perhaps there was an authorized technician in my area that could take a look and nobody has responded. My husband has tried to make slight adjustments to the cutter . . . square it up per accompanied instructions and it works for a short period and then is soon out of square.

That was easier said than done - since the ball is just slightly larger than the actual Delta-made part. It made the act of turing on the faucet a two handed proposition. I've never seen a faucet so difficult to operate. I gave up and went to the local hardware store and paid triple the price for the actual Delta made replacement parts.

Jim has assembled various works from some of his 'friends' on this 12-song CD, joining some of them on several tracks as performer and composer. Standouts include \`Partners In Crime', a duet with Dave Koz (currently climbing into the NAC/SJ Top 10), and \`Your Love' by Canadian artist Michelle Wright.The remaining selections run hot and cold, as is the case with any compillation CD. However, one pleasant surprise is Amanda Upchurch's version of the James Taylor classic, \`Shower The People'. The only selection that even comes close to alternative, this gem sounds like a cross between Sheryl Crow and Fleetwood Mac, bearing little resemblance to the original song. Amanda's performance is wonderfully understated, a rare thing in today's world of vocal gymnastics.

Other songs of note are the duet by Ingram and Harris \\"Like Love\\", a silky smooth combo and Peabo Bryson's \\"My Heart Belongs to You\\" which shows his resonant voice to perfection.

I had no prior knowledge of VBScript, SQL or other Server side programming languages like CGI or perl. It starts with the basics of ASP and quickly leads you to building your own scripts. The codes given are not complete programs so you have to go step by step from the 1st chapter thus building your knowledge from the ground up.

But psychological traumas occur not only in the killing fields but also in seemingly ordinary homes where children and adults sometimes suffer severe psychological trauma from a variety of sources.

I had seen this game on pre-release here but in china it was already out. So i got this game like 2 weeks before the american release. This game isn't bad as the graphics, controls, sound, gameplay are all pretty good but the only thing is its kinda short. Plua the fact dat this is an ez game means this game doesnt take too long to beat.Hints: When defeating android 19 and 20 make him follow u. go behind a tree and he'll keep walking in to it but wont attack. u just attack from the other side and you win! ez.In the android 19 and 20 saga you have to destroy the 3 generators. One is in dat Hep Cat's hous up to the north. To get to the generator which is locked in a room you must undo the security in the rite order. I'm not sure what the order is because i was randomly pressing the switches. and the keys are black and green and the darker blue. im not sure the order so be sure to test it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dragon info","review":"hey peeps yo this game is off the hiz hook u should get itit is the one game u will be proud to have"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is terrible","review":"First of all, they didn't have any half stars.The amount you get to fly is pathetic .

Even if you don't know anything about dragon ball this game is still good. I never played the first game. This is an action-role playing game. Instead of turn based battles, everything is real time in an overhead view like zelda from nes. The graphics is simple with excellent details, high production value. The 'one' town and dungeons are pretty big in size, you get that in the game feel. This game is funny and colorful. The sound and music is decent. Only bad things are game length is a too short, no real inventory stuff, enemy variety and only ONE town. After this game i might try buu's fury. If you like hack and slash try shining soul 2.Overall this is a good action/rpg game."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!","review":"THIS GAME WAS HOT IT WAS KINDA LOND BUT STILL.THE ONLY Z FIGHTER I LIKE IS PICCOLO AND TRUNKS.AND CELL WAS HARD I BEAT HIM UNTILL 3 TRUNS.I STILL LIKE IT EVEN I DIDN'T PalyKRLLIN BECAUSE he's also my favrite z fighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant","review":"I played DBZ Legacy of Goku I, and it was too short and WAY to easy.

Like Nesta Webster, Cronin understood that they needed to be studied together in order to understand their decisions, their mistakes, their loves and their martyrdom. This book especially excels as a portrait of Louis, demolishing the myth of his impotence and sexual malfuctioning. Rather than the indifferent husband and incompetent king, Cronin builds a strong case for Louis as being very loving and loved, by his wife and by his people. As for Antoinette, Cronin explores in detail her charities and activites as a mother - a dynamic, busy woman, not a bored and decadent consort. I loved this book; it is one of my favorite biographies, which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very narrow-minded one-sided work","review":"This book is written by a group of extreme left wing architects and journalists.

It has a large database of foods, and gives complete nutritional infomation on virtually every food you can think of. I really only have 2 negatives which keep it from getting a 5 star review:1) Looking up the food items requires you to enter text on a numeric keypad (like texting on a cell phone) and the response time is fairly slow. So, it gets frustrating. A small blackberry size keyboard with faster response time on the screen would be a HUGE improvement.2) It would be great if you could store your top 10 or top 20 favorite foods. Right now, we have to reenter the type of food every time, and it takes longer than we wish using the numeric keypad.But, the scale is nice looking, the battery lasts a long time, and it really makes it easy.

I have not and will not put favorite recipes in it but I do use it to weigh all her fruit. It does remember the ones you have used and you can scroll through the list. I also LOVE to use it to weigh servings. Ie - I can put a bowl on the scale and zero it out. I add dry pasta for instance or dry cereal until I get to the amount of grams that is 1 serving. You can also change it to ML and LB/OZ as well as G. I probably use it at least 3 times a day for all her meals. I no longer use the 1 cup is a serving method. I use the grams per serving since this scale is so accurate.

It has lots of clear worked out proofs of propostitions. Many of the exercises at the end of each lesson require that you find proofs of propostions mentioned in the text but were not proven.

Since I am a student, I personally think the exercises at the end of the chapters are somewhat difficulty to figure out, but for others they might not be.

Greenberg walks you step-by-step through the proofs of the foundation ideas for each chapter (with selected exceptions left as examples. However, these proceed predictably from other examples that do have full proofs). There are numerous exercises at the end of each chapter, typically professors will choose a handful that they find interesting or amusing and assign those. No answers are at the back of the book. The problems require proofs and I have yet to see a text that provides answers to proofs problems in the back. Anyhow, many problems have multiple approaches.

The picture seeems software interpolated as the screen is sharp for a brief moment after turn-on, then goes blotchy. The gamma and brightness controls barely do anything. The Microphone array produces noise. I recorded myself moving around, without talking. On replay there's not silence but significant crackle and popping on the soundtrack, I guess as the microphones are looking for something to track.

Also, the operas are often incomplete, which is frustrating if you know them well or are trying to introduce them to someone new. I grew up on G&S, and much of this set is a travesty - the best analogy I can think of is the Disney version of Winnie the Pooh compared to the Shepherd originals.

My camera fits in the main compartment very well, and I can also carry other items in the two additional smaller compartments. It comes with a strap that I can use around my neck or can just store in one of the compartments. It also has a belt loop that slips over the strap on my waist pack, making the case/camera hands free!I love this case, and would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a well-made product to protect their investment in their compact digital camera. This is a great case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bellagio mocha mix was like overpriced hot cocoa","review":"I usually buy Big Train Mocha Mix, which I love, but decided to try Bellagio's due to the price. Big Train's price keeps going up. I was disappointed with Bellagio's because it tasted like weak hot cocoa mix. My daughter also tried it and felt it was watered down and she adds xtra to hers. I will not buy this product again.

The author makes the same two or three points over and over again (the meat of her book) and spends the rest of the book detailing lithographs and program covers -- copies of which appear in the book.

These shoes are not available in half sizes, however, according to their sizing chart, if you wear half size, you just get the next size bigger. I wear 7.5 so I bought the 8. All the bumps and ridges that are designed to keep your feet comfortable become a painful trial if you don't wear a whole size. The toe crease ridge is under my toes instead of in the crease, where it would normally be. The arch support is under the ball of my foot so it's like walking on a rock. My feet hurt after just one trip to the grocery store in these shoes. I really wish they made sandals in half sizes because I like their shoes, but as it is I cannot wear them.

Unfortunately, the parts I'd read earlier (approx. the first 150 pages of this book) are about as good as it gets.The list of comics creators who worked on this series is impressive -- including Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, and Stan Lee -- but ultimately it seems like they were just meeting deadlines and paying bills.

It also provides information on how to comprehend them. Children psychology is one of the most crucial factor in raising children, so understanding their feelings and correctly deal with them will give parents some basic information on how to meet their children needs, as well as an easier every-day life. I would recommend this book as an introductory guide to parenting, but not as an only option (there is not one book for everything).

It provided me useful insights into how some typical parent behaviors can have unexpected undesirable side effects on the child's development.I found the cover and title misleading, I think I was expecting something about the secret language of babies that might be helpful in the first year or two.

Although it wasn't as \\"classic literature\\" as I was expecting - I found the book to be one of the best offerings for children I've read in a long time. Gage really does a fantastic job of exploring a vast sociological allegory within an interesting and fast moving plot.

Why are so many singers with excellent resumes, excellent voices, excellent acting skills, and excellent reputations, recording this trash?Yes, there are a couple of good melodies on this, but that isn't much of a recommendation for a double CD. They sound as if they have been written by someone plinking around on the piano, not someone who has any kind of a musical education and not necessarily much of a musical ear. Most of the music is trite, and the songs are very repetative. Couldn't the title character have more than 3 melodies to sing through the course of the show?The lyrics make me wonder whether the whole thing is intended as a parody. Please.

There is a handful of principle characters and we follow their plight throughout the book as each of them deals with their personal quest to survive. The book seems to be well researched and provides quite a bit of technical details about earthquakes, specfically in the southern California area.It is scary to imagine a disaster such as this, and the inability of the emergency services to deal with the damage and provide aid to the survivors.My only complaint is that the book should have had more careful editing.

The optical zoom range of 5x is very good and there is no discernible image deterioration at any focal length.

Korn should have recorded a performance from the \\"see you on the other side\\" tour, the setlist was much better. This dvd has all the Korn hits, and a few new titles, but it lacks some of the older material that was on the syotos tour. A reviewer had said that the band wasnt very active at this show, and i must say that they were active, but not as much as on the syotos tour. All in all this is a must have for a Korn fan, but it could be better. The only reason im really buying it is for the simple fact that i want to see if im on it at all. If you have the \\"korn live\\" dvd from 2002 i believe, you pretty much have this one already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!

I've put it on the PS3 console and the screen stayed black and after some seconds, the system delivered me a error message with a sequel of numbers (I don't remember right now which were).So I recommend you to don't buy this product!Remember that music Y'All Want a Single?

I can't tell you how crappy this fondant is to work with. it is so stiff. My husband and I tried it several times (thinking maybe at first we just got a bad box) we both sat with half the box each and worked it until our hands were sore to get it vaguely softened. Then I tried to roll it out, it was so stiff I was using my whole body weight to roll it. My husband rolled it out with difficulty. By the time you've managed to roll it thin enough (all that effort takes time) it has dried out and cracks as it folds over the cake. Terrible fondant. SATIN ICE is much much better, more pliable, easier to roll out and much nicer flavor. Wilton flavor is kinda ok, it's not discusting like some say but SATIN ICE is so much nicer and also comes in many different flavors like vanilla or buttercream - even chocolate! whereas Wilton comes in one fake flavor.

If you are looking for a feel of Berlin during the war you will not get it here. I realize that these are the memories of a child, but the author is now an adult; I found it shameful that she had no bettter insight on why her jewish father had to leave Germany.

This is geared more towards using your weights. :) I have two young daughters and the only chance I get to workout is at 5:00am before they are out of bed. I put this video in on mornings that I dont want to jump around too much. Of all the Firm videos I have this one is one of them that is geared more towards beginners.

If you really want to sweat I would recommend Hard Core Fusion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Easy","review":"Just like another reviewer said, this is way too boring and easy. I feel I'm wasting my time when I do it. Most of the The Firm stuff I don't like anyway, even though some of the newer ones I can tolerate.

I found that there were way too many breaks in between sets and found it too easy, even with the increase of weights. It didn't even raise my heart rate that much.

I know first hand if done diligently the Firm series can and does produce fast long lasting results. I personally have lost 80+ pounds using them. This DVD is great for body sculpting. There is no high intesity cardio, but studies (and my personal experiences) have shown body sculpting and resistance training are necessary for long term health and strength. I would alternate this workout with walking or another type of cardio activity if your desire is weightloss. This DVD also has an express workout that is about 25 min. Overall a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice workout with some interesting combos","review":"I really liked this one! I think it is perfect for advanced beginners or intermediates. I especially liked the way different moves for different muscle groups were alternated, allowing me to rest one group while exercising another.

Instead of sending the broken watch out to see if they could repair the band, I bought a new one. This one is beautiful, and I have worn it almost every day since I bought it. The downfall is that the \\"stainless steel\\" is actually plating; the steel rubbed off and exposed brassy looking metal underneath, and the clasp won't stay shut-I've actually had to resort to taping it shut.This watch is less than a year old, and it's falling apart. My old Bulova was a Caravelle, (the lower grade), and it upstood my harsh job at a grocery store; this one can't handle my job as a teacher and a student.My conclusion is that I'm upset I didn't buy another copy of my \\"old\\" watch; and I've had cheap-o Walmart watches last longer while looking better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, but could use some improvements","review":"This was a pretty fun book to read and learn Chinese hanzi.

William Goldman's book of course, comes to mind. Also, Dawn Steele's book provided some interesting insights and advice as well. I think that what it comes down to when you are looking to break into an industry is the advice and suggestions you are given. And its the wise person who listens and takes the advice of those with intellect and experience. If some readers feel they found it here, perhaps it is because they are silly, giggly, superficial and (I'm sorry to say) stupid as the author. For all of you who feel MTV equals brain power, this will suit you just fine. People with a bit more substance (and no trust fund to their name) will most likely find this book offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's face it, the book sucks.","review":"The reviewer from West Hollywood takes the most pretentious, pompous tone of them all, telling everyone to just calm down, etc etc etc. Face it, the book is awful. No, the bad reviews are not about Hollywood jealousy. The bad reviews are about reviewing a bad book honestly. The reason, I believe, the reviews take a personal tone is that the book is written in such personal tone. Ever meet someone who makes you vomit? Ever meet someone who makes you roll your eyes? That's what this book brings out in the reader. It's just too personal a take on the experience-- and it's the voice of this annoying girl that are making readers gag or take offense. That's what this book brings out in people. Maybe if the book was just slightly more objective in writing, so would the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU'LL LEARN AND YOU'LL LAUGH","review":"Are the below few readers 1) Jealous? 2) Self-serious? 3) Humorless? or 4) All of the above?

Guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete drivel...","review":"As a \\"D-Girl,\\" I can say with certainty that this book will not help anyone get into the business or handle the perils and pitfalls of working in Hollywood. An expensive wardrobe and toned body are appreciated in L.A., but they won't make or break your career. Period. No wonder Hadley Davis washed out of the business so quickly. It's clear that she has neither the smarts nor the savvy to deal with a development job over the long term. There are many other books which will give youmore insight into the business. This one is a huge waste of time, and the author has zero credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow advice most everyone already knows","review":"The glossary in this book \\"defines\\" such arcane industry terms as: script, delivered, at the end of the day, manager, shop, hot, buzz, heat, the business, the industry, box office, schmooze, etc.Her entire definition for \\"the business\\" is: \\"Is there any other?\\"But \\"the industry\\" is so well covered by the media, most farmers in Iowa probably already know most of what's in this book. Nothing in this book a few episodes of ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, or a week in front of E! won't explain.WANNABE is a far more insightful true-life book on the life of an \\"industry\\" temp, and Rob Long's CONVERSATIONS WITH MY AGENT is a great inside look on sitcom writing.Take away the \\"glossary of definitions\\" and Davis' book barely comes in at 150 pages. Less, since much of the book is filler and happy talk and blank pages and cutesy drawings.If this book has rave reviews, it's because people like to see their name in print, and Davis name drops and praises no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop the insanity","review":"Can we please all agree to a ceasefire! Yes, D-Girl is a useless book written by a pathetically unqualified woman, but this is Hollywood, folks. Since when is talent rewarded? Give her some credit for not letting an utterly unspectacular career stand in her way. Franky, I wish I had her flair for shameless exaggeration and opportunism. She parlayed a silly little assistant job into a stupid little book, then hitched her wagon to a writing partner with a fancy TV job. Such flagrant self-promotion is nothing to sneeze at.I guess karma is a boomerang, though, since Davis got axed from the show a short time later once they realized who the real talent of the pair was. Still, I don't have a book deal, and I have a lot more to say than Ms. Davis. But I guess that's not saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a weak book!","review":"You won't get anything useful out of this... it's an empty, moronic book written by an apparent airhead who has nothing to offer other than glamour tips.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"The reader in Massachusetts has a good point. What use is a how-to guide when the author is such a flagrantly dishonest individual? When I worked in \\"the biz\\" in New York, Hadley was unaffectionately known as \\"Hadajob\\" for her series of lateral, entry-level moves. Perhaps the reason the book is so empty and silly (although, I must confess, I actually couldn't get through it)is because the author never got beyond the cubicle. Instead of a chapter on something truly helpful, say advice on honing scriptnotes, we get tips on xeroxing. As they say in writing programs, write what you know.I suggest Ms. Davis try her hand at fiction next. Not only does she clearly have an overactive imagination, but, judging from the number of positive reader reviews here, she is obviously quite prolific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying it!","review":"Well, I can't say that I'm surprised that there are so many reviews... there's nothing like a trashy book on the business to get everyone hot and bothered. The book is really not worth much. Unfortunately, Hadley represents much of what's wrong with her generation. Like many of the young people who are attracted to Hollywood, she has no real talent or brains -- instead she relies on image, superficiality, and appearance. While there were some funny bits that rang true, there was no substance to the book -- it was a just series of silly remarks from the mouth of a silly girl. When I read Hadley's bio, I expected something more intelligent (I'm curious how much Mr. Davis gave to Penn to accept his daughter) but found that the book was really a waste of my time. It was also disappointing (but typical) that Hadley had friends and associates write rave reviews on the Amazon site. Hopefully, this book will disappear and Hadley will build a career based on substance instead of spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"CheesecakeGirl hopes Cheesy Title sells poorly written book","review":"The title & cover photo say it all. It's almost like Ms. Davis is saying, 'Wheee! Lookit me. I'm a Hollywood Player, guys, and now you have to take back all those things you said about me being a ditz.' Holding a copy of Variety, sitting by some scripts, talking on the phone, wearing an expensive/stylish retro minimal outfit while flashing a smile that cost a lot and a hairstyle of equal value-sheesh!!!Fashion tips replace insight and it doesn't merit being a how-to book of any kind.Book tries to titilitate instead of teach & flops. NO tip is offered that is of value that you couldn't figure out yourself.Oh well, she'll make someone a great trophy wife.

This is not so much a book about making it in the movie business as it is a quick look inside the life of a young woman with money who is having fun at a job she sees as the ultimate in glamour. It is more a book about how and where to buy accessories and designer labels, and how to live according to the guidlines of In Style Magazine. The only part of the book that I found really offered solid advice was the glossary of terms. The rest, unfortunately, is more like a very long diary entry written by a woman who's convinced she's Made It. If adapted into fiction, it could possibly read like a satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a credible source","review":"There are many angry reviews here. True, the book is awful. true, it is shallow. true, the person who is serious about this job could probably use more substantial and intelligent advice than what is offered... Now here's another one to add to the pile: The author is not honest. In a recent interview in a magazine, she claimed to do a particular, specific job for a certain filmmaker... who my uncle works for, and has worked for for about fifteen years. Interestingly, neither he nor anyone else in the office has ever had contact with her, much less heard of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most insipid book ever?","review":"Ms. Davis' book represents a new low for publishing--the insipid chronicle of a woman who could get vertigo in a sewer.

Unknown to Ko-Ko, Nanki-Poo is actually the son of the Mikado, traveling incognito to avoid an undesirable marriage! Hilarity ensues as the various characters find love...or at least marriage.This is a very good production of The Mikado, with a very good cast, and excellent scenery.

Candy and Levy star as the protagonists who are forced to join a security agency when all other options fail. Revolving around a plot involving corruption and crooked cops Candy and Levy aim to get to the bottom of all that is wrong while [complicating matters] frequently. I really laughed a lot at this film. Candy and Levy make a great team and offer up some very hysterical scenes. Levy's attempts at being a defense attorney, Candy fishing at a pier, and the two crashing a ball thrown for the chief of police all seem like harmless events but these two always know how to screw them all up.

The sound quality is fine (actually it is better than when I was the Winos in 93), and the angles, etc. are what you would expect for the late 80s. The only problem was that it was shot on video and Richards was forced to have it released in order to plug the hole in the number of bootlegs flooding the market throughout the years. Otherwise, if the docu-concert was a planned one, given to adequate editing, et al., this would have been a masterpiece.

Set in Florida, mostly during the 50's and 60's, the book follows the intertwined lives of a couple of teenage girls, their friends and families. Carter gets all the details right. Her senses of place and time are pitch perfect, from her description of the toniest beauty parlor in town to her evocation of a sultry Florida night. She knows what teenagers of the day wore and worried about, and she knows what their mothers cooked and worried about. Humane, funny and beautifully written, this book is so full of life it breathes.

The story takes through the years as the Landys and the Lockharts grow up. Charlie Landy, Crystal's brother has many special gifts to give to the community. He falls in love with Dinah. Crystal and Dinah grow apart over the years but family and love bring them back together. Her mother Victoria is an unpredictable character, and tends to cause a great amount of anxiety to those around her. Tessie is able to fall in love even though Jerry is still a part of her life.

This book has some few beautiful photographs, and several lovely sayings -- but it seems superficial and communicates little useful information about the place and culture.

I find this relativistic approach to be frustrating, since I believe there are values which should be universally understood and applied (such as, \\"do not control/manipulate other people\\", etc.) I side-stepped this relativism by continually reminding myself that, even if I am sure that there is inappropriate behavior, the person involved is almost always \\"damaged\\" in some obvious way by his/her past.

If you are looking for a practical book with great ideas, that will help you get control of your anger, and perhaps help you to realize that whatever is bothering you shouldn't...this isn't the book for you. I found the book to be over-simplified, with a demeaning child-like quality to many of the ideas and \\"exercises\\" it has you do. I was very unimpressed, and found that the only real benefit from the book came from the breathing exercises... Don't bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"The authors view of anger as being detrimental to ones self, as well as the idea that the entire population has been misinformed on the dangers of being angry, is in a word simplistic. The book is helpful if what you are angry about is something \\"silly\\", but if your anger is more complex their book has a belittling quality to it. The book did little more than skim issues and tell you your \\"bad\\" to be angry. Better off punching your pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing Anger","review":"\\"When Anger Hurts\\" is an excellent book. I had mistakenly believed that to hold in anger was bad for your health both physically and psychologically. Although I never got angry with my casual friends, my \\"loved ones\\" were not spared. I realized something wasn't right about the way I was expressing my anger. This book was an excellent source of information for me. It made me look at how anger is good if we use it to propel us to positive action. If you read this book, you will gain tremendous insight on what triggers anger. It will amaze you! This knowledge alone will help you to use your anger more effectively and appropriately. We need not make our lives painful. Holding onto anger and blaming only make our lives less joyous. This book will help you live a life that is more fulfilling. It will at least give you a wonderful start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical self-help","review":"Although the book does give a few good pointers on how best to deal with your anger, I think that the best remedy is to seek a great counselor. As a therapist in training, we review many \\"self-help\\" books and although they are comical in their over-generalized answers, there is no substitute for a good therapy session. Real anger cannot be quashed by reading a self help book, and this book isn't going to offer you what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sat in the warehouse too long","review":"When I received this pedometer, the display did not work.

You need, however, to spend many hours listening to the thirty or so great singers of the last century. Particularly, you can profit from listening to other tenors who've developed the sultry undertones--even Neal Sedaka has some--needed for romantic ballads. The delicate tenor sound--which helped end my father's career--went out with the thirties. Listen to lots of tenor-baritone John Gary (fascinating bio), Jerry Vale, and many baritones--Frank, Vic, Steve Lawrence. And even some of the women--Sarah Vaughan, Ella, Edie Gorme, etc.) to absorb variety and flexibility. You won't sound like them. Find a pop vocal coach with some kind of a track record. (The best in New York can take someone with little voice and make miracles.) Natalie Cole had no apparent talent--so embarrassing her father discouraged her, and hear her today! Listen, study, broaden your voice and musical horizons. Do you get Music Choice on digital tv? You can buy fewer cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD makes a better Frisbee!","review":"I get more out of this CD using it as a mirror than I do playing what's on it. This guy is a horrible singer and should have his vocal cords ripped out. Then he can communicate on paper and not have to irritate the rest of us with his voice. A good singer understands what he's singing, can share his emotions with the audience through his voice, and has the vocal talent that makes us want to listen. Since Paul Hull has none of these qualities, I don't understand why he didn't become a male nurse. Skip past this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Awful Movie","review":"The only reason to watch this low budget action flick is to see a young Sharon Stone, the movie itself is so pathetically inept I'm sure Sharon would like to delete this clunker from her resume, the screenplay and dialogue are so bad as to make one think a teenager made it up and the action scenes are mediocre too.

The author has done a tremendous service for all of us who love mathematics and to entice many mathematicians to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful overview of mathematics.","review":"I love this book because it covers a huge span of mathematics topics in a very thoughtful and entertaining way. There are many diagrams, examples, cartoons and drawings that make difficult topics easy to visualize.I bought this book a few years ago and continued to use it as a reference tool until the math I was doing became too advanced. When I need to teach a topic I will often reference this book to see if I can improve my own explanations. I have often suggested this book to students who are interested in mathematics but aren't planning to become mathematicians because the material presented is thorough but not too technical or too formal.Many of the great ideas in mathematics are explained in this book in a way that a curious math student will enjoy coming back to over many years.Highly suggested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone. It truly captures the spirit of mathematics. Without a doubt, Gullberg dedicated a good portion of his life writing this book.

Can anyone confirm that it is a small mistake or that it has been corrected? Such a book deserves to be totally free of typos, especially for such an important part of the book: the fundamental theorem.

My high school calculus, algebra, geometry and trigonometry were not enough to prevent a lot of frustration and inability to understand many steps in the logic. You need a year of college calculus at least to start on the book. I agree with the other reviewers that the book is well organized with a delightful writing style and lots of amusing illustrations. I will get back to it after studying more calculus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriotism","review":"While General Lee certainly had his flaws, a lack of patriotism was not one of them. It was precisely this profound love of country that led him to serve the Confederacy, defending Virginia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically researched","review":"I can't beleive all the 5-star reviews of this book on this site. I happened to see the author on CSPAN-s \\"Booknotes\\" program and he was utterly inept and ill-informed on Lee. He did *not* know that date of Chancellorsville, he did not know when Lee graduated from West Point, he did *not* know the general that faced Lee at the Seven's Day, he didn't even know who Ulysses S. Grant was! How can anyone put their faith in an author who obviously did no research into this book? He is not an historian, he's a businessman. Why would anyone buy such a book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee would be embarassed.","review":"Of the half dozen books about Lee I've read this is by far the most disappointing. Mr.Crocker is of the school that still can't accept that the Civil War was fought to perserve the Union. It's still 'The War Between the States' to the author and he insists that the south lost only because Lee's generals (Longstreet in particular) were at fault. In Crocker's version Lee was perfect. This is sad because even the old General himself knew his own shortcomings and accepted them.Lee was a fine gentleman but one can't lose sight of the fact that he turned his back on his country and took up arms against it even after having taken the oath on the plain at West Point. There are several excellent biographies on Lee... this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"R.E. Lee is J.C.!","review":"Crocker the Third describes R.E. Lee as the second coming and then develops articulate reasons why the slaves should not have been freed by the cursed Union, who fought against God, the angels, and of course the blessed Lee. It then applies these lessons to personal growth and leadership. I could only read a bit in the beginning. Then I had to take a shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant","review":"Of all the books I have read, classes I have taken, and conferences I have attended, this book on leadership TOPS THEM ALL! Robert E Lee's life and teachings should be required reading in every classroom from elementary to graduate school. It is a shame that the views of the civil war have been so pervetedly twisted in society today that Reobert E Lee has been put on the back shelf, when his teaching and life are an absolute must for a country that hasn't had a true leader in decades. If you want to follow the status quo, sign up for another conference, if you want to think, talk, and act like a leader....buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership from a truly great leader","review":"It doesn't matter which side of the Civil War that you would have supported, Robert E Lee was a great leader of men and truly a great man of character. This is not a biography on Lee's life, this is simply an easy to read and informative read about some of the characteristics that made Lee a great leader. If you are looking for an in-depth biography on Lee you might want to pick up \\"Lee\\" by Freeman, but if you are looking for an interesting book about what makes a truly great leader this book is well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character Counts","review":"I hadn't known much about the famous general, aside from what little was taught in High School history class, so I found this to be a terrifically interesting read. While I'm not sure what a presumeably humble man like Lee would have thought about such an analytical look at his life, it does make an excellent case for finding contemporary parallels between Lee's leadership strengths and successful modern leaders.Integrity, compassion, strength & grace under fire (in Lee's case, literally!) are sought-after and challenging qualities for great businessmen and this homage to Lee might well inspire many.The final chapter, \\"Lee's Lieutenants,\\" seemed oddly anticlimactic. I'm not quite sure why the Editor decided to stick it in at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration in Personal & Professional Character!","review":"Harry Crocker does and excellent job of showing how Robert E. Lee lived his life profesionally and personally. In doing this he has developed a unique parallel to how we can apply this to the modern day business leader in a simple and effective approach. Also, this gives us an understanding of the intelligence and gentlemen qualities Lee possess and how he gained unilateral respect among his President, Army personnel and from the Union Military Leaders too. This is a book one can use as a reference guide in Leadership and how to handle the day to day challenges we face in a complex and changing business environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert E Lee, On Leadership:","review":"Books on R. E. Lee depict an outstanding man for all times. He was born to aristocracy and had the means to meet mundane problems head on. He was responsible for the end of slavery, for had he not been so successful a general, the war would of have been over before much was done about it. Hail to R.E Lee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into the man","review":"Very well written. Lee's use of talent and limited resources reflect his brilliance as a leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applying the lessons learned from Lee","review":"Rather than preaching about Lee's leadership style, Crocker details how Lee made decisions during the Civil War and applies those experiences to the business world today. The summaries Crocker provides at the end of each chapter help to focus the reader on the most important points made. The major themes focused on are setting and achieving goals, risk-taking, and personal humility and how they can lead to victory (in battle or business challenge.)This book is valuable not only to managers, but parents, clergy and anyone else in a leadership role. The lessons are straight-forward and easily applied to daily/business life. For those of us that are managers, our staffs and co-workers will certainly thank us for reading and applying the information. It is certain that any reader will come away with useful new ideas on leadership that they have not considered before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I purchased this book because I am a leadership junkie. It is an awesome leadership book ... one of the best I have read. This book also does a great job on Civil War history and telling of Lee. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in any of the three subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide for our leaders in Washington","review":"Many of our politicians in Washington would be better served if they read H.W. Crocker's recent work. Crocker portrays an individual who is a giant compared to the \\"statesmen\\" who currently inhabit the hallowed halls of Congress and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is a fascinating read and sets the record straight for those who malign Lee and find him contemptible because he fought for the Confederacy. An enjoyable work about an inspirational character."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best leadership books I have ever read. I love how the author makes the emotion of General Lee come to life. What a true gentleman. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"This book should be required reading for people put into any leadership role. It draws heavily upon Civil War history, and, therefore, may be foreign material for non-history types, but I recommend it. With 25 years commission service (Army regulars and reserves) and 25 years in business, I would put this into the hands of any subordinate in whose career I was interested in enhancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must read for anyone in a position of authority.","review":"The strength of this book are the leadership lessons that transcend their historical context. Lee's personal and professional challenges are succinctly illustrated through Crocker's insight and intellect. Today's leaders will benefit from this work as well as be challenged by the ethics and morality of Lee's life. Regardless of your views on the Civil War or comprehensive knowledge of it, you will enjoy and be educated by the thought provoking decisions Lee made and how he made them."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think Abraham Lincoln was great, read this!","review":"An absolutely fascinating treatment of perhaps the greatest American of the 19th Century. An understated evaluation of the personal qualities that made General Lee the dominant figure of the Civil War era. Having read a number of how-to-do-it books on management over many years, I rate this as the most practical and interesting of all. I did major in history, so my perspective is not that of an MBA whizzkid. This book has substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the top!","review":"The little Australian with the BIG voice. A must for lovers of show tunes, this album by the much-loved scene-stealer of stages across London's West End showcases her powerful voice (piano accompaniment only) and her utter mastery of it - poignant tenderness to full-blown belt, and never too much of either.

And he pretty much stunk on SNL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to the used-DVD bin","review":"This is utterly and spectacularly lame. Jim Breuer is a modestly talented sketch comic (mid-90's SNL) but excruciating at stand-up. Lots of yelling, mugging, and running around the stage but it just ain't funny, dude. We did smile at his spot-on AC/DC imitation, but that was the show's finale.Looks like most other reviews here are friends-and-family, with pandering quotes like \\"You almost get exhausted by just watching him run around the stage like a madman. There is hardly a second that goes by where you're not laughing hysterically.\\" Rrrrrighht... My wife and I were so exhausted we switched to C-SPAN and got more laughs watching \\"Prime Minister's Question Time\\" in British Parliament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"I bought this as a present for myself after hearing him on satellite radio and recognizing him as Goat Boy. My husband and I watched it together and both seriously came close to wetting our pants! Jim is very physical with his comedy and his impersonations are head on (especially ACDC). I was also impressed by the fact that he is pretty clean (maybe 3-4 cursewords in the entire routine). Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good general map for White Mountains Nat.

It is not necessarily detailed enough for longer wilderness trips, but overall an excellent overview map."},{"rating":"1","title":"No latitude/longitude coordinates marked","review":"This map has No latitude/longitude coordinates marked.

So this map is NOT very useful for hiking the presi traverse in winter time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful-seems too subjective","review":"I received this book from either my mom or my aunt who's quite religious. The authors seem very close-minded. It's a book for someone who is fanatically religious and some of the statements made in the book are a bit ridiculous, mentioning that movies like Harry Potter and Astrology is evil. Also, it's very discriminating against gays, the book gives the idea of homosexuality being unacceptable. There's also a typo on page 165 saying \\"You many even feel proud of your new hairy look.\\" It had a few good points but overall it was so very one-sided. I didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to follow","review":"I've done yoga for more than 15 years but this was the first time I was introducing it to my five year old daughter to it and it was a disaster. It's not instruction but rather a vaguely creepy home movie with no pose explanation or preemting to give you a chance to help your child transition between moves. Frequently the camera is focused on the grass for no reason what so ever so you can't even see if you are positioned correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book has influenced me greatly.","review":"Armstrong takes a tough stand on how this therapy is able to be effective for any disease.

Just a warning after a few days if wearing it around the house, you start to get stronger neck muscles because it weighs 4 pounds.One problem was the band and condition of the steel. I did nor get the band and there were a few minor cracks in the steel rim. The liner is adjustable but the buckles are old and one of mine broke.

That isn't made as clear as it could be on this page.I guess you already know this volume deals mostly with the characters' pasts.Now, what did I think of it? Glad you asked. I liked it. It's both funny and serious. Although I must say it can be a bit confusing; sometimes it seems to jump around without enough explanation).Dragon Knights feels like shojo to me, even though it seems to be mostly magic / action and not much romance. The characters are very cute although drawn a little weird sometimes. (Rune looks like a girl sometimes.) They're skinny and (especially Rath!) young-looking. Also hair tends to be a big thing with the artist. And think Clamp's pointy-male-faces, only more so.Okay, here's my question. Does anyone else think Rath looks a lot like a very young, sweet version of Hiei? (The hair, the fire powers, eagerness to fight...) Hm. He is far more cheerful than Hiei, though. Which is kind of nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued! I will never use Avon again!","review":"I am so fed up with Avon! Every time I find something I like, they discontinue it!

All the artists on the album are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save trees, do not buy this CD.","review":"Alright so CDs aren't made from trees, but the CD insert is.I didn't like Taylor's Nosferatu. This, however, is worse. How can that be, you ask yourself? I wondered the same thing. Perhaps it's that this music is even more painfully trite, full of stereotyped mock-Shakespearan synthesizers. Message to the composer: they didn't have synthesizers in those days. Hire real musicians. If you aren't making enough from your CD sales to hire them, meditate on why this might be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cast but repetative music","review":"I like the cast and there is some lovely singing on this CD but the music is repetative and the lyrics are often bad enough to make you laugh out loud. I think it takes a very special composer to do justice to Shakespeare, and, well, this isn't him. If you know the original play the contrast between Shakespeare's language and wit and the lyrics in this musical will be especially painful to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools....","review":"This is an awesome DVD and well worth the money if you are looking for real relevant tools to help you along your path. You pop in the DVD and feel like you are part of a class of regular people, just like you, there to learn a technique to use in your own way, perhaps with your own group. The information is presented well and orderly both in explanation and demonstration. Everything worth having takes work and you have to be willing to practice the techniques and find what works best for you to succeed. Peter Paddon provides the foundation to build on. Considering what others charge for a class along these lines, the price of the DVD is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"The worst video you can imagine....I would suggest NOT buying this, or you will be disappointed!I cannot believe this man would charge $30, or even $5 for this horrible home video.This terribly made video is a man telling a class of 15 or so people to put their hands close together to feel the energy. Then he gets them to look across the room, and try to see someone's aura. He just says blur your eyes and try to see it. Now you've just read the whole lesson...you don't need to buy it, lol.In the second half of the movie, he calls on a spirit and pretends it has entered his body. I believe this is possible for people to do, but I'm pretty darn sure he hasn't done this in the video. There is no purpose for this, as this 'entity' has no relevant knowledge to offer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and necessary","review":"Anyone who is interested in knowing WHY the crips and bloods gangs exist needs to see this. I watched it many times with my son and I feel we both got a much needed history lesson and insight into one of the problems that face Americans Descended from Africa. The first part of the documentary gave insight to the \\"Black Power\\" movement of the 70's and how all the black leaders were crushed by the American establishment. After that the Gangs were the only outlet for the young black men of southern California which ran unchecked for years as long as they stayed in their own areas, not affecting white America. This documentary should be necessary viewing for ALL of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring propaganda","review":"This is not a documentary about the Crips and Bloods. It is sensationalist propaganda about white oppression of blacks. It's poorly researched and simply wants the viewer to think these murderous thugs had no choice to live their evil lives. It does a disservice to those who rejected this life and worked their way out of poverty and crime. This is a serious documentary like \\"National Enquirer\\" is a serious newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching To The Choir","review":"I was excited when I bought this at Amazon, hoping to get an in depth look at the Gangs and the history of L.A. Instead, I was treated to a barrage of one-on-one interviews with \\"former\\" gang bangers, and their portrayal of what it was and is to be Black and segregated. The fact this whole film was dedicated to blaming Large corporations for deserting Black Families and leaving them no other choice but to become Criminals, left a bad taste in my mouth. The up side to this movie is that their were a few instances in which the truth about innocent bystanders being caught in the crossfire were brought to light. Overall, it starts out promising, but becomes monotonous after about 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary...just not what I expected.","review":"I recently purchased this DVD from the store since all the reviews on here were pretty much a 4 or 5 and that it was done by Stacey Peralta who does awesome work. I put the DVD in and sat back and watched the history on these two gangs, black rights, gangs then and now, and so on. I enjoyed this documentary but was a little disappointed because I was looking for some knitty-gritty doc where it shows day to day gang life with shootings, crack deals, drinkin' 40's and rollin' blunts, and tons of eff bombs like \\"mutha eff this\\" and \\"mutha eff that\\", and all that other great jazz that goes along in a gang bangers life.

Peralta is probably America's most talented documentary filmmaker (sorry, overrated Mikey Moore) by letting the people involved tell the story.By tying the two riots (Watts in '65 and the Rodney King trial verdict one of '92) together as well as showing how African Americans were ghettoized by a combination of segregated real estate policies and heavyhanded policing, the movie paints a damning picture of the US as a whole in its inability to offer solutions to a solvable problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's NOT just a gang thing","review":"I lived my entire life in the Greater Los Angeles area, and NEVER was I even aware of what was going on thirty miles away.

It's roomy and comfortable, and she can buckle herself in and out (makes her feel like a BIG girl) No problems at all with the seat! Material shows no wear after quite a few washes. The seat will stand up on it's own on the floor, you just have to click the seat all the way upright. No problems with losing food in the cupholders either. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great booster seat! Fit great in the 2nd and 3rd row seating in my minivan. When my twins get old enough for a booster I will be buying the same one. But only one with the flower print, I don't think her brother would like it!

It will not stand straight up unless it leans on something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Booster","review":"I just bought this booster for my four year old daughter and she loves it! I like the way that the head rest is contoured and she doesn't fall out if she falls asleep. She loves the color since it is the only purple one that we could find. This booster is better that the old Britax where the kids would fall all the way over if they fell asleep.

If you have ever tried to get a worship team of amateurs to play along with a click track - you know thats pretty much impossible.

The images are phenomenal - the video editor who made this is very gifted - but the subtitles showing the lyrics to the song (the whole reason one would get this product) has only one setting - white letters very small.For such limited options available on the lyrical edge and the limited number of songs per DVD It seems a bit much to me. I have DVD A and will not be getting any others. Glad I got a deal on it at the Christian bookstore...My advice? borrow another church's to see it before you buy it.

Counterfeit?","review":"I don't think these are genuine Lenovo products.First of all, these are only rated for 3 amps, and the Lenovo product is rated at 7 amps in the US.

I unplugged this adapter and plugged in the the REAL Lenovo adapter that came with my machine during the same usage and it was barely warm.I don't know if these are counterfeit, but I do know that I threw mine away and wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I think they are actually dangerous to use due to the overheating issue and the low Amperage rating.

Amazon were nice enough to help me to resolve the issue and give me a refund.I thought that I might be the lucky one and get the bad batch on the first order; thus, I decide to give it another chance.I order the 2nd one, and now it died within 2 months. I'm not an abusive owner nor I use it all the time. As of matter of fact, I can count with one hand on how many times have I use it within these 2 months.This time around, I got a NASTY surprise from the charger. Not only it died, but it also took my tablet with it to the bucket. I can smell the burning odor from the charger and my tablet lost its light forever.So do yourself a favor, if you must order the charger, get the charger from Lenovo itself. At least Lenovo will try to stand behind their product or accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two-prong plug saved the day!","review":"I bought this for my daughter's college laptop, so that she wouldn't have to lug an adaptor home on breaks.It works fine, but I just recently discovered an added benefit.The original equipment has a 3-prong plug, but the plug for this part is only two-prong.We were about to embark on a long trip, and she needed to be able to use the laptop on the road.The minivan we rented had an AC power outlet, as well as the usual cigarette lighter ones.

However, I've had to replace the battery and charger(s), so logically I bought these parts from Lenovo.However, it's very obvious that since taking over production from IBM, Lenovo has redesigned these parts so they are cheaper to make, less streamlined, more cumbersome, and less reliable.

I decided to keep the original packaging and return the item, but since my laptop was functioning correctly I didn't rush to do so. (My mistake!) Yesterday when I turned on the laptop there was a loud \\"POP!\\" from the adapter and my laptop immediately switched to battery power since the adapter was dead.

There was no way my laptop recognized the charger, I tried everything but it. just. doesn't. work.What a scam.Sadly, I live outside the US and it was cheaper for me to buy another one from a local seller (about twice the the price) than returning it (at least it'd be easier to return it here than to the US).

The adapter I got was indeed original however it wasn't exactly new or unused. The AC adapter itself is fine, spits out the current voltage and current amount of current as expected. It was however manufactured in 2009. The problem was that someone has clearly spliced a new head onto the adapter and hasn't done a very good job of it. Occasionally it will not power my laptop and it'll require some turning in the port to actually make a connection.I half expected it for the low low price I paid and it's not the end of the world as I'm only using the adapter as a spare one on my desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not perfect","review":"I bought this charger as a back up to keep in my backpack for when I get stuck somewhere out and about without my original charger.

We placed the foam mattress on it and with the boxed frame and it didn't caved down in the middle in a little over a month.

At least with the battery operated chargers they lasted about 2yrs, NOT 2 months. WASTE OF MONEY.. So now I need to order a battery op frother. Save your time and your money and opt for battery operated NOT the Non-replaceable,2 month life battery.

This one has severe attitude with the on and off switch! It is supposed to be spring loaded and turn off when you release the button. NOT! More than once I have had to clean the walls and my clothes after the goofy thing would not turn off. It frequently causes over flow onto the counter because it will not properly release the power like it should. I will get another frother when this one dies but not this one!

My hope was that it would recharge after every use and being environmentally consciencious would put my mind at ease. Well, the recharging base is not \\"smart\\" so you have to drain out the # of uses before putting it back on the base. The battery has memory so if by accident you put it back on the base, the life span of the battery is shortened.

We used this item several times a day and charged it only when is was almost discharged. It last just a few months. When it was new it worked great. We then went back to a standard frother using alkaline batteries. They only last a couple of weeks.Today after it had been sitting in my garage for a few months I was getting ready to throw it away when I decided to see if could be fixed, I do that to almost all things that break, I can't help myself, I am an engineer. Seeing no screws I resorted to brut force and grabbed it with both hands and tried to break it in two. To my amazement, it came apart and revealed two replaceable NiMH batteries. It snaps back togher also. It had AA 600mAh batteries inside. I ordered 4 POWEREX AA 2700mAH for $14 though Amazon. The higher capacity batteries should make it last much longer between charges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo electric frother","review":"I bought this frother over a year ago hoping to do something for the environment by not using AA batteries all the time. The frother worked fine to begin with, but after a few months started to show ever slower performance cycles until I had to re-charge it. Now, I know why - thanks to the reviewer who pointed out that this frother has NiCad AA 1.2 volt non replaceable batteries in it. The way this frother is marketed is really misleading. I would not have bought it had I known that it contains batteries and on top it batteries that you can't replace. I probably charged it to often, to close in time, by now something rattles on the inside like something came loose. I will go back to the traditional AA battery operated frothers until something better appears on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this product","review":"I've had this rechargeable frother for a year and continue to enjoy it every day. I love my frothy lattes! As suggested in another review, I don't leave the charger plugged in, but just recharge as necessary. It goes for a long time on one charge. I've had the battery-operated type in the past and the one I had wasn't as powerful - and the batteries needed replacing frequently. I've just ordered two more of these as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect","review":"I bought this Bonjour Frother to replace one that died after about 5 years of use. It does a fantastic job of frothing milk, but you need to follow the instructions about unplugging the unit because eventually the battery will not take sufficient charge to work if it keeps recharging after only losing a little of its charge. While waiting for the replacement, I used a little battery-charged frother that I bought from World Market for just over $2. That worked almost as well as the Bonjour Frother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought","review":"Bought this unit after about 4 months batties died.

Even ten or fifteen years ago you could buy a product that would last a few years. It seems like now most items you buy are total crap!!!!! I'm so fed up as a consumer. I know $20 isn't alot of money, but it's the principle of it. I will NOT buy another product from this brand! I would rather pay twice as much and get a frother that would last at least a year.

The first one she got was broken out of the box. One of the wires was not connected to anything. We took that one back to the store which exchanged it for no cost. The second one immediately had a piece fall into the toy when we open the section to install a battery. Now the battery cover won't screw down and has to be held in place. Neither box showed signs of damage so I really doubt that the damage was caused in shipping. Also the original purchase and the exchange were down at stores of the same chain but in two different states. The store unbelievably sells this toy for $15 when it's workmanship suggest it should only be found on the shelves of a dollar store. I'll not be buying any more products from Pressman."},{"rating":"1","title":"New \\"improved\\" version is awful","review":"We had the old version, shown in the first two photos, and it was great fun for our two year old. We had several broken fish and eventually it just stopped working after a small plastic piece under the switch died, so we decided to replace it. This new version has several flaws.1. Fish are smaller than the previous version and much harder to \\"catch\\" especially if you're 2 and using your fingers.2. The old one started slow then speed up as the game went on, this new version is on faster speed the whole time. Even I can barely catch any fish.3. It's overall smaller and less durable, it came with two fish already broken and several of the eye stickers were missing. The old fish don't fit properly in this one so we can't use those as backups.Overall it's a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same game we grew up with","review":"We had this game growing up and loved it. Like most toys, now that everything is made so cheaply overseas, this was a huge disappointment. It is very cheaply made. When it arrived many of the fish were already missing their sticker eyes...and the rest came off within just a few uses. The poles used to have a thick string on the end (um, like a fishing pole!) but these are plastic that get stuck at the hinge. Overall it's just cheap. I wish we would've saved our game from the early 90s...sure it still would've worked better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun with Let's Go Fishin","review":"It's good fun for my 3-yr old. It does help with the motor skills, hand-eye coordination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been recalled","review":"When I first got this toy, my kids loved it and I did too. We had lots of fun. However, I want to address that this toy can be a hazard. My son almost lost his finger with this game! I'm not sure if this has been recalled. A toddler/kid can stick their fingers on an empty fish slot while the game is on and can get their fingers caught in it. I turned off the game quickly, but the gears have already caught my sons finger really bad and it was impossible to unscrew those tiny screws! I tried to get his finger free for like 5-10+ mins. to no avail. I had to call my husband at work to come home (and my mom-in-law who was in town) to help me. My son was screaming and crying and fingers almost turning blue. Thankfully, my husband works about 5 minutes from home and yanked the toy apart to save my boys' finger. Needless to say, we threw that toy away and would never buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can get stuck on thumbs!!!!","review":"My kids loved playing this game, but if they take the fishes out, they can get stuck on their tumbs....the little plastic teeth sink into the skin, needless to say after about 20 minutes I finally free'd my son's thumbs and the game went in the trash, not taking anymore chances!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the motor does not work the first time","review":"the motor does not work well the first time. It got stuck so often and makes loud noises that scares my son. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Service Call","review":"We have the older version of this game, but most of the fish and the poles have broken. But my 3 1/2 yo and 8 yo still love to play with it, so I thought I'd get them a new one. It came so fast - the next day! But when we opened it, even though it was sealed in plastic, it was missing the poles. I called customer service the next morning and left a message with the story. They called me back within 5 minutes, apologized, took some info from the box and are sending out poles. The boys were a little disappointed they couldn't play right away, but CS was very helpful and I would purchase from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Toy was broken and missing pieces.

We had it on when he came downstairs. He played with it immediately and really enjoyed it. 20 min later - it was dead - we don't know why. Tried changing the batteries, nothing worked. We are returning it to Santa's workshop to get repaired. Perhaps just a defective one, but was disappointed and annoyed I have to deal with returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining toy for 2yr old and 4 yr old","review":"I love this game except my 2 yr old broke the end off 2 of the fishing poles. I finally found a place to order replacement parts [...] It was hard at first to catch the fish, but it only takes a little bit of practice and even my 2 yr old could catch some fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple but fun","review":"The game is simple; nothing extremely educational here, but fun for my 3 year old. Of course it's all what you make out of it. We talk about the colors, count the fish, ect. It is louder than most toys I would generally buy, but overall it's great for a rainy day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This is a classic game.

They love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea but not so great toy","review":"My son loves almost every game there is, he is three, including boring candyland, but this game is too hard for little ones and boring for older ones.First problem: The hooks of the poles come off so one of ours fell off and now our pole is a stupid stick.Second problem: It spins too fast. My son was trying so hard to catch one and every once in awhile he would but he would just get bored.Third problem: You basically shove the stick in the mouth and flip it out cause it doesn't really latch on.Fourth problem: The eyes fall off cause they are stickers and they don't really stick at all.I really wish I would have read reviews and chose a different game. I'm so sad. It's totally boring too cause you don't do much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - too fagile for kids","review":"Just like the Alian game, this one too is far too fagile for children to play. the \\"fishing pole\\" is flimsey and the \\"hook\\" snaps right off (choaching hazard). Without the hook on the pole the game cannot be played. The poles break at the joint then they are too short to use. The fish jaws snap off and they break easily at the connection point as well.Seriously, this one is just another version of a super cheap, flimsy, use it once and send it to the landfill kind of game. Don't bother.I can't believe the company pumped this toy out after the marketplace expience with the Alian toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this!","review":"This is a cheaply made game!The plastic part that suppose to open the battery holder, doesn't open, it is broken in some way.waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic Toy","review":"I bought this because I remember playing this game when I was younger. Unfortunately, the concept is great, but the product is poorly made. They should have magnets on the fishing pool hooks instead of hooks that you have to angle at a particular way to catch the fish. My son is 2 and he ended up trying to drag the fish out of their holes. Also, the battery door screw doesn't screw in, so we have to tape the battery door. I should've returned it, but figured it wasn't worth the hassle for the price. Many made in China products are much better made than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun, even the littlest can enjoy!","review":"My little 2 year old loves this toy! She asks me to get it out for her over and over. The version we have we bought from a yard sale and we have lost some of the pieces, so I am going to buy it again for her birthday. She has loved playing with this for atleast a year and has a great time with it all by herself and if you have other kids like me, you know this is a great thing at times! I think it is great for her eye hand coordination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic but \\"character\\" themes may be more popular","review":"I bought this for my niece and nephews for Christmas and they had fun playing the game. It teaches good hand-eye coordination and timing. Let's Go Fishin also comes in movie themes like Cars, Toy Story, Disney Princess, etc., which I found out after I bought the original version. The game was easy for the kids to learn and the adults also enjoyed playing with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed:(","review":"We got this toy for Christmas for our little girl and we just opened it for game night for the first time. Put a new battery in it and turned it on but all it did was make the motorized noise. Tried another brand new battery from a different pack and it did the same thing. My daughter is making the best of it and just fishing anyways but you can't actually play the game so she was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Game","review":"Although my daughter loved the playing with this toy, it is almost impossible for a child to actually catch the fish. (I could barely do it myself!) The fish are not magnetic and the only way to catch them is by snagging the fishing pole line with a tiny bead on the four front (and only) teeth of the fish. Too hard for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made...","review":"Unfortunately I thought this toy would be great, but the quality was not. 5 of the fishes were missing the \\"stickers\\" that make up the \\"eyes\\", 2 of the fishes \\"jaws\\" fell apart...upon closer inspection it was just badly manufactured. I was looking forward to playing this as a family game with our little boy but didn't work out. Maybe it was just this set that came out cheap, I don't know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"This game was fun for my child while it lasted. The problem is after only a few uses, it started to fall apart. This toy would of rated higher for fun had it not started to auto-destruct from use. Sadly, it has joined the rest of the inferiorly made games at the dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Hat Linux 9.0","review":"This will be a one word, well maybe two word review..It Stinks!!

She never goes deep into the feelings and emotions of what it really takes to be apart from someone you have spent a large portion of your life with... a person who is connected to your friends, family... she never discusses really the emotional toll on the two people involved.

It followed the events of the book, but was exciting and surprising as well. In my opinion, it was better than the book! It is one of my favorite Gameboy games and I'm glad I bought it. It was fun, had pretty good graphics and sounds, and I liked interacting with the characters. I liked the fact that the controls were pretty easy to get used to, but the game was still challenging. I got so addicted to it! At first I played it every day until my thumbs hurt and I took it with me on my six hour plane flight and I had fun the whole way! The Hobbit was a great addition to my collection of Gameboy Games. I recommend it to everyone! I had a blast playing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating piece of social history","review":"What sets \\"Victim\\" apart from your average run-of-the-mill thriller is it's depiction of the plight of homosexuals. This was decidedly daring in 1961. One senses that the actors put their careers on the line to make this film. Dirk Bogarde in the lead role of a barrister is excellent. A truly fascinating and entertaining piece of film history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Time Capsule of 1960s Perception of Homosexuality","review":"Daringly forthright, this suspenseful story of blackmail (expertly performed by a great cast led by Dirk Bogarde) is a valuable time capsule of the pervasive homophobia that dominated all reaches of 1960s society. There are great, timeless moments that remind the audience of simultaneously how far and how little we have progressed since then.A 30 minute television interview from 1961 with Bogarde is also quite interesting, particularly for American audiences who may only be peripherally aware of his wonderful work on the stage, in film and as an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Waste of Money","review":"The headrest forces your neck and head to bend forward in an uncomfortable position when you sit in an upright or a slightly reclined position. The cushion in the seat back and the seating surface is too soft to offer any support. The underside of your thighs will sink into the gelatinous cushion that cuts off your circulation, causing varicose veins in the long run. Do NOT buy this chair. You will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated and Over-Priced Chair","review":"I bought the fully-loaded leather package and I am really not impressed with this chair. My previous chair was the Herman Miller Aeron which I love. I thought this chair would be better because it cost more...but I was wrong. My bum sweats when I sit on this chair for any length of time (my underwear gets all sweaty, not a good feeling....maybe the fabric version is better?). The arm-rest does not adjust height wise (I hate how low the arm-rest is on my chair (and it annoys me that I can't adjust it). When you lean back, you are basically lying down. I would prefer that the whole chair reclines (tilting) back instead (not just the back-rest). It just feels un-natural when you lean back. It looks great...but I think I will stick to my Herman Miller (I love the mesh seating on the Miller...it is sooo much cooler when you sit). I would not recommend the Freedom chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Do not buy this extremely expensive chair. I have one in the softest leather option and it is very hard and uncomfortable. Worst of all, the leather is very slippery and there is no cushion so one's butt slides off the chair within minutes leading to a classic bad posture with no arch support. Am amazed that such a highly rated chair can have such a poor design flaw. Am considering switching to Steelcase leap only after a year of use, which has a cushioned seat so there is no sliding even with leather option."},{"rating":"1","title":"HumanScale Freedom Chair gave me a herniated disc","review":"After using this chair for 6 months I started getting severe back pain and was diagnosed with a pinched nerve due to a herniated disc.

It is way over priced and does not allow you to adjust it much at all. Really not worth the money. You can get a better chair at an office warehouse store for lots less, or probably on Amazon.I bought the \\"gel cushioned\\" version. Not very cushioned. If you spend a lot of time in front of a pc, you're not going to like this chair. Also, if you lean back even a little, you're laying down. Can't even adjust the tension to prevent the chair from leaning back so easily. 1 star for being able to sit on it.Get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Ergonomic","review":"I have one of these at home as well as at work, and I spend around 10 hours a day on it. I have sat on the Herman Miller Aeron before and I find these chair to be a similar experience. I haven't suffered from problems with lack of padding or back-pain as have others. Chairs by themselves can only go so far. I haven't found a perfect one that forces me to sit in a good position, not slouch, etc. I have to be conscious of my posture and adjust it as I have to with any chair. So, in other words, don't expect a miracle, although you are shelling out quite a bit of money for this chair.It provides good support and a range of settings to make it adjust to your body. I find these much more comfortable than other chairs (arguably cheaper) at my work place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chair is not durable","review":"I bought this chair through Madison Seating via an external retailer link on Amazon. Madison charged $170 to ship from New York to Toronto, and then FedEx charged another $150 for brokerage.Shipping aside, the chair is not very durable and you must use the chair with a great deal of care:- Black weave fabric has started 'piling' in under a year.- Push pins are coming loose in the adjustable arms mechanism.- When sitting down, the arms will not support your weight if you try and brace yourself.- The seat base is also very fragile; it feels just like a piece of plastic with foam and fabric stretched across. If you put too much weight on this, I believe it will break.- No way to lock the tilt mechanism.Overall, I'm disappointed with the purchase. While the concept behind the chair is unique (and it looks good), the execution is far from perfect, and the chair is really over-priced for what it is (when used daily).Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE","review":"I weigh 155 pounds and I am 5'4. I HATE SITTING In this chair. I sit for at least 30 hours per week at my job. My butt slides out when I lean back. It's very uncomfortable.. it puts un-necessary tension on my back and neck when trying to lean back because it is so spring loaded so tight it's like a sling shot!!. And when I lean back, my head gets pushed forward with my chin in my chest.As much as I sit in this chair with the so called correct posture.. I can honestly say from experience, this chair is NOT for short people. There is nooo cush for your tush. We all know that our boss bought theese chairs just to annoy us...They also start falling apart after a few months. Plastic pieces at the join't fall off. And the small metal washers that hold the pins in place eventually work themselves loose. And this is through 3 shifts so theese chairs are sat in, 24/7."},{"rating":"1","title":"great for short periods","review":"I borrowed one of these while recovering from a severe pinched nerve and needed strong shoulder support. I found the chair great in that aspect, and I loved that it would adjust to my seating position instead of having to move a bunch of levers.The big problem is that I can't sit in the chair for much more than an hour. There's hardly any padding in the seat, so after I while my butt gets sweaty and starts to hurt. Other chairs seem to have solved this problem by having either a mesh seat or a lot of padding. Not sure how they messed this up.Maybe this is a subtle way of encouraging us to get up and walk around every hour or so. If so, that's not what I was looking for. Even after taking a 5-10m break, sitting back down still hurt.Too bad; otherwise it's a remarkable chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegantly simple and comfortable","review":"I found it more comfortable than several that we tried at my office. The simplicity is amazing, no fiddling with 4 knobs and levers. The counterweight reclining is awesome. I can recline and take a short nap no problem. Do get the headrest. As advertised it promotes moving your position without needing re-adjustment. I do wish the lumbar support moved higher, which is more comfortable in the reclining position. Personally I liked the padding rather than the cooler mesh chairs. Service is great.

The design is clean and the touchscreen controls are ingenious and simple to use.But the sound quality was just unacceptable. There was a buzzy, fuzzy distortion that I just couldn't put up with. The cheap discount store analog mono unit it was going to replace by comparison has a much clearer tone (if somewhat less bass).If you usually play rock at medium to high levels, it actually sounds better that way, so some may like this radio more than I did.

I'm not looking for super-high-quality sound from an alarm clock, but I often don't recognize songs that I know well because the speakers are vibrating so badly, especially on the left side.

The title says it all, for the good Dr. Blacks are slaves even after the fact that they destroyed the slave system in 1791 and gained French citizenship in 1794. The good Doctor should tell us why the butchery of the Black population on Guadeloupe during the period of the Haitian Revolution was better than Haiti's fight for independence.

In whole this movie will take upwards of 3 days of hardcore viewing to finish, but the storyline will keep you glued to the screen until you've got all three of the good endings and both of the bad ones.

Granted, I was coming to it after experiencing the anime, so it might be different for someone playing the game without having seen the anime, but to me, the pacing seemed really slow, the graphics a bit primitive, and the controls very cumbersome in comparison.

So the strength of the alcohol usually washes out any flavor a mix would have. I could not taste the rum like I do with other mixers! And while this may be good for me, all guys know that a drink has to have good flavor for the girls! Also, I can take this mix overseas and pack it in my suitcase because it is in powder form.

Even though she is big for her age, the tools are too big for her to use, and she's not much interested in make believe play. Keep in mind that these are plastic toys and wouldn't be useful as real tools - a good thing in the hands of toddlers where heavy wooden handles and sharp medal edges would be an invitation to disaster.

Disappointment sets in very quickly as one realizes that LoBrutto's writing style is very tedious, amateurish and repetitive. The irony is that the author is clearly an admirer of Kubrick and has done extremely meticulous research -- what a shame that the editing was not nearly as careful, quite unlike a Kubrick film.I switched to John Baxter's recently published biography and, though that book certainly has its own weaknesses, it is much more concise and has a livelier style. After finishing it, I picked up the LoBrutto book again in an attempt to at least skim it for additional detail, especially since it offers more technical information. I have again given up. The poor style is too much to endure and the extra detail is not interesting. One wonders whether the Baxter biography is merely a more professional rewrite of the LoBrutto book."},{"rating":"1","title":"well researched.....","review":"....at times, then there is nothing, with no explanation.

Great book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivia, trivia, trivia, a bit of Kubrick, and more trivia","review":"Vincent Lobrutto's Stanley Kubrick biography is filled with meaningless bits of information, even to hardcore fans (such as myself). But as if it wasn't enough he wrote these useless anecdotes about Kubrick's young and mature life, he always exaggerated on their importance to the director's character: I don't think that young Kubrick's shouting at his friend \\"Why da hell did you buy a pickle\\" really has anything to do with the making of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". And the worse part is that when it finally comes to the stage where Lobrutto writes about Kubrick's films, he tells the most insignificant little stories, and not paying any attention to the artistic work. Lots of details, lack of interest. So if you really want to know the exact time when old Stan, may he rest in peace, went to the bathroom on December 16th 1976, this book is a must. Otherwise, I suggest looking in other biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at THE master filmaker's career and life","review":"We will never see the likes of Stanley Kubrick in our lifetime.

I never got to see The Who play live, but I did see the Airplane numerous times. The three songs represent them well and it is fantastic to 'time-travel' back; only complaint - I want more! Not enough people have seen Michael Bloomfield play and at least we get one track here. Or Larry Taylor playing bass (Canned Heat) - he is SO into it!

Although she is well and high-bred, her family's poverty asserts she marry wealthy. A score of suitors show up to court the young maiden and Catherine fights them all off... with pranks and pleas and costume changes ( such as mouse bones in her hair and blacking soot on her teeth ). It is Catherine's pursuit of her own happiness that makes this book so intriguing. Her perserverence and her refusal to marry anyone deemd unworthy sets her above the rest.Cushman paints the medieval period without romanticism. It is grubby and gritty and dirty and crass.

In the middle, there were some dry and rather boring parts, but the author nearly made up for it by her amazing character development and satisfying ending. I felt like I really got to know the main character, Catherine, as if she were a friend of mine. I liked the way that I felt like I knew everything I needed to by the end of the book. Still, it was a bit too long and drawn out for my taste. For example, I didn't need to know as much about feasting, holidays, the weather, the other villagers, monks, and fairs. To me, this was not the purpose of the book, and some of the events that occurred were unnecessary. I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't mind if the story isn't adventurous, but instead educational. This book, at least for me, was more of a story to teach me rather than to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine, Called Birdy by Brandon","review":"I didn't like this book very much. It was very boring at times, and the plot was pointless. For instance, at the end of the book, nothing importtant really changes. At the end of the book, I was a little annoyed that the author used such a bogus ending. I would go into more detail but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. The only things that kept me reading this book were that I had to read it for school and that it was really funny at a lot of times. It also taught me a lot about what life was like back in Medeival times. All in all, this book was barely good enough to keep me interested, but it taught me a lot and was funny, so I give it two stars. I definitely would not reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine called boring","review":"This book is completely sad. It could never hold my attention, and I am not amused by 200 pages of wind in the bowels. I f there is a worse book out there e-mail me with its name. I will read it a enjoy it more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY not deserving of the Newberry award!!!","review":"This book may be historically accurate, but I found it extremely dull and pointless. The story had almost no plot and I fouund myself sometimes falling asleep while reading it. I do not think it is for 6-9th graders. It is more suited for elementary school students with her childish attitude and stupid speech. The story was overall very sappy and I don't even recommend it to the slowest of readers! This is why it received only two stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books that I've ever read!!!!!!","review":"I think reading Catherine, Called Birdy was one of the best choices I have made. I recommend this humorous, depressing, jovial, over-all WONDERFUL story to anyone with an interest in people and/or history. Catherine, Called Birdy tells much about regular people's lives in the Middle Ages. Whether or not you fit the above description, make a good choice: try Catherine, Called Birdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Medevil comedy is Hilarious!","review":"Catherine Called Birdy is a hilarious book! Certainly it is one of the best I have ever read. Catherine is devious, tom-boyish, and everything that is not part of being a Lady. She hates almost everthing about her life and uses her journal to express her pure hatred of her father and overall boredom of her daily life. A wonderful and hiarious account of a Lady's life in those days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mischief, mayhem, and humor-this book has it all!","review":"\\"Catherine Called Birdy\\" portrays a very different version of the typical medieval woman. Catherine, the main character is headstrong, intelligent, and extremely stubborn. Her unique blend of characteristics, which are so rarely found in novels featuring women from the Middle Ages, give us unique insights into Catherine's life and beliefs. If you are looking for a welcome change from the usual medieval reads, check out this book. It is sure to amuse readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great diary of the wonderful life in the Middle Ages","review":"Starting with the notion that it would be dull, as most diaries are, I read the entire book. I's a wonderful way of showing the history and the time of knighhood in a different ad interesting way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than THE MIDWIFE'S APPRENTICE","review":"I have to agree that at first this book was rather dull to read, and the midieval ways of speaking and slang also contributed to the difficultness of understanding this book. But I figured: There HAS to be a reason why this book got the award, so I atempted to read this again, and was NOT dissapointed.Catherine, Called Birdy is a powerful and true novel about the trials and tribulations of a female in the midieval ages trying to understand her abominable brother, her best friend's lover for her brother, why her mother fell for her rat-like father, and over all trying to run away from her fate of marrying a rich 60 year old stinky lord who, worst of all, has a son her age!The whole book was hilariously funny, this diary of Lady Birdy, is a great historical fiction, and I can not doubt why this original book got the prestigeous award it earned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book slowly, then you'll catch the drift","review":"For a first read, this book was rather dull and pointless. But if you slowly read it, and the little italicized paragraphs, you start understanding why this is happening, or why Catherine feels the way she feels. A very emotional book, doesn't get to the point where it's so pathetic that you start crying your heart out, instead, your eyes fill up with tears from laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is everything under one cover!","review":"Karen Cushman out did herself. She really did her homework on the middle ages. This book gives you tons of onformation mixed in with humor. This is a wonderful book that will actually get kids my age (11 and 12) interested in the middle ages. It is a great book that many girls can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore!","review":"This book was soooooooo boring. I practiclly fell asleep while reading it. It did not deserve the award it got. I can't believe there are people who liked it. All she wrote about was how many fleas she picked off and the disgusing fact that she wonders where her waste goes. I didnt even read the last few pages, but I peeked ahead. How can she marry that pig's son without even knowing what he looks like. It's like she had a total change of personality. I do not recomend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for 10-12 year olds","review":"ZERO STARS......... but that selection was not available.I was helping my son with the book for class work. He was terribly uncomfortable with the book. I complained to the teacher about the vulgarity and overall negative tone of the book. Since we have to complete the book, we've spent a lot of time together discussing inappropriate behaviors in society today, starting with the lack of judgment in the public school system. I'm fortunate to have a scholar's child which will be attending a private school in January because of the poor judgment in literary talents available for this specific age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHACK BOOK","review":"THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE. IF THERE WAS A SPOT FOR 0 STARS, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD GET, PROBABLY EVEN LESS. I DIDNT EVEN WASTE MY TIME READING THE WHOLE BOOK. I JUST READ THE FIRST 2 PAGES AND THE LAST 3 PAGES. I DONT RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD. THIS BOOK SUCKED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"this book is soo horrible don't even think about reading it because it sucksthat's all I have to sayDON\\"T READ IT OR YOU WILL DIE A HORRIBLE DEATHi like pie but i'm depressed im gonna eat some cake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read for Eng. Lit., Historical Study, and High Interest","review":"Catherine, Called Birdie, written by Karen Cushman provides an excellent example of historical writing describing the life of a young girl living during the Medieval Ages. It spans one year of her life yet covers her family tree and thoroughly provides insight into the many aspects of daily life at that time. It could be utilized for many age groups and reading levels. Although it is written by a girl, the life and expectations of boys during the same time period are covered in detail. I am using the book for a literary reading, a means to address the diary as a form of writing and in the area of history for the purpose to study the time span of the Middle Ages. It would be an interesting book to use for literary circles in the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I first read this book in third grade, and now ten years later it still remains by favorite book ever! It taught me the joys of reading a good book and because of it I am now an avid reader. Plus, I have read it at least a dozen times since I was seven years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the bomb","review":"Catherine Called Birdy was a good book. It was written by Karen cushman I thought it was very funny. Also it held my intrest And I thought it was cool because it was based on midieval times.Catherine Called Birdy is about a girl in midieval times. She is going to get married by asuitor but she doesn't want to. So she tries everything to drive them away. Her father is mean to her so they never get along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherine called Birdy","review":"Catherine Called Birdy is an interesting book about a named Catherine who lives in the meidieval times. She goes on many adventures & tries to discover herself. Most people call her birdy because that is her nick-name. She is very interested in animals & nature. Her father wants her to marry a rude man,but the man is never rude to the father. All of Catherines friends are getting married & she is still looking for mr.right. So read this book & see all of her amazing adventures & obstacles of life. I reccomend this book for adventureous teens who are having trouble finding their path of life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Research overwhelming. Journal format overused in YA lit.","review":"Although Cushman has earned many awards for this title, the book itself is not that interesting. Cushman has a tendency to overwhelm the reader with all the FACT, which I'm sure she enjoyed learning, but which detracts from the story. The journal format has been overused in the young adult arena the past few years and students are turned off by it. Most of my girls gave it a PASS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simplistic","review":"The writing is overly simplistic and the story is predictable. It seems rather contrived, really, like a lot of historical fiction. The author, it seems, did a little research, found an interesting idea, and then pasted a narrative around it. I really wanted to like this book-the main character and I share a name, after all. There are so many other books out there with the same sort of plot-I might have loved this book in elementary school, but it'd definitely not intended for the \\"young adult\\" audience.I did enjoy some of the humor, though, especially the interaction between Catherine and her brother, the monk. The book had a lot of potential, it just doesn't quite live up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright...","review":"Yes, I had to read this for school. There seems to be no plot, but the book is trying to teach you how little freedom women had in the Medieval ages. Took me a while to get that. Obviously, this book is more written for girls than it is for boys. The language is not bad, but some material in the book referring to young adult themes, which is NOT appropriate for children who have to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine called BORING!","review":"This book is uterly terrible. It was soooo boring that I had to push myself to read it. All it is, is her talking about how much she hates her life. It did not have any morals to it. It also did not have a plot. If you are reading this reveiw and think that you might want to read it just to see if you like it. DON'T!!!!! I had to read this for school because am homeschooled. If I had a choice I would not have read it. There is also lanuage that is not suitible for 6th grade and under.Please do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!","review":"I had to read this book for school and I didn't evenget through the entire thing! I must have skipped about 4 or 5 months because I thought it was so BAD! The story had no plot, was 100% pointless, and I didn't care about one character in the story. If I could rate this book lower then one star, trust me I would. If you want to read about a girls life, go buy \\"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle\\". It is a MUCH better book. The bottom line is, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there any way to do less then one star?","review":"I hate to sound like a jerk, but in my not-so-humble opinion, THIS BOOK STANK!!!!! I found the heroine course and disgusting (what kind of person wonders where their waste goes?), and I still can't understand WHY she gave up her freedom for a BEAR. I like animals, but still!!! I found the entire book just plain DISGUSTING!!!! ::shudders:: The only reason I reccomend it to anybody is because I know that I'm not like other people, and that people my age usually ENJOY disgusting. ::shudders again, and starts praying to God:: And I thought I was crazy......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading","review":"Karen Cushman's style of writing was rather low and sordid even taking into consideration the time period and the reality of the Middle Ages. I would not recommend this for children's reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"As I recall...","review":"I had to read this in 3rd or 4th grade. I recall finding it rather boring. I struggled through it. Perhaps I would enjoy it more now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam's Reveiw","review":"Catherine,Called Birdy,written by Karen Cushman is about a young girl whos dad is forcing her to get married to the oldest,meanest,and revolting man she has ever met.

I have never read anything that made me want to murder myself more. I had to read it for school or else I wouldn't have finished it. Also, I must say that if you are considering reading it but don't want to because other reivewers said that it had 'vulger launguage', than think again. It has no vulger launguage, and the lady (...) who wrote it was innapropreate for ten to twelve year olds is really off. However, i still dont think you should read it. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this ... and I'm 20!","review":"This book is not just for preteens, it is for everyone! It is written intelligently and is so funny. Catherine is not you average damsel in distress. She is a thinker and a doer and she doesn't rely on anyone for anything. I loved the ways in which she would scare away suitors! This is a must-read for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the romantic","review":"One thing I love about Cushman is her realism. She doesn't paint things \\"up gaudy\\", she doesn't pretend everyone's going to live happily ever after, she just has her heroines find their place in the world and work towards accepting it. This book is no exception.Catherine is a delightful heroine. Clever, witty, quick, crude but basically kind, and really very modern for one who's meant to be a modest mediaeval maiden, she quickly captures our hearts, and perhaps more importantly, our interest. Her exploits are a pleasure to read.The reason the one star is missing, is that I am a hopeless romantic. Really, deep down, I hoped that she'd elope with the goat boy and live happily ever after. Sorry. It's just me.But read this book. It's a memorable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suprisingly Interesting Work Of Historical Fiction!","review":"This book was on the reading list for my school, and as soon as I began it, I couldn't put it down. Some parts are hysterically funny, and others full of interesting information. Though the main character, Catherine, isn't always perfect, she remains hilarious and always true to herself. The book is set in medieval times, and Catherine is being forced to marry old, gruesome men whose only appeal is that they are wealthy! Catherine manages to chase most of her suitors away until finally the ugliest and most horrid one of all refuses to get chased away! Will Catherine succeed in her quest to remain a maiden, or be carted off to live the rest of her days with this barbarian? Read this great novel and find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious look at the Middle Ages!","review":"I loved this book! I first read it two years ago, and have reread it many times since. It takes a light look at serious history, and gives readers a taste of life in Medieval times without depressing them with all the morbid details. However, the details were accurate, and some were presented in such a funny way. I loved it when Birdy talked about their bathing habits (going from October to May without bathing because the tub was being used to keep eels!). Birdy was such an engaging character that I go back to this book time and again to get another laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure and Strength","review":"Catherine Called Birdy is a very adventerous book. You feel as if you are actually Catherine. The book takes place in the Middle Ages. The book can seem slightly confusing, but once you understand what is happening you will be hooked! Catherine escapes from marrying by running away and creating trouble. The book tells you details of everything. She tells you the smells and how people look. She tells you of, well, I'm not going to wreck it for you. Her father is a knight, and beastly as could be. He wants Catherine to marry off to some rich guy, no matter how disgusting or rude he is. Catherine's mother is sweet and kind, but Catherine still doesn't know why her mother married her father. This book will keep you on the edge of your chair reading about her adventures and life. You might not feel suspense, yet you will feel as if you are Catherine. I highly recommend you buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for anyone.","review":"This book was required reading for my up and coming 6th grader. She hates to read, but this book has been a riot. She is not into Barbie, pink or much girly stuff. Fortunately, neither is Catherine. She and my daughter have a lot in common. I would highly recommend this book for all girls. If the boys can get past the sprinkling of puberty stuff they will like her antics too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps you remember when women and girls had no rights!","review":"Many people have their own opinions for everything. Catherine of \\" Catherine called Birdy\\" was just that type of person. This story takes place in medival times when women and girls had no say in anything. Not even who they married. Could you imagine that? Catherine can. She goes through it everyday. She gets all of her feelings out in a daily journal, which makes up the book. This book is funny and full of romance. When Catherine's Uncle George comes to visit Catherine is thrilled, because she has always had a crush on him. It is a joyful occasion until he meets Catherine's best friend Aelis. Aelis and Uncle George fall in love and Catherine wants to do anything that will stop it. She will even try spells on them to cruse love! This is a wonderful book and I strongly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You ask too many questions. That's Bad Manners.","review":"This book is good. It's funny, and depicts what life was like in the Medivel Ages. You still need to know a little bit to start you off, and a dictionary to understand some of the old words, but other than that this book should be highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give this book all the stars in the sky if i could*****","review":"I LOVED this book!!!!! This book is narated by an obstinine, stubborn and ricious preteen fom the 1200s. Catherine's father (a greedy relentless jerk) keeps trying to marry Catherine off to dull, disgusting, unattractive and self absorbed suiters to get himself richer. Catherines mother and nanny try to get Catherine to become a lady who talks little and weaves a lot. Catherine yearns to be a villager who can daudle and forget their manners and marry someone of their choice. This book tells every detail of this young womans late preteen years. WARNING: You'll find yourself laughing, crying screaming and scheming along with the book.PS I've read the book 9 times and never tire of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A girl living in the Renaissance is forced to marry.","review":"In Catherine, Called Birdy, a historical fiction book by Karen Cushman, a teenaged girl completely disproves most people's ideas of how \`proper' young ladies always act. When Catherine's own father is willing to sell her like livestock to any suitor who comes along, she uses her own wit to scare them off. All of the rich old men leave, almost immediately - all except one, that is. In an exciting climax, Catherine faces the very possible disaster of being forced to marry a rich pig without any input in the matter at all. Catherine's situation becomes more and more certain to end in disaster -- right up to a fairy-tale happy ending. I think that almost anyone would enjoy this book -- from a young person with a special interest in the Middle Ages to anyone simply looking for a good read. Written in diary form, this book has a lot of historical truth, yet its humor is appealing to kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Called Birdy","review":"This book is about a 14 year old girl named Catherine. She writes in a journal about her hard life. Her father beats her and wants to marry her off to the richest man.

One of her brothers named Edward gave her the journal to write in because he wants her to be educated. She wants to marry Perkin the goat boy and be a regular old villager.

I thought it was hilarious. After a while, though, I got sick of Catherine's stupidity and immaturity and found that there was just no plot at all. I got so bored of the book I stopped in the middle, which I almost NEVER do. Normally I continue to the end of all books I read, no matter how badly written, because I just want to know what happens at the end. Not with this book! There was absolutely no suspense because there was absolutely no plot. Later, a friend of mine, as we discussed the stupidity of the book, told me what happens at the end of the nonexistant plot the back of the book suggests, and though I won't give it away here, it's as stupid as the rest of the book. I can't really say it was badly written, it was just a bad, boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this become a Newbery Honoree?","review":"I was greatly deceived by the book cover and description on the back of this book. I though I was going to be reading a charming story of a mischievous girl in the year 1290.. Instead, I got a greatly drawn out anti-climatic year in the life of a shrew. I was so bored reading this story and I can't figure out what the literary qualities are, that nominated this book for a Newbery Award. I hope teachers don't choose to make this a priority book in their classes, because the kids will most likely not read it. Even if they do, they won't learn anything from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the intelligent child","review":"I was intrigued by this title and thought it might be enjoyable for my daughter. The first several pages were acceptable, but I was finding myself more and more irritated as the story continued, because there really was no story. It primarily consists of the unhappy rantings of a 13 to 14 year old who hates her life, hates her father, hates her brother, hates her nurse, love-hates her mother, loves the words \\"piss\\" and \\"fart\\" and taking God's name in vain, wants to run away and never does, and whose character does not seem to grow until the very last when she finally resolves that she will, after all, settle for the arranged marriage she cannot get out of.

If you take my advice and not read this book, you'll be thankful too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fantastic Review of the Journal","review":"This was a Medieval Project in my 7th Grade Humanities classThe Summary: Catherine Called Birdy was a conflict type book. It was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. If you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. It is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book. A phew funny things were when Catherine caught some objects on fire!Rating: I rated my book 2 stars because it was kind of boring. Why is because all the book was really about was Catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. When I did like it was when she tried to get out of each man.Who this book would be suited for: I would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the Medieval times. Also is if you are interested in action books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"This book seemed like it would be interesting, but once I started to read it, it was just boring. Hoping that it would get better, I read the whole thing, but it never really did. The main character just gets really annoying by the end, with her constant complaining. Given, she sort of tries to change her situation, but not really. And she portrays her life like everyone is out to get her, even when they're trying to help her. It has a few comical moments, but not enough to redeem the book. Then at the end the \\"heroine\\" loses all her credibility by just seeming to give in to what she's been fighting against the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Liked This Book!","review":"I thought that this book was kind of funny.I also thought that it was pretty exiting in a way.I actually had fun reading about this book.At first when I saw this book I thought that it would be boring because of the cover,but I guess it wasn't after all.I would like to read other books from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too politically correct","review":"Listened to the CD. There were so many references to politcally correct ideas that at first I thought the author would calm down and get to the story in a realistic manner. But she does not and continues to drivel.

But it lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I would never read this book if it wasn't a requirement for school. I found myself daydreaming with the book open in my hands rather than actually reading it. It was that boring. It took me a long time to get through it because I kept putting it down. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone, and if you must read it for a requirement, I feel BADDD for you.

The end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Called Birdy by Karen Cushman-reviewed by Jim","review":"I didn't like this book. I thought it was pretty bad. It was about a girl who lives in 1290 on her dad's, a lesser noble, manor. It is written in the form of a dairy with seperate entries for different days. I thought it was kind of boring because it was just a story about a girl whohas to marry who her father wants her to. She doesn't like him becuase she doesn't want to marry. She was a very revoulutionary thinker. She thought all about womans' rights, a thing which they didn't think about in that time period. Also it had a lot potty langugue. My teacher said that it was normal for back then. Even thought it made me laugh I think that he book would be better off without it. I'd recomend this book to the kind of person that likes reading diary style books and love/hate books. Over all I thoight the book stunk hence the single star. Thats just my opinion, read the book to make yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this zero stars, trust me I would","review":"I had to read this book for school, and it was boring and had absolutely no plot. It was SUPPOSED to be about a girl who's father kept trying to set her up with rich people and she was supposed to do HILARIOUS pranks to them. That happened for about 5 pages scattered throughout the book. The rest had nothing to do with anything, it was pretty much words typed up on paper. It wasn't funny. it wasn't adventurous. It wasn't anything but boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! If you call this new, how bad is old!","review":"Ok, so were reading this book in school, and my teacher tells us that if we have our own copy so we can take notes in she will give us 5 points extra credit on the next exam. So ofcourse i order the book, and i wanted a new copy, with fresh pages and a nice new glossy cover. What i got was a book with yellow pages, a scratched up cover with a sticker on it. To make matters worse when i ripped off the sticker some of the cover came off!

She also hates her father trying to marry her off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine, Called Birdy","review":"This is one of the most boring books that I have ever read. There are only two good things I have to say about it. One good thing is that it could be funny at times. One funny part was when Catherine got tired of her sewing and threw it into the privy. The other good thing is that the characters are very interesting and well developed. This is a good quality in a book, but it made the plot very predictable. By the middle of the book, more than half of the class I had read it with, had correctly guessed the ending. Also, Catherine, the main character, is funny at the beginning, but since she matures throughout the book, the second half is not nearly as humorous as the first.

The story takes place during the Medeival Period and it provides a good historical reference for what it was like to grow up during that period. I read this with my eleven year old daughter, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Corpus Bones!\\" I couldn't put the book down!","review":"Catherine, also Birdy, is shown in a medieval environment as a typical teenager worried about boys, local news and behavior of her family. In this book, Catherine is forced to do things that she probably wouldn't do if she was paid. God's thumbs! This book is very realistic: crushes on uncles, chores, church, and much more. This book is definitely on the \\"must read\\" list. God's thumbs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdy's life is awful and all she can say is \\"Corpus Bones!\\"","review":"Catherine, a.k.a. Birdy has a life full of twists and turns. It's not easy at all living in the 1200's. Her father plans to marry her to a rich suitor no matter how ugly he is. Catherine wishes to just colapes in a ball and hide from all her sorrows and misery. But then a suitor from the far side of England more uglier and more rude than the last, decides to wed her. Very exiting and thriling. The author, Karen Cushman describes the life of a juvinile lady quite well. I recomend reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Called Birdy By, Justin","review":"This book was a terrible book. It was very slow moving and I do not suggest it to anyone. I think it was written just to have a book written. From this, the book seemed very rushed and disorganized. An example of this is when Catherine talks of the Queen's death just to fill up pages. Parts of the book were a little too exact about the Middle Ages. For example, talking about pigs and goats was too much detail. Also the book had an awful ending. Through out the book, Catherine says she wants to expand to better things. In the end she decides to be happy with her horrible boring life, instead of traveling and being a crusader. In a way though this was somewhat of a good thing because, Catherine learned to be who she is. When I say this I mean she wanted to have a different life, but she realized she is who she was born."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Called, Birdy by Philip","review":"This book was so boring that I had trouble staying awake while reading this book because it was very slow-moving and was only about the story of a girl whose father was selling her off to be married. However, I did learn a lot about what life was like for ordinary people in the Middle Ages. For instance, I learned that women were considered property and were treated as such. A father would even sell his daughter to a man who wished to marry her, sometimes against the daughter's will. Although the book was very boring, it did have a great ending with an unsuspected twist. Obviously I am not going to tell you what it was because that would take away the only good part in the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially a kid, unless you are interested in learning about life in the Middle Ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Called Birdy by Katya","review":"I really did not like this book. I liked the way the author wrote the book in a diary form, but that's about all I liked. There were some funny statements, like the names she gives her suitors, but overall it didn't have a very exciting plot. There wasn't very much motivation for the reader to keep reading the book. Some of the characters weren't well developed. For example, it didn't make sense why Robert was so mean to Catherine and then suddenly became nice. Athough the story was very dry, I learned a lot about the time period. For example, I leaned about the crusades, fairs, monks, nuns, villagers, rulers at that time, and religion. I definitley would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine, Called Birdy by Jaycob","review":"Catherine, Called Birdy was not a very good book. I didn't enjoy it at all, except for the last chapter. It was very boring and it was hard to even stay focused on the book itself. A lot of the journal entries were very ordinary, lacking excitement. However, it did give me a very good perspective on life back in Medieval Times. It gave a lot of information. For instance, it told about how girls were treated like property. They would be sold to the highest bidder, even if they didn't like him at all. I liked the ending because it gave the story a very nice twist. That was the only part of the book that I really enjoyed. I would not recoommend this book to anyone, unless they were going to read it just to find out about life back then. When they read this, they will find out that life was very dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherine Called Birdy","review":"\\"Catherine Called Birdy\\" by Karen Cushman is a GREAT novel!

I have usually found diary narration less than entralling, but this attempt was one of the worst I have ever read. I had prepared myself for an extremely good book, since this one is often associated with books such as. Ella Enchanted, ( it is unworthy to be in the same sentence as the book.) Please, good Americans, do not waste your time on such an unspeakably dreadful narration. Ugh! Don't waste your money: b/c you are worth it!

Catherine will sacrifice one thing and make her life miserable. I think this book is very good!!! It is exciting, funny, adventurous, and very detailed. Catherine, Called Birdy is realistic fiction.

That was maddening because you had to find a location beyond the page that triggered it to get close to where you were before. If you went back to the same location it would crash all over again.

Also, by reading I do not mean understanding - this will come only after few shots of cognac and certain amount of banging your head on your keyboard while Wiresharking.

I purchased the Nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one I have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is HORRIBLE PICTURES.The 'electronic VR' is simply digital image sharpening, the ISO adjustments in low light are terrible, and what I simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is. Couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAMERA","review":"Is somtimes difficult to understand some of the reviews for that camera. One review for instance says that the quality of the pictures is fantastic and the next one says that it's terrible. This camera is (like most cameras of this kind of any brand) basically a point and shoot camera and it will of course never have the performance of a Nikon D 200 or even of a D50. It is not the same range and not the same price. But for what is is, it's an excellent camera that takes great pictures. I bought one to update my \\"old\\" S1 and to take everyday pictures, I am quite satisfied with it. It takes great pictures , great videos, is fast enough for a \\"normal\\" use, the display frame is one of the best and wifi works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon Disaster","review":"I bought this camera with high hopes and it is by far the WORST digital camera I have ever owned.

Yes it takes fair photos and has all the flexibility anyone can expect in a camera. The bigest and most serious drawback is the inability to view anything on the screen on a bright, sunny day. On a recent trip to Italy I couldn't use it outside during the daytime. Thank God I had my Canon as back up otherwise I wouldn't have any pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it!","review":"I received this camera as a gift from my husband who had been listening to me say I wanted a smaller digital camera to capture the everyday moments of our three kids. I previously had a Canon Powershot G3 which I loved, although it was bulky and hard to carry around when I had my three small kids with me. That being said, this camera is a waste of money. While it is small and fits nicely in my purse, I have yet to get one nice photo out of it. I consistenly get blurry pictures and all the lower light shots have subject who have these bright white eyes that can not be photo shopped out. I sent it back to Nikon who \\"repaired\\" it for free, however the repair did nothing. I have had my pictures from several imporatant occasions ruined by this camera and am planning to trade it in for anthother Canon soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little point","review":"I've bought like 3 or 4 Nikon Coolpix S7c, and i've seen the camara has a good funtion but after use for sometime appear on the screen a little point like a lens scratch, this point no is a lcd dead pixel, is a problem on the lens, no is a significative problem, but exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon Coolpix S7c auto mode leaves domething to be desired","review":"I am disappointed by the poor image quality of this camera in automatic mode. I gave it to my wife as a gift and she did not use it first until the 30-day return peroiod lapsed. The auto-exposure feature does not work well. It sets a very high ISO rating causing the flash not to flash indoors and the photo to be too grainy. The photo is good when the ISO is set to 100 manually, but then the flash is too weak to take anything but close-ups. A 200 ISO setting is a compromise which enables the flash to light the subject, but it more grainy than my Canon at ISO 200. In short, my wife prefers her film camera and does not want to fiddle with setting the ISO manually for a better photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wifi = good. pictures = bad","review":"The wifi is a great idea!

I chose the S7c because besides the S3 it's the only small digital with decent macro capabilities below the expensive full size SLR models. So far the S7c appears to take high quality photos on par with the S3. The only problem is that it won't interface with my Canon downloader (the S3 did).

The author came up with an interesting idea but got far to carried away in many scenes and used mostly 2 dimensional characters who really did change much over the 100 pages I managed to read, hence my comment about lack of guidance from the editor. As far as the editing itself is concerned, many scenes could have been cut by a half to three-quarters to improve the flow of the storyline which is choppy at best.

I applied to exchange the trimmer, thinking I could use the box from the second shipment to return the first one. But the second one arrived in worse condition than the first. I gave up.

After what seemed like over an hour, it was not fully charged, but I figured close enough.I used it for about 20 minutes and it ran out of juice. So I put it back on the charger. The green light stayed on and wouldn't charge. I remember someone else posting it needed to be \\"cold\\" to charge so I left it unplugged for over an hour and tried again, no good. The light stayed green, got a few seconds of charge and died. I tried several times over the course of 2 days and finally gave up and sent it back to Amazon.

I was absolutely bowled over by this recording: the impeccable pitch and timing, subtlety, intelligence, and wit of Jim Ferguson and the superb musicianship of everyone involved. Wonderful songs from the clever title song to the sophisticated Wilder numbers. It repays repeated listening and leaves one hoping for a new release soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb CD. I feel fortunate to have heard about it.","review":"This CD is a delight. The music is perfectly chosen, with beautiful ballads and other tunes I haven't heard in years. The musical artistry is first-rate. Ferguson's voice is clear, on-pitch, dry and unpretentious. He is a real jazz vocalist, and his bass playing -- both soloing and behind the group -- is terrific. His group play beautifully together; I particularly enjoyed the organized, coherent, beautifully structured solos of Chris Potter on saxophone. All of the tunes are done thoughtfully. I was so pleased that I learned about this artist in the NY Times one Sunday.

The paint is smeared. The directions are copied from a website that the manufacturer doesn't own. The cards are of very poor quality. But, it is the cheapest board available. I shouldn't have to, but I will live with these defects because it is cheaper than the other boards. I expect more quality for my money, even when it's only $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I agree with Richard Topliff's review...and add that the hinge is not recessed when the board is open so the metal rubs on your table--we're forced to put a cloth underneath to protect our wood.We needed a board quickly and this was all we could find after visiting four local stores, so we'll keep it for travel, but for daily use...I don't think so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this cheaply made board!","review":"I recently purchased this Cribbage Board from a local department store and was very disappointed with its quality. Since it folds in half, it has a hinge that wasn't installed very well so when it lays flat, it's not very flat. Also the holes are drilled really bad and the plastic pegs don't stick in the holes very well. I suggest looking for a better made cribbage board with metal pegs! I'll be returning this pos when I come across a nicer one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as pictured - VERY disappointed","review":"My husband and I already had the product that is pictured - a nice metal container with a decent set of cards. However, what we received from Amazon was an extremely cheap cardboard container which doesn't look like it will even hold up to the scuffing it will take to get it out of the plastic wrap. I purposely ordered this on Amazon (instead of purchasing the cardboard version for less at Walmart) because we specifically wanted the durable metal container as a fun gift for our son-in-law's birthday. This looks very cheap, and we are considering returning it. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon has not changed their picture to reflect the change in product. This seems like false advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor quality; functional for those just learning cribbage","review":"This cribbage set is little more than functional. The playing cards included in the set are the thinnest, worst quality cards I've ever seen. The playing instructions are very short and incomplete. If you are just learing how to play cribbage, you might wnat to also purchase a book like \\"Bicycle Official Rules of Card Games\\" to provide you with a complete set of rules. The board is cheaply made, but is functional. I guess this is a good starter set if you've never played the game and want to see if you like it before you invest in a better-made set."},{"rating":"2","title":"truth in advertising","review":"I love the board but, all advertising claims it to come with a deck of Bycicle cards but in reality it only comes with a deck of Pavillion cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cribbage a game that stands the test of time.","review":"Although the game looks simple, which it is.There is much strategy involved as well as luck.Beginners can quickly grasp the game and even winagainst cribbage veterans.

Keep them coming Margaret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligence is social","review":"Besides its excellent presentation and highly methodological structure, this book describes the anti-individualistic point of view of \\"intelligence\\". The point is about showing how problem solving and evolution can be thought as mainly driven by the way components interact, not through some notion of an individual's \\"intelligence\\" that would be the property of the person (or any \\"entity\\") which is solving a problem, and not the result of the contacts with his (its) environment.If you like books providing a different point of view of AI this is the book you are looking for...in addition it is entertaining and easily readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I should need a little bit more","review":"I have read the book at a stretch. In my view, the thesis (human is social) is a very simple, wit, and sound one.

Foundations and arguments in favor, coming from social and computer sciences, are orderly and properly unfolded along the book. The associated web page is being a very valuable resource for me.

It is kind of hippie-schlocky, no doubt. But I never get tired of it. You've got to love that first 30 seconds or so, the intro, with that delicious anticipation of the first utterance of \\"White bird...\\" And the song just wouldn't work somehow if the singers had a seamless blend to their voices, if they were matched on the order of, say, Simon and Garfunkel. It just wouldn't be \\"White Bird.\\" The rest of the album is forgetable. If you've ever heard the actual Strawberry Alarm Clock album with \\"Incense and Peppermints,\\" it's the same thing (well, much worse actually, to give due credit to It's a Beautiful Day). Just abominable. Ah, but the one song... a classic. I know there are devoted IABD fans out there, but let's face it, they're a one-hit wonder. But for my vote, the one hit really is a wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!","review":"I must echo the post of \\"a music fan in San Francisco.\\" I urge all fans of this band to avoid this album and all other recordings on the San Francisco Sound label.

Wish I could purchase all my music this way (maybe I can)Surprisingly, the most well known and popular song on the alum, White Bird, is one of my least favorite (I still like it, just not as much as others) I heard a version of \\"Time Is\\" on a tv show recently, so it's been remade, but the original is still just as fun.

All of which are strong tracks. \\"Bombay Calling\\", \\"Bulgaria\\", and \\"Time Is\\" are all very good but do not in my opinion hold up to the first half of this wonderful album.Albeit the writers aren't poets and most of the lyrics are hippie flower child crap, but the album does not lose face because of this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"Not one of the better known or better remembered bands of the late 60s and early 70s, It's a Beautiful Day was nonetheless one of the better groups with a very clean distinctive sound. Sometimes those types of groups were duds in concert as you found out that their sound was produced largely in the studio, but that was definitely not the case with these guys who put on one of the best concerts (maybe the best) I ever saw.

Of course, the first was it brought back many old long-forgotten memories, both good and some not-so-good. The second was I got to listen to the music while straight, something I never was in the 60's through the 80's. And this album, for me, has indeed stood the test of time. I still get very happy and elated listening to David LaFlamme's soaring electric violin, and the words to me are still emotion & thought provoking, even without the drugs. White Bird still makes me cry, and as I've grown older, (I was 18 in 1967) the importance of being truly, deeply who I really am (which to me is why 'the white bird must fly') is no less important than it was back then, I just have a better idea of what that means. If you've not heard White Bird, give it a try. If you have and liked it, revisit an old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Beautiful Day - self-titled (San Francisco Sound)","review":"Review no. 115. For a semi-obscure act,I was amazed at seeing over a hundred reviews for this 'cult classic', sort to speak. Originally released in 1969, this was It's A Beautiful Day's debut record. I remember my baby sitter playing this lp several times, as I always thought it was, like sort of cool-but at the same time a bit strange. Now, light years later, I like getting to check out the CD reissue. Tunes I was most impressed with were \\"White Bird\\", \\"Summer Day\\"(most older fans should recall this cut), \\"Bombay Calling\\" and the somewhat eerie \\"Bulgaria\\". Good old school San Francisco psychedelic / folk rock.Line-up: David LaFlamme-flute, violin&vocals, wife Linda-organ&piano, Hal Wagenet-guitar,Mitchell Holman-bass and Pattie Santos-percussion&vocals. Unless your memory is a mite rusty, this band might appeal to fans of Jefferson Airplane, Traffic, Spirit, the Strawbs and possibly Soft Machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album from little know Band","review":"Originally recorded in 1969, Its a Beatiful Day is not \\"main stream\\". This band is not listed in Rock History, yet Hot Summer day and Wasted Union Blues are great tune. The Laflamme brother and sister are the core to the band.Subtle touches of rock and pop were their hallmark. \\"White Bird\\", is of course, a classic.. Sit back relax and listen to the harmony. If you want to show some depth in your collection of 60's music, this is a must to add. Also get the live version of \\"White Brid\\" from The Filmore East- Last Days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, romantic, heats up to a crescendo","review":"I first heard the group on vinyl in '69. I liked it but did not know how to classify it, other than emotional and intense. Then after seeing the group in concert while at an eastern college, I was won over as a permanent fan. I was thrilled it came out on CD. The songs are rich but melancholy, sometimes bordering on sinister with LaFlamme's electric violin. Many keep building up to a crescendo with eerie yet pleasant harmony. This is intense music, excellent for love-making and a classic in its own unique style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best acid rock song ever.","review":"The vocals, lead & harmony, are fabulous.

The melodic \\"White Bird\\" is finally coming back to radio, witness to the music's timelessness. The driving \\"Hot Summer Day\\" is still a powerful piece. The haunting \\"Girl With No Eyes\\", eclectic \\"Bombay Calling\\" and the pulsing \\"Time Is\\", slowly winding itself around to a climax...

The strangely narcissitic character of Dan, her husband is a well rounded study in matching image and human nature.

Her strength in R&B is still as strong as it was back when she started in the mid 1980's, and that remains to be true.Her 2000 DVD, The Greatest Hits, showcases the many talents this legandary Diva has made. While some of the videos reamin as simple, like You Give Good Love, and The Greatest Love Of All, and some reflect Mrs. Bobby Brown as a hard cookie, like Queen Of The Night, and I Learned From The Best.Surprisingly, there are two different versions of the DVD anthology of Whitney Houston's videos. Some of them carry two extra music videos, Exhale (Shoop Shoop), from Waiting To Exhale, and I Believe In You And Me, from The Preacher's Wife.While her music may have fizzled down in the industry, Whitney Houston still shows that she is still a survivor among the so-called corporate teen idol crowd of Nsync, and Britney Spears fans. No wonder Whitney Houston has still learned to be the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I wasn't a Whitney super-fan until I got this!

Wow, now that is a sexy image. Anyone who has ever watched a loved one dying from a lung ailment knows that the last thing on their mind is sex. The remainder of the book plods along, having a few inspirations along the way and cute kids and their antics--but too few.I am struck by the lack of talent in some of these writers and I wonder how much nepotism is involved in their career.

More like the ridiculous!","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It's set in Berlin, cold war, all the things that interest me. This book never gets me to believe anything about the main character. He's incompetent at best. Time spent describing cardboard boxes is tedious, and we never get any detail about the actual tunnel or the spy element to this whole story. To say this book lacks suspense is a bit of an understatement. The whole story is preposterous....young man, unsure of himself, falls for first girl he sees....I thought a high school kid wrote this book. The author thinks that by dropping in a name of a famous street here and there, it is enough to place you in Berlin. It's not.

The characters so perfectly realized they begin to breathe. They take us on a journey through a marriage, a time in history, and the forces of good and evil....and always that disquieting image of the black dogs, symbolic and/or real. It builds slowly, and with his luminous writing style, developes a rich and involving story. It lingers in my mind still. It's theme is so much bigger in scale that the slim volumn that contains it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of Strange Fascination","review":"\\"Black Dogs\\" reminds me of McEwan's Booker Prize winner \\"Amsterdam\\". In both, he sets up a philosophical scheme - in this case, rationalist versus spiritualist. Then, he fully realizes characters that are opposites and shows their interaction. In \\"Black Dogs\\" I enjoyed this interplay and found McEwan to be very insightful about these characters. At the same time, I never really accepted Jeremy, the narrator, who is obsessed with the relationship between rational Bernard and spiritual June. At one point, my marginalia reads: \\"Who is this guy? What is it about an ordinary moment that can generate such foreboding?\\" Even so, this is a book well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite IM book","review":"This book to me never really got going...dragged on too long without much really happening and I could not like the main characters.

I read some good reviews for this one, so I gave it a try. I'm really glad that I did! The cueing is great, the moves are more innovative than I've seen from the Firm in the past.

If you're not sweating after the warm up, you will be sweating after about 60 seconds into the first cardio set, and you will sweat profusely as the workout continues. Warning: the cardio segments are very dancy, however, Alison's cueing is stellar! There are two cardio sets that include light dumbells, one high intensity cardio set. Never fear though, there is an instructor demostrating low impact/beginner modifications, and she gets plenty of camera time! The dvd also features a 25 minute express option, as well as a tutorial that demonstrates some of the moves. This really is an excellent workout to have in your fitness arsenol."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great workout","review":"I rotate between my growing collection of Firm DVDs and this is one of my favorites!

Please note the toning segments are not static toning, but they do have a cardio \\"feel\\" to them. The full workout is completed in 46 minutes, and you can complete the express workout in 25 minutes.I thought Allison did a great job and there was only one awkward arm movement in the last cardio segment.

She instructs at a very fast pace, and I am trying so hard to keep up that I am not paying attention to form. I am probably doing over half the workout wrong. Also, it seems like they do not tailor these workouts to be done on carpet. There is one segment that I have to stay with the \\"modified\\" version in order to finish because my feet keep getting stuck on the regular. It is like you are skiing, yet they want you to change directions. This instructor also is a very \\"dance\\" oriented instructor. I prefer the simple moves that anyone can do. They may be boring, but they are effective because you have proper form!I use this video in my rotation, but I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"This video is ridiculous. It just reminds me of the super fast-paced aerobic videos my mom used to do in our living room when I was little. It is soooo fast paced and I had a really hard time keeping up with the moves. A lot of moves are used over and over again, which is good because that made it somewhat possible to keep up. It was discouraging because I felt like I couldn't do the workout properly. This was a tough video for me, and not in a good way. I probably won't be putting it into my DVD player again any time soon. My opinion is biased though, I much prefer yoga and strength training videos, and I like to get my cardio in from jogging or on the elliptical. So take my review with a grain of salt, because I am new to this type of video."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many dance moves","review":"This video is waaaaaaaay to complicated. I enjoy the Firm DVD'S that focus on strength training, but this particular instructor moves way too fast. If you never grew up dancing, this is not the video for you!

Everything they recorded together that was complete is here. This is definately a must have for fans and hardcore fans. Motown has finally done a little good by releasing this set. Loaded with alternate mixes and some unreleased songs and interviews with Diana Ross, Cindy Birdsong, Mary Wilson, and Otis Williams. \\"You Gave Me Everything\\" sounds like it could have been released as a single, and it's nice to hear \\"Why Must We Fall In Love\\" crystal clear and undistorted, finally.

Together, they recorded a handful of decent tracks. But this 2-disc package, though reasonably priced, is a needlessly padded expansion of two not-very-good albums. If you don't have at least a good hits compilation of each of these legendary acts, don't start with this. Each album (which represents the bulk of it's respective disc) has loads of filler (some of it bland, MOR stuff). Of the bonus tracks, many of them (the majority on disc two, in fact) are simply alternate mixes of album tracks that will thrill only the hardcore.Most of these recordings are far from terrible, and some are very good. But it's not as good as you might expect if you are a fan of these two groups and Motown in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primes and Primetts Back toogether again","review":"The tracks are very good.

Which means you can't tell what time it is at night unless you reach over and push the face.2) The phyiscal orientation of the unit determines which alarm you hear, but the controls to turn off the alarm are only on one side. You will have to pick up the unit, turn it around, hunt down the little alarm on/off button, and put it back down on the side you want. No thanks.3) The sleep function only sounds the alarm three times. Once you've snoozed the third time, the alarm won't sound again until the next morning.

She had he highs, but they really aren't covered in this incredible, but short, piece of work. I can't wait until the next book!For the record, this isn't really my genre of book.

In a way, I'm pleased, I'd like to keep Amanda Stern a secret for a while. Unlike the privileged and over hyped women writers in Ms. Stern's generation (you know who i'm referring to) Ms. Stern is the real thing. She has clearly written this novel from her heart. It is brave and courageous and she has guts. I too see the comparisons to Denis Johnson (this is the one article I've found on Stern floating around out there) but she is very much her own stylist and manages to imbue her novel with such substance and free-spirited language that she arguably stands in a class by herself.

This is THE best action game ever. Although many people would complain about the difficulty level, which I agree on, but it's very rewarding once you get it down. The one thing I was kinda frustrated on was the camera angles. Sometimes you would be fighting like 4 enemies at a time and the camera would do an overhead view so you could not see anything. The enemies are smartest A.I. I've ever seen in a game. You have to be very careful when going against multiple enemies. The bosses are a spectacular sight when you notice the detail. The combat moves are endless and there's great weapons that you can upgrade.

I was a huge fan of how hard it was, but it is a reason why its not for everybody. Ninja Gaiden is renowned for its brutally difficult games and honestly, I have never completed the first game on the NES (but neither had the Angry Video Game Nerd). This game has brought some great thing back to the Ninja Gaiden franchise. Anyways lets get into the game play. The game looks amazing, but the controls are even better than the visuals. They just feel so tight that even though the game is challenging you feel as though Ryu Hyabusha can totally handle it. The story is, well, meh.

Having some kind of in-game training dojo to hone your skills would be very helpful instead of having to do the old trial and error thing over and over and OVER again.

Usually, the person doing a review is uninformed and gives out incorrect information.

Anyway, Ninja Gaiden will be a game similar to Devil May Cry (Lets hope that its not too similar to DMC 2) with graphics that are characteristic of other games released by tecmo like DOA 3. I watched a tech demo of this game and the game mechanics seemed quite good, with a good mix of both sword and hand to hand attacks. I also hear that the game will have a ninja star like boomerang thing, which is always a good sign. The game will also feature the original ninja gaiden and a few of the arcade ninja gaidens from the late 80's and early 90's.

I've never done such, but this in NOT what I look for in a game. I bought a game for FUN, not controller-breaking rage.I will be writing whatever developers I can, and I will keep writing reviews reflecting my serious disappointment in this game.

Techmo did a pretty good job of reviving this game from its original 2d platforming gameplay. I wouldnt reccommend this one for the little ones because of some pretty gorey kill moves and combos.

The bosses are larger then life and highly detailed just as every inch of the game is. You start out with (...) kicking waiting to happen and it's frustrating but as you go on you grow stronger and so does your inventory. The ninpo in this game is an incredible addition the game is REWARDING if you stick with it and it will be worth it in end. Patience is a virtue and anyway's is that not a quality of a ninja. Ok now the camera yes it is a little annoying but only on some fights and if you got the skills this is no problem at all even has right trigger to put camera behind you come on.

For me it was perfect. I'm from the first generation that grew up with games, and in the early days, games were short and challenging instead of long and easy as they are now. To me this is somewhat of a throwback to those earlier days, where you had to figure out the enemy's moves to win...you couldn't just keep pressing a button until he's dead. The bosses to me are just fine..though I'm not quite to the end yet. So far I'd say the first boss what indeed the most difficult..even after learning how to tackle him, it's still hard to pull off...but this isn't true off all bosses...some are riduculously easy once you figure out their weaknesses (like the boss on the 3rd level). But the rest of the game paced is high speed ninja action..kind of like you'd see in a movie. It's the first game of itt's kind in my opinion to pull it off correctly. Give it a chance..and make sure you learn all the moves if you want to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THAT bad...","review":"ok, ninja gaiden is hard, it will kick the crap outta u, blah blah blah... but the camera is not the real problem (i only died once from it) and yeah the save points are a bitch, but the real problem is... the end of the level.i'm not saying it's hard, i'm saying it's ridiculuos. you reach an aztec maze (but i thought we were in japan) filled with only one enemy, those spooky fish, who can't be blocked or attacked by any weapon but the dragon sword or ninpo. you'll find urself racing jamming on Y and B until u reach the next level: a tower were the halls are filled with spooky fish and the rooms are the typical kill till the door unlocks puzzles.other than that it's an ecsellently crafted game with awsome fighting and an awsome story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely rivetting","review":"Great game.

Anyways, about the game.The graphics are just FLAWLESS. The scenery is beautiful, the characters are well developed. 10/10 in Graphics.The gameplay reminds me of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. But 10x Better. I. E You get to see the items equipted in the character. Not only that, but the gameplay itself is similar in the case that you have to look around to make certain things work and develop strategies to destroy bosses and opponents.No, it is not an easy game. A walkthrough guide could keep things flowing smoothly and it wouldnt take the fun out of the game. I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of crap","review":"Runner up to game of the year huh!? All all anyone cares about is the graphics.This game got me so mad I smashed my xbox(breaking it)Then I ejected the disc and tryed to snap it in half!(it was a rental and i was about thirty minutes into it.)NOT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EASY FUSTRATED i.e ANGER MANAGMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the Original Arcade Classic Finally Coming Out?","review":"I remember this game back when it first debuted in the arcades way back in the late 1980's.The thing is, is that none of the big video game companies (Nintendo, Sega, Turbo Graphix 16, etc...) never developed the original Ninja Gaiden, two player version for their systems.I'm hoping that this is the real deal hear, a new version of the original 2 player arcade based game, not that cheap rip off One player version that was originally developed on Nintendo.UPDATE:Well, I guess after all this is going to be that cheap rip-offone player version.This game should not even get a one star rating if it cannot be created the right way.So save your money and buy a game that will be worth spending your hard earned money on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"XBOX OWNERS READ THIS","review":"Microsft is liying about the relese date of the Xbox 2, the console will have a secret launch somewhere in july, they are not telling this news for the community because no one will buy xbox anymore. I also know from a reliable source inside microsoft that XBOX LIVE is sending a undetectable worms to 20% of the xbox users ( mostly die-hard-fans), the worms destroys the hard-dribe of the xbox be overloaing it. Send this to every xbox user, don't let the propaganda fool you, they'r playing with our money just for getting extra cash. This is no joke remember XBOX 2 will come in july with the name of XBOX: EVO.-insider"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fo Shizzle dizzle!!","review":"The game is gonna be the major Biggity Bomb!!! It will Roxxorz!!I will be taking a nap at Wal Mart the day before it comes out so that I will own this game for the rest of my life. I think I may sleep with it for the first few nights after I get it. Ninja Gaiden is the BIIIIIIIIIZZZZZOOOMB!! I'm gonna destroy all dem Mounsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game's gonna be hot!","review":"This game is definately gonna be hot. Don't mind the guy who mad at people who rate games before they are released since he gave it a 5 star rating himself. I specifically remember seeing a video preview that was about 3 minutes long on a preview disc that came with my Xbox magazine long before he saw it a some show. So maybe other people saw that demo too, eh? Don't be so quick to judge there pal. Anyway, buy this game, it's gonna rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only for DOA fans. other than that, the game is pretty flat","review":"it controls similar to DOA games. just another button mashing game. sure the fans of the xbox will praise it cause this is one of the very very few games that carry the crap system besides Halo.the game's graphics are ok. nothing spectacular.xbox sucks"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is awsome (based on demo version)","review":"Ok the graphics in this game are beautiful and its pretty gorey (and thats a good thing) The controls are easy i cant get how its hard to get used to get to the controls the controls are just how they should be and the difficulty could of been a little bit easier but it just makes it more challenging i cant wait to get the full version of the game just the demo got me playing it for hours ."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game just really hard sometimes","review":"Great graphics and gameplay and really what youd expect from the guys that brought you DOA. The cheep moves also transfer (remember draining a guys life meter only to have him opull every counter/combo in the game) The difficulty level is a roller coaster, just be ready to invest some serious time in playing it and replaying it. If you get sick of dying and restarting from where you began(some place dont have easily accesaable check points). Beyond the difficulty level, the camera can get sketchy, and the absence of a lock on feature which makes targeting the guy that you want totally random. Deffinitely give the game a try if you have patience and it deffinitely pays off. Just dont expect a cakewalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy xbox magazine just for the demo!!!!!","review":"I've played the demo fetured on the demo disk that comes with my x-box magazine and if there is anyway for u to get your hands on a copy of the demo i suggest u do just that!!! The game is just plain incredible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the hardest game ever made","review":"this game has little fun factor to it. if you want a game that raises your blood pressure to unhealthy levels during each chapter, to the point where you want to trade it in everytime you play it, then this is the game for you. if you're looking for a game that is fun, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. as much as i love being a ninja and chopping enemies to bits, it is not worth the hours spent trying to advance 50 yards in the game. the average grunt soldiers can at times give you a run for your money. not to mention bosses. weapon power ups are only possible if you spend hours doing repetative killing with no advancement in the game. i thought i could tough it out but only made it a little past half way before i decided to trade this game in for probably half of what i put in to it. rent it dont buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ninjas need loving too","review":"I was really, really impressed with this game. Team Ninja has done a great job on this old school remake. With gorgous environments that you can flip around, walk on, and do amazing things with, this game gives a really innovative and refreshing take on an action game. This is a very versitle action game as well, with a slew of weapons and items. Really bloody too, with some of the weapons you can even decaputate enemies. Even has some flavor from the NES series, you can flip and run on the walls. The boss' in this game are really challenging and the matches have a great feel. The action is really intense and I was really suprised at how much you can do with an action title. The visuals were top-notch, the backgrounds were outstanding and the models were very sharp. Definately the most impressive action/adventure title i've seen in a really long time. Well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best action games I have ever played!","review":"This game is one word: GreatThe action is, for the most part, non-stop. Many puzzles, though some easier than others. The graphics are amazing. The best on the Xbox. The framerate only slowed down once with me. This game is very long by the way. It has 16 chapters and last about 20 or so hours. This game is very hard. If you don't like tough games, steer clear of this one. I love this game. It has many things to make you want to come back to it again and again. If you like hard action games and ninjas...buy this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game is so awesome...I will agree with the other writers it is hard but you just have to out smart the enimies and load up on your elixers. Camera angels get a littler out of wack but slick the right trigger and your back in buisness. The depth of this game is great as with the extremely realistic grafics. I must say if you want a game that will keep your mind busy then this is the one for you. GET IT! its a great game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"The bag is light and very functional. It even stands up. Could use at least one more compartment with zipper on the inside of the bag. This is one hugh bag. Its actually too big for my use."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE BIG SHAM!!","review":"I wish I would have taken the poor reviews seriously before I ordered this book! I am doing research on the Lilith Fair and was desperate for information. However, I could have got the same information off of the net with out having to read about the authors little \\"cowinkidinks\\" that have been thrown in over and over (and over) again throughout this entire book. Fitzgerald (or Fitz, as the people who know her in the book, and lovingly refer to her as, once they discover what a great gal and a great \\"reporter\\" she is) writes in such an irritating and \\"cutzie\\" way that this book makes for one HUGE annoying experence. The only conspiracy going on is all the five star reviews this book is getting!! Save yourself some time and money - Do not buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book, not a great book","review":"I am not the author and I don't really believe Judith Fitzgerald has either the time or the inclination to hang around writing reviews of her own book. I read the book. It's good and it's entertaining. It's not the best unauthorized bio I've read (ie there's no talk about drugs or sex or rock and roll per say) but, all the more reason to read it, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe these 5 star reviews","review":"It's been rumored that the author herself is coming here to write the great reviews about her book. It's really a pity too. As someone who has read the book I can tell you it ain't worth the paper it's printed on. This woman has a serious problem with the fact that Sarah or her management wouldn't allow her to interview them. Sarah's management tried to get the printing stopped because the book contains so many inaccuracies in it. Sarah McLachlan has never, not once, in one single interview called Uwe Vandrei a murderer, rapist or stalker. Uwe thought that she was insinuating that she was. This book is a total crock. Spend your money on a Sarah cd or Sarah song book, please don't waste your money on this book. It's really not worth it. It's only stuff that's already been in print, and a desperate attempt to make money off of Sarah's name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Sarah","review":"This book isn't about Sarah McLachlan. It's about Judith Fitzgerald and her lame conspiracy theories about Uwe Vandrei. The new Sarah music book contains lots more information, plus it's authorized and you get lyrics and music. Take it from someone who read this book cover to cover and don't waste your money. You can find all the interviews in the book on the web. Judith Fitzgerald didn't even get to interview Sarah or her management. This book is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"I can die now. I have read THE WORST BOOK EVER MADE!!! The poor reviews you are reading about the book are entirely true. I can't believe I read the whole thing. WHY???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bashing a reviewer","review":"Okay, I believe that you had no right to bash anyone that wrote a review disliking this book. Yes, you have a right to your opinion, but you have NO RIGHT to tell people that they're stupid/stalkers because they disliked this book. People have made valid points as to their feelings about this book. It's just an opinion. Maybe, on your next review you should stick to your critique on the book and not the people who critiqued the book. Hey, thats just an idea. I am personally offended and hurt by your personal remarks towards me and other reviewers. Who's sorry now? You should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please.","review":"To the woman who gave this book a five-star review: If you're going to criticize other reviewers for their misspellings, you might want to proofread your own review first.Please. This book is very poorly written, and the author is obviously an egomaniac with a vendetta against Sarah. My advice to the author is that she find a life of her own, as well as a new career, because she's no writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read about Sarah, don't buy this book.","review":"I really don't care how much judith fitzgerald thinks she knows about the music \\"biz.\\" And I really got tired of her trying to impress the readers with her vocabulary. If I wanted to read about her, I would have bought her own autobiography (please tell me there isn't one.)No...I wanted to read about Sarah. That's why I bought the book in the first place. It was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindergartener's writing","review":"This book had a very convoluted plot and very contrived plot, that I, frankly, could not follow. Not surprising, considering the conclusions and bs could have only been the product of a kindergartener's writing. The book was probably made as a vehicle to try to get the author into the book world, but if that was its goal I would have to say that I hope she didn't invest too much money in its production."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the worst","review":"This book was the worst of the worst. You cannot try and write a \\"biography\\" while never talking to the subject at all, because it rarely works. The plot was boring and tired, the writing was terrible (especially the stalker material). This book was pointless and boring and every copy of it should be burned. Rating 0 out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely an Allan Smithee","review":"Alright, the writer should have used the infamous movie alias of Allan Smithee, this thing is so bad. She probably wrote this book for a paycheck. But what a waste, if I had all the resources she did, I would basically say to forget the sniping, and actually make it good. Anybody could have done this. On a scale of 1 to 10, \\"Building A Mystery\\" gets a 1! ( I wish we could vote zero)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a good book? Look elsewhere.","review":"If you went into this book looking for great writing, a quality plot, excellent research, and stunning information - oh boy, did you come to the wrong place! However, if you like a bad book that will allow you and your friends to revel in it's inadequacies - you've come to the right place."},{"rating":"1","title":"use the library!","review":"This book isn't worth your money...but if your curious to read it like I was--just to get a better feel for what people are talking about when they say it's bad--please use the LIBRARY! I don't think Fitzgerald should receive any of our money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it less than 1 star???","review":"Fitzgerald needs to find a new soapbox, because this one isn't going anywhere. She's disguised her jealousy of Sarah McLachlan's success by implying that the book somehow comes from a journalist who would never have any reason to say bad things about Sarah. Fitzgerald has an agenda, and it's about promoting herself by lying about someone famous. Fitzgerald needs to get her own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written.","review":"First of all, this book is horribly written. A lot of it makes no sense; plus, the punctuation and grammar are disgraceful (if you need examples, just open the book to any page). This thing could not possibly have been copy-edited or proofread very closely--Sarah's last name is even spelled incorrectly on the spine! Second, the book is just a nasty unauthorized bio. The author engages in some ethically questionable methods to get her \\"information,\\" and implies some outrageous things. Even if you're not a Sarah fan, you'll probably sympathize with her after reading this hatchet job. It must be tough having people write things like this about you. Please, please, don't waste your precious time and money on this debacle of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Strange!","review":"A poorly written, ridiculously subjective, and distracted attempt at a biography (if you can call it that). When my wife asked how it was, all I could do was shake my head and mutter, \\"It's so strange....\\" The book's marginal value lies only in its very small nuggets of early McLachlan info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I paid for it","review":"This thing came out a while back, and I thought I should read it - but I spent the whole time waiting to read something good. At the end I couldn't believe that I had paid for the privelege of reading it. By far the worst part is the end - where's the climax? It just gets to the end and stops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny, transparent, etc.","review":"Almost nothing about this book struck me as entertaining while I was reading it, unless you count all the corny conspiracies that Fitzgerald is trying to pawn off here. They were funny, but I sure didn't believe any of them. The transparent, misplaced humor, the oh so serious treatment of the dead stalker, and the bashing of anything Fitzgerald didn't come up with herself make strange bedfellows. Fitzgerald's lack of insight into Sarah Mclachlan's life is just compounded by the cold, emotionless reporting of Sarah's personal details. It seems a little strange that Sarah's life is givemn such perfunctory treatment, and the dead stalker's life is gone over in loving detail. I suppose that goes hand-in-hand with the totally uncalled for dedication to the dead stalker at the front of the book. That's too weird for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something boring this way comes","review":"I was yawning after the first chapter. I didn't see what all the hub bub was about, bub. Why would Sarah want this book blocked? There's nothing in there that's worth her time, let alone getting her lawyers on the case. Sarah was right, any of the dirt that the author thought she was digging up was more like non-dirt, and quite out in the open. It's all just a bunch of blah, blah, blah, Uwe Vandrei, blah, blah. Overall, I'd say it's pretty blah! ; D"},{"rating":"1","title":"See-saw","review":"We all do dumb things. In Judith Fitzgerald's case, it was writing this book. There is no explanation for why there are so many positive reviews of this book. Apparently those people and me were reading totally different books. Seems too much like they want everybody to think that this book's good. Got news for 'em! It wasn't worth my time, or my eye strain! So much Sarah-bashing going on in it that us seems like a real fan of Sarah's would like it. Which are you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"See-saw","review":"I finished this book only by sheer force of will. It was so full of gibberish that I couldn't make heads or tails of the logic in it.
