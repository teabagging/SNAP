Also, the cover they showed you for the video tape of the uncut is really the Aweaking one, I don't know why the put the words small hearts on it. The uncut and TV versions of the real Small Hearts both has a Sailor Saturn on it, but they are different.

It has a plastic black tray for small bits, screws, tape measure, etc. Has a dome top that allows for thick bulky items to be on the top tray and still able to close the lid and lock it.

This is a great time capsule, people, and if you like American song, it needs to be opened. There's plenty of some of the best of Jolson, a few WWI memories, a taste of the stage (including the signature title piece), and plenty of comedy. There is also lots of contrast in style within, in spite of the limited period of time in which these pieces were published. A study of that facet alone is worth the time of any music student interested in popular song evolution. And you can always write me for further information on nearly any of the pieces.

I learned of this release through the local college radio station WVVS back in 1987 and felt a kindred spirit awaken from within. This is my kind of Celtic rock! Alba, sung in the local tongue, kicks off The Cutter & The Clan with a beat that will remind you of Tears for Fears, but the chorus soars away from that comparison immediately showing that these Scotts have thier own identity. The Cutter brings me a sense of a song written for a soundtrack for a man far away from his home. Bag Pipes? They have 'em. Very tastefully done in Pride Of The Summer. For this American, the whole package is full of emotion and just perfect for an evening sitting on the porch with pipe in hand dreaming of far away lands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure and Powerful","review":"This album has energy from the first song to the last. Of all of the Runrig cds, this one, though perhaps not their best, has the clearest cohesion and progression of songs.

The author clearly did his homework and has the knowledge and a deep appreciation for his subject matter. If I had to say one negative thing about this book, my complaint would be that it was too short. The great details and photos of vintage, promo, and celebrity picks just left me wanting more. A great read for the serious guitar pick devotee as well as for the casual music fans who want to know more about these seemingly mundane musical accessories. PICK up a copy asap!

Well done Mr. Hoover....Well done indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lost AOR album","review":"Storyteller was an AOR/melodic rock band that was apparently kicking around the L.A. rock scene since the 80's, but until recently never released an album. That album - Corridor of Windows - was released in 2000 and features songs written at various points in the band's career.Storyteller's sound was very similar to the classic Asia lineup's brand of AOR in that it's very melodic, has plenty of keyboards, and makes use of some great vocal harmonies. The style of the songs on Corridor of Windows seems to change at random from an Asia/GTR/Journey sound to one more similar to early 90's bands like Giant and Bad English. The band does each style well though, and the progression gives Corridor of Windows a \\"greatest hits\\" feel.I can't quite get on the 5-star bandwagon over this album, but Corridor of Windows is an impressive AOR release (for this or any decade) and should please most fans of the classic melodic rock sound. Unfortunately, the band has yet to issue a follow-up album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the eighties","review":"Hello music lovers! I picked up this cd by mistake, a mailorder company had two bands under the same name. The Swedish symphonic metal band \\"The Storyteller\\" and the American band Storyteller. I thought I had bought two albums by The Storyteller but I was wrong. Instead I got this album. And I couldn't be more satisfied.I love the rock from the eighties, with all the harmonies and arrangements.This is a top album which draws resemblence to bands like Harem Scarem, Giant and Europe. It has a blend of strings, rock edge guitars and high pitched vocals. The material is very good and deserves to get recognition. My favourite songs are Why Cry (best song on the album), What She Wants, and Corridor Of Windows. so if you melodic hard rock you should pick up a copy of this disc. Thank You Ginza for screwing up my order so I got to hear these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the book is ok -- just ok.","review":"The half of the book set during WW-II isn't bad. Nothing amazing, but not bad. However, the contemporary part of the book, i.e. the The Obit man himself and his story is completely extraneous to the main plot. Apart from shoehorning in a reporter (the author's ego) into the plot, and giving him a variety of women to bed, it does nothing else. A story solely about the WW-II character, Mr. Foix, would have been far more interesting. Lastly, there are far too many typos in the book for it to have been reviewed professionally. IMHO, if you want a good WW-II story, try MacLean or Ludlum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body By Bellydance","review":"I give this DVD four stars, not because I like it, but because I think it's an excellent workout video. If you're looking for belly dance, however, this isn't the video for you, unless you combine it with other dance DVDs. There are belly dance moves in Body By Bellydance, but it isn't like dancing. I hate exercise, but love dancing. Dancercize fools me into thinking I'm having fun rather than working out. This video is mostly all exercise - and you want to be really fit with very strong leg muscles to make it all the way through! Michelle (the instructor) does show and explain things clearly.

It's a very nice treat when a great one like this comes along. A no non-sense live performance by The Herbaliser chalked full of tracks with tight lyrics and spun with an artistic flare from beginning to end.As a reference point to compare, I thought Fabriclive.19 by The Freestylers was absolutely horrible. The Herbaliser's Fabriclive album makes The Freestylers' set sound like something from a local ghetto \\"talent\\" show.This album ties Adam Freeland's Fabriclive.16 with 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Snare Drum Heads!","review":"The Remo Renaissance drum head will surprise you with its deep, punchy attack and warm, calf-like tone. Why bother with standard coated heads that will eventually wear out in the middle?!!! The textured surface gives brush work a nice, smooth sound that I prefer over standard coated heads. I'm amazed that these heads aren't more-widely used in rock and pop. Do try one out on your snare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindagoodkindabad","review":"The last portion of this book which has interviews with raw foodists is fairly interesting and inspirational.

The only part that was interesting was the few interviews he did with raw foodists at the back of the book. This book will not teach you the things you need to become a raw foodist.

Even King James (Cleveland) makes an appearance on a song other than the hit title track.It's terrific that this project has at long last been issued on CD. You never know how long the company will keep producing it, as is so often the case with older albums from indie record labels. So snap one up while you can and enjoy the classic sounds of true gospel as only the living legend of Miss Albertina Walker can deliver it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Whole Again!!!","review":"I was 19 and a classically trained musician in college when this came out.

However, if I were to compare, I seem to recall liking Remo Williams a lot more for the humour. Joel Grey in that movie was hilarious as he played out all the oriental stereotypes while at the same time injecting a unique fastidiousness.This movie's link to the original Jekyll and Hyde story is nothing more than the names of the character played by Adam Baldwin. Like Remo, it was also intended to be a pilot for a TV series, but it wasn't very promising in the execution.The plot was rather loose and the vengeance motivation is a powerful drive that needs a powerful resolution which I do not get from this movie.The martial arts by today's standard is rather basic.I give it two stars cos knowing what I know now, I'd rather watch Remo Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I checked out this movie...and lo and behold, it turned out to be a winner. A real suspense ride from beginning to end. Adam Baldwin does his brothers proud with his updated take on the classic characters of Jekyll and Hyde. The Hong Kong-style action tries hard...and succeeds most of the time. A real standout in this mystical, HK-set action flick is Steve Bastoni as a Chicago cop running rogue in Asia and the legendary Anthony Wong. Music is strong. Directing is good. Writing is top notch. All in all it was well worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cleaner for piercings","review":"I recently got my nipples pierced, and it is sometimes difficult to keep them clean. Not with this soap. Very good, and in combination with H2Ocean spray my piercings are almost healed after 1.5 months. I couldn't be happier since my ex-wife had a healing time of 18 months with very little aftercare. 12x faster than if you ignore them. Get this! Also, get a face scrubber to lather and apply, as this will remove the crusted lymph fluid from piercings, and when the piercings are slid through after lathering, an almost cooling feeling is noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form and Style","review":"I always list this book among the \\"recommended texts\\" for my classes.

But wondered if I was the only one who thought it was ruined by the obsessive desire to defend Cliff Roberts, even on matters that really seem pointless. So I came here to read reviews and I couldn't help but notice that many of the glowing reviews here on Amazon appeared to be written by the same person, but I was glad to see some agreed with me about the format of the book. I suppose it's a must for the pictures if you want to see the course the way it once was, but I recommend avoiding it if you get irritated with a book that has an agenda and seems to go out of its way to not just tell the story, but to address issues that someone wanted addressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"It's as if the author was handed a list by the Augusta members of all the things they wanted clarified or addressed regarding Clifford Roberts, and the author was charged with clarifying the supposed misconceptions regarding this odd character. If you are looking for any sign that Bobby Jones was involved in the creation of the club and Masters, forget it. It's as if Jones was just lending his name to the place, like players do today as architects, and Roberts was everything about the club, in every way, shape or form. At least the pictures of the course are interesting and perhaps make it worthwhile to buy, but barely. The text is just a case laid out for making Cliff Roberts a saint. Who cares about that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clifford Roberts Love-In","review":"Too bad the wonderful nuggets about Augusta that Owens has dug up are mired in a non-stop paean to Clifford Roberts. Examples of Robert's usually controversial, sometimes appalling behavior seem brought up for the express purpose of explaining them away, and then always with a very sympathetic eye. It often reads that the only way Owens got so much good 'behind-the-scenes' info from Augusta was by agreeing to write a soft, agreeable portrait of the club co-founder.That being said, it is still an interesting read. Owens' writing and research are first-rate, and his debunking of early Masters mythology is especially interesting. However fans more interested in tourney lore (the 'Masters' part of the title) should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book aided by original source documents","review":"Over the years many untrue articles have appeared concerning Augusta National Golf Club and The Masters. This was probably due to the very private nature of the club which I'm sure rubs some people the wrong way. So to get back at this secret rich man's club, some journalists made up stories and repeated them for years. Now that the archives have finally been opened we are better able to judge the facts. Mr. Owen clears up many of these past inaccuracies in the last third of the book. He also shows us just how \\"touch and go\\" the whole enterprise was in the early years. The photographs and maps are worth the price alone and the history of the club is interesting to read. If you have ever been to Augusta you understand what the word \\"perfection\\" really means. This book is similar to Curt Sampson's \\"Hogan\\" in that it finally dispels much of the nonsense that has been written about these two remarkable gentlemen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"The Making of the Masters cleans out a whole library of rumor and legendary rubbish that has been written about Roberts, the club and the tournament.

It ends very unhappily and without any resolution of any issues. It's like they ran out of film or ideas how to end the film. I understand that life is messy, complicated and often unresolved, but this is not life -- it's a movie, and it left me wanting something, anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad Lesbo flick","review":"There was zero chemistry between the 2 main actresses. Nothing happens to create real conflict between them, making the fight between the two women pointless. The only redeeming point to this whole movie was the straight best friend and the bar scene.

Some of the one-on-one dialog scenes are so poorly directed that they grind to a crawl (I was often saying \\"Cut!\\" in my mind when sitting through these moments). The settings and scenery provide some production value, but the sound quality is poor. The relatively mild sexual encounters might encourage some to hang in until the end for possible fireworks -- but what there is, is not enough to merit a recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BORING!!!","review":"This movie starts off really slow. I mean yeah... the brunette lesbian is hot, but she alone cannot save this movie.15 minutes in, I thought I still have to give this movie a shot.45 minutes in, lesbian kissing scene. I was happy for about 3 minutes then they cut off the near-sex scene.65 minutes in, I'm wishing I'm drinking too.There's nothing special about this movie.

While this book is not aimed at dealing with the death of animals, it offers a clear, simple, sensitive explanation about death and how to cope with it.

I have loved reading his incredibly descriptive style as he paints a pictue of political intrigue, family and spiritual ties and intense eroticism. But this book was not nearly up to par with his past works. The entire plot was overly confusing and too full of coincidences. If the Bonita twins were so powerful, why do they even need Lew Croaker, detective extraordinaire, to do a hit job for them? Especially since they ended up carrying it out themselves after all? Lustabder always has multiple charcacters, but in this title, they were all a jumble. The twins in their little white death truck seemed silly, and the severed heads and incestual sado-masochism was at some points was a little sickening. I was anxiously awaiting for this novel after Lustbader's hiatus, but this was definitely not worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Croacker gets by without Nicholas Linnear","review":"Despite of the lack of exotic settings and having a more ordinary hero,this novel is still a page-turner, thanks to the complexity of its charachters. Croaker ends up being a much more intersting person than Nicholas Linnear (who is something of a demi-god by now), however, DH lacks the thrilling changes of location in time and space characteristic of former novels. It's on the whole a fine novel, but I would suggest Mr, Lustbader to improve his Spanish spelling and grammar, there are lots of mistakes which undermine the credibility of the Spanish-speaking characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FABOLOUS","review":"I have to say that this book is one of Eric Lustbader's finest.

It still had the factory Leaf Springs on it , and rode really rough. Just before my firsttrip...from San Diego to Vegas...I had ne Monroe Gas shocks put on. Lets say I was pretty disappointed. Didnt really notice ANY difference. TILL I PUT THESE BABIES ON!! The air lift 5000 kit raised the back up about 3 inches, and it now rides like it's only about 5-10 years old. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5is it took about 5 or 6 HOURS to install the front and rear. They say a couple hours for the rear. NOT TRUE!!! I had my buddy who is a mechanic bring his Pneumatic tools over etc. Let me say it was WELL WORTH IT THOUGH!!!! GO BUY THESE. HECK if they can make my 33 year old RV ride like almost NEW. What can they do for you??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonder bags","review":"The air lift was just what i was looking for.I have a chevey van that's a 1991 g 20 so on top of this its a conversion as well so very big and heavy.I put the air lift on it so I could pull a trailer with out the hitch draging the ground. I was suprised that it really worked and took the roll out of the van to so this was like a bonus. The only thing was it took more than 2 hours to install more like 3 days try to fig it all out and then have to get some tools like a torque wrench. But the worst of it was geting around the tail pipe so my solution was to cut the tail pipe off so I could drill the holes and mount the brackets. then took the van down and just had them weld a new one on . I chose to just dump it right befor the rear wheel so yhe heat stay's away from the air bags this should give them a good life.So if you are looking for some air lift other than air schock's this is the answer.Becase what yo0u going to do when the shocks blow."},{"rating":"1","title":"get what you pay for","review":"The plastic and leather cover broke as I put the phone in it.

This is just excellent in all respects...The game control is great - precise and intuitive (well, after a while), with many dribbling tricks. The ball can be curved a great amount if kicked right, just how Becks the master curler wanted. The whole atmoshere is there, with highly detailed stadia, design your own if you like. Making up your own teams, and change player abilities leads to some exciting gameplay (always very fluid however much is going on). A really great feature is the training mode, which seems much more comprehensive than others. Beckham is huge, a soccer god, plays for Manchester United, and every school kids dream would be to play soccer like him. A fantastic quality bargain. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Everything in this game is wacky (aka stupid.) It is really hard and the throw-ins are bad. The reason for all of this poor stuff (and more) is that doing anything is random, like a coin flip. I wouldn't be suprised that there is a coin in the machine and you need to get 3 heads in a row to do something succsesfully which makes the game as a whole worse then pathetic.

Also, I liked Ray Stevenson in Rome, so I was really hoping this would be a good romp on the wild side. It just wasn't though. This might sound weird beyond belief, but it was just too immature to be good (weird since these types of movies are expected to be on the immature side.) It reminded me a bit of the Batman Forever movie. Most of the action scenes are good since they aren't chopped up and jerky like a lot of action movies these days, which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. Wish I could say I liked it better. If you're male between the ages of 15 and 25 and get turned on by seeing tons of guns, you may get more out of this. Otherwise, I'd say wait till it gets put on Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Rip-off","review":"No matter how many Punisher movies they make or comices they sell, two things do not change.1. The Punisher continues to be a clear rip-off/imitation of the Executioner, Mack Bolan, series. All the way from the character's background and motivation to the uniform and weapons he uses to even a war van which was another Executioner series original. Except the Executioner has a sense of right and wrong, emulates the true meaning of justice, yet does it with heart.2. For approximately every 5-30 \\"bad guys\\" the Punisher kills, he ends the life of one innocent person.If you believe the end justifies the means and do not mind a few innocent people getting in the way, then you're the type to enjoy this immitation of the largest selling book series in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punisher","review":"Why is everyone so down on the Thomas Jane version? Is is because it has a coherent script and some very good acting?

Would've liked James wacky ways or the Jigsaw Puzzles cut up face. It would have been cool to say to my friends that I liked all the gory action that took place etc. But at 17 I doubt I could even pretend to like this movie.

Too bad, because the lead actor and the ambience are decent -- it's just everything else that is dreadful. You'd have more fun watching a friend play an FPS game on his pc than sitting thru this dreck. And that's all this film is -- people getting shot. Wow, how original. You can crucify me for not growing up on Punisher comics -- but I didn't read Watchmen either before seeing the film, and Watchmen blew me away (5 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Zone rocked!","review":"This movie rocked! A must for the serious Punisher fan; a treat for the casual fan.Even my wife, who has never read a comic book, nor even heard of the Punisher before we saw the Thomas Jane film, loved it.

Some people actually gave this movie 5 stars!!! What a joke. This movie is almost if not worst than Catwoman (I'm not kidding). The acting is horrible. Don't they screen the movies before they release them in theaters? I agree that the previous Punisher movie wasn't as good either but It sure as hell A LOT better than this one. Hell, I'll even watch the Dolph Lundren version than this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Definitive Punisher movie!","review":"This movie was completely lame. The acting was terrible and the plot was even worse. Yeah, it was violent, but you can go see violent movies without them being crappy. The only difference between this movie and Shoot 'Em Up is that this movie didn't seem like it was supposed to be a comedy. Since when was the punisher a gag comedy? This was like watching a violent three stooges. Anybody who liked this movie is completley freaking retarded. Oh really? You liked it? YOURE A MORON! This movie ruined the Punisher. The previous Punisher movie was awesome, and had great actors. I know a lot of whiny fanboy idiots complained that it wasn't gory enough for the Punsiher so Marvel apparently decided to make a retarded movie to appease all of it's drooling idiot fans. You're all morons. You all suck. Goodnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Comparing This With \\"The Punisher\\"","review":"On it's face, and if you have never seen the first Punisher with Thomas Jane, this movie would just be okay. Compared with the first movie though this one is absolutely horrible. No redeeming value at all is felt for the character and I couldn't wait for the movie to end, as a matter of fact I got through 3/4 of the movie and had to turn it off. Waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, this is Punisher!","review":"Let me say this first, Ray is the Punisher. By far he is the best Punisher we have seen in the movies. There were some brutal scenes and some dramatic scenes, Ray pulls them off equally nicely.Gun works feels very real, I mean the timing of reloading, holsting and drawing do look very natural. Gore factor, on the other hand, does not. Look, even if a baddie trips and falls there is blood splatter, come on. They could have toned it down a notch, then it would have been perfect.Although the one with Thomas Jane had more color in the story, it felt like another action movie. But what we have here is a Punisher movie, dark and gritty. Acting is not very strong with the supporting cast, but no problem, just ignore them.Finally, I was expecting Jigsaw to be scarier and better constructed but this will do I guess. Overall, I liked the movie. I'm not the fan of the comic but I guess it's true to it's roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punisher: War Zone","review":"This movie is made for action lovers with weak minds. It is not even close to being as good as the first Punisher. The story line is weak, boring and then they throw in enough curse words to make a sailor blush. When will movie makers learn that ideas can be expressed in english without having to throw in cursing. I was very disappointed after seeing the first Punisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film ever made in the last 30 years","review":"I'm a huge comic book enthusiast. I enjoy even the BAD comic book films, but this movie is one that even I couldn't enjoy. I began watching it with some friends, knowing it was going to be bad, and for the first 30 to 40 minutes, I laughed hysterically at it's poor quality and bad acting. But eventually I stopped laughing because even the poor writing and overuse of the multiple red and blue light filters the cameramen were using was no longer fun to make fun of anymore. Not only that, it was BORING! I was very embarrassed for the film makers because this just might be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I own all the comic book films based on DC and Marvel comics characters, even the really bad ones...I will refrain from purchasing this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ray Stevenson as Punisher, Colin Salmon as Eye Candy","review":"Movies like this are why people should read reviews before purchasing. It should have been no surprise about the violence if you were familiar with the graphic novels. I don't normally go for such violent and gory films, but I like watching Stevenson and Salmon so I gave it a chance. At least it's not brainless, hence my 4-star rating. There a plot and a purpose to this film. And, the ending is okay. Not recommended for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third time's the charm","review":"I remember the disappointment of The Punisher in 1989, then the soft yet not too bad Punisher 2004, after hearing lukewarm reviews for War Zone I waited to see it. After finally watching it I've got to say I really loved it. This isn't a five star movie but it's the closest Hollywood has gotten to the Punisher.I love the fact that they showed his real NY central park origin (I understand the Vietnam connection being erased) This isn't a nice Punisher, this is a big, cold mean Terminator like killing machine, which is what the Punisher is.Surprisingly a guys movie directed by a woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action jam pack","review":"Not a senseless action movie. Actually, this movie has good acting, good script and excellent actions scenes. And above all, excellent direction. The characters are strong and played very well by the actors. I have seen this movie about dozen times, but it still doesn't bore me. The mood and tempo is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action is nonstop","review":"While this movie isnt going to win any awards for plot it is a fun action movie. Over the top violence. The punisher is a great character but this movie doesnt do him justice. The punisher actor did well but some of the other cast like jigsaw fell very short due to some bad script and make up choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ass! movie!","review":"At 1st I was thinking it was going to be like the first punisher but it was wayyy more graphic. Don't get me wrong the first punisher was good but this one has more action. Although i'm not sure if the story line picks up where the 1st one leaves off. I doubt it though, they seem like to completely different story lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than previous versions","review":"Dark, violent, and the way Punisher should be. Early scene at dinner party is one of the best. The Thomas Jane version of Punisher pales horribly by comparison. Ray Stevenson owns the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Sequel","review":"Frank continues his war against organized crime. One day he horribly disfigures the mob boss Billy Rosoti, and accidentally kills an undercover FBI agent. Now he has two groups after him. Rosoti recruits all the gangs in the city to fight with him against Castle. He is about to fight his toughest battle yet.This is another great sequel. Ray Stevenson plays a great Frank Castle, and Dominic West is very good as Jigsaw. This movie has all the action and drama of the previous ones. It's a must see for Punisher fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This Punisher movie is by far the best incarnation of the comic book. This is the Frank Castle I remember from the comic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque Third Punisher Film Not For The Squeamish","review":"\\"Punisher: War Zone\\" is the third attempt by Marvel to start a franchise based on the ultraviolent vigilante who wreaks havoc on the underworld after the death of wife and children. Ray Stephenson takes up the mantle from Dolph Lundgren and Thomas Jane. The first two were their own kind of misfire, but this film is the worst of the three. Grotesquely gory, this film goes way past point of cartoonish action and descends into scenes that some horror movies would shy away from - heads blown completely off, faces blown off, and mutilations and gorings aplenty.The cast and the general direction could have led this film into promising territory, but the desire to gross out the audiences overrode good taste and turned what would have been at worst a passably entertaining film into a sideshow remembered only for continuing Marvel's inability to start this franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punishing to watch.","review":"The idiot before me should be punished for this review.This movie was a waste of Frank Castle and a script.Marvel will never get this movie right because they simply don't understand the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punisher: War Zone, 800th review!","review":"I saw the preview for this movie when it first came out and shrugged it off. I watched a review from a guy saying how good this film was and since I enjoy his work I checked it out. I've seen the two previous Punisher films and I did like the Dolph Lundgren version, which is a shocking statement in itself, better then the newer version with Thomas Jane. This one is probably the best film out of the three.The film is straight up action from beginning to end. I've heard people say the acting sucked, there was little action (well from one guy), and the story was non-existent. It's a friggin action movie who the hell cares about acting? The main bad guys, Looney Bin Jim and Jigsaw did a good performance. There is a story to the film but I guess some people missed it. The action is plentiful and somewhat gory. I highly enjoyed this movie and I barely expect anything from it. Check this out if you want a mindless action film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Since Zelda!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is the best action game i've played since zelda. What a fun, totally awesome game! You won't be able to put it down. My mom had to use the prybar to pull me away to dinner. After school it is the only thing I wanted to do. It took a good 40+ hours to complete. This game can be hard to play at times and you might find yourself wanting to throw the controller. I highly recommend this game. Can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 2. *Spoiler* At the end it will leave you began for more and asking yourself what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful and Enchanting Game","review":"This game was exactly what I thought it would be and more: fun and enchanting.

Buy it, and you definetly won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one complaint....","review":"I loved this game, and having completed it with some minor 'strategy-guided' help, I only have one complaint. A couple of the boss fights are pretty hard, and if you die, you are forced to go through the entire cinematic 'intro' to the fight. This is ok for maybe 2-3 iterations, but seriously, some fights took me 20 tries, and having to sit through a 30sec-1 minute intro (exaggerated) every time gets amazingly tedious and annoying. If there were SOME way to skip the cinematic intro after the first time you viewed it, that would make this game perfect in my eyes. But then again, maybe I'm just a worse player and most people didn't ever have to do a boss fight more than twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Strategy/Action Game!","review":"Great I bought this last year.

In this game you go through a series of levels and defeat different villians from different Disney Classic Movies. My sister says its a good game and lots of fun, she suggests you buy it for kids who enjoy Disney movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it!","review":"I think this game was really good but a little pricey.It has Disney Characters for 8 year olds but a real good story line and good fights for 10-14 year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are still reviewing this?!!!!!","review":"I own the game and it is a good one,but I didn't think it was this good!There are over a thousand reviews in over two years!I have been looking around at what everyone has been saying about it and some of the things are not even true.KH won for the best story honors.I'm not sure if some of you guys actually took the time to play the game.Have you seen the graphics,the gameplay,or how about the different secrets in the game.Secrets like the Dream weapons or the different key blades help make the game worth while to play.Besides, it is at a price no one can refuse.Oh yeah, and if some of you KH haters are wondering why most people hate your review,I may have something to do with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"suggestion","review":"i dont have a PS2 i have only played this at some friends house. i think it would be cool to make one for gamecube. i cant afford to buy a PS2 just for one game but i and i bet lots of other people would buy one for gamecube. please consider this.i love this game it is so much fun traveling through all your favorite disney movies in a whole different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another phenomenal game for all","review":"Delightful game for all ages - My sons and I delight in Square games, because we can work through them together - a perfect balance of story, problem solving and action. This game has all the wonderful 3D freedom of games like Super Mario Sunshine, the action of a first-person shooter (without the gore), and a plot that will cause nostalgia in parents who loved Disney (while introducing the amazing worlds anew for your children). A couple of nits: the Gummi ship workshop is confusing, and you have to be disciplined enough to look around carefully in first-person view for subtle items that are needed to advance the story. I have the strategy guide, but I'm trying to finish the game without it once, knowing that I'll have great replay value looking for all the hidden things...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney and Square? Who Woulda' Thought?","review":"This game is THE best work I have ever seen. A lot of people I know were sceptic on Disney and Square working together to make this...masterpeice. I Am a gamer at heart. I've played the Final Fantasy series many times and this game CD is gonna stay in my PS2 console for a while. All gamers who love FF should love this game to (if they hate Disney, then don't, but who hates Disney?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This game has only one downfall in my opinion, which was that the screen can sometimes be hard to manuever, especially during battles. However, the plot, the characters, the dialog... wonderful! I personally loved this game more than the second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay i'm lost","review":"I'm still on the first level. do you NEED A MEMORY CARD?

I played it at my friends house. It was one piece of crap. It was realy cheasey. They changed Squall's name to Leon because of meeting the King Mickey. That is just plain old sad.-jonnittiPS-Sorry to put you guys down on square-evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can think of better cross overs.","review":"The gameplay and graphics are interesting, Squaresoft has set the standard when it comes to background and character designs. Of course, all of that means nothing since you are fighting along side Disney characters. I wanted to like this game, I really did, but I just felt stupid when Donald Duck and Goofy comes to your aide. If Squaresoft wanted to make a cross over game, why not use the Star Wars Universe? Or Lord of The Rings? Or even the Marvel comics and DC universe. Playing Kingdom Hearts just felt plain wrong, and the game is a rental at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"???????NTSC sold worldwide!!!!!!!!","review":"Do you really think anyone can read NTSC on the product image?????This products are abosulutely no use if you aren't on a NTSC area and this is perfectly detectable before allowing to sell it to these countries.That's my case.I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark to see","review":"The game starts out great. Excellent graphics. Even has its funny moments. Then came the night of the storm, and suddenly you have to navigate through the entire island in almost complete darkness. I've never been able to get past this part because I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING other than a hint of bluish light and a gate in the distance which you aren't supposed to go to until you find Rikku. 90% of the time I find myself guessing where I'm going because I have absolutely no idea. A mini-map of some sort like they have in Final Fantasy games would've been nice. But no, the game designers decided that would've been too easy.I don't know what the game designers were thinking when they made this game, but forcing players to navigate in complete darkness isn't my idea of fun. I tried adjusting the brightness of my TV to maximum, even turned off all the lights in my room, but I still can't see a thing.If it weren't for the near-total darkness, I might've given this game higher rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS GAME IS SO CORNY. BARBIE ADVENTURES IS BETTER THAN THIS GAME. DISNEY IS A BIG FAT SUCKER. THEY CANT MAKE A SINGLE GOOD VIDEO GAME. IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOULL REGRET IT.DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hearts Review! Really Cool Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Personally, I think Kingdom Hearts is one of the best games for the PS2, and I can't wait until KH2 comes out. It's a fun game to play, and the ending is really worth the work.It has great graphics, an exciting storyline, and excellent gameplay. It features Disney characters, and some of the Final Fantasy characters, this makes it very exciting.When I first got KH I couldn't wait to play it because I new it was worth the money. I would really recommend it to people who love RPG's because it's a very good one.My experience with Kingdom Hearts was very fun. Exploring new worlds, meeting different characters and interacting with them was very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for \\"Everyone\\"","review":"Unusually violent for a \\"E\\" rated game (who comes up with these ratings???). The main character Sora frequently must repeatedly pummel the evil Heartless characters with a key or sheild to advance through various stages. He is joined later in the game, and much to my dismay, by popular Disney characters, like Goofy and Donald Duck, participating in the beatings. I never thought I'd live to see the day when Goofy would be trying to beat the poop out of something. The violence comes to a climax at one point where Sora commits ritualistic suicide by ramming a key into his heart to save his little girlfriend.I think the next time Disney partners with someone to make a video game, they should at least attempt to keep it on this side of carnage. A major disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD GAME KIDS!","review":"This game is horrible, Sora is prehaps the cheekyest character in vidio game history, and Goofy and donald are very, very annoying. Also the cutscenes are way too long and are unskippable, and the story sounds like it was made up by a two year old. Now, to the game play; the \\"heartless\\" (the enemies in the game) are fun to fight in the begining of the game, but the battles get boring and repetative later on, and the later bosses may be too hard for your a younger gamer. goofy & donald's AI is incredibly stupid and are better used as sheilds rather than fighting partners. Also magic is too easily used up. Overall I only gave this game one star if it hadent been for the Final Fantasy cameos."},{"rating":"2","title":"good not great","review":"This game was constantly good, but rarely great. At 20 dollars, you should definatly get it. It is not very hard on normal mode, but there is and expert mode or you could just level up less if you're looking for a challange. Like ff 10, this game is a little more forgiving because you are fully healed when you walk over a save spot. This makes leveling up much quicker and easier. The plot was pretty good, but in the end there was less focus on the rivalry, and more focus on a stupid kid plot about the meaning of heart. It liked the combat system because you run around and hit things like you would in an action game, but it still uses RPG elements like magic and leveling up your stats. remember that thisgame does have a lot of disney in it, so there is a chance you will hate this game, but i don't like disney and i liked this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom hearts rocks","review":"Ok Kids. I got this game yesterday when it came out. And it freaking rocks. Ive never seen anything like this game. get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder if there making Kingdomhearts2?","review":"When I was playing the game and finally finished it,the ending was so sad, and I thought, I wonder if they are making KH2 because it did'nt end right because Sora and Kairi never stayed together and it always kept saying that Sora will open the door to the light and he never did. It would be cool if there was a KH2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, just as I hoped!","review":"I at first thought the game might be creepy with all the commericials that kind of looked so real, but it is just obsessive, not creepy.First, I LOVED the theme song at the beginning, and I was so thankful when at the beginning the game took you through the control buttons and had you test them out. I knew how to play in 3 minutes! The effects is awesome and the story is awesome! Very good game. Have no doubts if you are going to buy it. You want it, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bestest","review":"It's fun and entertaining and all around one of the best games i've played. play this game all the time cause i can't put it down. graphics are fantastic, villians are cool (can you say sephiroth?)and the weapons and mini games are awesome!! Not as good as the Final Fantasys (10 and 7) but almost there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I played this game when it came out and i remember i was in the seventh grade. This game was so awesome when it came out. Once you start visiting all the disney worlds you can't help but get engrossed in the game. The fighting system is very basic, as you only attack with your keyblade, magic is for the most part not very useful except for healing. This game is quite long, back when i played it on normal i remeber finishing it after 60 hours that i put on it. For a game with disney characters you would think this game is for kids but it is actually quite hard and I have no idea how a little kid would ever be able to pass this game. If you like final fantasy, you should get this game, if you like disney movies, you should also get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"The Kingdom Hearts series is one of my favorites, however. I must admit, KH2 is way better than KH1, but KH1 is still really good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of the Kingdom","review":"This is one of the better RPGs I have played in my time.

A little Disney, a little Final Fantasy, absolutely amazing music! I've never met anyone who didn't love this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Games out for PS2","review":"I remember a while back I heard my friend talk about Kingdom Hearts, and my first impression was that a Disney game just wasn't going to cut it for me. After hearing from many people talk about how great this game was, I recently took a drive down to my local used game store and purchased this game, and may I say, this game is just awesome. Yes, this seems like a very easy game, but it is actually a challenging game that I can't picture anyone under the age of 12 being able to beat it. The graphics push the ps2 to the limit. The storyline is good. There are cutscenes present, but they are not the usual long and boring cutscenes from other RPG's. This is an action/RPG game, but yet, the game is very easy to catch on to, but the game still presents a challenge.To sum it up, buy this game know! This game appeals to people of all ages. Don't let Disney scare you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hearts brings RPGs to a New Level","review":"I have never had a gaming experience as good as Kingdom Hearts. The characters are so amazing, and the animation is the best. I love this game so much that I was in hysterics at the end. This game is heartfelt, wicked awsome/fun, and slightly addicting. I'm obsessed with it. But seriously--get the game, and be happy for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are gonna be a lot of sequels!!!!!!!!","review":"It's me again I still wanna the secret ending. For any considerate out there. And I also would like to tell you that there are gonna be 8 more kingdom hearts games. Unluckily one fo them is a gameboy advance version kingdom hearts called Kinkgdom Hearts:Chain of Memories. Let's hope the other 7 are sequels to the awesome ps2 version not that they waste it on other crappy consoles. So let's hope they stick to the ps2 sequels. One of them is already being made besides chain of memories and it's a sequel to the ps2 version!!!!! I hope that because I was so considerate to give you all this sweet and crappy information you tell me what the special secret in exchange. PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I really do love this game, it's so fun and addicting.

I played it for 10 minutes and about died of boredom. Where's the action? You have to go around picking up \\"mushrooms\\" and stuff. Plus, there's stupid Disney characters like Donald Duck and Goofy. If you want Final Fantasy, buy Final Fantasy. Otherwise, don't waste your money on a stupid half FF half femmy game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Already have played the import version I must say this game is great. Yes people think Disney sucks but the integration of disney to a Squaresoft RPG was executed very well. The game is dark and challenging. The game is a mix of Secret of Mana and FInal Fantasy IX a deadly combination. If the game had flaws it is the way the Disney World felt small and compressed (come on Neverland had more than Big Ben and the Pirate Ship). The music is excellent and the animation is crisp and clear. A kiddy game? No. A Challenging Game? Yes. A game worthy of the Squaresoft Name? Definatley Yes. And is is better than Final Fantasy X? .................. Nah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best game since Final Fantasy X!","review":"This game will make you laugh, cry, and really into the story. The graphics, the music and the voiceovers are great and couldn't have made it better. Of course there are some problems with the camera, but it won't hurt you that much. It's still good. There are some dark tones in the game that are different from Disney movies and related to Final Fantasy games, but this game has the best ending ever that will make you want to know more about the world of Kingdom Hearts. So what are you waiting for. Buy the game and play it for yourself. You think this is kid's stuff? Wait 'till you go though the game and to the ending. You'll be surprise. 'Cause one thing's for sure, RPGgames don't get better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and clean","review":"this is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love the theme song.this game is very touching.

All these billions of people can't be wrong!(The 1-star rating is for the fact that I only get to see it through other people.

THE \\"UNDER THE SEA\\" WORLD IS VERY HARD. I HATE SWIMMING GAMES! THE SEA WITCH IS EVEN HARDER. THE \\"ALICE IN WONDERLAND\\" WORLD IS VERY STUIPED! AND AGAIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A KEYHOLE IS.FIRST OF ALL, DISNEY HAS THE STUIPEDEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME. IF YOU PUT MOVIES LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND OR PINOCHIO INTO A VIDEO GAME, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT SOMETHING TOTALLY STUIPED WILL HAPPEN. FINAL FANTASY IS A LITTLE BIT TOO CHALLENGING.

Cloud can kick Sora's a** any day so can Squall and them other people. The bosses in this game make a puppy look scarey. The game makes Sephiroth (One of the coolest, strongest, evilest villian from fianl fantasy) look like a turtle on his back. The summons aren't powerful, bambi, simba, tinkerbell, and some other pu**ies are a bad excuse for summons any day. (Where did Bahumet and Eden go?) The story line looks like something that came out of the blender. Mickey can't control a universe and white people can't dance i want justice !

Square has another masterpiece here. Simple as that! This game just plain rocks...and it's one of the best they have made! Kingdom Hearts plays like a 3D pumped up version of Secret of Mana....alot of button smashing and timing things correctly..some of the bosses aren't pushovers either and this game isn't kiddy it may have Disney characters but it's pretty tough in parts...you'll see alot of your fave Final Fantasy characters and all of your fave Disney stars....calling upon Simba as a Guardian Force is just downright COOL...or you summon the Genie...and Dumbo...it's all just fantastic! The graphics and voice acting are superb! Be forewarned this isn't a child's game challenge wise...if you think it is buy and play it on expert....you won't get far.

If you're a Disney freak, it'll be that much better, but even if not - you're going to have fun with this one. The graphics are beautiful, the characters and story are enjoyable, and the game play is a blast.It's an RPG somewhat in the tradition of the Final Fantasy series, but with \\"real-time\\" action in the battles, rather than a turn-based system.

Even though I have not beaten the game I think I can give an accurate review on itThe graphics are beautiful and crisp.You play the character Sora who's homeland was destroyed like many others by the Heartless (the badies of the game who are controlled by Disney's badies such as Malficient).You Meet up with Donald and Goofy in Traverse Town when you fight one of your bosses. Goofy is a knight and Donald a magician (who would have thougt)Donald ana Goofy are looking for the Keyblade Master (Sora)In most levels you can switch characters. Like in the Deep Jungle you can place Tarzan in your party.This is a game for serious gamers and anyone would enjoy it.

I found that I really wanted to see what world I was going to next, and who I might find there. For me that was most of the fun. With few exceptions batlles could be won by just attacking ruthlessly...which is fine by me but it might leave some people wanting more. My biggest problem with the game was the jumping. I'm terrible at jumping, and some of the jumps can be downright frusterating...well, at least it doesn't kill you.It's definatly fun seeing old FF friends showing up.

Ever want to swim like Ariel or fly like Peter Pan? Well, you can do all of that and plenty more!This game is amazing. You play as Sora, who is on a quest for his lost friends after an evil force rips their world apart. Along the way, you get the help of Donald and Goofy, and depending on the world, help from Disney favorites as Jack Skellington, Beast, and Tarzan!The game itself is long--like 30 plus hours of game play. There are many side quests and the game is fairly open eneded. One of my favorite side quests was the \\"100 Acre Woods\\" in which you get to play with Pooh, Pigglet and all your 100 Acre friends.There is no graphic violence (a shock for a PS2 game!) which makes it suitable for the entire family. In fact, my son who is very young, likes to watch daddy play with some of his favorite characters.If you have a PS2 and a family, you must give this game a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Game in the World!","review":"I absolutely love this game.

If you have too much trouble getting past something, all you have to do is fight more bad guys and you'll get stronger. And unlike a lot of games, this one is even more fun the second and third time around. For the Disney fanatics out there, these are the movies included in the game: Alice in Wonderland, The Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh, Tarzan, Hercules, Aladdin, Pinnochio, The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Belle, the Beast, and of course Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Donald, Goofy, Chip and Dale all make cameo appearances.

Especially if you like disney characters. You get worlds like Atlantica from The Little Mermaid, Neverland from Peter Pan and Olympus Colisuem from Hercules. Rating: 6 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Square Does It Again","review":"Square has made, in my opinion, their best game yet. I've been a FF fan since the beginning, but this one is even better than FFX. Yeah the graphics may not be realistic like FFX, but it's Disney for crying out loud it fits. As far as the acting goes, I'd say it's a tie between Hearts and FFX. Most of the original Disney voices are brought back for this one. Hearts is more action oriented than the FF series but it fits the game to a T. Lots of recognizable tunes in the soundtrack help keep you involved, and humming along. Also throughout the game you pass through many classic Disney worlds bringing back memories and making you feel like a kid again. Overall I love this game better than FFX and can't wait for part 2. (Speaking of part 2, there is a trailer for it if you complete everything.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that much hype","review":"The game was pretty awesome from the start of the game. What I really liked about the game is that there are quite a few sidequests. The Coliseum was a great addition to the game because the hardest boss is actually on this sidequest. However, I did think the game was a little short despite what people are saying about the game even with doing all of the sidequests. I do agree though that this game was not much like an rpg, in that you only have control over one character and most of the time you are just hitting the X button to hit the enemy. Also the magic was not very impressive because there weren't too many types of magic and the magic was not very powerful even at the highest level of 100. Overall the game was still a lot of fun and probably not worth the $49.99, but I just figured that was because of the 2 creators Disney and Squaresoft and the cool cut-scenes throughout the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually exciting.","review":"This game is visually exciting and challenging. Wish it were adaptable to a two-player game as well as single player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...for young children learning to play for the first time.","review":"This game has a lot of potential, but very little skill is required for the majority. The activities necessary to get from point to point aren't so much challenging as they are tedious. For instance, during the vine swinging area you may get right to the end, swing to the next vine, hit it directly, but you will fall and have to start all over again. There are numerous parts of the game where the main objective is getting from point A to point B by jumping from tree tops or vines or pillars, but a few jumps will always be irritatingly right out of your reach, causing you to start from the very beginning every single time. It's not as much fun as it is time consuming as this jumping areas of the game are frequent. I purchased this game believing it was going to be like a fun form of Final Fantasy. It's not. This game isn't childish because it has Disney characters in it; it's childish because the tasks are boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool, but not a true RPG","review":"Since I am a diehard RPG fan, it was little difficult getting used to actually jumping and pounding buttons for slashing and dashing. Seeing Final Fantasy characters in new ps2 graphics is exciting.. and the once I got used to the fighting I was addicted. The storyine is a little corny ..but what do you expect from Disney characters? It would be 100 times better is there were multiplke player capabilities too. And it is a fairly short game... beatable in a night if you really went at it. Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"intereasting game","review":"this game is really cool but strange at some times. Its battle system is nice, and if you have ever played Dark Cloud then you can know what the battle system is like because they are almost the same. the only problems are that in some places what you have to do is not obvious so it takes some time. another problem is that in the hades cup ( a coliseum thing that is really cool) 2 of the bosses cannot be hurt for a while you have to attack them a little bit. But without these few problems this game is a very good game to buy or rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is like the BEST game ever!","review":"I played this game at my friends house once and I just love it! My friend and I, we just love the song \\"Simple and Clean\\" so I did some \\"research\\" and I found out it's in the COLORS album by Hikaru Utada. I think KH should be a PS2 owner's first game!

HeHe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good combo","review":"the disney films are very intiguing indeed, Especially Alice and Wonderland, Peter Pan. It is like disney, final fantasy and zelda into one game. What i found strange was how the Ansem report's sound like the devil himself. The disney films often dragged into occultic/illuminatic themes in Wonderland, Sword in the Stone, Pochahontas, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Aladdin, The Lion King but nevertheless i have always thought that some of the disney films have been scarier than \\"scary movies\\". I still remember being scared to death by the witch in Snow White till this day(i was 7 at the time)thank god she was not in the game. It is one of the best games ever and i hope there is a sequel where the final fantasy team will tread new disney ground not covered in the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"this game is a awesome game were any age can play it. the game is easy to use and understand.two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Game!","review":"Kingdom Hearts is my most favorite game in the entire world. I love the fact that it has Disney characters in it. If you name a Disney character, it will most likely be there. For example, Tarzan? Got it. Ariel? She's here. Winnie the Pooh? Yup. Jack Skellington? Present! There are so many more, too. You'll meet all of these great Disney and Final Fantasy characters with great voice-overs and familiar sequences. You can also team up with a lot of the characters to battle the Disney vilians! You can team up with Tarzan, Aladdin, Ariel, Jack Skellington, Peter Pan, and Beast. You can defeat Hades, Cerebrus, Clayton, Jafar, Ursula, Lock, Shock, Barrel, Oogie Boogie, Captain Hook, and Maleficent. Sounds familiar? Thought so. Get this game. If you don't have a PS2, get one. You will definitely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PS2 game I've purchased!","review":"When I heard of the game for the first time, it sounded like a really really bad idea. I mean, Disney and FF? Then I played for a few minutes at a friend's house and was HOOKED! The storyline is great, the gameplay is well-balanced, the graphics are fun and there are little Disney & FF in-jokes everywhere. It's not too hard for younger ones because of the two difficulty levels. Seasoned gamers will feel comfortable with the Final Fantasy style commands. This is a must-have game! I'm sure that most PS2 owners would love to receive this one as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game this year! Great for ALL ages!","review":"Kingdom Hearts is a fabulous game. The graphics are beautiful, and the sound (music and voice acting) is among the best ever created. The story is entertaining and fun, and involves literally dozens of favorite Disney heroes, villians, and other characters. People who assume that this is a \\"kiddy\\" or \\"cute\\" game just because it features Disney characters will probably be pleasantly surprised if they give this game a chance. I had a wonderful time playing all the way through it and I still go back to explore even more. I'm 23 and I enjoyed exploring everything, finding all the secrets and hidden items, and figuring out the puzzles without a strategy guide (it took me about 33 hours in total to complete the game). But this is also a game I feel comfortable sharing with my nephew (age 6) and letting him play (he does need quite a bit of assistance with reading, etc. in this one). I would recommend this game to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"you will be the one who will open the door...","review":"Sora, Riku and Kairi all live on Destiny Islands. While in the secret place, Sora meets an unknown hooded figure who wanted to see the door of Sora's world. Soon after that, Sora's world is swallowed up by a race of evil beings known as the Heartless! Sora ends up in Treverse Town, where he is awaken by...Pluto?!Yeah, that's right. Disney and Final Fantasy characters roam about in this game. You team up with Donald Duck and Goofy to fight the evil Heartless. Donald and Goofy are looking for a \\"key\\" and Sora has the keyblade. Donald and Goofy are also controlled by the computer. The two will fight enemies on thier own and heal each other if they need it. The battle system is inspired, allowing you to move around the fight in full 3D, as opposed to the stationary battle systems in Final Fanasty VII.The game has two modes: Normal and Expert. I suggest you play on Normal. Just 5 stars? I give this game a 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Kingdom Hearts is one of my top favorites.

To interact with characters from the movies, with a few Final Fantasy characters thrown in, is pretty dang cool. The game has some nice visuals and decent bosses. The camera angles are fairly worthless and the controls are bad enough that you'll never quite get used to them even after hours of play. The weaponry is decent and the choices are definitely there. My only real complaint about the game is that Square Enix doesn't really allow you to use their characters throughout the game. The Disney character are the only ones you can use. I kept wanting to rock it up with Cloud from FF7. But this sadly isn't really an option. You only really get Donald and Goofy as companions. But aside from that, great game and definitely worth playing all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product and fast shipping","review":"Game came just as described and arrived in only 2 days!

I will be purchasing from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2002","review":"This game brings RPG's to a new (possibly disturbing) level. Squaresoft inserts many of their characters (including Cloud, Squall, and Sepiroth), and Disney puts in nearly all of theirs in some way, from Jack Skellington to Winnie the Pooh to Dumbo. If you like Final Fantasy, or even if you don't, you'll love this game, especially just to see the Disney characters interact.

I put it in my PS2 system after playin some Tony Hawk 3 online and I started it up. I was like whoa from the time I put disc in til I took out. I loved it. I have spent a few hours on it.

After playing through Final Fantasy X, I realized that the characters were annoying and childish. Now, with the release of Kingdom Hearts, we see where Squaresoft is heading. They are targeting a much younger audience now (5-13 years old), and as such, Square has turned away from making good role-playing games that require thought and skill to master. Kingdom Hearts is an OK Disney animated movie, with some RPG-style battles using magic (almost exactly like that annoying Pokemon/DragonBall Z/ etc..) I rented it, and was quite annoyed with the fact that Disney characters keep appearing. From the reviews I have read, it seems that everyone loves this game. I think many of these reviewers have never played a true RPG, like the ones that were very popular from 1988-1994. I suggest people avoid this game, simply because it is just another Disney product, very watered down and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be talking about another game","review":"I have played this game, and this game is HORRIBLE! The graphics are ok, the camera angle [stinks], music is horribe with all the little pop noises and stuff, and the worst of all.......IT HAS DISNEY CHARACTERS IN IT!! This game seems to be like something for Squaresoft to keep onto the shelves with. The so-called battle system hs been used before, as in DEVIL MAY CRY (2)(even though the system uses three characters in this game, and one to control in DMC), and some more games, and the story-line is totally bogus. As well, they run out of inventive or unique characters, so they throw in characters from the FF games. This game is a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kingdom Hearts","review":"I am so disgusted that the makers of such an excellent series in Final Fantasy can make such a stupid game in Kingdom Hearts.

It's sad to see Disney trying to inculcate good buying habits (buys Disney, get it?) in the very young, and comical to see a kid raise her eyebrow, frown, and grok the entire situation in a sudden furious flash. Sorry, but Disney's \\"crown jewels\\" can't compete with Final Fantasy XII (or even X). How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Valley of the Winds? And Square Enix should be ashamed of themselves for soiling their own brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and just plain wierd","review":"This ridiculous pastiche of two marketing juggernauts -- Disney and Final Fantasy -- is a perfect example of how Hollywood will ruin the video game industry. Is this what passes for creativity now? There was barely any attempt to combine the two in any sensible way. The dialog between self-important FF folk and the most idiotic of the Disney crew (i.e. Goofy) is like being on drugs -- really bad drugs. The battles are tedious. The gummi ship sequences are dull as dishwater. The camera angles are literally nauseating. Watching the auxilliary characters in your party jump around like drunken spiders would be unintentionally amusing, if they didn't get in your way when you are trying to kill the incessant stream of boring baddies. But the worst part is the music. It is so insipid (particularly the Traverse Town theme) it is enough to make you turn the game off -- or at least the sound.

Some of the bosses can be hard like (Sephiroth, Phantom, and, Riku2). But they are easy if you are a strong level and you have the right equiptment.

However, it isn't as hard as the actual Final Fantasy games. Final Fantasy games are tough RPG's that definetely require a brain to play. Passive playing and cruising don't apply here. Only play a game like this if you are willing to put the time and effort into it. It is fun. It isn't too easy either. It's a pretty good balance with nice graphics to keep younger kids happy to watch. Story parts are usually incorportated into Final Fantasy games. Parts of the game where you watch,read, and listen, rather than play. These usually aren't long, except for the starting of the story.

I am a 24yr old male and have never played Kingdom hearts before even though I've played RPGs all my life. All of the other reviews have hit the pros/cons right on the head. The scenary and characters make this game. The combat is extremely repetitive but it is not quite boring. You are jumping around swinging your keyblade most of the time. The bosses are relatively epic for a game made when this was. I think the game was geared more for a younger audience because of the Disney characters and the fact that the RPG elements are kind of light. I would pick up a guide unless you like being lost and not know where to go to progress the story. You have to like RPGs to like this game, or it may be a good way to introduce yourself to RPGs.

Not only are there hundreds of disney characters in the mix, unknown to the public was that Disney executively produced Nightmare Before Christmas, the classic Tim Burton fairytale. Quite a surprise to most, even Aries from final fantasy VII is still alive! Graphics in this game are amazing, even for the playstation 2, not to mention gameplay is so invigorating you can't put down the controller.

There are so many side games that you can play this game for many years and still have things to do. If fighting is your style, You can always boost up levels for as long as you like.

Whos office has a huge door, Anyway he gos off to find the probablem with the doors and heartless and the blablablablabla. So on Soras quest he meets with Different disney characters to join the party. The combo moves are nice and the bosses are cool. Kingdom hearts is a challenging game like all the other Final fantasy games. It is ok but not the best out there.

Look for the sequall in December 2005"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hearts ROCKS!","review":"Don't be fooled by those stupid one star reviewers! They only don't like the game because of the Disney themed worlds. The story is awesome! The graphics are tight and it's a lot of fun to play! Even with the Disney worlds. They are way more fun than it would be to visit Final Fantasy Worlds. (Although I'd like to go there in KH2). Buy this game! It's soooooooo cool. Sure there's a tiny problem with camera angles, but I really didn't have that many problems. But, don't be fooled by it's cutsey worlds. This game is really hard! I mean crazy hard! It was still good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Some people don't like this game just because it has Disney charactors. Don't listen to them. This game is mostly Final Fantisy charactors, but most of the boses are like Captin Hook, Jafar, and Oogie Boogie. But when else do you get to beat stuff up with the Little Mermaid. I wasn't going to buy this game, but I got it for Christmas. After 5 minutes I already loved it. So unless you absolute ly hate Final Fantisy and Disney buy it. If you don't like Disney just rent it. It's one of the greatest games out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game in history","review":"i would give this millions of stars. This is a great game. The voiceovers are awesome, the graphics are incredible, the control is good, and the fun factor is awesome. there are hundreds of disney characters. The worlds are wonderland,olypus colisium,deep jungle, agrabah, monstro, atlantica, halloween town, neverland, and hundred acre wood. I beat this game and i wish i can do it again without knowing the real story. I deafeated the great warrior Sephiroth, the ice titan and other hidden bosses. I did all of the extra things like finding all dalmations, winning hades cup, and sealing every world. I also got the ultima weapon. To all you final fantasy fans you might like this without the disney characters, I thought this game was dumb but when I played it I lived it, anyone who hates this game does not know what a masterpiece is. I proudly have this game on my rack of games. Everyone get this game and make it become a greatist hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"ssssooooooo awesom","review":"the best game made ever in the history of the world. kingdom hearts deserves this many stars ************************************************** it is that good. it has a real time fight thing that is realy cool. also if you beat it with some extra stuff you get a weird ending that hints that their will be a kingdom hearts 2. i cant think of any game that tops this or any other stuff to say about it. over all this is the best game ever. buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"Ok, if you like Disney you will definately love this.. it features many many different types of world featuring the characters you have grown up loving.. the only problem I have found with this game is that at the end it gets very hard compared to the beginning, and people under 10 might have some problems. Also I feel it is a test of your frustration level because if you can't beat it the first few times you won't go on for awhile. There are of course good points to it, the graphics are excellent while the sounds are good too. They also get excellent voices on the character.. also I found that if you answer the questions at the beginning selfishly then your health will never reach its full potential. And almost all the charaters have a pretty close voice to the way they were 10 years ago. You go through many worlds in this game also like Atlantica, Holloween Town and Wonderland. Overall I would give this A 5 but because of diffucutly and frustration I give it 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hearts Review","review":"Kingdom Hearts is the best game ever! I love it.

Combat is perfect, no bad angels or cheap A.I., just fun. If you think this is a kiddey game just cause of mickey and the gang your wrong,...I would recomend this to anyone with good taste.

If you liked Jack and Dexter, you will love this game even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Game","review":"Wheeee! This game was really, really fun to play! The characters were wonderful, and the Disney ones were so cute. The music was quite redundant, mostly coming from the Disney soundtracks. However, the voices for everyone's favorite Final Fantasy characters were great, Leon's voice fit him perfectly. The graphics were also quite nice. Hallow Bastion, the \\"Holy Fort\\" was absolutely stunning. The once blurry and blocky Cloud is now very very hot. ^_^ The controls were pretty easy to use, and the battle system was nice. However, the camera was horrible! If I ran into a wall while trying to move it, there was nothing I could do but move. That often resulted with me falling off of a ledge. Another factor that brings this game down a star is the replay value. I don't think I will touch this game for a long time.

A few years later, I decided to re-purchase the game after I (regretably) gave it to my friend. I forgot how much fun this game was. It was just as much fun playing it now as it was then, and it was worth every cent - especially since Kingdom Hearts II is now on the market. Definately pick up a copy if you have never played it before or no longer have a copy. Oh, and to anyone who thinks that this game is for small children - you are entirely wrong. The storyline is really deep when paired with the sequel, and it is touching to people of all ages. Overall, it's a blasty blast. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't the RPG you're used to...","review":"Kingdom Hearts is a great game. With that in mind, let me say that its not really the kind of RPG you'd expect from Square. Not because of a weak story or the Disney aspect, but the gameplay has changed dramatically with the introduction of real time battles. Kingdom Hearts plays more like an adventure than it does a roleplayer. You don't really need the kind of strategy here that you did in past Square games, its mainly hack and slash. The story is great, as well as the characters, but don't buy it expecting anything like Final Fantasy X."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy Game","review":"This game was in very good shape when it arrived.

I heard that Squaresoft and Disney were making a game and all I could think was \\"How lame will this be?\\"To my delightful surprise I found this game to be nice and simple. The story reflects those of Disney movies, yet the whole time there is a bigger plot at work, and was beautifully delivered by Square.The gameplay is simple, yet fun. The graphics are extremely good (one good thing Square got from it's lackbuster film.) The story line is very good, and I think now that Square has devoted a branch towards it, things only look to get better and better!If you are doubtful, give it a shot with an open mind, you might be surprised what you see"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME AND BEST OF ALL ITS JAPANESE!

All that changes, though, when evil creatures known as 'Heartless' attack. Then you're launched into a mystical adventure with Goofy and Donald as your allies, along with the characters from Disney Worlds. The plot is amazing, taking several twists and turns througout the game. The music is also top-notch, with songs that reflect the world and situation. The only downside is the sometimes-screwy camera, but it's easily corrected by the manual camera controls.

The best part is hands down the battle engine. It's nothing like Final Fantasy (a good thing in my case) because you actually get to move. Dont get me wrong, Final Fantasy is great but this is so much better.The storyline is pretty good too. If youre older and you think Donald and Goofy are for little people give them another chance you wont regret it. You play as Sora as you try to find your old friends.

The introduction song is very nice. If you like Lance Bass, he plays on of the voices. There are over 100 disney charcters in this game. You start at at this place called Destany's Island. Then you leave the Island because a big storm hits, and then you meet your sidekicks, Goffey and Donald, they are searching for the king, Mickey,( this is where Donald and Goofey are from,) while you, are searching for your friends, Riku and Kira. After you beat the first place, where you meet Donald and Goffey, you start out at 3 worlds, Herculas, Tarzan's, and Alice, ( which is wonderland.) This is a great game for everyone, even though there are Final Fantasy Charcters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hearts","review":"Wow! I've just finished it - excellent role-playing game! It is a collaboration between Squaresoft and Disney, so features a lot of Final Fantasy and Disney characters, most with authentic voices. There are a few new characters, with voices from the likes of Haley Joel Osmond.The graphics are amazing throughout, although being closer to a platform game than classic Final Fantasies means that although the fighting is not turn based, the camera angles will have you tearing lumps out of your sofa in frustration sometimes.Each world that you visit is based around a different Disney movie (using the featured music also), although swimming in 'Little Mermaid Land' (Atlantica) is very frustrating.As a whole, the game follows a lot of Final Fantasy traditions, with plenty of side quests and chances to level up for hidden boss fights if you want.I highly recommend it, especially for Final Fantasy fans or those who were put off the series by the turn-based battle system."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Ever!!!!","review":"This is my favorite game ever!!1 It may have Disney characters in it, but it's still one fun game.

The fact that you are trying to rid the universe of darkness, and defeat evil disney chracters such as hades, Jafar, and Maleifancant is funney, yet oddley intense at the same time.

Sure, the cut-scene animations are great, and it's cool to see all the Disney characters--but otherwise, it's hard to figure out who's supposed to like this game! The gameplay is way too simplistic and repetitive for serious gamers, but it's too slow-paced, too map-based, and ultimately just not imaginative enough to hold the interest of most kids--or even us boring grownups for that matter :).Underneath it all, Kingdom Hearts is a very second-rate RPG with little to recommend it aside from its cool animation and its Disney cameos. Is it worth 50 bucks? No. If you're excited about seeing Disney characters onscreen, your money would be better spent on your Disney DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner's RPG","review":"I tried so hard to get into this game. I love RPGs and especially the Final Fantasy series, along with dungeon crawlers (such as Dark Cloud and Zelda). This game bored me so incredibly with its easy button pressing and redundant music whenever I was walking or fighting (the cutscene music is excellent). The gameplay is seriously lacking in the FF strategy and Zelda variety, being a simplified version of a dungeon crawler. This is not for RPG veterans. It will offer them no challenge and just put them to sleep. I recommend this to the younger gamers who have not played any (or many) RPGs.

They make more and more and soon they will be making worse and worse games. Why not mix Resident Evil with Dora the Explorer? Or maybe Metal Gear and Barney.

Segas game has much better graphics(the players have double the amount of polygons compared to EA's),also the players faces look more lifelike and more varied.As for the sound,again Segas game is more active and immersive. As for the announcers,EA wins because of the 3 amigos that are the same crew that do live television broadcasts weekly.(Corso,Herbstreet do most of the talking)As for presentation,Sega is better with their new ESPN license,looks just like on TV.And most importantly gameplay,its a matter of opinion.

Also, another bad characteristic is the fact that you cannot erase the previous data, so if you buy it used, it'll probably have all the characters unlocked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste.

This movie is insane. There is no cinematic structure, no suspense, no atmosphere and no climax or any substance whatsoever. This movie is a disgrace. Simply ridiculous. What were they trying to prove here anyway? I think I spent 20 minutes of the movie watching a pink toaster in the movie that seemed like it would never go off the screen. Obviously, the creators of this flick were going for the \\"Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Paranormal Activity\\" angle with the live video footage, but they just did a terrible job of telling this story. Unbelievably boring movie with pathetic acting makes for a watered down mess here. I wish I could have liked it, but it was completely lacking in style and substance.

It obviously has nothing at all to do with the first one, it's in a completely different sub-genre (the first was a slasher while this is a found footage film) Plus I strongly doubt anyone of the 15 people who had the supreme misfortune of seeing the first Knock Knock would ever want second helpings of that cinematic cesspool anyway.But I digress, this movie regardless of the title is utterly awful. Imagine \\"Paranormal Activity\\" made with a lot less money, few fewer scares (knock knock 2 has none whatsoever), worse actors, and a woefully unengaging storyline.

She has a beautiful voice, and it is very well showcased in this project.If one needs to pigeon hole this project, it would be as folk. The acoustic guitar is the prominent instrument. \\"Midnight\\" is the sole excursion into alternative music on this project.Masen wrote eight of the songs on the project, and co-wrote a ninth, \\"Home\\" (the final song) with Julie Lee. Masen also has a cover of the Supertramp classic \\"Give A Little Bit.\\" On one hand, I was disappointed with it, because I loved all the great acoustic guitar-work on the original, which is lacking on this remake. However, Masen's strengths are her singing and the words she's singing, which are clear.My favorite tracks on the project are \\"We Are A Beginning\\", \\"Girl On Fire\\", \\"The Valley\\", \\"Hit And Run\\", and \\"Hope\\".I would recommend this to both Sarah fans and to newcomers to Masen's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAVE WHO ?!?","review":"5150 is an excellent album.

It really has it all: a great mix of melodies and guitar rock. What makes Eddie so great is his unreal guitar skills combined with his ability to write memorable tunes and no VH album shows that better than 5150.I have to disagree with some who think Eddie's best work was earlier in his career. As great as his early playing was (and it was great), I think it was a little one dimensional. His later work shows improved sophistication and real mastery of the instrument. His ability to compose a good melody and put underneath it a complex guitar accompanyment (it's so busy it's hard to call it accompanyment) really shines on 5150. Listen to what he's doing on some of the songs while Sammy is singing. I don't know how he does it. Also, the solos that Eddie plays on this CD are universally awesome.If I was forced to give away my CD's except for a few, this would be one of the last to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of Van Hagar!","review":"This album came out when I was a senior in high school and it was all the rage.

I never really liked them with David Lee Roth but when this album came out and hearing the songs on the radio (Why Can't This Be Love, Dreams, Love Walks In, Best Of Both Worlds), I had to get this terrific album. Sure it sounds more pop orientated then their older stuff, but who cares? Its great music at any rate.

Sammy already had a career by himself and with HSAS,which is an acronym for the last names of the band's members,another being Neal Schon of Journey. That same year,original Van Halen lead singer David Lee Roth released his second solo album,EAT 'EM AND SMILE. Sammy's biggest solo hit was I CAN'T DRIVE 55 in 1984. In '86,this was one of the year's best-sellers. Hits include WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE,DREAMS,GOOD ENOUGH and LOVE WALKS IN. The studio that this album was recorded is called 5150. On INSIDE,we hear the band \\"bulls---ting\\". One said \\"What kind of crap is this?\\" Another said,\\"You got a point there!\\" Their follow-up,OU812,was also a big best-seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Don't recognize them anymore\\"","review":"This album has some good songs on it admittedly, but the energetic, all out, unabated, rock your socks off sound is gone. Roth is out and Hagar is in and the sound changed dramatically. I know I don't speak for all Van Halen enthusiasts but I think Van Halen sounded better with David Lee Roth and David Lee Roth sounded better with Van Halen. I'm not trashing this album, it is good, but its a far cry from their audacious beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is your father's Van Halen","review":"While this band was a driving force in it's beginning, the fire that was instilled into the band left with its original lead singer. Love ballads covered this entire album. Ripping, inventive guitar was replaced by sappy synthesizers, and Eddie went from guitar wizard to mediocre pop star. This band changed after Dave left, and not for the better. If you want to rock, get Van Halen's first 6 albums, and David Lee Roth's solo albums (especially Eat 'Em And Smile and Skyscraper with Steve Vai, and his latest DLR Band). They carry the original Van Halen attitude.They definitely should have changed the name to Van Hagar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and different","review":"5150 was the first album with Sammy Hagar. When he joined, their music changed comletely. Eddie's guitar playing dosen't even sound like a guitar. Their is not one good guitar solo on this record. All the solo's are a bunch of whammy-bar noise crap. Anyway, the cd does show some good tunes like Dreams, and Love walks in. That is about the only songs I can think of. The album proves that VAN HALEN WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ALBUM AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST. It seems that their songs are not as good, and neither is the guitar playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen Rocks!","review":"Does it get any better than this?

After buying 5150, I was reminded why. After going home and locking myself in my room, I put 5150 in my cd player. Instead of the usual womanizing hard rock that I had come to love, I was greeted with Sammy Hagar screaming \\"Hello, baby.\\" Please. After immediately skipping that track, the truth had set in - I had bought a poor man's Van Halen album. Why Can't This Be Love? Maybe because you're responsible for writing I Can't Drive 55? I listened to a few seconds of each song before taking 5150 out and wondering to myself, \\"What the hell was I thinking?\\" The cd gets one star because after hearing a preliminary version of Why Can't This Be Love, David Lee Roth left the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap?","review":"As everyone else, I was shocked when I heard that Diamond Dave was out. I decided to listen the Sammy stuff, though, and I have to confess that I was terribly disappointed! The people who claim a change was necessary and there will never be another Van Halen I album miss the point. Of course there will never be another VH I album, but the problem is that quality is gone. It is not because an artist has to evolve all the time not to spend his/her life playing the same tunes that he/she is to start playing worthless music. I think it is impossible to enjoy this record if you already know what was done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Hagar Yuck","review":"I really really really like Van Halen, but when David Lee Roth left that just did it for me. Even though Eddie still jams just as good as before I just don't like Hagar. For me Roth's voice made this band just that much better.

Van Halen was great, but Van Hagar is less then ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me wrong...","review":"Dont' get me wrong, I'm not the typical \\"Sammy Sucks, get Dave back\\" reviewer.

Over night,the VH motto changed from 'Ain't Talkin' Bout Love' to 'Why Can't This Be Love'. Also, enter syrupy love ballads(thankfully absent from the Roth years),and possibly the WORST lyrics I've ever heard.(\\"Only time will tell if we stand the test of time!?!\\") And 'Get Up' only sounds like the band is trying to out-rock themselves. Given; Sammy is a good singer, and obviously did bring energy to the band, but they should have taken their label's advice and changed their name. But check out the video for this tour, 'Live W/O a Net' for a few laughs.

David Lee Roth had just left Van Halen, and the initial single, \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\" was pretty bad. Then a friend bought this and I heard the entire LP. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Besides the single, the rest of the album is very enjoyable. Songs such as Good Enough, Get Up, and 5150 are great rockers.

The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot. This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy flashlight","review":"This is a sleek looking flashlight ( mine is all black), comfortable to hold, though a little heavy considering the size. Its not at all compact, meaning one you can carry and shine with your fingers. This advertises a wide beam, and it delivers on that. Unfortunately, the projection is short and the wide beam is dull to the point of it being fairly useless. Further, because of the shape of the end, you cannot stand this flashlight on end, meaning it takes up more space.To add insult to injury, the flashlight wore through it batteries very quickly and now the end cap is somehow fused on so that I cannot remove it to replace the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Flashlight","review":"By the time the broad beam reaches the ground the light is so diffused as to render it useless. Walking on a dark road or sidewalk with this flashlight is similar to driving too fast on a dark country road without using the high beams. You out drive your headlights. In the case of the flashlight, you simply out walk the light. The light is weak and fuzzy at the edges with no distance projection at all.Without any doubt this is the worst flashlight I've ever owned. The attempt at cutting edge cuts out the user's ability to see anything. And into the trash it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop/Rock Culture Adventure","review":"Touching story of a young girl from a small town who moves from home to home in search of a family. She eventually winds up on the streets and uses her gift of voice to get by. Here she finds a real family and partner with whom she shares her talent in a band called Cloud Cuckoo Land. They grow together teaching each other lessons of love, friendship and life. Very well-written; real and interesting characters; as funny as it is touching. I recommend it to anyone... especially those who lived and loved the 80s music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"fully worth the trip","review":"This novel is extremely fun, loving, mischievous and joyful. It's kind of like \\"White Oleander\\" except less melodramatic and not depressing. Like WO, it's about a girl who gets abandoned by her mom and gets shunted from foster home to foster home. But CCL has a lot more music to it than WO, esp. since the main character, Miri, is a musician. Nice evocation of the Austin music scene and of '80s and '90s musical culture. I bet Lisa Borders will be The Next Big Thing--hey, based on this she already is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and engaging","review":"I've always being a fan of the forgotten realms, and the story of Finder and Joel is especially intriguing. The plot is excellent, though a little unrealistic as powerful gods like Selune and Finder send poor Joel to multiple planes to thwart a plot involving the lady luck. It is also rather unbelievable that a god of good could be so totally blinded by a god of evil right beside him. Still, the writing is excellent, the plot flowing smoothly. The characters are likable, especially Jas, Joel and Finder. It is well crafted, and that is all that matters for a fantasy book. After all, 'reality' and 'possibility' should not be the judging criteria of fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stain on it.","review":"One of them has stain on and I cannot remove it.

However, used no more than 10 times, the stress on the fiberglass frame that is always under stress due to its bowed fiberglass construction eventually will break at the weak point which is right where the fiberglass frame is joined together by a metal coupling. When I finally contacted the manufacturer, they did determine it to be defective and promised a replacement. They went dark on me and never provided the exchange nor would return my calls.

Maltodextrin is the first ingredient listed on Sweet 'n Low frostings. Athletes use maltodextrin in energy drinks and foods to give them a *BURST* of glucose. My diabetic family members' postprandial glucometer readings were incredibly high after eating this. I've written the company about the impact of their product & to stop touting it as a \\"must for diabetics,\\" but they never responded. PLEASE, please, please realize that if you're a diabetic, eating maltodextrin is worse than eating sugar as it has a quick, rising impact on blood sugar--unhealthy for diabetics.

While it has many assets for anyone interested in the dialogue between science and Christianity, what stands out in my mind is its treatment of the relevant Biblical texts. Collins' knowledge of the nuances of Hebrew is staggering. I find his treatment of the ever-controversial \\"days\\" of Genesis 1 to be especially satisfying. I suspect that his arguments will be widely considered, and highly regarded, in coming years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous wolf in sheep's clothing","review":"Now here is a strange book written by an educated Christian who teaches at a seminary in St. Louis. Collins has come up with the analogical days theory to explain the six days of creation (he thinks the six days were several years). He builds his entire case on a very poor interpretation of Genesis 2:5. We'll probably be hearing more about this in the next few years, and for that reason it is good to know what his case is (and it is very weak). Collins suggests a literal interpretation of the Bible is bad, but then he continually leans on this method to build his cases for a variety of bad expositions including long ages (millions of years) having passed since the universe was created and support for macro-evolution. His book is written in a very friendly manner that kind of warms you up to him, but his shared opinions and interpretation of some Scripture is very, very bad. The sad thing is knowing that this stuff is actually being taught in a seminary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Las pacientes embarazadas que tengo","review":"en terapia, coinciden en que este libro las tranquila muchisimo...La verdad, yo no lo he leido"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOCA ME HUBIERA VUELTO EN MI","review":"PRIMER EMBARAZO SI NO HUBIERA SIDO POR ESTE LIBRO !Antes de leerlo ( en el tercer mes ) ten��a miedos, pesadillas y dudas al por mayor !Este libro fue como mi psiquiatra: Me dio paz, conocimientos y trabquilidad...?LO AMO !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This first edition of this book is a treasure.

You can get a magician of black chaos, BE ultimate, and gate guardian all in one pack. You can also use cheat codes to get the rare and powerful cards. The more duels u win the more duelists u can face. the promos are graceful dice, skull dice, and exchange. Pretty good promos. There is only one downside. (which is why I gave it 4 stars). After a while it will get boring. Sure its exciting to get new duelists and cards there arent codes for but even that will get boring.

There is an option at the bottom of the second screen called password where you put in a number thats printed on a physical card and it will give you the card in the game. I got a Blue-Eyes White Dragon from a friend of mine and entered it in, it's helped me win alot of duels so I suggest you go and get a Kaiba deck and get one of your own.As for the game itself, it can get tedious from time to time, expcally if you can't win alot. but you get at least five new cards each time you win and from time to time Joey will pop up and say that there are new duelests in the game for you to battle.

Personally, the new-agey spiritual narrative nauseated me. This lady whips out her personal altar at the drop of a hat; she is \\"stunned\\" by personal revelation to such an extent I wonder that emergency rooms around the lake weren't on high alert for her presence; she finds signs in things most normal people wouldn't even notice. While she writes about a spiritual journey,and personal transformation, ultimately, this is a story about a frustrated housewife who is figuring out how to get on with the rest of her life and needs a slew of new-age speak to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Struggling to understand herself","review":"I found Ann Linnea's adventure to be very real and remarkable. The memory of her experiences were likely written to the best of her abilities. Few of us can put into words, with utmost clarity and feeling, events and emotions that have moved us. To Linnea's credit she was brave enough to share a portion of her life with us knowing that what she has shared may be inadequate. She, like most of us, is not blessed with a life of tranquility or perfection. I for one am not going to guess what went on in her mind prior to setting out on her voyage. Obviously, her life was filled with stress. Suffice to say the voyage and incumbent experiences during the the 65 day journey affected her immensely. Having had some deep experiences myself I know how hard it is to adequately convey the emotions and feelings during those moments. I do think she had to distance herself from her normal life in order to prepare herself for the spiritual experiences.BATU: The Transformation"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best kind of adventure memoir","review":"A page turner and a universal story of a woman's courage.

This is the tale of a whining, self absorbed, grieving, gender confused woman, running away from the life she has. The only thing she seeks is someone to tell her its okay to dump her husband and come out of the closet. Yippie, good for you, but not an inspirational or interesting read!The book is as poorly planned out as her trip was. Improper clothing and gear, poor planning of landing/camp sites, gross misjudgments of distances, weather conditions, and abilities. The only thing amazing about her journey is that she didn't die from her own stupidity.I've kayaked on Lake Superior....

The ad for the product said it's a disk, and the picture of it looked just like a CD package. So I thought I was ordering a CD --WRONG!! It is actually a square diskette that goes into Yamaha player pianos, although there was no mention of this in the ad. I thought that perhaps it could be transferred to a CD, so I called the Hal Leonard Corporation which is the contact listed on the pamphlet that came with the disk. The customer service person could not tell me whether it is merely instrumental or whether Big Tiny Little is singing on it and said that he didn't know anything about it. At my request, he gave me a phone number for Yamaha, but when I dialed I discovered that it was a discontinued number.

He doesn't spend all of his time trying to inflate the importance of the subjects of his essays to make himself seem more important. Instead, he just goes about selecting familiar yet unexamined niches of popular culture and reveals the ironies that turn up with wit and enthusiasm. These 10 essays on the aesthetics of consumerism may embarrass some readers when they show how we've been manipulated by corporate marketing, but, ultimately, one can't help but feel enlightened and thoroughly entertained by Harris' writing. As essays as good as these rarely appear in mainstream publications, I would recommend buying this book without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I'm a bit of a shopaholic and I like to read so I buy books often...maybe by the bus load.

This book however cute, funny and interesting, seems to be much more focused on seeing how many great scrabble words Harris can shove into one run on sentence after another.

But why would you bother paying for the frankly dreary \\"actual book\\" when the title; cover art; and sample pages available on the internet deliver considerably more bang for your bambi? Daniel Harris's tragedy is that he has outdone the more obscure theoreticians he so delights in superficially deriding.

The sound recording quality is fine and it is an unabridged version of the text. The reader achieves the sort of chilly undertone that I associate with the work; the detachment of the really rich from humanity.The film soundtrack is an amazing landmark effort and we can only hope that it will soon be released on cd. Nelson Riddle's adaptions are sumptuously beautiful and very well chosen for the film. The opening, a bewitchingly orchestrated version of Irving Berlin's \\"What'll I do\\", is worth the price of the album alone and it moves from there through a treasure trove of great songs from the twenties.

If you wind up renting this cowpie, look for the best editorial mistake ever. It's toward the middle of the movie, where the black drug dealer (stereotypes anyone?) says something like, \\"With all due respect, if you can point that gun somewhere else\\" then... watch for it, he actually mouths the other actor's line.

The jet responds agonizingly slow to command inputs which complicates air-air combat with targets that fly much slower than you can.Overall its 3 stars on a good day.

Remember how much you hated those missions? Well EVERY mission in this game involves you protecting something! IT [stinks]!The narration is SOOO FAKE and annoying. You'd think they could have spent the extra dollar on some realistic narration. I would have expected gaming companies to have learned their lessons from their past mistakes on the fake acting and fake sense of urgency in the voices. They RUIN the game.The graphics are great but barely par for the XBox.

The format leaves something to be desired as at times you're not sure whether you're in the present or back in the past, but perhaps that's what the author intended.

Beyond that, the save game feature is [weak] as you can't save except at the end of a tournament. Since it takes about an hour or more to finish a tournament, this imposes sever restrictions on playing. Also, the user interface doesn't allow you to look in detail at two or more choice for a \\"dimensioning\\" in order to decide which is the best one to choose.I had high hopes for this game, but am sad to say the lousy AI and poor game save feature has ruined it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dungeon Dice Monsters is great","review":"This game is very fun.

True to everyone's reviews these balls hold up very nicely! Both me and my husband jump into the ball pit with my 1 1/2 yr old all the time (have had it for about 3 weeks now) and so far none of them have popped or have made any dents in them.

There was nothing wrong with the product itself. It was just way to small than what I expected. I would have needed 4-5 more bags of this product to fill up my son's pit. I called around some local stores where I live to get more balls right away to fill the pit up and found a store that sold them. I went in and saw they were bigger - more of what I expected. I bought 4 bags of those balls. Before emtying the new balls in the pit, I took these balls out. Turns out I only needed 2 bags of the bigger balls (my son's pit is the size of a toddler pool). So, I get to return these balls and the 2 extra bags of the new balls I bought.

Since ball pits are no longer available to children of this generation (for reasons of cleanliness), I decided to create my own for Lily and her friends. I bought an inexpensive plastic wading pool at Toys R Us and, after reading several reviews, chose these balls to fill it. They're great! They are bright, colorful, and quite durable. The plastic is thinner on some than others, but it hasn't affected their quality. I even climbed in the pool to play, and none of the balls have sustained any permanent dents. Lily is thrilled! I only ordered 100, and they don't quite cover the bottom of the pool, so I intend to order another set to make it a bit fuller.Good quality and great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"100 DENTED balls","review":"How cheap! I guess you really do get what you pay for! Every single ball was dented upon opening them out of the bag. They are also made of very thin flimsy plastic so that even if you barely press against the ball it's dented even more so. Unless you plan on giving these to a newborn baby who won't move around them, then save your money. My kids don't want to play with balls that are smoooshed. How sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described!","review":"I hardly ever write reviews for products, but I had to this time. I was quite disappointed when these balls arrived. I ordered 6 packages (600 balls total) and planned to fill a pool with them. More than 90% of the balls that arrived were deflated. They were flat and dented. I am sending them all back! I think I'll be spending a little more money somewhere else to replace them. And...I should add, these 600 balls were ordered in 2 separate shipments and arrived on different days in different UPS trucks, so I think it's unlikely that they were BOTH damaged in shipping. I think they're just cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap excuse for Ball Pit balls","review":"My 2 yr. old doesn't too much notice the quality of the balls, because I already filled her pit with quality balls. I only purchased these balls to give her ball pit extra \\"fluff\\". These balls crush very easily, and my kid isn't over 30 lbs. The plastic is so thin, that the balls are translucent. Ball pit balls are usually solid colored and opaque. Not nearly the same quality as the more expensive balls. I would never put these in the dishwasher, like I would the other balls, they would probably melt. I am so glad that I only purchased one bag. Don't fill an entire pit with these balls, you will be disappointed. They would be useful, perhaps, as extra balls, balls for small babies ( as they are VERY soft), or balls for very limited useage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...... Not as described.... Poor product","review":"Ok...so I bought these balls for my son's ball pit....that's after reading the \\"positive reviews\\"..... Right out the box, there were balls with dents in them..... Opened the bag and as soon as I touched them dents appeared..... I wonder if the people who gave this product 5 stars and great reviews got paid by the company to do so.....

Its a good game with good graphics and varying degrees of difficulty. The best part ofcourse it the wide selection of mobile suits. My only complaint if there is one is the missions with the Characters Amuro, Char etc, they can't be destroyed but they sure as hell can destroy you. I am not sure though maybe it is possible to kill them, but I haven't been able to. But all in all this is a winner for those who like the Gundam series. It definately made me want to go back and watch the old movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY CHALLENGING!","review":"this game is your basic arcade type space shoot-em up game.it starts off with a familiar premise for whichever side you choose(fed or zeon). it starts off that your side is losing the war and its up to you to turn the tide. most of the battles are pretty easy early on, but after a while it becomes pretty evident why your side is losing.enemy AI is very clever and you will often be attacked from all sides.there is about 100 different missions for each side so that adds some replay value,but most are just your basic search and destroy mission. there are also between 25 and 40 different mobile suits and mobile armors that you can play with. overall if your a gundam fan you will love this game because it follows the plotline of the one year war perfectly, and if your not a gundam fan you will like it if your really into shooter/simulation games. that is why I gave this such a high rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian's Review","review":"this is one of the best gundam games i have ever played who ever plays this and is a gundam fan will no doubt love this game.

It looks great, same as the day it was new and it must be at least a year old so I know glued wood can hold together. And my old cutting board gave me several years of use before it started to split.

Over the holidays, my in-laws were staying with us and did most of the cooking. I was worried that my brand new board would not survive the abuse because of the way they cleaned and used it. Normally, I would clean the board with a wet soapy towel and immediately rinse and dry. My in-laws on-the-other-hand would wash it in the sink with copious amounts of running hot water and lots of soap and let it air on the dish rack.

I finished the book with less enthusiasm about learning it then when I had started and I am now unsure whether I would even want my child to be involved in the deaf culture and community since the main feeling I got was that deaf people are unaccepting to anyone who is not deaf.

And one hand-shape, looking like no letter in particular, drawn without a thumb, was included in the mix. Looking further through the book, drawings were expressionless.

Also, when the Bears play on the road, they wear their white on white uniforms. The players on the sideline wear the white on dark blue pants. Just a little flaw that perhaps was overlooked. Overall, playing the game feels like you are watching Sunday Night Football. The player on screen stats and replays are superb. Tackles are awesome and realistic.

Ironically rather inspiring the reader to believe in the concept of \\"true love\\" this book redefines true love to be a desperate fight against loneliness with only one possible winner. Needless to say the winner is not the gullible male lead. If you feel compelled to read this book, I recommend breezing through the first 350 pages.

I'd like to know where Nicholas Sparks' editor was when he/she read the following passage (page 170 of the copy I borrowed from my library): \\"She was short of breath as she reached for the snap on his jeans. Meeting his eyes again, she unsnapped them, then slowly slid the zipper down.\\" This image of eyeballs with snaps and zippers is horrifying, to say nothing of painful, and it's only one of a thousand glaring stupidities in a banal and trite little book.

It fulfilled all of my lowly expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"Message In a Bottle by Nicholas Sparks moved me to tears. Excellent story telling, as with all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable with soap opera dialogue","review":"I was deeply moved by this book, not to tears, but to yawns. I would give it no stars at all. The characters did not come alive. It might have made a short story for a woman's magazine, but a novel? The plot was predictable from the first page, the pedestrian writing was soporific, and umgrammatical in places. I'm glad I waited for the paperback and didn't waste the money on a hard-cover copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and diasppointing.","review":"I was very dissappointed in this book. I thought the characters could have been developed more and even better. I really felt manipulated into crying at the end. The whole thing just wasn't natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple yet sophisticated stop-over!","review":"This book truly engages you in a sweet, romantic tale not too far from a possibility for some of us. Sparks has a way of keeping you turning the pages until the very last one! This book put me in mind of The Bridges of Madisson County which, I might add, was also an excellent read. I look forward to reading The Notebook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After having read \\"The Notebook\\" I couldn't wait to get my hands on \\"Message in a bottle\\". To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The characters didn't ring true and the story starts to lose its thread toward the middle. I will have to re-read \\"The Notebook\\" to get the bad taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Awful. Insulting.","review":"A terrible book, poorly written with incredibly unlikeable characters. I hear the movie is better, but will not dedicate another $ to Mr. Sparks' cause. The Notebook was enjoyable, but Mr. Sparks must have had only one book in him. 1 star is too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most wonderful story I have ever ever read!!!","review":"This story was sooo touching. I am begging Mr. Sparks to please, please, write a sequel where the main character is still alive...perhaps he was unconscious and drifted to a nearby island. I want a part two movie to be made....please!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"Great service! The product wasn't perfect, and when I let the seller know, I received a full refund, no questions asked! I would definitely recommend this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding!","review":"Being from the same hometown as Sparks, I REALLY wanted to like this book. But, after reading it, I have to say that I cannot believe how many good reviews this book has gotten. Actually, I can't believe that this book got published. It is that bad. The only good thing that I can say about this book is that the concept was good. But, the writing was absolutely horrible. It was very dumbed down, trite and any other adjective you want to use to emphasize how bad the writing is. As a previous reviewer said, \\"The book is usually better than the movie, but in this case, the opposite is true.\\" My advice -- watch the movie, don't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the movie and sort of liked the book","review":"It's probably safe to say that the book is usually better than the movie, but in the case of Message in a Bottle, it is the reverse. The story, itself, is a nice idea. Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find \\"man with love expressive language.\\" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement. For the most part, the book read like it was done by a first-time, romance novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Trite, cliched, a glorified harliquin romance. Nice if you're looking for something to pass the time or enjoy having your emotions easily manipulated by dripping sentimentality, but if you actually want to read something other then the standard soap opera fare then don't waste your time. I tried really hard to like this book, but it's predictablity and lack of depth (yes, it dealt with \\"deep\\" subjects but in the shallowist way possible) left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only \\"zero stars\\" existed as a rating","review":"This book was extremely painful to read to the point that I could not even finish the novel. The plot is ridiculous and the writing cliched. The whole idea that a woman would chase after some guy because she finds his love letter at the beach is one of the most pathetic plots I have ever heard of and is insulting to women. The dialogue between the two characters stimulates as much excitement as trip to the dentist. Even idle curiosity about how the book would end could not sustain me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has touched not only my heart but my soul.","review":"I have read a lot of romance novels and I have thought that the love written in those books seemed so eternal until I read Message in a Bottle by Nicholas Sparks. The love between Garret and catherine overwelmed me and when I started to notice the new love forming between Garret and Theresa I knew that this love was different in so many ways. This book has touched not only my heart but my soul. It made me cry, laugh, and giggle. I think Sparks is brilliant in this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved Bridges of Madison County, this book is for you","review":"otherwise, don't waste your money or precious time wading through this screenplay. Mr. Sparks is indeed fortunate that so many people fly these days and get stuck with novels such as his to while the time away. I am relieved that no one I know saw me reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough to make anyone seasick! Not one but ZERO stars!","review":"The fact that this literary tripe has spent so many days on the bestseller lists convinces me that American taste has truly sunk to the lowest common denominator. I couldn't believe that a book so poorly written could be accepted by a publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book to read!","review":"I have skimmed through most of the comments on this novel and I was dissipointed at the amount of people who complained that the novel was \\"too easy\\" The beauty of this book was it's simplcity. I don't count this as the best book I have ever read, I don't count any book as the best, but it was a great book which captured a surprising amount of emotion and, I'm not ashamed to say, made me cry.I think that all of the people out there complaining about the plot and the characters need to stop for a second and realize that, to be good, a book need not be Jane Eyere. The fact that it was not a very deep thought provoking novel subtracted absolutely nothing from the enjoyment I got out of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very romance story","review":"the book is written in simple english, that is easy to know and the story is very romantic. the love between threase and garrette is pure, they love each other from their heart and they care for the other. to love somebody is not difficult, but nowadays many people are very self center and will not give up their own business or living habit just because of love. garrette willing to give up his memories as well as his shop. he want to be with theresa, itlikes a fairy tales. most women want to have a husband like garrette and this is the success of the writer. but the ending is sorrow and it makes me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling!","review":"Message in a Bottle completely touched my heart. This story made me laugh, cry, and think. Like Sparks' other novels, this is about love. Love so strong that it changed the lives of two very differnt people. Message in a Bottle made me appreciate what I have and not take it for granted. It showed me how hard it is to lose someone you love more than life itself, someone you would do anything for. Sparks described this feeling so thoroughly and so perfectly it seems as though he has experienced this himself. I have read all three of Sparks' novels and I found this to be the best. All of Nicholas Sparks' books are heart-drenching and fast reading. I have never enjoyed another author's writing as much as I enjoy his. I rarely read a book that I find interesting, but his novels are so much more than that. I can't wait until his next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best book I ever read.","review":"Nicholas Sparks was great.. He really know how a woman feels about love and being loved! Message in a Bottle was the book for those who want to find a real love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, shallow, disappointing","review":"Message in a Bottle is mainly exposition-- long on melodrama and short on character development and genuine depth. The messages in the bottle that Teresa finds are supposed to provide the flesh and blood of their writer, Garret Blake. Instead, they are merely corny and cliched weepings of a shallow and maladjusted man. Teresa is no deeper. The love affair between Garret and Teresa is merely the set-up, by Sparks, for the tragedy. Garret never gets over the death of his wife, so of course he will have to die at sea--- his messages in bottles live on, of course. And then so does Teresa's message to the now-dead Garret. It's a novel full of glass bottles full of messages to dead people. Maudlin, sentimental, and predictable. In fact, the story is so shallow, no wonder Kevin Costner was picked to play the lead in the movie version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 90 minutes of your life!","review":"This might have made a fine short story. All of the filler was sooo boooring! Stupid woman, stupid man. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A woman finds a message which leads her to love","review":"The message in a bottle is well written but it fails to grasp the true meaning of love and romance. Obviously written by a man, it lacks the depth of love which overcomes all obstacles. It chooses instead to have a bittersweet romance with a tragic ending. Yes, the book touches the reader emotionally but then leaves the reader flat with the ending. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please","review":"A recently divorced mom, Theresa Osborne, discovers a message, in a bottle no less, that sends her on a whirlwind of adventure and emotion. Well, there's not much adventure, but the treacle more than compensates. Be prepared to have your emotions mercilessly manipulated. Or if, like me, you find the characters and plot of this novel entirely unconvincing and unmoving, prepare to give your eye-rolling muscles a good workout. You'll see the shocking turns-of-events coming a mile away and will actually, witness the shocking turns-of-events if you can burrow your way through Sparks' trite, breathless, compendious prose. Readers with weak stomachs may wish to look away during Garret's letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because there was no \\"0\\" star rating","review":"Horrid. Insipid. Drivel. The characters are unbelievable and one-sided. The male \\"love interest\\" needs serious therapy, not a relationship. For that matter, the woman who would entertain a relationship with a man so obviously fixated on his dead wife could use some head-shrinkage. I found myself impatient with the plot, and with the writing. The characters are repeatedly described as \\"just knowing\\" how the other one feels, or magically intuiting the right thing to do. Only 12 year-olds, or the severely emotionally immature could possibly think this is the way a relationship works. By the end of this stinker, I was rooting for the storm. If this guy is your ideal; if he makes your heart flutter; be prepared for a painful and unsatisfying love life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Well writen and great story.

I found the book to be very enjoyable. It reminded me of adventures in my life and brought back fond memories I'd almost forgotten.

Keep up the good work! lmilberg@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, trite dialogue, no bang for the buck!","review":"I have never been more dissapointed with a second attempt. After indulging myself and emotions so thoroughly in The Notebook, I found this book as predictable as the fact that tomorrow will come after today. I could not put it down, however painful it was to see it to the end, always hoping that something of substance would happen. Nothing of any realistic substance ever did. After sending The Notebook to several of my friends, I will happily use this one for kindling."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was like eating cotton-candy for breakfast.","review":"This book was such a disappointment. I was hoping that it was something that I could really sink my teeth into. But when I took a bite, it dissolved into nothing but a sicky-sweet taste in my mouth! The plot was cliche-ridden and predictable. Theresa and Garrett didn't even seem like real people! I kept hoping Jeb would meet someone like him (meaning a real person) and we could forget about these two cardboard cutouts. For someone who values honesty in relationships, I was appalled that the author based this book on deceitfulness and shared victim-hood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total & Absolute Disappointment!","review":"Loved The Notebook, and HATED this one.

I wish I have done that before suffering the irreparable damage of reading those dreadful first pages. The narration is boring, concentrating only on the sorrow in the eyes of the protagonist and the hotness of the female protagonist. Hate it! If you are looking for a good romantic reading, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but stereotypical","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks and all of his work, but this book was a little stale.

I will definately be re-reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"This book was amazing. It was everything you want it to be and so much more. There is insight into both characters, avoiding a one sided perspective that only leads to too many question marks and doubt. The story is complete and leaves no cliff hangers behind. Nicholas Sparks is amazing and I look forward to reading the rest of his works. I recommend this book to everyone, it is one in a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was absolutely uninspiring!","review":"Sparks missed the boat on this one. It was an example of poor writing. He chose to treat readers as simple minded saps. He paid no attention to literary techniqes that may have made this a better story. The language was bland, dull; no color. It lacked descriptive details and the characters were static and undeveloped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Bad.

It was romantic and provacative at the same time. To think of a man so tototally in love and devoted to his wife is to think of fantasy and love at the beginning of a true love relationship.

My first Nicholas Sparks - this is my punishment for buying a book at the airport. Garret was so sappy - completely unrealistic and wholly unappealing. Theresa's character made no sense - she never thought he'd find out she wrote a column about him? DUH! The whole plot was just not well thought out. And the big surpise \\"twist\\"? Come on, it was so obvious. I know there is a wide audience for silly romance novels, I just wished this book had been marked as such so I could have stayed away from it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story of the hopeful romantic","review":"This story, Message In A Bottle, is an excellent story for the hopeful romantic. Nicholas Spark's art of createing such real characters, people you want to know and care about. I would highly recommend this emotional story about two unexpected people falling in love. Theresa Osborne has lost faith in the dream of everlasting love and Garrett, who is still passionately in love with his deceased wife, battles his inner demons. A must read. My Story, When It Rains, is similar in the sense that you can't fight who you fall in love with. Marjorie Spoto, Author - When It Rains."},{"rating":"2","title":"This lonely love story keeps you hoping for a miracle.","review":"This is a great story to take to the beach where you can stop and look out to sea and think about all the messages waiting for other lovers to discover. As in his first novel, Sparks can tell a love story that will leave you thinking about it far longer than it will take you to finish the book. Loved it! Would recommend to anyone who likes to read a book in a day or two--won't take much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Sparks? or Barbara Cartland?","review":"Maybe I'm just jaded and bitter. Or maybe I read The Notebook when I was happy and in love. Either way, I was completely disappointed with Message in a Bottle. Too much boring detail (who cares what they were wearing, for God's sake) and too much sappy dialog. Is it impossible for two people to be in love in a normal way? Yes, people can learn to love again after losing the \\"love of their life\\" but usually it's a realistic relationship, not this storybook hoohah. I was ready for a relationship story, not an obvious attempt to jerk my heartstrings with a \\"two-hanky\\" romance. Mr. Sparks, write like you mean it, like you can. Don't pander to the folks who want goosh."},{"rating":"1","title":"The neediest man I ever read about!","review":"Nicholas Sparks only succeeded in disappointing me with \\"Message in a Bottle.\\" The plot was contrived and the characters were repulsive! If Sparks was attempting to create romantic and sensitive characters, he failed miserably with Garrett Blake. This sorrowful, broken-hearted character is supposed to be sensitive, but ends up as a seriously needy lump of a man who can't mend his shredded heart. Theresa Osborne on the other hand, his second true love, is overconfident to the point of being cocky and downright rude. For lovers of Sparks' \\"The Notebook\\" his latest work will leave you feeling empty and cheated. It's neither romantic nor touching, it's simply a 300 page treatise on the pitfalls of codependency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a box of kleenex handy!","review":"I have never been so moved by a book. I could not put the book down. Theresa and Garrett's long-distance, bittersweet romance was so emotinally draining. I could hardly see the words through all my tears.

Bad decision! Poorly written (yesterday night?!), banal characterization and tear-jerking emotional manipulation are the features of this slight effort.

I won't even tell her I read it because I'd be embarassed to tell her what I thought of it.I am a 35 year old woman who thought that the dialogue was ridiculous, the characters childish and immature, and the plot totally unbelievable. I didn't even cry at the end; it was so predictable (and overdone)! I bought this book in hardback and now wish I'd have saved the money to go see the movie, which, for once, looks more promising than the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it is the same author as The Notebook","review":"After reading The Notebook, I was excited to pick up another hyped Nicolas Sparks book. But boy oh boy was it such a let-down. A third of the way through I started rolling my eyes. When I was half way though, I found that I didn't really care about the two characters and how their \\"relationship\\" would become. Three quarter through, I was hoping for one of them to die (how horrible was that!?). I just wish it was Theresa who died. She was a creepy stalker who jumped into bed with a practical stranger. And she \\"forgave\\" him for what he had done!? She was the one who needed to ask for forgiveness for publishing other people's private thoughts and looking him up and stalking him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin Presents...Nicholas Sparks","review":"While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.I'm extremely surprised this is a \\"best seller\\". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring and very predictable book","review":"Yawn! After reading this book my main thought was that I could write as well. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"This was my introduction to Nicholas Sparks as a writer, and a sorry introduction it was. (I haven't purchased another of his books, though I did see the movie of The Notebook, which I thought was a wonderful story and and film.) But it's hard to believe a writer who could produce something as awful as Message in a Bottle, could write beautiful books too.Message in A Bottle was everything bad -- a stupid, maudlin soap opera with a dumb ending. The characters were cardboard, the drama never got off the ground. The writing was as amateurish as it gets. The dialogue was inane. I thought I was reading the exercise of a first-time writer in junior high school. The only reason this book made it was that the author was already a \\"New York Times Bestselling Author\\". Just proves that the world of publishing is completely irrational and unfair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those who want to be manipulated...","review":"This was so dreary and pointless. There is very little originality here; I kept thinking that Mr. Sparks \\"borrowed\\" from countless other stories. The part where she is looking for background on the \\"mysterious\\" author of these letters is right out of Sleepless in SeattleThe suspense is non-existent. One reason I kept reading was to see if i had accurately read the heavy foreshadowing.A trademark of Sparks seems to be that he manipulates his readers (ala Tuesdays w/ Morrie\\"). I just didn't care about this soogy love story.Save your money and purchase a book with substance. I recommend Coming Home by R. Pilcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real tear jerker...","review":"When I picked up this book I didn't know what to expect. Nicholas Sparks has a way of bringing the emotions of his characters to the surface. You feel as if the events are happening to you. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys feeling, but be sure to have some tissue handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a story of true love - its confusion, tragedy and happiness","review":"A must read for the true romantic. You get caught up in the emotions of the characters and can feel your self in their place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and predictable","review":"The writing is wooden and cliche-ridden and the story is so predictable that a 10 year old could guess what will happen next.

The movie HAS to be better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring and sappy bunch of drivel that I have ever","review":"read. Oh boy.

I do like a good love story once in a while and hadn't read a good one since Bridges of Madison County.This story started out well and captured my attention, and then took a turn near its end. I couldn't stand listening to the internal whining of our main character Garret any longer. Was this truly a man in love with his dead wife? His see saw of emotions was getting irritating. No women I know would have put up with it as long as our heroine did. My God, Get on with your life already!Needless to say, I was pleased with the books ending. What did I take away from this book. I wasted too much time reading when I wish I had chosen something different"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manuscript should have been tossed overboard","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Notebook\\" and was bitterly disappointed with \\"Message\\".

However, I liked it because it was a touching and heartfelt novel. \\"Message In a Bottle\\" is a different story altogether. I'm almost finished with it, and I have to say that this book is a total dissapointment. The plot is too long, too farfetched, and totaly boring. Don't waste your money or time on this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEPSI-LIGHT WITH A MANIPULATIVE AFTER-TASTE","review":"Premise predictable with characters of little depth. Would not have finished if movie was not coming out, and believed there must be more to the book to even warrant a movie. Still worth seeing Costner...Paul Newman is perfectly cast as the father role"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"Read this with an open mind. So the story line may not have been 100% believable, but it is a story...a book for entertainment. Sparks beautifully chronicles the beginning of a romance and the course of emotions that anyone who has experienced a relationship challenged by circumstances will understand. Sparks knows people, emotions, and how to express them. The ending may be predictable, but the way it is presented is heartwrenching to anyone with a soul. I couldn't put it down. Bravo, Mr. Sparks. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent the movie, it's better","review":"If you like simple, simpering love stories of the type that are always on the best-seller list, then you'll like this insipid, slow, unexciting book. When I was done reading this book, I felt cheated. My suggestion: Rent the movie. At least the boat-wreck scene is exciting, and you get to see a little Paul Newman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This book would have been very good, had it not been for the Garret character. He was so selfish and so un relatable I just could not stand it! All he thought about was himself, wanting her to move were he lived, HELLO? Do you have any feelings at all! I really loved the ending though it was the only good part. I'm not talking about him missing his wife whom died and that being the reason he was distant (that wasn't a give away) He was just a horrible person, who did not deserve to have theresa."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Love Story","review":"When I first read the back of the book i underestimated it. At this time I was looking for a good love story book to read after reading The Notebook, and I had thought it was going to be a boring read and not a great love story. I thought how can Theresea be suddenly interested in a man who wrote letters to his wife in bottles. But then when i was reading the book i kept wondering how could nobody want to meet Garrett. This book most definately suprised me because it is a great love story. It's mainly about dealing with past relationships and moving forward.I really enjoyed this book, and cried really hard at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"This story could have been a short story in a magazine and it might have been worth spending a half hour or so reading. Thank goodness I didn't spend any of my money on it! I thought the same thing about Bridges of Madison County. I can't believe so many people think this stuff is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"More painful than the Marx-Engel Reader","review":"I'm only through the first part of this book and I hate it. It should have gone through at least two re-writes before it was published. The prose is hackneyed, and lacks any lyrical quality whatsoever. Why is Sparks so intent upon explaining useless details, i.e. what Theresa wore to go shopping, or the size of her breasts??!! Obviously the author meant this book to be a screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story has no plot...","review":"I have been reading over 200 pages - still looking for the plot, or the meaning to this book. So far it is just boring dialog, romance, and --- whatever. I read some of the reviews and I suppose Garrett gets killed later on. Wish they had bumped him off earlier - maybe the book would have been shorter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I loved this book at the begining because there was a semi-normal realationship going on, but then, as time went on I developed a real dislike to Garret, the fact that he couldn't get over his wife was sweet at the begining, but then after a while it just got annoying, like he couldn't decide between an alive woman that he loved and his dead wife that he also loved. It really isn't that hard of a decision, it's not like he would have a great realationship with his wife- she's dead. And then towards the end of the gook I got the feeling that he was selfish, I won't say why because it may ruin the ending for some people. If you've been told this was a great book and to read it, I suggest that you rent it from the library, because, like many other people, I went in with Great Expectatins and came out with Great Disappointments."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good read...highly recommend it!","review":"\\"Message in a Bottle\\" is not the usual type of book I read; however, I picked it up because the title caught my attention and the idea that it was a \\"soon-to-be-released\\" movie appealed to me, also. I enjoyed the book very much and wanted to buy copies for all my friends to read! It surely is a tear-jerker. I found myself sobbing,locked in the bathroom so nobody could find me until I was presentable again! I'm looking forward to Mr. Sparks' next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too generous!","review":"I'm glad I read many of the customer reviews before penning my own. I was afraid I'd be the only person on the planet who thought this was the most trite, banal, boring, insipid pieces of writing I'd come across in years. Just confirms what I've believed for a long time - we've sunk to the LOWEST common denominator in taste. I would have put Teresa out of her misery by page 10! Aye, the dialogue! Only positive thing to come out of my reading this empty shell of a book was that I got to revive and polish my Evelyn Wood speedreading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"This was obviously written as a screen play first and then Sparks tried to make it into a novel. He failed. He cannot write dialogue to save his soul and the whole story line is such a cliche! I think this is one case where I may actually like the movie better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very romantic","review":"I couldn't put the book down. It was very romantic. In fact it was so much so, that the ending was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book made it to print","review":"I don't know how anyone can put this book and the \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" in the same class. Gag me.Once again, we have to suffer with a heroine who is too gorgeous to be real (don't forget the great hair and flat stomach), who is romantically mentored by an older woman (always overweight and asexual). In comes the mystery man (who is also drop-dead gorgeous), who is haunted by his last love. Haven't we read a book like this before? Fortunately, Mr Sparks writes enough about the beautiful NC coastline to spark any interest in this syrup-laden, predictable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and predictable.","review":"I love a good romance if it is well written and has an intriguing plot and fine character development. No, no, no. I was trapped on a long flight with nothing but this book. Nevertheless, I finished the book once home so it earned one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. I confess, I didn't even read the whole thing. About halfway through I got tired of wincing and just scan/read to see how it ended. Poorly. How could this guy be a best selling author?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrible - no other way to describe it.","review":"This book was horrible - no other way to describe it. Theresa is a self-righteous character out of a dime store romance novel and I was not surprised that her husband cheated on her. Garrett would have cheated too had he lived to marry her.The Notebook was excellent. What happened? I think Sparks should stick to the male viewpoint or stop thinking of women in Victorian terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Depressing!!! Don't waste your time!","review":"I found this book to be a quick read and kept me up late reading. I was very disappointed in this book especially after reading The Notebook (more realistic, maybe because it was told from the male point of view). You can tell a man wrote this book!! Nicholas should not tell stories from a female point of view. For someone like Theresa who couldn't get enough time off of work in the beginning of the book she ends up with a very flexible schedule and very LARGE pocketbook. Good career or not, I don't know any single mothers that can afford that much air travel and time off from work. The ending would never happen with an experienced seaman as Garrett was, hell I wouldn't do that!! This book insults our intelligence with the unrealistic chain of events. A love story isn't suppose to make you cry with saddness but cry with happiness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Message sunk in a bottle","review":"Trite!!! Boring!!! Lacks ANY emotional depth, meaningful characterization or significant plot line. Obvious from the first page. Juvenile. Silly!!! Wish I had gotten anything else but my book club made me read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money on the book or the movie","review":"This book should have been a step up from Sparks' first novel, The Notebook, where he combined amateur prose with a simplistically beautiful love story. However, Message in a Bottle lacked The Notebook's ring of truth and the writing was more uneven. It seemed as if Sparks couldn't quite convince himself that the hero could have a true love other than his \\"Catherine\\" (also the name of Sparks' wife). The book should have been character-centered, but instead Sparks forced his characters into unbelievable situations. As for the movie, a dead fish could have brought more life to the role than Kevin Costner."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was incredible!!","review":"Sparks has a gift for bringing every emotion to the surface and allowing you to explore the depth of each one. Happiness, sadness, frustration, romance... it was a wonderful book and very thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"reading this book is a monumental waste of time","review":"I've read love stories before that were sad, interesting and believable. This love story is not one of them. It is basically a cliche-ridden excuse of a book, full of predictable sappy moments and conversations. Most of the \\"circumstances\\" leading up to when the lovers meet are improbable and trite. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I couldn't even finish it!","review":"I tried, I really did! For the masses who thought that \\"Love Story\\" was great writing. At least I won't waste any money seeing the movie.There are so many wonderful books out there that it astounds me that a book like \\"Message\\" is considered \\"great.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the ending!","review":"I did not enjoy the book. You anticipate the ending of the book, and the end of this one was not worth the anticipation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not \\"The Notebook\\"","review":"As someone who loved Spark's novel \\"The Notebook\\", I was extremely disappointed with this effort. I've seen better character development in high school English papers. Makes me think his previous novel was a fluke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon purchase","review":"I was very pleased with my order. Condition of book was as described, and arrived ahead of schedule. I would definitely order from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas can't go wrong","review":"Message In a Bottle is a fabulous novel by most writers' standards, but I didn't enjoy it as much as some of Sparks' other works (A Walk To Remember, The Notebook, Dear John). Perhaps part of my problem was my lack of enthusiasm for seafaring. Boats are discussed quite often in this book, so I hope you like them! In the end though, I can never dislike anything by Nicholas Sparks, so this is worth reading....after you've soaked up his better books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent romantic presentation","review":"This is one Sparks book that made the grade and succeeded from book to movie in grand style. What else can I say? I love Nicholas Sparks works and I truly enjoy reading any and all of his novels.Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Get Through....","review":"I loved Spark's first book and when I read the cover of Message I felt that this would easily live up. The plot was laid out well - but early on I got concerned when a dialog between Theresa and Deanna was over cards and every card move was brought into their conversation - like the book itself too much unnecessary information was brought into the plot and it was distracting to read. I think it is fair to say that the concept was okay, but the plot really wandered too far off track to the point where I eventually couldn't even finish the book. Good idea but not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Sappy Romance Lovers.","review":"This is the kind of book that you will read to the end if you are truly dedicated, or you could do what I did, skim over paragraphs at a time, just to see how this dreadful novel ends. The plot itself was quite interesting and should be attributed to the novel's success. In the hands of another writer I imagine that this could have been quite good, however under Nicholas Sparks pen, it comes out as ***** pulp fiction. The tedious, mundane dialogue and uninteresting descriptions are part of the problem, coupled with sheer sappiness.I would recommend this book only to Harlequin Romance lovers and to someone who is recovering from surgery and is taking pain killers, to them the novel could prove to be readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to write a bestseller","review":"If I was not so sentimental, I would have given this one star, but it did raise a tear to my eye in spite of myself.All the traditional elements of a weepy bestseller, clich��ed characters, predictable story, absolutely programmed to appeal to a certain type of reader who does not want to be challenged with anything new, but hopes to find in a book a permutation of familiar themes, culminating in a watery message about the meaning of life. I felt faintly queasy after reading it, as though I had eaten too much candy floss.Disappointing, but I had not read his first book. Come to think of ot, I don't think I will either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks is Brilliant...","review":"although i was torn up by the ending, i fell in love with garrett... oh my god! anyone who hasn't read this book, even if you've seen the horrible movie version, MUST MUST MUST read this book!and on a side note, i've read all three of sparks books (and am eagerly anticipating his new novel which i have yet to purchase!!!) and you will NOT be disappointed by him AT ALL!!! so be sure you read message in a bottle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for literary enthusiasts","review":"Although this book may be satisfying to romance genre readers, for those of us with any literary inclination this book is a horror. The third person narrative is too cliche and annoying. There are over a dozen instances of \\"she\\" and \\"she'd\\" in a paragraph on page 2. The story line is nice and if you can get past the style and like the premise, it's worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and insulting to the reader.","review":"Nicolas Sparks has made an assumption about his readers: They're starved for romance. Their lives are empty. They don't know good prose when they see it. Three good ingredients to money-making formulaic writing.How insulting. Here's an example: Sparks writes about our lonely heroin's search for the messages' author. He goes into great lengths about how she logs in, keys in the right command to bring up a search engine, types in the place where her man might be, and, here's the best, we get to see an illustration of what comes on screen! All available choices. Don't it make you want to log in and see what that internet is all about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"NIcholas Sparks.....Wonderful Writer!","review":"This book was in good shape and arrived in exact timing of what was told me. I set downwith this book and only put it down twice. It is a book that keeps you reading, it keeps youwondering what will happen. It is a #1 written book in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing. Poor character development, a laughable plot, hackneyed writing. The male lead falls in love with women who are pretty, which the female is, and the female prefers a handsome man, which he is. We don't really learn much else about their characters. The author has set out to create a \\"beautiful story,\\" and the characters frequently remind us of this goal. Not wanting to plow through the whole work, I soon skipped to the ending, which was as muddled and incomprehensible as the rest of the book. Unfortunately, this sort of story, with its cheap tears, tends to make the best seller list, especially among women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately entertaining- but barely worth your time","review":"Perhaps I was so disappointed with \\"Message in a Bottle\\" because I had just read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" - a truly heart-wrenching story. I found Nicholas Sparks' writing poor and the story line trite - lonely divorcee finds a message in a bottle from a lonely widower, who she then hunts down? Okay, maybe, but the plot goes WAY downhill from there. As for the ending, anyone who didn't see it coming obviously was too caught up in the romance to see this book for what it truly is - a daytime soap opera during sweeps week. That may be fine for someone looking to kill a few hours, but if you're interested in literature, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very courageous plot.","review":"The book had a courageous plot because of all the emotions that Sparks sent through the characters. At time it made you doubtful of the storyline. Wheter or not the book could \\"go out with a bang.\\" It hada a somewhat disappointing and amotional ending, but because of that it really went out with a bang. I will probably remember this book far into the future, and I would probably reccomend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarism is a No No!","review":"I haven't read all of the over 500 reviews of this book but I did sample a good portion of them. Has anyone not yet noticed that Mr. Sparks blatantly lifted a couple of lines in his final letter from Garrett from the eloquent letter written by Sullivan Ballou which was used to such great effect in Ken Burns' documentary \\"The Civil War\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and contrived","review":"The story had a lot of potential, but the characters were not developed and the plot was contrived. Thoughts and emotions were described in \\"5 words or less\\", jumping forward, skipping the \\"meat\\". I was disappointed with this \\"bestseller\\". For excellent writing, try \\"One True Thing\\" by Anna Quindlen. She knows how to tell a story and put you in the shoes of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised how quickly I was drawn into the book.","review":"It was great to find a book that completely took me away to another place while I was reading. The book read easily, was romantic and certainly had a different ending than I anticipated. Found myself teary-eyed at the end of the book and left with a warm feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please....","review":"I have to admit, though the dialogue was a bit stilted and at times simplistic, I was initially involved with the story though the characters were somewhat one-dimensional and behaved with a sterotypical precitability. The \\"ups\\" of the relationship were fun to read - the equivalent of a good beach book - but the \\"downs\\" of the relationship were terribly overwrought and difficult to wade through b/c of their lack of believability. Even with all this, though, I could have nodded at the end of the book and understood what it is that \\"everyone is talking about.\\" But the absolutely stupid \\"twist\\" at the end just made me feel completely manipulated. If they are wise, they will change the end in the movie, but I cannot justify wasting any more money on this story to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-stars would be a better description","review":"This is the sappiest book I've read since \\"Bridges of Madison County\\". I can't believe it is a bestseller! The characters are unbelievable, the prose is cliche-filled and wooden, and the plot line is not only predictable, it's boring too! I can't believe anyone enjoys drivel like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Disappointment","review":"After reading The Notebook, I was really looking forward to reading Message in a Bottle...I thought for sure it would be as good, if not better, but was I ever wrong. I received the audio book as a gift, so I decided to try that out instead of reading the book. Maybe that was my first mistake. I listened to it straight through, and I didn't shed a single tear. The story just wasn't filled with the emotions that The Notebook had. I was hoping for something at least a little uplifting...this story doesn't hold a candle to Sparks' first novel. Maybe it is better when you read it for yourself. At any rate, I don't recommend the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is THIS a bestseller?","review":"C'mon Ladies! This book is so hilarious, I can't believe that we are spending our hard-earned dollars on this! I admire Mr. Sparks' attempts at romance, but it is the most predictable corny book with the worst dialogue I think I've read since Muffy and Bif walked Spot to the park. Nick Sparks has the good fortune to be Warner Books Hollywoodized author of the year, but he's no literary wonder. Try Wally Lamb if you want a hanky-worthy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MESSAGE TO THE HEART From Message in a Bottle!","review":"Nicholas Sparks clearly is a young man with an OLD Soul. This book takes you into the hearts and souls of two people very much in Love. Two people that had always loved each other. They are Soul Mates with a destiny. I will now, and forever be looking for the \\"Message in a Bottle\\". Thank You Nicholas for the EXCELLENT book. I purposely waited for just the right moment to finish this wonderful Love story. I may have to read it again....Thank You, Rosi Bentley"},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottle should have broke - or sunk with it's protagonist","review":"Another bomb from Nick Sparks. I've explained the basic premise to about a dozen people, and every one of them has guessed the plot to a \\"T\\". The \\"messages\\" that the main character finds are the most contrived, embarrasingly stupid pieces of pulp mush I have ever had the displeasure of reading. There wasn't a page I read that wasn't predictable for it's outcome. There was never any sense of mystery about whether the two main characters would meet and fall in love. It boiled down to an argument of who was going to move in with who, and THAT's why they \\"broke up\\". I encourage everyone to read this book, just because it's so laughably bad. Or just read the Weekly World News, at least there is a sence of drama in it's pages...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"If you like sappy, corny, love stories, based on just two characters who are really not all that interesting or likable....Then you will enjoy this book. I had the audio version with Kathleen Quinlan and Bruce Boxleitner as narrators. Bruce's southern accent was pretty fake and kept distracting me. Kathleen's narration was lacking warmth and failed to draw me into the story. But considering the material they had to work with...you can't really fault them."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does he do it ?","review":"Once again I'm amazed. It may be a step above Harlequin Romances, but I love it !! I was sniffling and leaking, totally wrung out emotionally, and blissfully so. Young Mr. Sparks knows where our buttons are and plays them like a virtuoso. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"struggling writer from Idaho","review":"This was a terrible book. The dialogue was cliched, the characters uninteresting and trite. It was so obvious Sparks was trying to appeal to a mostly female audience. The only good thing was the plot premise, but then it turned into predictable mush, even worse than a Mary Higgins Clark novel. The only thing that kept me reading is I wanted to see if it sucked all the way to the end, and it surely did. It is depressing that so many folks here thought this was such a great book -- either they don't read very often or I've overestimated the intelligence of the average reader. How this ever got published, or even made it past the first cut is amazing. Total fluff.This is what it takes to be successful today in America? It's the equivalent of some so-called rap artist becoming a millioniare that can't even sing or play an instrument. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"great in the beginning...","review":"Well I loved \\"The Notebook\\" so i thought that I'd give this a try. It was a great book up until the last 20 pages, when it just took a rather obvious turn that didn't need to happen. Stupid what she did then what he did was even more moronic. If you love someone don't wait to find them, just go and find them. dumb dumb dumb ending that ruined the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever read!","review":"The writer has no talent! The only fascinating part of the book is the plot, which became the skeleton of a movie with same title. The descriptions of the sceneries are inaccurate and tastless. The characters are not well-developed. After I finally finished the book, I felt like the author wrote this book in a kind of rush as if he was participating in a speed-writing contest, and quanlity of the work doesn't matter! 370 pages of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I have enjoyed Mr. Sparks books until the end of this one.Great story up to the conclusion.

I had to stop and read the instructions on the airplane barf bag every once in a while just to stay awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"i LOVED this book. i have never had a book bring me to tears but this one certainly did. nicholas sparks is not a cheesey romance novelist but rather a writer who's stories are so inspiring that they have you wishing you could jump right into the lives of the people he writes about and partake in their journey. when i finish his books i always walk away wanting more and the memoires of them stay with me for quite some time. please read and don't forget the kleenex. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am waiting patiently for Nicolas Sparks next book!","review":"After reading through some very candid comments regarding this book, I thought I must have read another book. Not every story ends happily. I find Nicolas very talented and as a budding writer, I hope he doesn't take the criticism hard. I read The Notebook first and passed it on to my sisters, mother, and many friends. They all loved it! I was equally impressed with Message in a Bottle (I haven't seen it since my sister grabbed it from me and started the cycle again). Yes, it was heartbreaking to find that the main character dies in the end. That is life!Nicholas: Please continue to write and we will continue to support you.

I love a good romance especially when I can share it with my wife, but manipulative \\"hollywood\\" trash like this just makes me angry. If you can't move your audience emotionally with good writing (script or novel) without killing off one of the main characters just for the sake of a good \\"tear-jerking\\" then you have no business writing period. The movie itself was better than the book but the ending left you thinking \\"What was the point?\\" Why would anyone lead it's audience on a journey about the triumph of love and overcoming pain and sorrow of a lost loved one only to kill them in the end? Manipulative and just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"After reading this book, I don't understand why people think Nicholas Sparks is a such a great writer. I found his book to be very simple and boring. The conversation was stilted, the ending predictable. I had read another one of his books and was also disappointed but decided to give it one more try. I can definitely say that I won't be reading any more Sparks books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF this was my first Sparks book, it would have been my last!","review":"People must be starved for romance. That's the only reason I can see people would give this book 5 stars. Or, possibly it was assummed it must be good because of previous Sparks books. I wanted to like it. The plot had great possibilities. Sparks just did not write in the same style as his other books. All of his books I have read (Notebook, Wedding, A Walk to Remember) kept me glued to the page and even had me wanting to just start the book immediately over again when I finished. This one was an effort to get through. The dialogue was probably better on the screen where you can see the expressions and body language. On the written page, it was trite and embarrassing. The characters seemed one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bunch of hooey.","review":"In MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE by Nicholas Sparks, a sensitive, yet regular kind'o guy,is sending out letters of love to his deceased wife. He puts them into a bottle and flings them into the briny deep. This is after he has drunk the contents of said bottle, probably vodka. A nosy, disillusioned reporter lady finds a bottle and sets out in search of him and love. This is the kind of situation that keeps Jerry Springer in business. As it turns out, the hero (named Garret) grows to care deeply for the heroine, but in the end, his heart remains in the grave as the quaint Victorian saying went. (Stephen King handles a similar situation much better in Bag of Bones, of course with SK, the heart really IS in her grave). I think after reading this loser, that John Gray and Nicholas Sparks ought to go into business together writing touchy-feely greeting cards. THUMBS DOWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will haunt me forever...I LOVED IT","review":"After finishing the Notebook, I couldn't wait for Sparks' next book. I wasn't aware it had been released. I snatched my copy and headed home. I didn't leave there for 3 hours, until I finihsed the book. I love the way he writes. I am touched by the tenderness of his characters, and I marvel at the insight with which he captures a woman's feelings and emotions.This book touched a my heart, my soul and a very personal cord with me. The story haunts me, as it closely parrells a relationship I hold very dear in my own life. Thank you Nicholas Sparks, when will you enchant me again ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...YAWN.","review":"Don't bother. Flat. Boring. Predicatable. One dimensional characters at best.

A huge dissapointment; I do not recommend this book to anyone other than Danielle Steel fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of 98","review":"I suffered through 99 pages of this book before finally tossing it down. This was definitely the worst book I've read all year. Sparks first novel, The Notebook, was quaint, soppy, but a good beach read. This novel contains some of the worst dialogue I've read, it is simplistic and unbelievable. The writer misses the boat on creating likeable characters you even remotely care about. You are never able to create vivid images from his descriptions, and it drags on and on and on.... Sparks benefited from Oprah's recommendation of The Notebook, but he is unable to follow-up with a novel that even comes close. I've happily picked up Carol Shield's Larry's Pary and after 5 pages, I'm captivated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a big disappointment!","review":"Having read and enjoyed \\"The Notebook,\\" I looked forward to Sparks' latest with great anticipation. \\"Message\\" was a total waste of time! Shallow and sappy, it earns a place in the Robert Waller \\"Hall of Romantic Fluff.\\" Garrett Blake was a spineless, pathetic character who failed to solicit any sympathy from me. Theresa was the quintessential, manipulative woman. It's no wonder Garrett drowned himself to get away from her! I will think twice before picking up another book by Nicholas Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cliche waste of time","review":"I read MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE thinking, \\"I hate romances, but how bad can it be? Oprah recommended his other book...\\" This was a story of a manipulitive woman who searches for the man she has found letters from washed upon the shore. Sparks seems to side at times with this sneaky creature, making her seem \\"right\\" at most parts in the novel. I could not take that. The unrealistic part of this novel was that Theresa went all the way to North Carolina to find this mystery man, finds him, and of course they instantly fall in love. This book takes too much patience on the behalf of the reader, from the anything-but-unique love letters, to the frail plot in between, to the cliche, spur-of-the-moment ending. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overrated book","review":"I found this book to be pretty poorly written. The plot was so predictable. Neither of the main characters were particularly interesting either, especially \\"Garrett\\". In fact, he really bugged me. I did not think of him as being some attractive and mysterious man, but a wimpy and childish man. And did anyone else notice how overused the characters' names were? I think the word Garrett was in every sentence. I only finished it because I was on a long plane ride and had no other alternative. I also have no desire to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message in a bottle? Sleepless in Boston","review":"What really strikes me about 'Message in a bottle' is that the story is the same as 'Sleepless in Seattle' except for the fact that Tom Hanks survives. Meg Ryan's editor boss, the radio show in stead of the bottle, the dead wife, the research into his whereabouts, the distance, the flying up and down, the first meeting between the two at the roadside, the son as a motivator to get a girlfriend is replaced by the father, they even both live very close to the water. Give me a break, I am not going to see the movie, I have already seen it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor read, and a boring basic story.","review":"The book was such an easy story: a woman finds a love letter, happens to find the man who wrote it (in about a week), they fall in love, and the story concludes with the tragic love. The book was so elementary by its terrible writing and too predictible story that you would be better off reading something by my 3 year old cousin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, trite dialogues ruin the book.","review":"Try again next time, Sparks.

This is the first book I've read by Nicholas Sparks and for some reason I expected more depth. I probably should have read the book before I saw the movie! I enjoyed the movie much more. The book seemed very anti-climatic.After saying all that, I should point out that I did enjoy the book and read it pretty quickly... it was an easy and pleasurable read. My expectations were probably too high is all.I enjoyed the author's style enough to try another of his books and I would recommend this book if you enjoy love stories (even when they are sad and tortured) and especially if you are fond of Danielle Steel's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Ridiculous story line. Very poorly written.","review":"1 star is actually generous, but it was the lowest choice I had. I haven't seen the movie, but I found the plot of the book to be very contrived. It strains credulity. Worse, the writing is so baaaaad--trite, unnatural conversations; repetitious phrases throughout; cardboard characters that evoke no sympathy. Except for the sex scenes (which are also wooden and uninspiring), this book appears to have been written for 10-year-olds. Sorry, but that's my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"As with another reviewer, I am reviewing after 301 reviews. This was awful! I almost couldn't finish it. I don't know about the movie, maybe when it hits video. At first I thought I was really going to love this book, but about 4 or 5 chapters in, I realized that I didn't like Theresa and Garrett and their relationship wasn't realistic. I understand about loving your spouse so much that life is never the same, but it had been 3 years. THREE YEARS!! Get on with life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Contrived and Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"Message in a Bottle started out beautifully. I was enthralled...for about one chapter.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomoric, no moral fiber, how does a loser end up on top?","review":"I thought The Notebook tore at your heart, and left you believing again in true love. This was such a let down. How could any relationship based on deception, and treading on another's grief and loss have ended any other way....what a waste. I disliked Theresa real quick. Decent human beings don't behave like this. There was no real romance that could ever have come from this..........There are really good books that could have been films, this isn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an enjoyable \\"happily-ever-after\\"","review":"When I read fiction, I want a book that will leave me feeling good afterwards. I did not get my wish with Message in a Bottle. I wanted to love this book, it has a wonderful premise, but the characters never came to life. I don't even believe they truly loved each other! I suppose, since I hated the ending, that is good. However, if you like this kind of tear-jerker story, read Barbara Delinsky's Three Wishes. At least with it, you will get really mad when the heroine dies, because you will feel like she was someone who could have been your best friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance for all time.","review":"I can only imagine what it would be like to find a love letter of that depth and magnitude.

This is not one of those books. I like Sparks, but he made me want to take a stiff drink after reading the ending to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story is a heartbreaking tale of love and understanding","review":"How many of you have got a chance to read this novel or watch the movie made of this story? Well, I strongly recommend the movie. When you have read the book and then watch the movie, you will see images of what you just have read. The story about Theresa and Garret brings out a big deal of hidden emotions of the person reading it. You will find yourself crying and asking if the love you have in life is significantly compared to this love story. You must own the book and watch the movie to see how your heart will ache with their pain as well as with the pain of your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and tragic love story","review":"I believe in fairy tales and Nicholas Sparks has done it again - woven a story that held me until the end. I fell in love with Garrett and became friends with Teresa. How they met was a little hokey, but hey, that's why we read these books. Having both been hurt, they were drawn to each other and, I felt, \\"meant to be together\\". No relationship is easy, though, and distance, work and family kept them from spending as much time together as they'd like to have done. Nonetheless, their love burned strong.This book shows us the power of true love and how it can help us get through anything in life and make us stronger for having been through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seaside Atmosphere","review":"This was a good story. A woman finds a message in a bottle. . . And she acts upon it. I won't say anymore about it because I don't want to ruin it for those who have not read it.My favorite thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable, and the food sounded good.This book would probably be considered a romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The literary equivalent of a 2X4 to the skull.....","review":"this alleged \\"novel\\" (I use the word lightly in the case of this endless stream of cliches, hollow banalities, and predictable \\"twists\\") has no redeeming qualities whatsoever outside of convincing me that the American public have lost their ability to distinguish writing from chicken scratch. Why would women like this book so much? Are they that lonely? Would they really enjoy meeting a man so unable to get over himself? This book is an ode to narcissism if anything, and it will drive cynics even harder to rip to shreds any and all attempts at romance fiction in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was searching for a mindless read","review":"and boy, did I get it with Message. It has been ages since I have read a book so poorly written, with characters so one-dimensional and with dialogue that would embarrass a Harlequin romance writer. I am glad to have finished this book because I laughed my way through it (sometimes until the tears rolled) - although I am certain this was not the effect that Sparks intended with his sappy, stupid story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most terrible book ever written!","review":"Nicholas Sparks needs to take a beginner's writing class. The plot is cliched (man falling for woman, man dies and leaves romantic tragedy behind), the characters one-dimensional, and his prose is riddled with hackneyed phrases, empty description, and boring dialogue. How this book ever became a bestseller is shocking to me. I was left literally gagging at the end and believe this will be the first time a movie surpasses a book in meaning and beauty for me. At least with a movie you have beautiful scenery to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Message in a Bottle was truly captivating!

That being said, as usual I liked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Kind of Message","review":"After reading a few books by Nicholas Sparks, I had pegged him as a hopelessly romantic writer who caters to women's wishes for love. After reading Message in a Bottle, however, I feel differently. I find nothing wrong with hopelessy romantic love stories... in this crazy world, everyone needs to have a little bit of delusional stuff to hold onto. But this book is not delusional... it is a delusional reality. Sparks paints the picture of a beautiful loves story but throws in a twist that I had not expected in one of his books. Rather than add this book to his list of obviously happy endings, Sparks ends this book in a bizarre, yet hopeful way that readers need to read. Delusional things are good, but a dose of hopeful reality is just as benenficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real tearjerker","review":"This was a good book, although the ending was very tragic it really shows how strong the bond of love is between two people i loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left a Sour Taste!","review":"I began reading this book almost immediately after finishing One True Thing by Anna Quindlen, a book which left Message in a Bottle choking in it's dust. Nicholas Sparks' prose seemed shallow and amateurish in comparison, and though at times I was caught up in the story, I frequently found myself feeling impatient with the plot, the characters, the \\"style.\\" The ending was horrible and reminded me of The Horse Whisperer--another book that left me feeling gypped (both books seemed like they were written with an eye toward the Big Screen.) The whole ending felt rushed and slapped together, and Garrett making that final, huge misjudgement seemed totally implausible and out of character."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"Don't waste your time. This book is predictable, far-fetched, and unbelievable. The only reason I kept reading was that I visualized Kevin Costner and Paul Newman as Garrett and Jeb. I HATED the ending!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as The Notebook, but still worthwhile","review":"I really enjoyed A Message in a Bottle although I can appreciate why some readers were disappointed. While the book is enjoyable it does not live up to the standards set in The Notebook. That may be due to the fact that The Notebook was based on a true story about Nicholas Sparks wife's grandparents. I do, think, however, that if you allow yourself to suspend belief and be entertained, A Message in a Bottle is a very romantic and entertaining book. Just be careful, because if it pulls you in, you'll need a few tissues. I still think Nicholas Sparks is one of the best writers to reach a woman's heart. And I agree with the reader who wrote that D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari) can really reach a woman's mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, ordinary, and uninspired","review":"If you can identify with a 30-something heroine with the annoying habit of twirling her hair around her finger, and if you enjoy such deft phrasing as \\"yesterday night,\\" then this book's for you.

The story is somewhat interesting but, it is like the ingredients to a gourmet dinner left in the hands of an employee of McDonalds. He leaves us gasping in amazement at the vacant emotion and contrived sentimentality. If you want Romance and great writing read Mother of Pearl by Melinda Haynes and Four Letters Of Love by Niall Williams. You will wish you never read anything by Nicolas Sparks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"It is a shame that this book was so bad. The idea for the book - a message in a bottle - was interesting. That idea was the best part of the book - Theresa was so plain and uninteresting one wonders why the author (or Garret) bothered with her. Theresa and Garret's second \\"romantic interlude\\" included her son which really took the wind out of the sails of this love story.

I had insisted that my rather cynical husband read THE NOTEBOOK. I felt that, after 30 years of marriage, we could both relate to this tale of surviving love. He enjoyed it also. Now, I hope that he does not begin to read MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. I don't want him to realize that I could read such an empty, trite, predictable book! Also, when I began the book, I could not see Kevin Costner playing the romantic thirty something lead. As I read on, it was easy to imagine him, with his pablum like delivery, saying these lines.

It is on the opposite side of the Cape on Nantucket Sound and the Atlantic Ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as his other two..","review":"This one is good, just not as good as the other two. I enjoyed A Walk to Remember and The Notebook much more. I found this book to be too cruel. Yes, the others are cruel, but it was the forces of nature that was being cruel.

How could she do this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start..Predictable Finish","review":"The book was enjoyable about halfway through.

Should have been a short story in a womens' magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly developed characters, plodding dialogue","review":"After seeing previews for the movie I immediately bought the book. The premise is one that is ripe for telling in today's world of broken relationships, lost loves. The effort to complete the book was monumental. It reads like an outline for a potentially marvelous novel/movie/play, waiting to be fleshed out. Unfortunately, the fleshing never occurs. Also unfortunately, the movie follows the book so closely that the movie, also, fails in its attempt to satisfy. Truly a pity, as Mr. Sparks had the potential to develop a deeply compelling storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend it","review":"This is the first book by Nicholas Sparks that I have read. Basically it's about a divorced thirty something woman that finds an extraordinarily romantic letter in a bottle washed up on the beach. The letter was written by a man to his dead wife. She works for a newspaper, prints the letter, in time finds out who the letter writer is, where he is, and goes to meet him. The rest of the book is about the two of them, the relationship they develop, and the relationship with his deceased wife that he can't let go of.Anyway... after I finished the book my mother in law read it. She loved it. Then we rented the movie. We both agreed the book was better.So read it.. I'm going on MOnday morning to the library to check out more books by Nicholas Sparks. He's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"tear jerker!","review":"This was my first Nicholas Sparks book that I happened across by chance and it left me a huge fan of his work. Yes, this book is sad, if you have a heart you will cry! No, it does not have a Hollywood happy ending, but how often do you see those in real life? But despite the tears I shed and the ache in my heart that I felt reading this book, I walked away feeling good. You CAN survive heartache, you WILL be okay. The human heart is strong and the whole adage is true: It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Message In A Bottle","review":"Nicholas Sparks surely has a way with words with this book!

Mind you, I am not the hard of heart, I cried during the Mother's Day episode of the Rugrats! But the dialogue in the book seemed, well, forced and contrived. Pure drivel!

What started out to be a promising read slowly became insipid and banal. I finished the book only in the hope that it would improve. It didn't. Still, I'm looking forward to Mr. Sparks third book, \\"A Walk to Remember\\" because \\"The Notebook\\" was THAT good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated, mawkish","review":"A totally predictable, shallow, overly clever and underplotted piece of mawkish sentimentallity. I kept reading it just because I knew I was SUPPOSED to find the story affecting, but wasn't even able to come up with a single tear at the ending. If Sparks's ambition is to join the ranks of one-dimensional romantic novelists, he's going to have to improve a little. I'll be sure and pass up \\"The Notebook.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely but not Impossible","review":"The story may be unlikely to ever happen, but not impossible, and that's what makes it so special.

I loved The Notebook, what a wonderful story. This one doesn't have the plot and seems too sappy and unbelievable at times, but still a fun book to read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough to make anyone seasick.","review":"The fact that this literary tripe has spent so many days on the bestseller lists convinces me that American taste has truly sunk to the lowest common denominator. I had to check the verso page of this to see if I was reading a foreign translation. I couldn't believe that a book so poorly written could be accepted by a publisher. Shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was pure drivel.","review":"Unfortunately, this sappy \\"love\\" story somehow escaped a thorough copyediting. The plot was full of sentimental cliches and melodramatic writing that at certain moments it was painful to read. The ending also went overboard (no pun intended) on the irony of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst writing I have ever seen.","review":"I do not even know why I continued reading this book when after only the first three pages I realized how hacked the writing and how idiotic the story are. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue seems to have been written by a star-struck teeny bopper romantik girlyboy still struggling through high school. I only finished the book out of morbid fascination. In other words, this kind of writing earns millions???"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the fuss about???","review":"I can't believe that this book was a best seller, I kept looking at the cover just to convince myself that it wasn't a Mills and Boon or maybe a Barbara Cartland novel. I did however shed a tear when it turned out that Catherine sent the bottle (in his dream)but that was it, the only emotion I felt through all of the boring 370 pages. The rest was mindless pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I picked up this book, impressed with it being on the NY Times Bestseller list as well as an impending movie with Kevin Costner and Paul Newman.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid stupid stupid","review":"This was one of the stupidest, most predictable books I've ever read! I hated it. Actually, I don't even know why I wasted the time reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best.....","review":"Did not enjoy reading this book. I think it was a disappointment after reading \\"The Notebook\\". I would highly recommend reading The Notebook instead of this book. The Notebook is actually one of my all time favorite books. Maybe if I would have read the message in a bottle before the notebook, I would have enjoyed it more. After reading the first book (The Notebook) - I guess I just had higher expectations of the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message to Sparks: Take a Class","review":"Someone should tell the author of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" that a description of someone grilling steaks is NOT the same as exposition! I read \\"Message\\" after hearing much praise for Sparks's first novel. What a waste of time! While fiction requires \\"the willing suspension of disbelief\\" on the part of the reader, this piece of fiction used up my willingness far too soon and gave too little in return. Nothing about this novel makes me want to believe--not the characters, not the far-fetched plot, not the use of dialogue where description would do.Perhaps Mr. Sparks can spend a fraction of his writing income to attend a good fiction-writing workshop and then try again. In the meantime, I will stick to Booker short-list titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a tear-jerker...","review":"This book was easy to read because the language was simple and very captivating. The novel was about two people living in different states are somehow connnected to each other from just a message in a bottle found by Theresa Osborne, while taking her daily jog on the beach when something caught her attention in the sand, a bottle washed up by the shore. A love letter from a man named Garrett to his wife named Catherine. As Theresa, a newspaper editor, so deeply touched by the letter, edits it in her newspaper and another woman replys by finding a message in a bottle as well. Theresa, wanting to find this man, goes through twisted and bending pathways. Striking as it seems, it gets more romatic, filled with passion, love, struggle and faith. Never knowing, a person could be waiting out there for you too, just believe in faith and destiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Message in the Bottle is no Notebook.","review":"After reading the Notebook, Sparks, a new author seemed to have captured the story of undying love. I had found myself amazed that a man who wrote fiction could grasp the underpinnings of unconditional love and move the reader to tears. However, this book paled in comparison. The characters were poorly developed and the plot seemed far fetched. The book droned on about the lead character's son Kevin, yet failed to develop a reason for even mentioning the son. Additionally, the relationship between Theresa and Garret did not appear to emmulate \\"love\\". I read that the Notebook, although fiction, had some basis in reality as it described Spark's grandparents relationship. However, Message in the Bottle left me with no message at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" meets \\"Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\\"","review":"The members of my book group and I really enjoyed this read. It captivated me throughout the whole book. But i would have to say my favorite part of this book, and the part that peaked all of our interest, was the secret steak recipe. We actually had a get together using his recipe on the grill last week. C'est Magnifique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sincerest Form of Flattery","review":"Message In A Bottle is a decent summer read for romantics. For those, seeking a compelling story, \\"who cares?\\" may scream over the beach. For some of us Civil War buffs, Theresa's final message in a bottle may have a familiar ring to it. Compare the contents of Theresa's prose with Major Sullivan Ballou's last letter to his wife before the battle of Bull Run. It was probably the most emotional momment of PBS & Ken Burns' CIVIL WAR Series. The letter is on page 82 of the series book. Looks like Nicholas Sparks is a historical romantic or something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride.","review":"Again, just as in The Notebook, Sparks is able to convey powerful emotions through the writings of his characters. The letters are actually the best part of the book and are works of art in themselves. Flaws in the rest of the book's plot and character development detract from the overall rating but the letters definitely make it worthwhile reading.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most beautiful stories that I have ever read!","review":"\\"Message in a Bottle\\" was absolutely one of the most beautiful stories that I have ever read. It is a book that touches the soul and makes you cry with the joy and sadness of it. The characters are so real . I read it during every spare moment I had and even when I shouldn't have taken another moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new level of banality.","review":"This book was selected by one member of my book club. I suggest we expel her. The book has some of the least imaginative dialogue I have ever read in a published work. It is obvious that the author had an intriguing idea,the romantic messages, but then had no idea where to go with it. Having read other reviews I am fascinated by the descriptions of this novel as romantic. Romance has to have a level of passion, and passion is not to be found on these pages. Even their individual ruminations on the relationship are shallow and uninteresting. The final \\"tragic\\" twist is obviously an attempt to give some tiny bit of substance to the work, but in order for you to view something as tragic you have to care about the characters, and the author created plastic people like Garrett, the poor man's Heathcliff. The message must have been in a diet soda bottle because this puppy was very, very,light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unnerving yet an excellent read...","review":"Well unfortunately Theresa messed up here. But interestingly enough, while the reader can at some point predict the ending, it is still impossible to put the book down. Hurry up Sparks and write another book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last....a truly romantic love story....joy and tragedy","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Notebook\\" so much I was eager to read this second novel. It amazes me that a male author can touch the soul with such writing. I would have liked it to end differently, and frankly was shocked at the ending. But after pondering this novel (and it is worth pondering) I think it was a fitting ending. Nicholas Sparks is a true romantic in my \\"book\\" and I am refreshed to find writing with such class and style. He doesn't write just for the shock value of sex and violence but has insight and depth to his soul. I'll take this kind of writing any time compared to Steel's \\"and then\\" \\"and then\\" descriptive paragraphing. No imagination there at all.It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is Real and Sparks proves it!","review":"Theresa and Garrett are characters that are could be any of us.

However, the only reason I read the thing was because I can't drop a book unfinished. I had to find out what happened. While the plot was farfetched, I did enjoy it. What got to me was the terrible writing. This man took a really neat idea for a plot and completely screwed it up. I had absolutely no sense of who the characters really were, and no sense of why Garret had a relationship with either Catherine or Theresa. Yeah they were all nice people, but the quirkiness and closeness that brings people together was absolutely lacking here. I wish I could write novels so I could rewrite this the way it should be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's just writting movie scripts, not a novel.","review":"I do not enjoy reading books that were obviously written as a movie script. They tend to be over simplfied and lack any character depth. Mr. Sparks goes so out of the way to get those tear jerking moments. At times I found myself laughing because I knew just what he was going to write. If I was sixteen I would find his books dreamy, at fourty-four I find them contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened!!!","review":"I looooooved The notebook it was one of my favorite books and I couldn't wait to read Message in a bottle.

I agree, there were some really slow parts. But I loved this book. I began to feel very close to the characters. I cannot wait for the movie.

It is sure to be a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Surprises from Sparks!","review":"I enjoyed reading Message in a Bottle. I am amazed how many surprises appeared in this story. I really enjoyed the beginning, but felt the middle part really drug out. The ending was a huge surprise which brought the whole story together in a creative matter. Nick Sparks certainly has a special talent for writing and showers many suprise sparks throughout his stories! I can't wait to read his third book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!! What a tearjerker!! A great romance novel!!","review":"Just finished reading the\\" Message In A Bottle\\" just 20 minutes ago. My eyes are swollen and I'm a total mess. I read Nicholas Sparks other novel\\" The Notebook\\" and I cried through that book too. What is it with Nicholas's books, that does this to me? I've never cried reading books, but after reading his second novel, I knew he struck a chord in me. The story was beautiful and heartwrenching. It made me reanalyze my life with my love one. And how much I treasure our life together. I just can't wait till Nicholas Sparks writes another novel. I'm waiting with my kleenex in hand.

Happy or sad ending, who cares?! The two main characters are cardboard cut-outs, the plot is predictable, the romance is sirupy garbage. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing is sophomoric and the story is treacle.","review":"I cannot understand how a writer of such little talent can be on any bestseller list. He wrote as if he wished to rush through the story. The characters are wooden, devoid of life; characatures of lovers. The author conveys no sense of place in his description of the Carolina coast. The story is about two self absorbed people who cannot seem to get on with their lives, but the reader is apparently supposed to accept them as deep people with grand philosophies of love. I found the main characters to be two people I would not want to spend an evening with. This book should be banished to the Romantic sections of bookstores, and placed on the bottom racks. Perhaps then people would not waste their money on this treacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Pure nonsense. Neither character is believable or displays any redeeming qualities. Self absorbed and sappy. The story line is complete foolishness. Mr. Sparks is mediocre, at the very best. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLS SHORT! Trite, sugary, over-done wanna-be tear-jerker.","review":"Too many coincidences. If you believe in modern day fairy tales...this is your cup of tea. I felt that it was overly done. This was a highly stylized knock-off of a previous book, The Bridges of Madison County. Except now, instead of BRIDGES, it's BOATS. It's all been done!!! The characters are definitely out of central casting. BUT, if you are in the mood for a sapppy summer read/beach book, without any thought required, I guess you could do worse. Majorly improbable plot....on many levels. Sparks takes the reader through bumpy twists and turns...and asks the reader to believe in all the incredible detours along the way..NO WAY would a sophisticated reader go for this. I feel that Sparks was waiting for a movie deal as he wrote this one, maybe even with the leading players chosen????? Too sugary....too sappy...take some insulin....before trying to buy into this love story. The ending was there for all to see by the end of chapter one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Combine the movie \\"The Titanic\\" with the curse of the Kennedy Family and you have \\"A Message in a Bottle\\". This book uses these type of tactics to claim the readers emotions.The book is slow with undeveloped characters. If you're too happy(?), read this book because it will definitly bring you down a few notches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as his first!!","review":"I believe that MIAB was just as good as The Notebook, if not better, because it was longer and I could spend more time reading a book that totally shut all of the bad stuff in this world out.I wish that Nicholas Sparks could write a book every week and have them published just as fast, but I'm also glad he doesn't, because I would never get anything else done.As soon as I got done with The Notebook, I went to the bookstore and asked about MIAB, but was told that it would not be available until May. I had the store reserve me a copy. Feeling that they didn't call me quick enough to let me know that it was in, I saw a copy in another store and bought it in a heartbeat. I went home from that store and I don't believe much got done until I finished it, of course with tears rolling down my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Fury Was Special !","review":"Paradise is a great compilation CD by Billy Fury.

I have never read any of Malamud's work previously. Curious to learn about how he perceived life of immigrants, Jewish underclass and life struggles in general, I have decided to read his complete collection of short stories. It was pure delight to read these short stories not only because of their intense content, bu also because it gave complete insight of the Malamud's growth as a writer. One can see how his writing and style is changing and evolving over time. It becomes better and better with writer's personal maturity. I would stongly recommend this writer to anyone who wants to read about Jewish culture, learn about life of immigrants in the period between 1930s-1960s. Now I am looking forward to read Malamud's other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich characters and wonderful prose","review":"This is the first time I read Malamud based off a recommendation from my well read grandfather. I asked him who are the best modern Jewish fiction writers. Bellows, Roth, and Malamud are definitely the best he noted. I was very impressed by the depth of all of the characters introduced in this novel and I was especially pleased at the constant reappearance of an artist down on his luck but completely in love with making art. And that is exactly what Malamud does - create art.Many of his characters are the outcast types that feel like outsiders hardly understand them and their passions (we've all felt that way at times haven't we?) Many of the protagonists are writers, artists, store owners, janitors - an ordinary walk of life. I recommend this book despite the incoherency of the last couple short stories - but don't worry the 50something before it are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"While Malamud is without doubt a very skilled writer, I gave up attempting to read this book approximately 1/3 of the way through it. The atmosphere of the book was overwhelmingly dour and depressing: story after story of loneliness, poverty, bleakness, bitterness, struggle, alienation from family. It leaves one ready to jump off a bridge somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Age","review":"I used this book for an advanced American Foreign Policy course.

Also, I will admit I'm a bit biased considering I'm best friends with his little brother and I've known Howie since I was 3. Howie's new CD is excellent, and I have to say that Les Hall(lead guitar, keyboard) is one of the most talented musicians I have ever seen/heard. It's amazing to hear what he can do on a guitar. The whole band is a great compliment to Howie and his looping. I strongly suggest you pick up his CD, especially if you liked Australia.

I have herad that Day is influenced by both Musical Phenomenons. Jeff Buckley would bend over and puke if he heard Howie Days voice, as for Radiohead; Is there any musician in the world right now that is not influenced by Radiohead. My point made.

If you buy \\"Stop All The World Now\\", go ahead and buy the previous one as well. It is just as good, maybe even better. \\"Perfect Time of Day\\", \\"Collide\\" and \\"Sunday Morning Song\\" are a couple of the good songs on the new album.

These are the perfect elements to please the masses of drones who buy anything that Mtv tells them to...but for those of us that buy music because it's good and heartfelt, well this album is simply a waste of time.Australia was emotional, flawed, and amazing...

I would listen intently forever hoping they might say his name so that i would know who he was, and could buy his CD. He is that good. When i listened to his CD, i found songs that were just as good, even better then perfect time of day. You wilkl be amazed. He has a gorgeous voice. It is deep, and rich, and full, and it reaches out to you and grabs you. Wow, this is an amazing album. When i hear his lyrics i feel as though he is singing for me, and that is one special feeeling. He can capture feelings in sound, and he is able to discribe these feeling in simple yet beautiful ways that are able to reach out to you, and share with you.

I am 40-something, and a musician myself, with over 1,700 CD's in my collection, and as soon as I heard this CD, my jaw hit the ground! Not many modern day artists have this effect on me these days.

Little troubadour with a big voice. First disc, Howie strummed and delivered half a good album. Now,he and his producer confuse seriousness with signifcance and give us 52 minutes of bombast. Virtually every song follows the exact same structure: Howie starts with a whisper or aspirant syllable, shifts into normal voice, then adds strings and begins screaming over them. Just like Barry Manilow, Howie seems to think that volume equals emotion. It doesn't. And who's idea was it to take a decent song \\"She Says\\" from Australia and add all the schmaltz? Is Howie making music or auditioning for rot like American Idol?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Howie???","review":"maybe I'm jumping the gun because I haven't listened to it enough, but this doesn't even sound like him anymore....It's over produced, he sounds vocally stiff and he lacks the emotion he had on the previous records. there is not one just solo acoustic number, all the songs have drums and/or alot of string stuff going on.

As someone intimately familiar with Jaco's debut album through scores of listenings and as a musician of 35 years, I love this kind of project that presents the music of a genius [Jaco] by a master of the bass [Bromberg]. As for any comments about the music style, it's probably from the same person who would dismiss Mark O Connor and Vince Gill because it's \\"country\\", Robben Ford because it's \\"just blues\\" or John Mayer because it's \\"pop\\".

Someone removed it surgically from him a long time ago, assuming he ever had any. And the music he's producing is the soulless output of a man who has no idea what real R&B, real jazz (not the honkified brand of mainstream crap that passes and has passed for the last 20 years), real music is all about. It makes me angry to listen to him butcher these songs. Jaco's seminal first solo release. These were masterpieces, most of them, and he layers synth and noodling solos over his \\"interpretations\\" of the Jaco bass lines, thereby totally decimating the integrity of the melodies, harmonies and musicianship of the original.

Many today believe God is a crutch for the weak-minded; surely those who are intelligent and educated need not lean on something so unknown, so unproven, as a belief in God. Goldstein answers basic scientific questions about the universe and how it works, and step-by-step leads the reader down a path of understanding of things such as quantum physics (which will stretch your mind unless you have already mastered that field!) and other scientific and logical arguments. By the time you finish this book, you will see that the only LOGICAL thing to do is to believe in a supreme God who created you, loved you, and died for you. Goldstein is a brilliant man and gifted author. You will enjoy this book even if you just want to read a logical, thoughtful, excellently written piece of literature.Shelley Bacon"},{"rating":"2","title":"NPQ covers everything you need to know about in the nonprofit world!","review":"If you work or follow the nonprofit industry, Nonprofit Quarterly is an essential source for news and information.The writing is top-notch, and they cover the issues that really matter.The magazine articles, combined with their frequently updated website, gives deep insight into industry trends and breaking news in the sector.Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Divine!","review":"Received this for my birthday a few days ago - and I am simply blown away.\\"Waiting on the Sun\\" and \\"Paralyzed\\" are probably my two favorite songs from the CD - of course, as I write this review I'm listening to the CD. \\"I've Been Waiting\\" has just started playing and maybe THAT'S my favorite song.My least favorite cut is \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\" and even it is eminently listenable, a subtly different take on the Crowded House hit.This is one of those albums that gets better with each listen. I highly recommend it to anyone with an ear for superior pop/rock, intelligent (and intelligible) lyrics and sometimes sublime orchestration.\\"Eyes Wide Open\\" just started. It just gets better.Simply Divine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but good","review":"I like this CD even more than Sixpence None the Richer's last CD because it's more upbeat and entertaining. I like every song besides \\"Eyes wide Open\\" which has a rather obnoxious tune. It's not a very coventional album--almost every song is a little strange. It makes for a very interesting album but takes a little getting use to. Many of the songs hit the spot for me musically, like \\"Still Burning\\" and \\"Waiting on the Sun\\". Other songs that I don't like all the way through have redeeming quailties, like \\"Paralized,\\" which starts out whiney but has a great chorus. My favorite song is \\"Dizzy\\" which is full of emotion and has very interesting instrumentation. It's a great CD as long as you like music that is a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely Divine","review":"I have to say I have never written a review for a CD before but, really loved Divine Discontent.

I'm waiting on the sunshine... Reminded me of the Beatles and I could easily see that on a soundtrack.Each song hit me a little differently, but in a very good way.

It is unpatriotic to the higest degree to betray the soliders with this kind of beahvior. It is not leadership, but fear that has ruled Paul Bremer.

The text reveals a bureaucrat who played things safe, instead of taking bold steps in the early days to transform Iraqi society into a modern state, instead of one torn apart by cynical politicians who use religion and ethnicity as weapons to gain power.

Not to mention having allowed / ignored / participated in / the organized looting of Baghdad's museums' priceless treasures.

The label that was set to release the album went under, leaving Cyndi with no way to get the music out to the people. Finally, she's releasing the EP with the songs that seemed to be getting the best response from her fans.So how are the songs? Great! Shine is a great anthem that shows that her vocal talents still soar. It's Hard To Be Me is reminicint of some of her earlier work, full of spunk and energy. Water's Edge is a beutiful balad co-written with Rob Hyman, who also co-wrote Time after Time with Cyndi. This song isn't as great as Time After Time, but it's definately one of her better ballads.This EP is going to have to get us through till Cyndi releases the full album (hopefully by year's end) and it's definately been worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Delivers Again","review":"I have been waiting for word of Cyndi Lauper's new music for quite some time.

It's a catchy tune with a fun message.When I was at my part-time job the other night I listened to this and set the CD player to repeat so it continually played the EP.

For those of us who have enjoyed her all along, this new cd is an reward, though it barely whets our appetite (I'm greedy, I want a 14 song cd!). However, the songs she gives us are good and show us all that Cyndi still has what it takes to give us good music. \\"Madonna Whore\\" (and no, she is not referring to Ms. Ciccone) and \\"The Water's Edge\\" are my two favorites on this EP. Cyndi delivers time after time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Music","review":"Cyndi's voice is so strong and beautiful!! Her voice & songs are gems in the world of bad over-produced songs.

This would be fine if it sounded like the music were written to fit the words, but I think the result would have been equal or better if she had pulled a random book off a shelf and read it to the music. The London sessions are better, since the instrument tracks are engineered to mask most of the flaws in the vocal track. Even so, the replay value is minimal -- there are only a couple songs that I would want to hear again.

Amazon offered the most competitive price and it was delivered the second business day. I am very happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy","review":"In a word this item is \\"buggy\\" and I gave up trying to figure it out. The connection gets dropped and buffers all key stroked and issues all the strokes when the connection is regained. I gave up and bought from the same brand but different item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid nagging issues for a keyboard this expensive","review":"The keyboard looks great (from the front). It seems pretty well built too. After reading the reviews, it looked good for HTPC usage. It's not really cut out for HTPC usage though.The problems I have with it are:1) Contantly looses connections from a distance of about 10 ft. I have to cycle the power 2-3 times to get a working connection again. An older RF Logitech wireless keyboard works just fine.2) With the device on it's dock, the computer will not sleep. Part of the allure (for me) for this device in use with a HTPC was to have a handy place the store the keyboard while not in use. Now I have to leave the keyboard lying around if I want the PC to be able to sleep.3) I have no idea why you would take a nice and sleek black/silver design, and put a horrible bright orange all over the back side.If the keyboard was 50$, I would have rated it 3-4 stars. At > 100$ I have a hard time giving it even the 2 stars I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing -- Lousy design, overpriced","review":"I've had one of these for about 6 months now, have been using with a media PC hooked up to the TV. I've found this keyboard fairly frustrating.Cons:1. Mouse buttons are poorly designed, of poor quality, difficult to press.2. Touchpad does not work well. No way to disable touch-to-select feature, so frequently end up selecting or moving objects that you didn't intend to.3. Sleep button is in the most illogical possible place. Right along the top edge of the keyboard where most people naturally grab the keyboard. Frequently inadvertently end up putting PC to sleep.4. Same goes for Bluetooth re-sync button. It's right along the middle top edge of the keyboard. Again, frequently end up accidently putting the keyboard in re-sync mode when picking it up. This requires logging into windows, starting the Bluetooth pairing utility and re-pairing the keyboard.Highly disappointed with this keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but provides no other Bluetooth services","review":"This is a great keyboard / touch pad. The range and battery life is good. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is that the bluetooth dongle provides no other services. Probably Logitech decided this way to make installation easier (and it is really a snap). However the Bluetooth standard was invented to provide a service that enables up to seven devices to connect to the PC via the dongle. For instance, if you have a bluetooth headset that you want to use with Skype, you are out of luck. You may try to connect the keyboard via a separately purchased dongle, but that did not work for me: Either the headset, or the keyboard worked, but not both at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but lacking some things","review":"Overall I do like this keyboard. The buttons are solid and it has a functional layout. As others have already said, it is lacking a numerical pad. Doesn't bother me much. I bought this keyboard for my PS3 and for use in my living room. So far, it has been working great. It hooked up right away without even loading the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laptop-like keyboard without laptop-like Numpad functions","review":"While this keyboard has sleek-looking hotness, it really isn't that good of a keyboard for home or office use. I find the Gyration keyboards to be much more functional, and the keyboard isn't as comfortable to use as my Thinkpad X-series keypad (and it's smaller).Cons:ExpensiveLack of functionalityControls don't work as expectedAlmost impossible to use when charging the batteryNot as comfortable as many other laptop keyboardsDid I mention it was expensive?Pros:Looks really nice on the desktopKeyboard will work before windows boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"I finally purchased this keyboard because of the good price after rebate. Unfortunately, after about 5 minutes of use the product failed. I fully charged the unit before use, and installed the software before using it. After about 3 minutes of use, the keyboard started turning off by itself. It would turn on when I clicked on the left mouse button, but turn off again. When I placed the unit on my lap, it kept turning off and on every second. Tried many times to troubleshoot. Now the battery light is flashing red when it's on the base. It does work when it's sitting in the base, but what good is that?? I did notice a little dent on the touchpad. A keyboard this expensive should have better quality control. I also feel that the keyboard could be packaged a bit better. The keyboard should be in the middle of the box, instead of being on top. Not too much protection for the keyboard, other than the box lid. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This keyboard is a great addition to any home theater setup. The built in mouse track is very convenient. I've tried several other alternatives and this one blows the others away. I have the USB receiver hooked up through a USB port, and the keyboard responds quickly. The mouse sensitivity takes a little getting use, but way better than having a stand alone mouse unit. This is an expensive unit but well worth the upgrade cost from competitors models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really worth the high price tag","review":"Truly a piece of art when displayed upon the recharging dock. The battery does seem to last forever, so in an effort to not hurt the bateery i keep the charging dock unpluged so i can still display the keyboard, but i dont have to have it needlessly be charging.

In that regard, it is fantastic. Everything works fine in Win7. I leave it on my coffee table sometimes for 2-3 weeks before it needs a recharge. While the price is high, if you're trying to build a sleek home theater setup, I'm sure you're already used to paying the premium price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent keyboard","review":"If you have an HTPC then this keyboard is a must. It works beautifully, the bluetooth works great and best of all it just looks damn beautiful. Many folks have commented on how great it looks. For a normal desktop setup it's still great. The keys feel just right as you type on them. This doesn't have a keypad though which should be noted for basic desktop use.The mouse or trackpad is the one thing that I hope to see improvement on for future iterations of this product. I can't complain too much because as of now I think this is the best mouse-keyboard combination on the market it's just that the trackpad (especially the scrolling) is not as much of a joy to use as the keyboard. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 star. I wanted to give it a 4.5 star cause this thing is almost perfect.All in all if you need a wireless keyboard and the lack of a keypad is not an issue for you then get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and thin","review":"I am a PC but envy Apple user's toys so I bought this keyboard.

While I love the looks of this keyboard, I don't necessarily want it to be the centerpiece of my desk while charging it. It's prominent enough by itself sitting as most keyboards should (flat).The quality is solid. Most keyboards with glossy black/acrylic materials look very cheap, however this keyboard reeks of luxury. The lights on the keyboard (orange!) are fantastic, and the multimedia functions on the side are great, which would make the keyboard useful for a media PC hooked up to the TV or projector.My girlfriend is using this keyboard right now and enjoys it. Key travel feels good, the spacing is standard so there are little issues there. Aside from the price being exorbitant, this is a great keyboard to say \\"Hey look at me, I'm fancy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The trackpad is pathetic. The ONLY marketing point for the purchase.THIS DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN ILLUMINATED KEYBOARD, REGARDLESS OF THE HOT KEYS. Battery Status key does not light or display at all.

The specialty scroll only worked vertically.Design is pretty, Bluetooth is nice.

There is a red light which comes on when charging. Tech support cannot define problem, and suggest return for an exchange. Therefore the product has to be returned. Rather than ship a new product, whereupon I would then use the existing shipping carton for the return of the defective product, Logitech has chosen not to support this method (different than most of the industry).

But after a year the Dinovo Edge would no longer hold a charge. A web search revealed that this is an ongoing problem. There seems to be no way to replace the battery... and it becomes useless fairly quickly. Contacting support is difficult and no answers were provided. The Logitech support forum has several entries on this issue with zero answers. That's really shameful that this thing, which contains many toxic elements, must be thrown in the garbage after a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb cordless keyboard","review":"I struggled with the Adesso cordless keyboard before finally admitting it is a flawed product that really doesn't work - period.Yes, the Logitech diNovo is pricey, but it's good.

I bought it because I was tired of sticking keys and flimsy-feeling key action in other (including other Logitech) keyboards. The key action on the diNovo is a dream. The touch sensitive volume control is also nice, and easy to use. I haven't used the touchpad much, but it also seems to work well. My only criticisms are that there is no number pad, and the glossy black finish, while beautiful, shows fingerprints after every use. I have cut a small strip of clear screen protector material to put in the area most prone to thumb prints, below the space bar, and that helps. Otherwise, keep the cleaning cloth that is supplied handy. Overall, this is a great keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome with one Fatal Flaw","review":"I would have given this 5 stars in a heart beat, but right before writing this review i went to get something off my keyboard and learned that this thing has no protection.. with just my fingernail i permanently ruined my keyboard.

Of the keyboards out there with an integrated touchpad, this one is clearly one of the best. The scrolling function on the touchpad is especially well implemented.

Oh, the software lacks some features / options to that I think should be standard, especially if you use it with other Logitech bluetooth devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this keyboard - one quirk","review":"This is a very nice keyboard that has the added advantage of having the touchpad built in so you don't need a mouse. I use it with my media center PC and it has great range. Compared to the IR keyboards the range is much further, I would say ten times as far. The only bother is the battery indicator light looks half full, even when full.

It was my home theater/server wireless keyboard. It's comfortable to use and works well. Unfortunately, as I recently discovered, if you lose or damage the charging base your keyboard becomes worthless.

I plugged the device into another computer to check if it was indeed a hardware issue for such a new device. Indeed, this was the case. In addition to receiving a faulty product, Logitech customer service was poor and would not honor their warranty.I will instead purchase a Apple magic trackpad and Apple wireless keyboard for my HTPC. If I have to boot to bios then I will use my 8 dollar wireless mouse and keyboard, which has working up and right arrow keys : )I will not purchase from Logitech again due to their poor customer service.Note: If the product was not defective I would have rated it 4 stars. -1 star for the track disc/mouse being uncomfortable to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"diNovo Keyboard","review":"Logitech has made another great product and works great if you have limited space to work with and do not use the standard numerical keys on the right of standard keyboards.

I think this is only because they don't have 'Vista' supported software for it yet. The install that comes with the disk runs on Vista, and you can configure all the keyboard keys and mouse (with the exception of the touch volume).I'll have to see if the software (that should be out on Jan 30) that comes with Vista will fix this or not.All around the best keyboard I have seen or owned for MCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I need to re-connect again and again????","review":"DiNovo costed me a lot and works fine if it is connected.

But for most of us who want to use it from a distance 2-5 meters, it will constantly stop responding and/or disconnect.You can fix this, if you are ready to spend another $30 on a class-1 Bluetooth adapter. I have tried Cirago (with toshiba driver) but it didn't work very well.The one I have found to work the best is Anycom USB-550 (with broadcom chipset, which is the one originally used in Logitech adapter).

Product is no longer in production","review":"The product initially worked fine but it wouldn't charge. So after the initial charge depleted it no longer was of use. The issue was with the charging unit... the charging connection points would not align with the equivalent on the keyboard. This appeared to be largely due to poor design with the charging stand. I called Logitech and they told me that unit was no longer in production and they could not replace like for like. They offered me a unit that retailed for $60 less. I declined and took the full refund option from Amazon instead.Shame all round because the diNovo Edge keyboard was very slick and I would have loved to have kept it. The stand up charging mechanism was a neat idea in principle but failed in execution for me. It would have been nice to at least have another charging option. I suspect that Logitech abandoned this design concept after determining these and similar issues in production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully designed","review":"This is a very sleek, low profile keyboard.

There isn't enough room for a full-sized keyboard and a mouse. I finally found this and it suits my purposes wonderfully. A short time after, I purchased a 30-in wide monitor for a different PC in the same room - my gaming PC, where I'm usually sitting on a small sofa. Having a keyboard on my lap was fine but a mouse on the sofa beside me, not so good. I liked how this keyboard was working at my desk so I purchased another.My only complaint is that I should be able to set the pressure setting for the touchpad. Every laptop that uses a touchpad has software that allows you to control the pressure and this one needs it as my tapping is clearly too soft for the default settings. Other than that this works like a charm. Even having it on all day and working, I don't need to charge it more than every couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with Windows 7","review":"I know this may be a concern for some of the people purchasing this keyboard, so I want to let you know that it works as expected with Windows 7.

I needed a keyboard with a keypad so I bought a Logitech since I have very good experience with other devices. However this keyboard caused me more trouble than any other gadget I have had. First, the unit I first used had some sync problems, but Logitech exchanged me with another one. After using some time, it started with some battery issues, it does not charge anymore and the battery indicator does not surpasses 10%, so I have only 15 minutes of use before charging again. This time, Logitech support is not responding my questions, so I am very upset with their service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Unifying","review":"Logitech's Dinovo Edge product should no longer be for sale, unless you're into buying outdated stuff.I own one one of these. Be careful. This keyboard is NOT compatible with Logitech's new unifying receiver technology so you will lose a USB port if you don't have bluetooth built in. My experience with built in bluetooth wasn't that great either... the accompanying bluetooth USB receiver was much more reliable (but huge in comparison to a unifying receiver).I do own a Logitech wireless mouse that uses the unifying technology. The receiver usurps a USB port, but is very unobtrusive (tiny), reliable, and compatible with up to 6 unifying devices simultaneously.Look for a unifying compatible keyboard instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"died after 5 months","review":"This is an editted review.

It gives you an excellent idea of how much he achieved musically in the 1980's before his albums, Hombre del traje gris and Hotel, dulce hotel (which were huge late 80's successes). In this live performance, Joaquin summoned the help of some great Spanish artists to appear as special guests for particular songs. In the song \\"Adios, adios\\" Javier Gurruchaga appears as a special guest, singing in his quirky and comedic manner. In \\"Pongamos que hablo de Joaquin\\", singer-songwriter Luis Eduardo Aute appears singing a tribute to his friend, Joaquin, a touching moment! And in \\"Hay Mujeres\\" you have Ricardo Solfa singing in his mortician sounding voice, quite charming and a real kick to listen to. Hey this is one of the best live albums coming from any country, so go out and be generous to yourself and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"This is Maiden's best release since Powerslave.

Bruce sounds much better vocally than he did on their previous, his voice recovered a lot. It's faster and more energetic also, their age shows less. It's harder to tell that the band's over 20 years old. Reminds me of Powerslave, especially on Wildest Dreams. I don't know what they did but it sounds like their young again, doesn't sound like they're in their mid-life. It's a little different, synthesizer in a few songs and it's very progressive. Dance of Death is an underestimated album, definitely a must have and it's a modern classic to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Quit","review":"If Iron Maiden is the only band you listen to, and you worship them like the 'emperor's new clothes' then you will love this album. However, if you are intelligent you should be able to realize that there's nothing special here. Just another cookie-cutter Maiden album. It's basically just as good as BRAVE NEW WORLD, except now the excitement has worn off that Bruce is back.'Rainmaker' is an OK song, except the German band Vanden Plas put out a song with the same name on their album, THE GOD THING. The Vanden Plas song is much better. The title track is also worthy of being played at concerts, but the band is pretty much running on vapors at this point. I don't understand why they don't get rid of Janick Gers and start putting out the kind of music we hear on Bruce's solo records. Is Steve Harris's ego really that big?I don't even know why I bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"this is not as good as brave new world. it is very repetitive. too many songs sound like the ones from last album. don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good songs, but not nearly enough to call it a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money!!!","review":"What a joke.I was waiting 3 years for the new album and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Bruce has lost his voice, probably from too much touring after Brave New World. Brave New World is an excellent album - a true comeback. Dance with Death is not even close to be in the same league.There are five albums with 5 stars: Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, 7 Son of the 7 Son and Brave New World."},{"rating":"1","title":"dance of mediocrity","review":"Yes, i am a huge maiden fan and always will be, but i am also honest.this album is nowhere near as good as \\"brave new world.\\"it does have a few good moments, like all maiden albums(they don't write a bad album), but the album is mostly filler.the first 4 songs could all be combined into one, because the riffs and time signatures are all the same.on the title track, the music is quite good, but the strings are so loud in the mix, it sounds more like jethro tull then maiden.lastly, bruce needs to rest his voice a bit more, because this album shows a very weary voice.I'm sure the tour will be quite fun, and the live songs are always better than the album versions, but this album should not have been rushed to print.maiden should really take more time recording. it shows in the lyrics and in the music. this is a 2 star maiden album, but hey! they had a great 25 years didn't they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You suck if you do not like this album!

Some of the choruses are plain awful - 'No more Liiiieeeees' repeated ad nauseum is just one example. And the cover art is easily the worst of any Iron Maiden album...by far. I seriously think there is one good album in this album and 'A Matter of Life and Death'. Bruce's voice is increasingly being lost in these muddy mixes too. Time for a rethink Mr. Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up the Irons!","review":"Hello everyone. If you like Iron Maiden, you'll like this.

I was in seventh grade when I road my bike to Buzzard's Nest Records in Columbus, Ohio to buy Piece of Mind. Iron Maiden was incredibly awesome in their day. However, that day has long since gone. This album is entirely stale. Even my hero Bruce Dickinson sounds tired, especially compared to his brilliant Chemical Wedding, which was only a couple of years ago. There's just something about heavy metal bands: when they get old, the magic goes and they get stale. They should have retired years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GOOD","review":"Big Maiden fan!

Get the new Iced Earth if you want some good ol Metal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another slow Maiden record ....","review":"ANY band that has lasted 30+ years will have some good albums and some weak ones. Dance of Death is not bad; it is just a very, very, VERY weak effort. All the songs are weak and slow. And the album (which I have listened to over and over again) never really picks up.. before you know it, you have reached the last song.It is really a disappointment. \\"Brand New World\\" was just okay. Dance of Death is filled with slow songs that are incredibly forgettable. There is nothing powerful or special about it. It's not that Dance of Death is a BAD album; it is just very weak. There is nothing really interesting other than the last track Journeyman with its different acoustic vibe.Being a fan of Iron Maiden since the \\"Killers\\" album I always await a new Maiden album with great anticipation. It is great to see this amazing band still making records and touring. But Dance of Death is a very weak effort. But don't take my word for it. Listen to it yourself and judge.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I understand every band has sepford fans, but maidens is the worst. anyone who thinks dance of death stands up to powerslave, or piece of mind is a true stepford!.....Even maiden themselves say their heyday was the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gak","review":"If it weren't Maiden, it would be one star, believe me. I have been listening to Maiden since the first album came out, learned to play bass listening to Steve Harris. I love the band.This is just awful. Nothing, but nothing inspires me on this album at all. It's not worth delving into details about the specific reasons I don't like this album; it's just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maiden lost","review":"The last fun song Maiden wrote was Holy Smoke on No Prayer for the Dying. Their albums in the 80's were fun. All songs sounded differently and you could sing along and enjoy the whole album. This album is boring. Theres no great melodic chorus to enjoy like Can I play with Madness, and theres no triplet beats like The Trooper or Somewhere in Time. Sad to say, but maybe theyve exhausted their creative effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constant change makes for good music","review":"OK, folks, it's not Powerslave and it's not Somewhere in Time. They are still Iron Maiden, though, and it still sounds freakin' awesome. 'Paschendale' is reminiscent of 'Seventh Son' and you almost can smell the mustard gas as it crawls toward the hapless souls in the trenches. I actually hated the first single 'Wildest Dreams' when I first heard it on the radio, but it is actually growning on me. The second tune on the album (can't recall the name) is pretty blistering, and the rest of the album provides a nice mix of music. Some people don't like the three guitar attack, but I personally think it just adds a layer of depth to an already deep band."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of \\"dance music!\\"","review":"This disc has got songs on it -- like Montsegur, New Frontier, Paschendale -- that ought to put a big grin on the face of any Maiden fan. The three-guitar mix sounds fantastic, big and clear; Bruce is in great form; songs range from short & punchy to the orchestrated epics. I'm a long-time fan who was disappointed with the 90s stuff, but BNW recharged my love of the band and DoD continues the upward trend. Time will tell, I suppose, but I really believe that the best tracks on this disc will assume a place right alongside the \\"classics\\" of the Maiden canon. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Named after Janick's stage antics, perhaps???","review":"More overblown, pseudo-cerebral garbage from the Sergeant Major, with those terribly repetitive choruses. That's how you know it's a Steve Harris song: by how the chorus repeats several useless times. And it's even Co-produced by none other than Steve Harris! Hey, when is Steve going to start doing the cover art as well? HIS band can sure use help in that department, as the cover art has been getting worse and worse as time goes on. Unfortunately, there are still a whole lot of sheep out there that'll trick themselves into thinking this is great stuff; that have been so brainwashed by the gimmicks and hype that anything put in front of them is greedily consumed. But until something's done about that worn-out-his-welcome, spastic, prancing 3rd guitarist, I'm not going to bother with this stuff. Hey, Adrian is back now, so you can leave. I think Blaze needs a writing partner....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden Mania","review":"Not the best album by Iron Maiden but the best album since Powerslave.

The latest Iron Maiden record brings the same punch and power from previous recordings but with the fresh melodies of 18 guitar strings that provide the tunes with a more elaborate sound.Truly refreshing, the first song ever co-written by Nicko McBrain, \\"New Frontier\\" has that characteristic \\"old-new\\" mixture of the 21st century Maiden, as well as the epic \\"Monts��gur\\".Great album for Iron Maiden fans, keep it up Bruce, Steve, Jannick, Adrian, Nicko and Dave.

For the last two albums, IM has used a writing style of repetition. It's pretty annoying when they repeat the same line ten times in a row. That's how they get their songs to eight minutes. DoD and The Journeyman are excellent. One is a pretty intricate piece that shows that Nicko can still drum. The Journeyman is an acoustic affair and their best one since Drifter.Buy the album, but it's not worth more than a discounted price or used.

It is great to see the old crew from Piece of Mind and Powerslave back, and Janick Gers (added for Fear of the Dark) is still on-board giving Iron Maiden 3 axe-men. All of the songs harken back to 80s and early 90s hard rock and the narrative-style lyrics sung by the incomporable Bruce Dickinson coupled with the flowing guitar melodies from Smith, Murray, and Gers make for some very memorable songs. Listen to Rainmaker, Montsegur, Paschendale. These are great songs! A Maiden fan starving for nostalgia will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"more of this please!","review":"It is almost unbelievable to me that after the fantastic return album IM came out with another one. This is great since it entails me going out and buy new music since releases from all other new rock bands are only useful as coasters.One, three five years from now noone will remember grunge and all of the talentless filler produced by overpaid college kids punk-wannabe over the last 13 years (the worse ever period for rock music).This album is not a 5 , but it is certainly a 4. Classic maiden style tracks. Given the times we live in, this is 4 stars material by default. Thanks guys for producing new music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This disc is not bad. Not at all!","review":"Iron Maiden is back again. Well, after some listening I have to say that I like that! Almost. The main problem is the sound which I simply hate. Even back in 1960's records had better sound and it's 21st century now... It's not only engineering, it's actually whole producing process, I suppose. I agree completely with one fellow reviewer who asked: Where is Martin Birch when he's so needed?Songs itself are OK. I love the title track and Paschendale! True, you find nothing glittering or extremely new here but I do like these tracks, bit oldfashioned as they are. This is unquestionably Iron Maiden and sometimes it's good to find that not everything in this world won't change so easy. Is it my nostalgia (I've been fan since Powerslave, so it's almost 20 years now :-) or something else, I don't know. But I do know that in nearer future I will definitely listen this disk a lot.So, in a word, this disc is not bad. Not at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Hear Bruce...","review":"DOD's music, to me, sounds great as usual, but I have always enjoyed the way the songs told stories. It doesn't seem the vocals were mixed well either...I can barely hear Bruce! Hard to follow the song without hearing the vocals well.

Maybe like an earlier review, I will keep playing it and maybe warm up to it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"best since seventh son","review":"all i can say is wow. they really used the 3 guitars well on this album more than on brave new world. maiden is starting to mature in their song writing ability you can really see this on paschendale and monstegur. if you havent liked maiden since the 80s i recommend trying this album, it ranks up there with the best of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"More adventurous than Brave New World","review":"This album will always be compared to the one that came before it. But it shouldn't be.Maiden are in good form here and there is a freshness to their sound.The best cuts are the title track and Paschendale. The chorus on No More Lies kind of ruins the mood a little (comes in too heavy too soon) and Montsegur rams the point a home a little too many times.At times they are teetering on becoming a little too Spinal Tappish (I could almost see the Leprachauns dancing around stonehenge on the title track)- But - and this is the importnat point - Iron Maiden are in on the little joke - there's some humour here about what they are doing - and dare I say - a lightness of touch, like they're not taking themselves too seriously. And that's what makes this CD enjoyable. They sound like they're having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god whats this??","review":"Im 27 years old,im listening to Maiden since i was like 16...this is by far the worst Maiden album ever,even more (i can't believe im saying this)then the ones with Blaze....every Maiden album since i was 16 the first time i heard a song it was clicking right away..the moment i knew this Dance of Death isn't clicking i gave it another try...still nothing....the sound is good,guitars are awesome....but the songs themselves just su**..and what is this last track?? oh my god!!! sounds like a slow song from a Dickinson solo projects.awful album!Better wait another 3 years.Up the Irons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sound for an old band","review":"Do you like early Agent Steel? do you like the first stuff from the Bay Area bands? The production of that albums are the worst, but I love that albums because of their music. Maybe the last Iron Maiden album is not the best production you can find. Maybe they miss Martin Birch, but the music is still great. All songs are very well executed, the guitars, the bass and the drums sounds like their livin' their best days of their lifes. Bruce's performance on stage is really amazing, and the quality of composition are the best. 10/10 for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Maiden Fan","review":"I just bought the new Maiden CD \\"Dance of Death\\". I was a bit hesitant to buy it, but gave it a shot. Well, I am extremely disappointed in their latest effort. I am 33 and have been a Maiden fan since I was 12. I loved everything from the first self entitled Maiden up through Somewhere in Time, (the 7th sign is weak). I even gave No Prayer a chance, it was good except Bring your daughter to the slaughter was crap. Like all Maiden fans I was ecstatic about the semi-original lineup getting together to put out Brave New World. It was pretty good, but nothing to freak out about. But the new CD \\"Dance of Death\\" is their worst effort possible. Weak song writting is the problem. The music is not too bad, but the songs are about what? And they all sound the same. Maiden is about heavy music with a heavy message. It's not supposed to be nice. When thet lost their dark edge, they lost me. Sorry fellow Maiden fans, but somebody had to say it, \\"THIS ALBUM STINKS\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"who made the cover? they should punished severly","review":"i've never listened to this cd but man, that has to be about the worst album cover i have ever laid eyes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maidens WORST album","review":"After reading some of the positive reviews and then listening to the CD i am very, very confused.

Can't wait to see the boys at OZZFEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Life And Death","review":"I was really bored with the Life and Death disc as it only had 2 interesting songs. On this one I only enjoyed 1 track. Instant buy & resell disc. I can't take Maiden any more. It's clear they just don't have a good work ethic. They've gotten too lazy, or brain-damaged to know you can't play the same freakin' power chords for 100 years without someone telling the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"SImply Amazing- THE BEST MAIDEN YET","review":"I cannot emphasize how FABULOUS this album is. After the so-so offering that was Brave New World, the boys from Britain come back with a masterpiece. Dickinson, now approaching his 48th bday, has a voice that can make me cry at times. The incredible riffs and guitar solos from guitar god Janick Gers supplement Dickinsons's voice perfectly. This album is pure perfection, a must have for any rock fan or any genre, be it soft rock or heavy metal. This is the best 13 dollars i have ever spend and probably will spend in the future. I cannot stress how good this album is. Fav songs: Rainmaker(beautiful melody and purely poetic lyrics), Montsegur(incredible lyrics and a sick solo), and the 8 minute heart-wrenching Dance of Death; the peak comes at a 3.5 min solo which makes you want to cry with envy when you realize you will NEVER be as good as Gers.Get this cd now. If there was a 10 star rating this album would get it. Album of the year, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend Continues.. Maiden forever","review":"This CD is incredible, If you are a Maiden Fan, this is a must have, it combines every aspect of Maidens long illustrious career. Most of the songs are 6 minutes longer or greater which I feel gives all three guitarists a chance to stretch it out and show the different skills of each guitarist. This CD is produced by Kevin Shirley of Dream Theater fame, He also Produced \\"Brave New World\\" He did a great job on it, and has extended that run with this CD, It is very well recorded. Great writing, Great music, Legendary Band, I'm biased though, I'm a huge Maiden Maniac, Maiden Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn everything between POWERSLAVE and this!!!","review":"From the first chord, this is a true return to form for Maiden.I'm talking Piece of Mind form. But there's a little something more to Dance of Death. You know how even the best Maiden albums were a little on the clean side production wise. Well this record effing crunches with the best of them - think Black Label Society's 1919 Eternal. Classic Maiden, improved production...UP THE IRONS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glimpses of genius","review":"The album is typical maiden music except for 4 songs.Montsegur - The chorus is classical sounding. The way the melody changes from minor to major scale is amazing in this song. But the intro is directly taken from the fallen angel.Dance of Death - Ah, Dance of death. What a song. Unbeleivably beautiful. It conjures up in your mind visions of a forgotten land where all legends and dreams come true. The best maiden song.Paschendale - It is different in the sense there is lots of tempo changes. But it seems too fragmented to sound good.Journeyman - The keyboards are liberously used here. You can hardly hear the guitars on this one. A departure from the heavy riff laden maiden. A very good song to end it.The other songs are pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Iron Maiden.Buy it for Dance of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for your Maiden libary","review":"Dance of Death, Pashendale, Journeyman, on and on, if you have never heard Iron Maiden play Journeyman you are missing one of their best songs, and it's unplugged!"},{"rating":"2","title":"some of the maiden's best","review":"This album has fully restored my faith in the band. After hearing the boners of the Blaze days, I was very cautious. I had been a faithful fan up until then and felt abandoned when they put out a pair of mediocre albums. After a successful album in Brave New World, I wondered if lightning could strike twice. I had heard from so many places that Dance of Death was no good, so I actually held off until May '05 to buy it.What a chump I was! I missed out until recently on some of their best work. It's so reminiscent of their early work, yet melded with their new sound. So many songs are of the Icarus/Invaders/Trooper/ calibre with the sonic power of 7th Son. Sorry, but people asking for Maiden to change are just looking for someone to put out another stinker like St. Anger. As long as the boys from the Beast are putting out albums of this quality I'll be buying them on the release day from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAIDEN IS SIMPLY THE BEST","review":"I have been a hardcore fan since 88, so don't expect my review to be objective, 'cause I'm not when it comes to a Maiden release. What I can say is that Maiden is an honest band that will never put anything in the market just to please the mainstream-media standards, just as others band do. This album is sophisticated and with great lyrics on it, especially Paschendale, a song that puts Adrian as an excellent guitarist and songwriter. Title track is also a great tune, and Age of Innocence and Face in the Sand are innovative, not to mention Journeyman, a fine piece of art in which you can clearly sense Bruce's contribution. All in all this is an enormous release by the world's greatest metal maestros. VIVA MAIDEN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance of Death","review":"Iron Maiden Rules! After Brave New world, this album does'nt do justice to the fans. B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"My god","review":"This sounds like Manowar and Queensryche got together on a Saturday afternoon, drank way too much, pushed the record button, and started jamming. If that is your idea of a great album, then go ahead and buy it. I'm getting rid of this junk ASAP. Paschendale sounds like a ridiculous Tenacious D song - Bruce even sounds like Jack Black on it for christ's sake! Journeyman? Please - it is total crap. The title track is ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS. Compared to Bruce's solo recordings Accident of Birth, and The Chemical Wedding, this is a MAJOR step backward. Those two albums are amazing - this one, is disgracing.It makes me sad to have to write something like that, but this album is just so awful. DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS THAT GIVE THIS 5 STARS. IF YOU ARE A LONGTIME, HARDCORE MAIDEN FAN, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS. NO WAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRON MEDIOCRITY","review":"This may be the most mediocre of all the Maiden albums . I like the fact that they stick to thier guns , but at this point Bruce Dickinson's solo albums blow this stuff away ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Maiden - As brilliant as ever","review":"Iron Maiden's new release, \\"Dance of Death\\" is nothing short of brilliant!! It's absolutely fantastic to have a metal band that still can rock as hard and write as brilliantly as ever. Not a lot of those around these days. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to those that take their metal VERY SERIOUSLY. You will not be disappointed! Up the Irons!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD from the Metal Masters","review":"This release is melodic. The three guitarists deliver tight and cohesive solos, and Bruce's voice is always awesome; it's more melodic and less edgy these days. My criticism is that it lacks that punch that metal delivers. The punch that comes from a solid pounding drumbeat. The drums aren't as clear and present on this one the way they were on \\"Brave New World\\", and that's the only reason I give this release 4 stars. Otherwise, it would be a 5. It's not as aggressive drumming as \\"Fear of the Dark\\" or even their earlier releases, or maybe I just can't hear it because the production isn't there to highlight it.Nevertheless, a great CD that every Maiden fan will enjoy and appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad But Not Great","review":"Don't get me wrong it's maiden just seems like they have ran out of ideas the good about maiden is there just damn interesting to listento so thats what makes so fun but i expected a bit better and some more originallity on the songs but still a buy for the maiden fans like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album","review":"Nice work. Some of the songs could have used some editing -- the choruses are repeated a few too many times. But overall, these guys are professionals and the songs generally rock. My favorites are Rainmaker, Paschendale and Montsegur. Maiden's best album since Seventh Son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, poor sound...","review":"The songs on this disc remind me of the Blaze Baily discs. Good edge, tempos, etc. The Title track is also remeniscent of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. The mix, however, is not good at all. The drums are faint, no deep bass drum nor clear snare or cymbels. Steve's bass is also muddier than in albums past. once you get over these problems, this is still classic Maiden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Maiden Is BACK!","review":"What can I say? The Mighty Maiden has done it again. \\"Dance Of Death\\" is simply put a \\"classic.\\" The songs \\"Dance Of Death\\", Paschendale\\", and \\"Montsegur\\" are epic classics. Every song top to bottom is amazing. This album is remeniscent of old Maiden material. This is what metal is supposed to be. Heavy! Blazing guitars, pounding drums, and the soaring vocals,of the one and only, Bruce Dickinson. It doesn't get better than that. Buy the album you will definetly will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the first time ever, Bruce's voice is the weakest part.","review":"For the first time in an Iron Maiden album, Bruce Dickinson's voice is sounding annoying. Going all the time for the high notes, even sometimes seeming out of tune, his voice is really wrecked this time. He seems to be fighting all the time with his vocal chords. It's totally strange, because in Brave New World and in the subsequent tour he was close to perfection.The songs are, generally speaking, very good. I only have serious restrictions about two songs: Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier. Absolute fillers, both of them.The production is muddy, that's for sure, like you this term or not. Worse than in Brave New World. Dont'know what happened. Nicko McBrain is also \\"sleepy\\" here, his drumming is without inspiration or even attempting to make something great.IRON MAIDEN is one of the last true rock bands of the world. They have purpose and respect their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave New World already explored","review":"This album sounds almost exactly like Brave New World.Long Gone is the creative Cover Art.Gone is the hard sounding edge from the 80's.Long gone is the high effort they put into recordings.Long gone is the high quality writing, power guitar solo's.Long gone is the 'Great' Iron Maiden.I am hugely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Maiden has only one flaw..","review":"Amongst all the reviews and opinions, one thing must be saida: the only trouble holding Maiden back in the compositional skills has a name: Janick Gers, a mediocre, talentless guitarist that, unfortunately, seems to have infected both Murray and Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up from hallucination.","review":"Dance of Death is the worst Iron Maiden album ever !It's even worse than Blaze era.My god, Bruce's last 2 solo albums (Accident of Birth / Chemical Wedding) are million times better than this cd.What is Iron Maiden's problem ?Also it's one of the most boring heavy metal album of the year.Bottom line = DoD is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME","review":"AFTER THE SUCCESS OF EVERY SONG ROCKING ON BRAVE NEW WORLD,DANCE OF DEATH KILLS THAT PROGRESS WITH EVERY SONG SUCKING.IT'S GETTING TO REPETITIVE!BRING BACK BLAZE!-REVIEW WRITTEN BY EDWARD THE GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please help stop the pain & suffering","review":"Why, Iron Maiden, why are you still here?

My 13-year old son has just found an interest in IM. I think that is so cool. I can hand him an IM cd and I know what he is listening to. It is real music with real, legitimate lyrics that actually have some meaning and depth. I have been a fan of IM since Number of the Beast. I am not of the MTV Gen any longer. The only way I know they have released another album is to go to the website and check. I believe in supporting the band and their efforts.

I like it better than BNW,cause it simply rocks harder and has more up-tempo tunes!Easily on of the best Metal -albums this year,and Maiden still belong to Metals greatest,even although they seem to be past their prime ,their star still shines brighter than that of most of the newer Metal-Bands!Well done,good old Maiden!Up the irons!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up the Irons","review":"After languishing for three years, the new Iron Maiden album finally was released and I couldn't be happier. After hearing the first single \\"Wildest Dreams\\" a month ago, I was a little disappointed and wary of the new album. The song was not bad, but was pretty lackluster as far as first album singles go. But once I popped in the disc, I found myself to be quite happy with the results. I compare the CD very favorably to the last release \\"Brave New World\\" in that the band keeps exploring new ways to transform their music. Highlights include the hard rocking \\"Montsegur\\", the eery title track \\"Dance of Death\\", the catchy chorus of \\"New Frontier\\" and probably the most memorable track on the album \\"Paschendale\\". I give this album only 4 stars because I literally bought it today and have only listened through it twice, but I can definitely see it growing on me tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good!","review":"i have to say right off the bat that this album was well worth the wait. I also have to say that the more i listen to it the more it grows on me! some of the songs are maiden at their finest (ala PASCHENDALE, DANCE OF DEATH (title track), and RAINMAKER my fav from the album). However there are filler songs that could have been b sides.... it seems in certain songs like GATES OF TOMOROW that they were trying a little too hard and were less inspired songs than the preceding album BRAVE NEW WORLD where just about every song had a fresh classic sound to it... don't get me wrong though! most of the songs on this album are pretty darn good and are worth the price of the cd alone. up the irons!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since reunion","review":"Incredible album and I must say their best since the reunion. Has more quality tracks than brave new world and doesn't have an excessive amount of long epics that plague the latest 2 albums. Montsegur, rainmaker and paschendale are absolute classics.

So here it is... Maiden's attempt to produce a new \\"Brave New World\\". This is more interesting than the latter because it is more adventurous but still badly over-produced.

However, not much else is positive for this game. I'm not a big fan of the playcalling menus. Too hard to tell what's going on from the play illustration, especially on the defensive side. I also don't like how you can't pan out to see the receivers when you are controlling an LB or DB on defense like you could in the old Dreamcast versions. This makes it virtually impossible to play a corner and difficult to play an OLB in coverage. Also annoying is the vertical leraning curve between walk-on and starter difficulty. It is easy to win 80-0 in walk-on, and then play the same team in starter and lose 20-7. From what I can tell, all raising the difficulty does is make your receivers drop every pass coming their way if there is a defender within 5 yds, while not affecting the computer at all. This game is a real disappointment, as I love the older Dreamcast editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Football game...?","review":"I prefer NFL 2k3. Last years NCAA was terrible.

Half of the playtime is spent retracing the steps of the first game and killing the same monsters. The fighting is just as fun and satisfying, but for some reason, the collection of souls (which if you don't know, levels-up your character) is very tedious--battling these same enemies and recycled bosses quickly becomes boring.There is an attempt to make the game more dynamic by including the exchange of \\"gifts\\". These are items you buy or find and give to other characters for rewards. These rewards can be more gifts to give away, or health items and weaponry, but in the end, this process seems like a drawn-out way of getting the much needed health-boosts and extra items that are in very short supply throughout the game. You also get a lot of junk.At the very least, this is a nice distraction if you're sitting at home and wanting to veg out, but I suggest that you rent or buy it instead of paying full-price."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgettable sequel to onimusha","review":"i loved onimusha. i hated onimusha 2. an utter waste of time and money, and i bought it for only 9.99. when i got to the final boss battle, i couldn't help but think 'this is it?' then i tried beating nobunaga a half dozen times or so, but couldnt since i used all my healing items and magic replenishers going into the purple phantom realm. if i had known that the final boss was right after i would have skipped it and whipped him good. so i finished the purple phantom realm and was hurt irreparably and only got some dinky sword. what a tur%. since i completed the whole game on normal i wasn't about to drop to easy mode just to beat the last boss. so i tossed the cd-rom in the garbage, something i had thought about doing quite a few times before as the game never started, and never really got going. a game without a soul. but there were a couple of pretty places with some nice graphics, that is the only positive.avoid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Onimusha 2","review":"Onimusha 2 is very fun....The gameplay is very good and has a few add-ons unlike its predocessor,like the mode called Onimusha where one has to get 5 white orbs to become an onimush for way too short of a time.The garaphics are insane and I only saw one flaw in the graphics..The controls are very easy and don't take that long to get used to..The story is cool and is mostly the same as Onimusha...The new weapons I think are better and funner and stronger than the ones from the first Onimusha.The game is a little longer than the first and can take up to 14 hours if your an ameteour(no offense).I reccomend buying this game if you liked the first and if you like adventure or RPG games."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT game to play on the ( PLAYSTATION 2 )","review":"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny EXCELLENT game to play on the Sony Playstation 2 game consoleI give it 5 Stars \\"Highly Recommended\\" Really WORTH IT TO BUY AND PLAY this game on Sony Playstation 2 game console"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad game review","review":"I have played many ps 2 games and this is bad.

Neil simply murders Elton John's \\"Rocketman\\" in a manner reminiscent of Shatner's \\"Lucy In The Sky\\".

This is just terrible, don't bother with this box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE OF THE SAME RE-PACKAGED","review":"I am a long time Neil Diamond fan. On the other hand, I find the release of this box set insulting to fans. Neil has released since 1992, no less than seven box sets with essentially the same songs on them. Sure a few new live cuts are in this collection, but they are the SAME songs.This is a rip off and Neil is not the only one doing this. They package together the same old songs, put a few new versions in, and rip the diehard fan off.Sadly, Neil Diamond is a shell of what he once was. It is pathetic the way his geriatric fans continue to act like he is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of ND ever WOW","review":"See I have been a ND fan since I was 5 years of age and Now being 35 I know his music and love most of everything he does.

And I especially love that my dogs both love these treats! My lab will eat almost anything, but she dances for these. And my 17-year old dog who has trouble chewing anything tougher than mush can eat these. If there's anything I don't love about these jerky treats, it's the slightly fishy aroma, but I don't consider the aroma over-powering at all.At first, I was a bit put off by the price, but these are definitely worth the cost.

Some sales were underlined in Real Estate, but not enough to focus on. But, I will say I was going in looking for an outline to follow and did not receive it!

The book's content seems excellent so far - I'm about 1/5 of the way in - but there are many distracting errors and omissions in the Kindle version.

And wherever one of these charts appears, the text that flows around it seems to disappear - sentences are not finished and ideas are fragmented, leaving you to wonder what is missing and to waste time trying to piece together the phrasing to get the gist.

The book is clearly written and an enjoyable read for someone who left high school mathematics behind a long time ago, but the Kindle version has some problems:1 The formulae are printed in a less dense font than the main text, and are quite hard to read;2The formulae need to be editted by a mathematically literate editor, as there are many errors, which confuse the reader. For instance there are many cases where dy/dx is written dyldx, or both ways on the same line, and several cases where a y has turned into a v. Cases also exist where the left bracket count doesn't equal the right bracket count.These are inexcusable editting failures in a mathematics book.

It is absolutely no fun whatsoever and will frsutrate everyone. I have played it throughouly and have to sell it due to the fact that I get so angry.The CPU will ALWAYS score tons of points until you get near perfect and learn tricks, but then its not like real football. When was the last time a linebacker had to cover WR with Safety and CB help EVERY play?? Exactly, the CPU also breaks tackles like its nobody's business, It took 3 linebackers (the Redskins ones!!) 2 DEs, a CB and a Safety to bring an RB down.So stay away at all costs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I rented this game and it's a disappointment. I really don't see why this game got rave reviews. The gameplay and the graphics are horrible. For instance, how they make you use the analog stick when you pick your offensive and defensive plays...if you push the analog stick up or down and let go, the cursor will come back to its original location. Another problem is when you try to move your defensive line guys to the left or right, he will move towards the line of scrimmage which may cause you to touch the offensive linemen. The player movement is very unnatural. There are so many problems that I can't even get to all of them. This is far from a bias opinion but Madden is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game stinks","review":"this is not worth 10.00 price the graphic stink and a waste of talent to be makeits a waste of time to play dont buy me instad bu madden 2004 better graphics this game sucks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then madden","review":"This is alot better than madden best franchise season ever I'm glad they don't do that mulligan [junk] (which I hate) and won't happen in the NFL. great gameplay and graphics and overall great buy and worth the time"},{"rating":"2","title":"NFL 2k3 = Madden 2003","review":"NFl 2k3 is very similar to madden 2003, if u hate madden then get nfl 2k3, if u hate espn then get madden.

Spoto might as well come out and say he can't stand the authority of the Church. He shouldn't call himself a catholic because he gives the rest of us a bad name. His understanding of the Eucharist is childish at the most and his discussion on the the Mother of God is rudimentary.

What authority does he have.Perhaps Mr. Spoto should read some of the reports of the secular doctors and scientists who studied the Shroud of Turin which prove using scientific methods and laws of science/nature that the man whom this shroud was wrapped around must have come back to life.I do not recomend a book filled with biased assumptions lacking any evidence whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"Dear Donald Spoto: you made it to the Marilyn DVD 'Diamonds Collection' with your MM biography statement....a bio which I would have bought until seeing your research on Jesus.

A work of grace dictated by Jesus during World War II to Maria Valtorta. Where THE story is told of anything unseen about Jesus you ever dreamed of.

Although the author doubts the historicity of the Virgin Birth and believes many of the tales are metaphors, he readily accepts the rest of the stories as factual accounts. He never questions their validity or authenticity. The following are two examples of his views: \\"We may indeed readily admit that nothing is impossible with God\\" and \\"It is only to the living and forever risen Lord that I direct my gaze.\\" This book adds nothing to the serious study of the New Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight, Pedantic","review":"For anyone with even a theological education, this book is lightweight garbage, poorly researched, very derivative of the work of legitimate scholars. I am a pastor who is always looking for more popular (and readable) works for my parishioners. I had hoped this would be one of those books because I certainly agree with Spoto's general approach to Jesus but I found it plodding and dreary.I would recommend Marcus Borg's \\"Meeting Jesus Again For the First Time,\\" the works of John Dominic Crossan, or Bishop John Shelby Spong's works for those who are looking for an unorthodox interpretation of the life of Jesus. I don't know if it's in print any longer but \\"For Christ's Sake\\" by Harpur (I think it was put out by Beacon Press) is a wonderful book. Spoto's work is going right in the give-away pile.And again, as a \\"Rev.

Nowhere near as entertaining or well done as the other three books. The book is set on an alien world that has been settled by a whole bunch of different alien races, and apparently it has all been done on the shonk, in general.Add in a mystery person and perhaps some ties to the other books, but this one needed some serious plot work to make it readable or make you want to go on with the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"I really enjoyed Brin's first trilogy and bought all three books for this series upfront. What a disapointment! This book was very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaves you hanging No Satisfaction Don't Bother","review":"This book spends over 700 pages leading up to a big climax that is not resolved unless you read the subsequent books.I usually don't review Bad books on Amazon but I was compelled to with this one. This book is just good enough to keep you reading and then it leaves you hanging by not resolving the cliff-hangers. It's as if in a cheep attempt to get you to read the rest of the books in the series they ripped out the last chapter and made it first chapter of the next book. This is 2nd rate science fiction at best and it doesn't even have any science in it. A very disappointing read. AVOID IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the story in thrice the volume","review":"If you're desperate to read this series, here's a shortcut: Read the first three pages of each chapter.For anyone who's read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", you'll recognize the tactic of hideous, layered repetition. Specifically, you'll note that Brin takes the liberty of summarizing The Entire Series again, and again, and again. There _are_ new ideas involved in these books, and that's why I'm handing out the second star, but comparing these to \\"Startide Rising\\" is like comparing \\"Family Matters\\" to \\"Friends\\".Buy the Cliff's Notes if you have to, or find an online summary, or just start with book three (which contains summaries of the important events in the first two). The whole series just isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bumpy start, but well worth the initial struggle.","review":"As with most colossal tales, the first book in any series can tend to be a bit confusing. However, as you read complacently along, Brin sneaks up behind you and before you know it, YOUR HOOKED! Likle an expert angler, Brin weaves a web of stories that appears baffling at first, but as the threads slowly join together, a story is woven that is staggering in it's majesty. I, for one had my breath quite taken away by the end of the book and could hardly restrain myself from bolting immediatly to my local book purveyor to purchase book two.The new uplift trilogy was well worth the wait. However, I don't recommend reading the previews of the next book at the end. I've found this only leads to unneccesary anguish if you don't have the next book close at hand. It's that addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloss, gloss, gloss!","review":"While this isn't quite as good as Startide Rising, this is one of the best books around. David Brin keeps you wondering what marvel of time and space will come next. The hardest choice you have to make about the book is which story line you like best, or do you like the vivid description of the sooner races? I liked the Dwer story personally. I couldn't put the book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book, slightly different than previous uplift","review":"Once the style of this book becomes familiar (numerous voices are used to describe the story, some of very alien nature), the action keeps going. Also, I liked the depth that David Brin brings to the book's characters. Proabably not as 'good' as the startide series, but a worthwhile book to spend time with."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Could somebody please explain to my why so many of David Brin's novels fail to get interesting until about page 450?I loved the first Uplift Trilogy. I couldn't put it down. Brightness Reef is far from what I expect from Brin. It's slow and choppy and a real chore to finish.I will say that there are a couple of things I do like: I like Brin's ability to create such vivid creatures from so many possible evolutionary paths. In the past his work has been very inspirational to my artwork.The drawbacks of this novel far outweigh the positives, however, and I am only finishing this novel because I have heard the second of this trilogy is very good. This book is boring as heck, however.If you do read Brightness Reef, be prepared for the process to take a couple months and don't be surprised if you find yourself reading (and finishing) several other books before you are done with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so gloss","review":"Not the better of Brin's work. I found the pace and character development slow. However, I've found that books written with a trilogy in mind, the first is always the slowest and the second usual picks up the pace. I've started reading the next and hope this is the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and frustrating","review":"I was looking for another good sci fi to read after I finished Elizabeth Kerner's \\"Song in the Silence,\\" I didn't find on in this book. Can you say slow.. I think I finally started to care what happened around page 500 out of a 625 page book. It took way too long to build any rapport with the charecters, and Brin's style of skipping from one charecter's prespective and individual plot line to another added to the muddle. I made me even madder when NO resolution was brought to any of the varied plots, they were all, \\"to be continued in the next book ... and then the next book after that.\\" This was not my best spent use of $6.00 nor will I invest in any more of the triolgy. If anyone feels like summing up what happens, drop me a note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less uplifting than others","review":"Brin tried a very different voice for the second trilogy, and I never got more than half-way through this book.

I have been trying to read this book on and off for over 2 months and I just cannot get into it, no matter how many pages I turn. Unfortunately, I bought the next 2 books in the series as well so I'm stuck with it. Save yourself some money and READ SOME PLOT SPOILERS ON WIKIPEDIA if you want to get into the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Plotted and Tiresome","review":"Geez, what a disappointment! I am a huge fan of the first uplift trilogy, but this slow paced behemoth held no interest for me at all. The new elements Brin adds are all half-ideas and loose ends. The characters are wooden. On every page, something seems about to happen, but nothing ever does. And by Brin's own admission, there isn't even an ending to this book, just a pitch to buy the next one. But why would I do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and way too long","review":"I loved Brin's other Uplift books but Brightness Reef (indeed, the entire trilogy of which it is a part) is a long-winded dud. It introduces a few enticing ideas, but constantly gets bogged down in useless character development and leaves way too many loose ends without resolving anything. This entire trilogy could have easily been condensed into a single volume, and at least two-thirds of the characters eliminated completely, without losing any of the core content. As it is, the three volumes lack continuity and the main ideas and characters introduced in the beginning turn out to have no relevance in the end. NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author, Excellent Book","review":"I recommend this and all of Brin's work. This book and the following two are perhaps my favorites by one of my favorite authors. Engaging characters, interesting storyline, and fresh plausible alien races that are really brought to life. You may want to start with Startide Rising and The Uplift War, but you don't have to. By the time you are into the third book, Heaven's Reach, you will find yourself slowly savoring each page as you won't want to reach the end and part ways with the truly enjoyable characters. I hope to be able to re-visit these characters and places sometime in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brin rambling without a plot","review":"Startide Rising and Uplift War were excellent, permanent additions to my library.

This book is not it. The plot is mostly nonexistent. The pace plods. The characters are static. The aliens are crudely drawn. It is hard to see where this book might be going. Most important, the payoffs do not come. Not enjoyable, and not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series should be called \\"Downlift Saga\\"","review":"I found the worlds Brin introduced in the first three very interesting and kept me completely engrossed.Like many of the reviewers, I found the story lines choppy and the characters thin (Not to mention the fact that Brin sees fit to mention that the clans of Jijo were illegal squatters every 100 to 200 words through out the book).That'll teach me for not reading the readers reviews prior to buying a book.True swill. Entertaining if you like being brought to fits of anger while trying to skim the hundreds of pages of banality.Hope the 6 dollars you got from me helped, Mr. Brin. I doubt you'll get another dollar. Go write sitcom script or bad high budget movies - at least that wont be nearly as insulting.Times like this, I really miss Asimov (God rest his soul)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Herring Trilogy","review":"I, like many other readers who reviewed Brin's Uplift Storm Trilogy, was very disapointed in how Brin managed his plots and characters. He continued to introduce new characters and plots at the expense of completely abandoning terrific plots and likable characters.My advice to you is don't waste your time with the Uplift Storm Trilogy. Read Startide Rising and the Uplift War (which are excellent), and then make up your own story about what happens to these plots and characters after you finish the books.After thousands of pages, I'm left with the impression that I was chasing a red herring - I should have spent my time reading other better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stand that the third book is not available yet!","review":"The first two books of the Brightness Reef Trilogy have been available for months now. They are as fresh, exciting and delightful as the Startide Rising Trilogy was. The characters are very full, the planet, Jijo is believable. I really want to believe that these six sentient races can live in peace and serve as an example for the Six Galaxies. Mr. Brin deserves high praise for his noble ideals, and for the positive outlook he brings to his stories. These two trilogies are among the very best of the Science Fiction genre. I heartily recommend them.

I can't recall the last time I actuallysuccumbed to the temptation to skip ahead and seehow a story thread comes out (yes, I'mashamed).If I have one criticism, it's the proliferationof fragmented threads and narrative points ofview, which at times spills over from suspenseto frustration, but the overwhelming interestof the storyline kept me turning the pages.He's set a high bar for himself - he'd bettercome through on those sequels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging start that spins into confusion","review":"As usual, Brin's book starts out complex but terribly engaging, as we are introduced to several highly interesting characters. The middle portion is also excellent as a fascinating story line is brought into play which ties us back to the original Uplift trilogy and brings out new perspectives on the characters to whom we had been introduced. But instead of tieing it nicely into a clean ending, Brin uses the last part of the book to take off on completely unrelated tangents that are not only uninteresting but completely uninspired (The horses are still around? Please! How corny can you get?) At the end of the book he \\"apologizes\\" for his inadvertant slip that turns this into a trilogy. It seems like more of a commercial set-up to me. I for one, plan not to read the rest of the trilogy out of sheer disgust. David Brin's earlier works are superb.

The only complaint I have of this ring, is that the edges are indeed sharp. It often snags of fabric, but in my eyes, that's the one flaw of this ring. Wonderful as a gift, stand-in engagement ring, or promise ring.I LOVE IT! <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, love it, and exactly what I was looking for.","review":"The title sums it up.

The fit was perfect (sometimes larger rings are either too big or too small). I was highly impressed with the quality of the ring for such a low price. It looks like it costs much more than it did. The CZ is not too big to look fake, and many people have commented on how lucky I am to have such a husband who has good tastes in diamonds! I am also impressed with the band itself.

The stone is a very believable size. I didn't get any comments, so I'm not sure if people thought it was real or not, but I don't see why they wouldn't have thought it was real from a few feet away. The setting is not particularly elegant, and does look a little cheap, but that's to be expected for the price. The silver band is good quality and pretty sturdy. I wore the ring for 3 weeks, day and night, just as I do my real e-ring, and it was comfortable and still looked good. This ring was a good substitute while my e-ring was at the jewelers, but I'm glad to have my ring back. It's tough to look down and be satisfied with an imitation when you are used to the real thing. The ring size was very accurate (size 6). Also, a band won't sit flush with the ring because of the stone setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"I was a little unsure about getting the ring at first, but I'm glad I did because my girlfriend loves it.

I could not get the largest file photos to work well and thought that I perhaps needed a tripod or something. I was okay with the less pixel pictures for what I was using it for. Then, after a while, some of the lower quality pictures came out blurry- some looked like a soft focus and some were so blurry you could not tell what it was. Even on the lowest quality setting, about 9 of 10 pictures are completely unusable- even when taking the lowest quality pictures. I have missed many family moments including my parent's 50th wedding anniversary photos due to this problem. After contacting Olympus, they know it is an issue but (not covered since warrantee is up)will only repair it at a price that is more than I could buy another comparable camera for.

I loved it until I dunked it in the water. I replaced it with a Canon G-3. This camera was incredible. However, it was a little more complex/sophisticated and bulky than we wanted. We wanted a camera as simple as the 490. So, we sold the G-2 and bought the Olympus D-565. More than half of all indoor photos are out of focus. About a third of outdoor photos are not in focus. Even in-focus photos are not as crisp as those from the 490 (only 2 mp). Go figure! Anyway, if all you want is primarily outdoor snapshots, the 565 is compact and simple to use. After taking photos at two very important events and being thoroughly disappointed I have replaced this camera with a Canon PowerShoot S50. It's 'focus success rate' is about 19 out of 20. It is compact like the D-565 and is simpler to use than the G-3. I'd recommending dropping an extra hundred bucks on the Canon S50 vs. the Olympus D-565."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, simple to use","review":"I've had this camera for over a year now, and I still love it. It's simple to use, and it produces great pictures. I still get comments occasionally about how clear the pictures are, and I'm always amazed and the clarity.The zoom leaves something to be desired, but it's as good as it gets for the price you're paying. I would love a killer zoom, but it takes a bit more out of my pocketbook than I'm willing to part with!It's simple to upload pictures to my computer, and I've never had any problems figuring out how to use the camera. There are plenty of fancy features I never use.There are nicer cameras out there, but for the price you'll pay, this is a great bargain. Quality pictures and ease of use make this a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible compared to the CANON, MINOLTA, & PENTAX!","review":"A lot of my pictures were blurry, slow for focusing, no audio!#The only thing I liked is that it's compact, cute looking, water proofish, & uses XD card."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"LIVE\\" show in your living room","review":"A Must have for All Rock and Roll fans.

Consider Cinco De Mowo to be it's fully realized maturation.

It doesn't heat evenly, its flimsy, the lid doesn't sit well, the bowl is odd shape, and the cup handle is not ergonomic at all.

Your hard earned cash is better spent on a nice cast iron frying pan, and if needed larger pot for boiling water for your camping needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for my purposes.","review":"I'm not sure where other people are finding their complaints. This is exactly what I was looking for, and fits my need of a lightweight mess set. While the material is thin, it isn't overly so or 'like a coke can' as I read in one review. Yeah, it scratches, yeah the handle can bend if you overload the pan, yeah it's not non-stick. I wasn't looking for a set for heavy use at home, just a light set to take hiking and backpacking. I'm using these over a home made alcohol stove and they work fine. No issues.If you're expecting something of amazing quality, this isn't it. This is okay quality cookware meant to be used and used hard. It should last me a couple of years. This is a cheap set that can be beat to hell. It will be, and it should be.

Made out of cheap aluminum, it is not sturdy and has no non-stick treatment, so cleaning is a pain. It basically can be used for one person for cooking a meal, but at a little more than a pound, it's not worth it. I wouldn't even buy it as a beginner set for the new camper. I recommend the \\"Open Country Sierra 5-Piece Nonstick Backpacker Cooking Set\\". It is treated with a non-stick coating on all sides and is lightweight. You really don't need more than two pots for cooking a meal for one to four people.

I'd only recommend this for the reasons stated. Up-Date: Went to the Desert Super Bowl Weekend and this \\"Low Cost\\" Mess Kit was worth it's weight in gold.

It's a metal cup, with folding handle, lid, and comes with two plastic cups that fit inside. You can also fit a gas canister and stove if you remove one or both of the cups.

Unfortunately, it is hard to open and close because the handle that holds every thing in, is held by a screw. I found it hard to open and I overloosened the screw which then dropped out of the handle and I could not find it. The kit was hard to put back together anyway as the pot handle didn't fold right. Not a good buy. I recommend that if one purchases a mess kit, that they get one which the handle folds rather than screws together.

This book showed me the correct way to prune azaleas and when to do it. Because of this method, my azaleas filled out to large mounds that look like big drifts of color when they bloom.

Based on the title and the blurb, you might think you were going to watch a video ABOUT THE GRAND CANYON. You would be mistaken.A better title for this movie would be The Colorado Plateau. Now, if we had started watching the video knowing this, we might have enjoyed it more, but as it was, we kept wondering, when are they going to talk about the Grand Canyon????The video itself discusses the history, geology, and parks of the entire Colorado Plateau: Bryce, Zion, Arches, Canyonland, Lake Powell, and etc. It spends very little time actually talking about and showing the Grand Canyon itself.The video was OK, if a little cheesy.

It is a constant process of life which never ends unless we allow it to by; settling for less, giving up, living our lives through what others say or by not using the skills, talents, gifts and opportunities God has blessed us with!\\"- Written By Carolyn J.

I have had to put them away because while my three year old isn't likely to put them in his mouth, his one year old brother is.

Of course, this ignores the effects of acid rain on ecosystem functioning in terms of multi-trophic interactions and ultimately, stability. Other topics are handled in a similarly contemptible fashion. This book is a perfect example of science distorted to support a political agenda.

Only as a woman can know the inner struggles we feel every day to walk the right path both within ourselves and with God is never easy. Here we see three story lines laid out that make our hearts yearn to share with them.The only thing I did not like is that all three books are printed in one. The book is heavy and hard to handle. This would have been better if each book was on it's own and packaged in a holder for the trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"Bought this book at Christmastime for myself.

It has a very basic premise-what you discard today may be what you drink tomorrow. The video has illustrated the point in the best way I've ever seen it done. There can be no mistake about the connection between the aquifer (underground) water and activities on the surface.Two particular things are great about the video. It's got a touch of humor. No dry, boring science here! The other is that the purpose of the video is conservation. But it's imminently practical. There's no suggestion we should go back to living in the stone age. The show gives several examples of what farmers and homeowners can do in their own lives to really make a difference-without sacrificing our modern lifestyle!I highly recommend this DVD.

They advertise many wood pieces, but they don't tell you that most of them (65 or so) are just the small connectors. You can only build very narrow buildings, and you have to leave gaps in most of the walls if you want any kind of height. I found it very difficult to do anything other than what was on the box, and it was even more frustrating for my 4-year-old when he tried to do something new. The 2 roof pieces are tricky too - they must be offset in height to work properly next to each other. Even for only $20, I would not recommend it. Get a set with more of the full-size pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Black Metal","review":"This import contains most of the bands better tracks from their darker, heavier, more traditional black metal period.

My daughter loves these books. Boynton's books are cutsie-poosie for the kiddies, and they are hard to read without starting to sing.There was one part that made me uncomfortable, though. I know this is going to sound hyper-sensitive, but it bummed me out when the narrator tells the little rabbit that he's too small for basketball. The book goes on to tell the elephant: \\"You're too big to use the swings, you should go do big guy things.\\" The elephant looks despondent on the swing, like an eight-year-old with a glandular problem being teased by adults who think he's twelve. It made me a little sad. Why can't the rabbit play basketball and why can't the elephant ride a swing with the other kids? But, I know, it's just a kids book, I'm definitely missing the point, but I can't help what it made me think.But your kid will love it. The rhythms are jaunty and fun.

I know I'm allergic to latex and, these are latex free so, it can't be related to the latex... once I put these on, I develop a very bad rash which drives me insane with unbearable itching. Not quite certain if I've just developed extremely sensitive skin in my old age but, these itch so bad, I can't help but scratching to the point were I may make myself bleed.

She knows exactly what the reactions would be appropriate for the profile of the character. I particularly enjoyed this book because I liked the main character, Robin.

On the other hand, if you are looking for an album that features five of the most talented musicians ever to play jazz, cooking on some really great tunes and playing together like they've been doing this all their life then this might be the album for you. This one does not contain (as one reviewer stated) the same lineup as \\"Kind of Blue\\". Milestones has Philly Jo Jones on drums and Red Garland on piano.

It's the traditional Christmas songs with the added twist and charm of Cartman, Mr. Hankey, Satan, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Mr. Mackey, and others.Mr. Hankey's Christmas special last year was very good, but since it was shown on Comedy Central, all the bad words were bleeped out. This compilation has all the songs and more in their entirety.I've been listening to this CD at work about 3-4 times a day (on repeat mode) for the last month and still love it.

However, the teeth were still deep enough to get through my hair without difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual and entertaining book","review":"I found this book very entertaining to read, but I have a few minuses to point out: it was a bit drawn-out and tedious sometimes, and changes between the different time-periods could have been handled better. Having said that, though, the authors seem to have done a lot of background research, and create a conspiratorial web to great effect. It is interesting to see how this secret organization, in modern times known as the Illuminati, has moved down through the ages and influenced politics and society. When you read the book you know that a lot is fact, a lot is the imagination of the authors, but pondering where the line goes is perhaps the most intriguing thing about the book, and can really give you \\"the chills\\". Read it - you won't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a hoot, All Hail Eris!","review":"As an admirer of Atlanta Hope (aka Ayn Rand) I enjoyed the digs at her philososphy.

At first, it was to humor him...but then, I found myself totally caught up in the story! At times, it was a little hard to follow, jumping from place to place and time to time, but once I caught the swing, I couldn't put it down! But, one question...was there any woman in the book (besides, of course, Saul's and Barney's wives) that Hagbard DIDN'T have sex with??"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me who I am today.","review":"Although it is not the most masterfully written book of all time, this book has the ability to alter your perception of the universe in startling ways. And I think that's the point. Through the description of a supposed conspiracy, Shea and Wilson point out that we believe what we see, and we see what we choose. They demonstrate this to us by actually causing it to happen in the reader... art in the highest sense of the word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the beginning of a mind-opening journey...","review":"I'll let most of the already-submitted reviews speak for themselves; worthy of note is the truly educational nature of the book--not in its information content (although plentiful), but in its ability to urge the reader to think and learn. It truly opened up a whole new world of independent thinking for me; one thing's for sure: after reading this, you'll never look at the world the same way again fnord.As an additional treat, you'll see how much of the Hollywood industry is influenced by this book, and how many surreptitious references to it show up in film after film...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really entertaining","review":"This book is 800+ pages of a practical joke. It is very entertaining and well worth reading. It kept my attention throughout the story and I found myself laughing at the absurdities as well as the 'wink winks'. Beyond that I would hope that people are intelligent and patient enough with the book to realize that it is a work of fiction, and that while there may be an iota of truth in every fifty pages, it is just a maybe. Be sure to read after the story is completed, and you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a convenient linear storyline you definitely will be. One last note, this book has made me research more historical archives than any history class, any thing in life which makes you think is a great thing to experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest bad novels of all time","review":"Bad writing, unbelievable characters, disjointed and disorganized plots that somehow come together to form a wonderful story. The three volumes that comprise the Illuminatus Trilogy are like taking a no spending limit trip through the parinoid's candy store!I read the Illuminatus when I was in my 20's and it frightened me because I thought might all be true. I reread in my 30's and was depressed because I realized that it wasn't. I've just read it again at 50 and now know that even though every word is fiction, every word is also true.Our lives are subject to the whims of people for whom we are no more real or important than unbelievable characters in a bad novel -- but it's OK as long as we remember how to have a good time while we're on their ride.The Illuminatus Trilogy is a must read that belongs on everyone's desert island list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth about 10 pages of \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\"","review":"A mildly entertaining work, despite overall structural incoherence. Weird, trippy, and often hysterical, but ultimately worth about ten pages of Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\". For more fast-paced, stylish, coherent Illuminati action, check out Grant Morrison's \\"Invisibles\\" comic book series (4 out of 5 stars in that particular genre)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of my life","review":"After several of my friends raved non-stop about the trilogy I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I was without a doubt the single biggest waste of my time. I tried to read it; I actually got through the first book and into the second one before my frustration overcame me. I did something that I have never done before I destroyed the book. I threw it into a foul disgusting gutter where it proceeded to fester and rot. I'm not kidding. I actually hated the book that much. Only the Mission Earth Series by L. Ron Hubbard comes close to being such a colossal stink bomb as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that need be said","review":"One doesn't really need to read this trilogy (though I have) to get an insight into \\"what it's all about\\".Yes, it's true that one of the lead characters is noted for the admonition \\"Think for yourself, schmuck!\\", and I have seen this admonition repeated several times in this forum.But the people in this forum who say, \\"Think for yourself, schmuck!\\" are adoring fans of this book and they are responding to the minority who don't like the book at all.The fans of the book appear to have decided that one couldn't possibly be thinking for himself if he just plain doesn't like the book.In other words, \\"Think for yourself, schmuck!\\" is just a code phrase for \\"Think like I do! Think like the majority of us do!\\"And that by itself, I think, is all that one really needs to know about the content of the book, the authors and the audience to whom the book is directed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"To be honest, I bought the book many years ago, after it came highly recommended by a friend. I did not read any reviews before I started reading it, because I wanted to keep an open mind. And oh boy, was I in for a surprise. I really, really, really tried to stick to it, but all I could get through was the first 130 pages. I must say that once in a while the narrative is quite interesting, but... Overall, it seems like the book was written by a undermedicated paranoid schizophrenic, who's been smoking something very illegal. I feel very sad and sorry for people, who thought this book was intellectual and profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"This is the only book in my ENTIRE life that I couldn't even finish!

If you ever wondered what the heck is going on--this book will tend not to help you, but if you have *never* wondered what was going on, this book might make you ask. Right around the 23rd reread, you'll experience your fifth major epiphany about life, etc. Yes, it is that good. Folks used to linear thought may want to read it slowly, however.

For any of you wondering if this book is worth the read...ignore everything you've heard and discover it for yourself. Fnord! I guarantee you'll never be the same again, but in a positive kind of paranoid way.I feel sorry for people who didn't like the book. Closed minds abound in the world, I guess. I just think anyone who doesn't find entertainment value (at a minimum) in this book needs to get a sense of humor and OPEN their eyes. Fnord! So without further ado...what are you waiting for?

The narrative itself is confused and turgid...with changing perspectives, ideological bloat-ware, clumsy sentences, and little appreciation for the uninitiated reader.If you are a student of '60s counter-culture/pop culture and fascinated by some dated conspiracy theories then you may find some value in this book. This work also, partly, inspired Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum....a fine piece of literary fiction from the Italian Semiotician.General Recommendation: Don't wast your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just read?","review":"Why did I waste two months of free time on this novel? 805 pages of pointless ramblings that just left me scratching my head. This book is jam packed with explicit violence, impetuous sex, black masses, and unabashed drug abuse.There was a plot at some point, or was there? How does everything tie together? Content that may have been thought provoking nuggets are lost in a sea of nonsensical circuitous paragraphs that would jump from one character's viewpoint to another.This book started off slow, continued to be slow, and ended painfully slow. I kept waiting for a payoff, given all the time invested in this novel, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I picked up this book a couple of years ago while in search of literature on the secret Illuminati society, which according to legend, has run the world behind the scenes for centuries. Well, it was one of those few books which I could not even read. It was so trashy and sporadic in the first hundred pages that I tossed it aside. No doubt cult fans will be as mad at me as I would be if someone insulted \\"Star Wars,\\" but in my humble opinion, this is shlock literature of the highest sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspired but still hackwork","review":"There is almost no point to this book; the philosophical ideas the authors try to illustrate are lost in the shuffle and have to be explained in the 22 appendices. Some credit must be given for them managing to work in references to Lovecraft, Fort, Rand, Hamilton, Stirner and Coolidge, and the parody of Atlas Shrugged is cute. If the authors don't like the fact that every page of Rand's fiction is filled with her worldview, surely their unintelligible is much worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both philosophically deep & entertaining","review":"This book is just wonderful. It is a very good science fiction novel, but it is also both funny and uncredibly philosophically deep. This trilogy belong to my personal TOP10 of fiction. This book is also one of the most important works of discordianism."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but a demanding read","review":"This book is very clever. The authors have a well-developed sense of humor, going so far even as to poke fun at themselves throughout the book.I agree with one of the earlier review that really what this book is trying to say is that an open mind is key to understanding the world.Reading this book as if it actually will provide REAL answers to to the \\"real\\" world is not a good idea. Conspiracy theories aside, if you trace where some of these facts come from, you can tell that they have been stretched a little here and there to fit the story (though sometimes not by much...).Bottom line, this book is great and I think any disillusioned liberal should read it. It'll provide a good laugh and maybe even a dose of hope.And the author of this review will NOT die for Fernando Poo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Files on acid.","review":"The Illuminatus! Trilogy will leave you hopelessly groping for the floor of the room with the trap door that you were just sitting in. You really don't know what to beleive after a while and this just sets the scene for the next 500 pages. Generous portions of surreal humour and eroticism are incorporated neatly into a plot circumventing common perceptions of reality. On the odd occasion I had to pinch the book to make sure it wasn't dreaming. The mix between far out drug induced dialogues and intelligent manipulation of history leaves the mind with a fresh sense of what reality isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening the Eye","review":"I first read this set of books while I was still in college (late 70's), and I have re-read them at least a dozen times. This is one of the best modern trilogies ever written. These books \\"get it,\\" more than any other book you'll ever read. The question is, will you \\"get it\\"?Yes, this trilogy is full of strange scenes and dialogue, it has sex, drugs, and rock and roll, it has deep philosophy and shallow meanderings of stupidity. What I'm trying to say is that EVERYTHING is in this trilogy. Most of all, it has humor; I'm talking about laugh-out-loud humor.I promise you that you will enjoy this trilogy, and you will learn from it. I can't really tell you what you are going to learn, because everyone takes something a little different from it. But, once you read this trilogy, you will never be the same.

This book has no plot or structure. Characters, places and times switch in midsentence leaving the reader puzzled and confused. For most of the book the reader cannot even tell who or what he is reading about! The superflous barrage of facts (and fiction) assult the reader's senses in a disorganized and chaotic manner. All in all this book is the product of a highly ego-centerd, very arrogant, and drug induced author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guy banging an apple?? Seriously?","review":"This book makes absolutely no sense. It starts out almost halfway able to follow, but by later on in the book you have no idea who is doing what or what character is even talking. And by later on in the book I mean chapter 2. I really wanted to like this book, it is chock full of things I can read all day about (secret societies, violence, conspiracies, etc) but seriously, at least write in a way where you can understand what the hell is going on.Mid paragraph characters change, sometimes mid sentence. Nothing makes any sense whatsoever. Everyone loves this book because of its genious and innovative writing style, well I have news for you, its not. There is a reason no one else ever wrote a book like this, because it sucks. This is the only book I have ever read that made me seriously pissed off because NOTHING MAKES SENSE.

The book has fun passages but as a work is about as profoundly simple as they get. The question of whether reality is an illusion and consciousness a disease has been handled with much more erudition by better, funnier authors. As far as pure satire goes, try Douglas Adams first - he's funnier and less pretentious. If you're in that 'atheist/modernist/whateverist' school of thought, Pynchon answers this question much better in his novels (and he came up with the 'KCUF' joke first).And if you found the seventh grade epistemology in this book profound, well, you probably also thought 'The Matrix' was intellectual.In a bigger sense Umberto Eco solved the problem this trilogy asks in a much more profound and interesting opus, 'Foucault's Pendulum.' The difference? In 'Pendulum', the conspirator is the insane one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry.....","review":"I never took acid so I just don't get it. I so wanted to enjoy this book.

For people who want to think they've worked for their fiction without actually having to put any thought into the project. The book is not exactly bad, but it is grossly lacking the mind-numbing agility writers like Gaddis have been practicing for some time.

This book is witty, intelligent, and well crafted. The constant shifts in time and perspective keep the reader focused hard on the text, making them think about what they're reading, rather than just absorbing it. A very rewarding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elsewhere","review":"A great example of how size and complexity do not equal depth or worth, this large, culty trilogy is more or less a white-noise barrage of meaningless events splattered over a thousand or so pages. As a proper novel it's a big shaggy-dog story, and as a reading experience it's just not interesting enough. By the end I was reading it as a grudge, just to prove that I could do it.It's dated, too - the female character(s) are/is there for the men to have sex with - and the time- and space-hopping narrative isn't nearly as clever as it seems to think. It has some memorably smug characters, too, and the air of something dreamed up and written down one night whilst bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disregard the haters","review":"Don't listen to the haters on this one. Basically all the revues denouncing this book so far are by people who have their heads stuck so far up pop-culture's exterior that they are inable to judge useful literature from non-useful(albei entertaining) literature. The Illuminatis Trilogy is useful literature. It will change you. Be prepared. One thing that the critics always complain about is plot. These people are missing the whole point: that the plot isn't the point of the story in the first place. It's not where you end up, it's how you get there. Read this book with a closed mind and you'll hate it. Read this book with an open mind and you will find a new you."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, poor kindle version","review":"How many times did I read George Dora?

It jumps in time. It jumps in perspective, from first-person to third-person. It even jumps into critiques of itself. This can make it hard to follow occasionally, but it's worth it.The plot goes through pretty much every conspiracy theory that existed at the time of its publication: who actually killed JFK, the existence of Atlantis, why MLK was assassinated, the existence of the Illuminati and the Discordians, and countless more. Numerology plays a big part, with many things being tied back to their numerological roots. There are double agents and triple agents.I enjoyed it, although I'll say that I honestly enjoy playing theIlluminaticard game a lot more than I enjoyed reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what thou wilt....","review":"Wilson and Shea turn the 60s and the 70s on their heads.

The paradoxes and Ironies of the book grow and grow to the point where characters in the book are writing horrible reviews of the book they are characters in and culminating when one of the characters realizes that they are all in a book. It is not an easy read, however, because whole sections of the book often seem like Joyce's thunder crashes: huge lists of words and ideas and band names.

It is an absolute masterpiece--one that has never been appreciated as it deserves. An integral part of the movie isthe marvelous haunting music of Franco Piersanti.

Though they rewrote the rules of post-disco electronic dance music, the rut of catchy melodies led to sameness. His title \\"B-2 Unit\\" alludes to industrial noise but you'll find haunting spare vocal arrangements here also. This is one of the most influential albums of my life. I don't simply love it so much as acknowledge it as an intimate friend who has been my conscience through times easy and hard. This album is emotional and powerful. A neoelectronic rhythmic soundscape and an insistent projection of creative ego in a blast of noise and timbre. Not an \\"ambient\\" wandering piece of trendy crap, but real songs of great movement and variety. Not background or soundtrack music, but innovative, strong, rich and still delivers a catchy melody or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflections of The Dream of Spaceflight","review":"Not what I expected.

The essays aren't perfect. Wachhorst often takes disparate insights from others and tries to connect them, when leaving them to contrast with each other would have been fine. He is critical of the postmodern [which is fine by me], but he often uses terms in fuzzy and metaphorical ways reminiscent of many postmodern authors. But ultimately the purpose of any good essay is to get the reader to think and Wachhorst succeeded with this reader admirably. The deep and wonderful insights in the essays [e.g. The whole person must have both the humility to nurture the Earth and the pride to go to Mars.] come often enough to recommend the book with a four star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enchantment of Memory","review":"This book is a collection of all different kinds of poems. Everything from the meaning of life \\"Roses\\" to the meaning of a rainbow \\"A Color of the Rainbow\\" to the end of life \\"My Death\\". If you are into to poetry or if you kinda think you could give it a whirl this is a great book to buy and read for yourself. Some of these poems make you catch your breath and other make you feel so good inside that you have to write one yourself. Their are of course better books of poetry out there but this is great for beginners and for old pro's to see some the amateur talent out there. The only bad thing, why I put 4 stars instead of 5, is that there are a lot of poems.

It reached such a long length with only 5 songs because it has more than 5 songs. It has two others which aren't listed on the list of songs. Don't ask me why.The two unlisted songs are the instrumental, unlisted song from Exodus (7th on Exodus), and a version of Static Journey with singing.This is by far my favorite Samael album. Rebellion and Static Journey are both amazing. Static Journey is an instrumental. I Love the Dead is from Alice Cooper. Into the Pentagram and After the Sepulture are old songs of theirs.Rebellion also has my favorite cover art from Samael.You can get all 7 of these songs on the compilation CD of Ceremony of Opposites + Rebellion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art of musical seduction","review":"This little known album by Ryuichi is his finest one as his avant-garde music stuff. He's mellowed down considerably recently, perhaps because of his own reputation in the past, producing some banal albums such as Smoochy, BTTB, etc. The general public may be pleased to listen to those banal understandable albums, but the most committed members of his audience would find this album Esperanto much more interesting and even more seductive. The music in the album is self-contained, despite the fact it was supposed to have been composed for an American dancer for her dance performance. As the commentary, which is included in the sold CD case, says (in Japanese), you would feel as if the dance performance were for his music, rather than his for hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a remarkable voice, it's deserves your attention","review":"If you adore great singing by a super star this cd is for you. What a voice! Everytime I hear it, I loose my breath i'm so excited. I tell you, there are not many voices like this around. When you find one you have better latch on to it for there may not be another.The main concern I had for this cd was the repertoire. It had too many songs that I didn't particulary like. If the repertoire had of been better this cd would definately have been a 5. I will say this, Lesley's voice was super even on the songs that I didn't like.I know a lot of people are unfamiliar with Lesley, since she lives in the U.K., but she deserves you attention.

Quite simply, it describes, in great detail, the career of the silent film star. It touches on his personal affairs; however, those looking for intimate details and confirmed accounts of those affairs will be disappointed to know that Mr. Soares does not base this book on speculations. Again, the rumors are addressed but not presented as facts. The reader will learn a lot about the late actor but it leaves the strong sense of mystery surrounding his personal life. Personally, I beleive that's for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"Let me begin by saying that reading this book revealed as much to me about Ramon Novarro as I would have learned from dozens of other books. The biographical profile is informative, and the movie discussions are revealing. I found myself wishing I could see every one of his films, and I was glad that someone had finally put the spotlight on a classic film star that is seen far too often.The author researched this work with an eye to uncovering unique pieces of information, and the documentation of details offers extraordinary accuracy, as well as manages to be entertaining, too, a combination that I find rare with nonfiction books.This book delivers substance, pictures, and a loving tribute to one of the great stars of a bygone era, and should be on every film fan's bookshelf.Review posted by David W.

His research was extensive and he dispelled some myths that have long been connected to Ramon Novarro.Ramon Novarro has an important place in Hollywood history. His career was a long one and for the most part successful. He is best known for Ben Hur but he went on to make many pictures and acted in television. It is a shame that he is known more for the way he died than for the way that he lived.Some where it was written that Novarro was beaten with an object given to him by Valentio and then the said object was stuffed down his throat choaking him. None of that is true and Andre did a good job in proving that point.Why Mr. Novarro did live a secret life and hid his sexual preferences, he was a man of intellegince, talent, and loyal to his friends and family.I enjoyed this book and think that anyone would."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent biography","review":"I am really enjoying ready the bio of Ramon Novarro written By A. Soares. The author is excellent in describing facts and lieux, even if, sometimes, he spent a little too much time in narrating certains events, like the making of BEN HUR before Navarro was approached to play in ti. But the book is consistant and really honest. Soares did not write this bio to give sensational angles of Novarro's life.

The author has managed to dump the lurid stories and produce a balanced portrait of this man.This is a very interesting and detailed biography. It will leave you with the impression that you really have a good idea who Novarro was and will provide you with a greater appreciation for his work.Thumbs up to Mr. Soares for his work as a researcher/biographer.

Although I am no expert, the book seemed to focus on just explaining how wonderful Taekwondo is, and some other basic information.

The Aboriginal song poems have been ably translated, but the editors decided to have the poems in their original languages facing the English versions. This adds much to the feel of a foreign, exotic literature. Explanatory notes are placed with the original versions, causing some difficulty in switching from page to page reading the translation and then the explanation (the meanings of passages are not always clear from the translation).

When he wakes up, have a new shell for him.\\" A photo of a crab in a ice tray is next to the text. This unusually cruel info is later contradicted, when he states that hermit crabs easily freeze to death because they are tropical animals.The really only good thing I can say about this book is that there are some nice pictures and photos.

Everyone hated it, including our instructor. I found myself doing a lot of independent study this year, because my instructor was often incomprehensible, and unfortunately, this book most often was just not thorough enough when it came to explanations. Usually, the problems that were explained stepwise, were very simple, so harder problems were difficult to figure out by myself. I am a straight A student, and a pre-med bio major, so I don't consider myself completely stupid, but this book sometimes made me feel as though I was reading a foreign language. Maybe having a better instructor would have made a difference, but since I had to pretty much cover 75% of the course on my own, I had real difficulty understanding the text.

Whatever happened to impartial reporting (so says he's a journalist whom I'm willing to bet my G3, pretty likely poured gasoline on and danced in glee during Apple's troubled days in the past several years. There is a very decidedly negative tone immediately into the first few pages of this book. Certainly sounds to me as if Malone greatly dislikes and is insanely jealous of Steve Jobs' success. One can sense he's in the background scowling. I would stick with Steven Levy's Insanely Great for impartial writing and Owen Linzmayer's Apple Confidential for juicy niblets. Thumbs down on Infinite Loop; although thumbs up for the cover design. That's about all I can say. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy any of the other \\"Apple History\\" books instead.","review":"A blizzard of minor factual errors and editing mistakes really brought down my enjoyment of this book.

Factual errors aside, the relentlessly fault-finding tone throughout is unprofessionally partisan, masquerading as this book is as a work of serious journalism. True, some of the facts of the Apple story are dire and depressing, but the bias evident in this work renders the writer's conclusions suspect at best and laughable at worst. And (partly due to circumstances not entirely in his control, but a writer really ought to revise conclusions if new information is becoming available and WAIT on the release...), the writer ends the book just as Apple is rising Lazarus-like from the \\"death\\" he alleges... Well, my new iMac and I would like to contest the writer's belief that the story's over. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisitly Written","review":"Michael Malone did a pretty good job with this book. He has got an explosive combination of ingredients in this book: A perfect plot (Apple Computers History), amazing characters (Steve Jobs just as an example), Intrigue, Drama, Joy, and a lot more. Michael Malone mixed all this ingredients the right way, writting a very good novel/business book. He his sophisticated in his writting, yet very simplistic. I loved finishing the book understanding what he meant by infinite loop. I strongly advise you to find it out for yourself. You will not get disapointed and you will keep turning those pages very rapidly just like a good thriller. Don't get intimidated by the size of the book, or by the fact that is a corporate history book. In fact it is, but it could also be a science fiction novel. That's what is makes it so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try Malone...could have been way, way better!","review":"Another so-so book in the HISTORY OF APPLE genre.

Inexcusable in an almost 600 page/$27.50 retail book from a major publisher 2) lots of annoying typos throughout the book. 3) too much reliance on work by other authors, not enough first hand interviews by Malone. 4) Loads of trite pop psychology theories about Jobs and Wozniak behavior and state of mind. 5) Latter half of the book much worse, more rushed than the first half. Typically seen when the publisher is bearing down on the author to get the title to market. Malone should have resisted.

(Come on!)I enjoyed reliving some of the computing history that I grew up in, but one error for example describes the Atari 2600 as their venture into the home computing market (it was simply a cartridge based game machine to my recollection). Malone also seems to want to villify Jobs and portray everyone else as having a tragic flaw as if this was all a giant Greek tradgey. I had to return this book to the library as I became sickened by the arrogance and personalities, backstabbing, and ruthless (anti)corporate politics of the Silicon Valley business world portrayed here.Of course it could all be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent","review":"I've read a number of books on Apple, Steve Jobs, and the early days of personal computing, but this one stands out as the most complete, compelling, consistent, and fair minded. Michael S. Malone tackles not only the entire history of the Jobs/Wozniak relationship and the history of Apple, but he also provides a lot of background information about the rest of the industry and what it was like in the Valley at various periods in the story. I've heard that 'The Little Kingdom' is considered to be the best Apple book out there, but it's near impossible to find. From my experience, Infinite Loop is definitely the best one and an outstanding history of the entire computer industry as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Debut","review":"Although I am not given to normally read historical fiction-based stories, I decided to read this one.

Forester (author of the Horatio Hornblower series), Alexander Kent (whose real name is Douglas Reeman, and author of The Richard Bolitho series) and Patrick O'Brian (author of the Master & Commander series) I had seen motion pictures derived from their respective works... but had always been reluctant to read them.Personally, I have always liked my historical reading to be, well... historical.This two-in-one volume has gotten me to reconsider my thinking, and to look deeper into the realm of such works of historical fiction.

The first song 'Round Midnight is an excellent old '50s song, recorded on 9/10/1956. The next song which was the first session Ah-Leu-Cha is excellent, recorded on 10/26/1955. All of You and Bye Bye Blackbird have really great piano. Bye Bye Blackbird is my favorite song here, it has the best piano. All the songs in this album are excellent as well as other Miles Davis. Get this with Kind of Blue and you can enjoy a relaxing late 1950s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! - But Cannonball Adderley is not on this recording","review":"This CD is one of the great hard bop jazz recordings of all time.

The music isn't as innovative as Mr. Bowie, but it's a fun listen. The first four tracks are pretty bad - Peter Kent's \\"It's a Real Good Feeling\\" starts it off on a real bad foot, and \\"Sunshine Reggae\\", \\"I Like Chopin\\" and the acapella take of \\"Only You\\" don't help much. After that, it's good going - \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\", \\"The Reflex\\", the killer \\"Dancing With Tears in My Eyes\\", \\"Such a Shame\\", \\"Eyes Without a Face\\", \\"Never Ending Story\\", \\"We Belong\\" (OK, we didn't need TWO Pat Benatar songs), Ashford & Simpson's \\"Solid\\", \\"19\\". Then comes an odd remix of Baltimora's \\"Tarzan Boy\\", then \\"Kayleigh\\" and \\"Running Up That Hill\\". The ending tune - Midge Ure's \\"If I Was\\" - isn't the best tune to go out on, but it'll serve.

But this video is ridiculous. The eclectic and dizzying mix of moves from the first 10 minutes was enough for me to throw my hands up and laugh. I don't think they repeat a single move more than twice in this entire video.They spent way too much time designing fancy Latin backdrops, strobe lights & black&white disco cinematography. Not to mention the laughable scantily-clad Latin chicks that sit along the sidelines and whistle at those sweating and rump-shaking in the video. A little more time needed to be spent designing a routine that was actually feasible to accomplish. If you're looking for a GOOD Richard Simmons tape, I'd recommend the Mega-Mix Blastoff. It's a lot easier to follow and a LOT less cornball. But if you're looking for a good laugh, pick this up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!!!","review":"I love this video! Maybe it isn't the best workout in the world (we're not talking about the Navy Seal Workout here!), but it's fun, fun, fun! The music is great, the video is colorful, Richard is hilarious. Jane Fonda may give you abs and buns of steel, but do you really want to do her militaristic style workout every single day? Latin Blast-Off is a great tape for rotation-- maybe do strength training, pilates or more intense cardio during the week, then kick off your heels and do this one on Fridays after work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad ...","review":"I have tried this video two times now, and frankly it just makes me angry. The professional dancers that stock this video are nauseating, ... The routines do not give a balanced workout as they stand--I can just dance around in my living room and get the same result. It would have been nice if the exercises were *adapted* from dance moves and targeted all body parts, instead of just being taken as is complete ... . The warm up at the beginning is almost a joke, the toning portion was weak, and there is no abs workout at the end. Richard seems to have tried to appeal to a different audience with this one, but I was just sorry I had wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Hits 2002","review":"The Tracklistings Are Wrong, The Real Tracks Are:1.

I think that all her books are just great. If you want good books to read-just read Karen Kingsbury's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Fiction?","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I was extremely disappointed. It just seems that Karen Kingsbury writes trashy fiction for Christians and in my opinion the way this book turned out I don't even see this as Christian fiction at all. It was littered with adultery and in the end we get the sense that the Lord would reward the adultery (I have not read the other books in this series and will never touch another Karen Kingsbury book again). I won't give away the ending. Unfortunately, Ms. Kingsbury tries desperately to write like Francine Rivers and even copies the manner by which she places Scripture but she is far from the gifted writing of Francine Rivers. Francine Rivers actually chooses topics of depth not the trashy romantic novel reinvented in a Christian paperback that I am so sick and tired of....No more Karen Kingsbury for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I am very disappointed with the book. I agree with the original critic - it reads more like a self-help book than a literary novel. The adultery, alcohol described in the book seem very unrealistic and organized to create certain points that the author wants to get across to the reader. I would find it hard to believe if this author has any real understanding of the circumstances that they try to describe in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like sappy, soapy stories this is for you","review":"Unfortunately, I don't like sappy, soapy stories. I gagged my way through the first 20% of this Kindle book, then hopped quickly through to the end. I'm so glad I didn't pay any money for this one; not only is the story soapy, but there's an extreme amount of preaching going on.I read this to take a bit of a break from my usual fare of fast paced thrillers - it served the purpose for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTALLY HARD TO SWALLOW STORY!!!!","review":"POORLY WRITTEN STORY WITH HARD TO SWALLOW FACTS.

It is sad and joyful. It is a reminder that we can rely in God when it feels like our lives have just collapsed. In those times God becomes our life support like never before. Like Kari, we can't see the end of the road so we have to trust our Heavenly Father with the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author and Story","review":"Karen Kingsbury writes so wonderfully about the trials that we deal with in our culture and proves you don't need profanity or vivid \\"love\\" scenes to write a great story.

My mother suggested I did and she was right I loved every chapter and had a hard time putting it down. I am looking forward to each book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption","review":"Great start to a real encouraging series. With such a lot of characters at different stages in their lives we can identify with what they went through and how the choices we make can determine our path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I've read this book multiple times. The first sentence pulls you into the story making it impossible to put the book down (as all good books should). I fell in love with Kari right away and the Baxter family. Kari's story is definitely one most americans in this day and age can relate to and I love that she chooses to do what most would not. This is the first book in a long line of books about the Baxters and as the series expands, Kari is one of the most likeable characters in the series. She shows that love is a decision, not a feeling. And no matter what choices are made, there are consequences that will enevitably follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"You ain't seen nothing yet!","review":"If you liked this book, just wait until you read Remember & Return, the next two books in the series! The first book, Redemption (named after the series), is very good but it starts out slow then builds to an exciting climax. The next two, however, are really the page turners as the characters become better developed and things start to happen at a much faster pace, making for some exciting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Redemption was wonderful! The story flowed nicely and there were many parts that were unpredictable. The story is about a married couple that battles with the consequences of infidelity. The authors do an excellent job of portraying human emotion. There were many powerful lessons in this book about forgiveness, the importance of communicating, and how to love. The one problem I found with the book is that most of the characters were too perfect both physically and otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commonality","review":"Redemption is my second experience with Karen Kingsbury's novels and with Christian fiction as a whole. I was reminded that even (or perhaps especially) believers have the same struggles and temptations as the rest of the world. Besides the fact that nearly every character was notably \\"stunning\\" or \\"gorgeous\\" (thus 1 less star), I was able to relate my own family with the Baxters. I particularly enjoy the series format and the teaser in the end... couldn't wait to get my hands on book #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Liked It","review":"An entertaining view on redemption. I think the author does a great job on getting you inside the character's mindset when trying to overcome a great obstacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series- some spoilers","review":"I have read almost all of Karen Kingsbury's books and I at least like them all. This was the first book by her that I ever read. The story focuses on Kari Baxter, the second eldest daughter in a family of five but also touches on the rest of the family that you learn more about through out the series. Kari has been married to Tim awhile before the story begins and their marriage is definitely in trouble. While Kari struggles with martial problems, Ryan, her high school sweet heart moves back into town. Kari and Tim learn that true love is not just a feeling but deeper commitment and struggle with their individual relationships with Jesus Christ.My only criticisms are the same for many of Karen's books. Sometimes she makes things too neat when real life is messy, though this book's ending is possible it just isn't likely. And then there's her fascination with high school sweet hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!","review":"This was the first book I read by Karen.

I loved the entire book. Just when you thought that you could predict what was going to happen next the book took an unexpectant turn.

For someone like me who spent his early musical years listening to hard rock and heavy metal and then was introduced to funk and r&b ala James Brown, KC & The Sunshine Band, etc. this album is the perfect combination. Stevie Salas is an amazing unknown talent. This album is a series of covers which Stevie picked out and then gathered up many of his musician friends to play on the album with him. Guests include Ritchie Kotzen, Zakk Wylde, Bernie Worrell, and the amazing bass of T.M Stevens (I can not say enough about the funk this guy plays out). I could go on and on about this album, but if you are like me and love listenin to hard funk with great musicianship all around get yourself a copy of this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle soap","review":"I first purchased wool fat soap at The Henge Shop in Avebury, England. Loved it! Each time I use the Mitchell's soap it reminds me of my trip. I have sensitive skin and have had no trouble with this soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable","review":"This lame take on \\"West Side Story\\" -- substitute gays and Latinos in East L.A. for \\"whites\\" and Puerto Ricans in NYC -- is predictable almost from the opening scene. Worse, most of the gay characters exist only for cheap laughs at their stereotyped behavior. It's idiotic. One more thing: In a genre where the DVD jackets bear little resemblance to reality, this one takes fantasy to a new level. The flick's skin quotient is fine, but it's nowhere near as much as the jacket indicates. On the plus side, Rene Alvarado does a nice job, considering a poorly written script that has him alternating between sulking jerk and the perfect boyfriend. (Having said all that, I'm a sucker for any gay romance film, so there were enough threads to make it worth a look -- assuming you rent it rather than buy it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bad story","review":"I not sure what the people who gave this movie a good review where smoking.

The best part of the movie was when the main character takes off his towl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcomes poor film technique","review":"Set in east LA about a gay Latino man, Diego, and his coming out who has hidden furtive encounters with Pablo, a successful real estate broker who lives in denial and loves roleplaying. Anglo homo's are moving in and gentrifying the neighborhood to the concern of many folks. Bianca (formerly Blanca) breezes in from Europe and everything is in place for the free-for-all.It was interesting, and frustrating, to watch the back and forth nature of the plot: Two characters get together...break up...back together... There is some tension between one GWM (a twink from Mississippi) and a hilarious moment with an AA group meeting in his house. Even with the predictability of the plot several characters grew on me, notably the sister who I was ready to kill at the beginning and hug at the end.The movie could have used a better lighting engineer, there were many scenes that were difficult to see because low light was ill aimed. However, it wasn't a deal breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority man with a brain","review":"Although I try to avoid Gay Cinema at all cost because it is usually terrible, I decided to get this movie due to the fact that I saw on a rating that it had four and a half starts. What a bunch of crap and waste of time this is! Geez, can you put any more Mexican and Gay stereotypes in this instulting and derrogatory movie. Give me a brake, what Gay man (especially a Mexican Gay man)really looks like that or acts that way? It is no wonder that gay and straight men grow up with such problems as to the way they look. In addition, I feel that this type of movie creates more danger for gay teens' self-estem that any bigotry and discrimination that straight society can dish at them. In conclusion, if you really want to exercise your mind and feel proud about being Gay or a member of any minority, then watch a creative and well-done movie such as \\"Milk\\" and skip this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the...?!","review":"This movie, and I use the term loosely, was atrocious.

The acting was bad, the writing was bad, the cinematography was bad, the directing was bad and the editing was bad. There was nothing new or exciting about this film.

Plus, it's loaded with beautiful people with great costumes and makeup, and they are having such FUN....If you are used to another Richard video and know his normal moves then get this. It may take awhile to get the moves down but doesn't it always? Plus, it's 40 minutes long. I always thought 1 hour was too much and 30 minutes was too short, this is perfect. The aerobic part was about a half hour and then there was a toning session with \\"cool weights\\" that you can order from Richard but they are just wrist weights you can buy at any Wal-Mart, or do without until you build your arm strenth up.

So the Monkees hold a Fair, and my favorite part in there was Davy singing a nice, but short version of \\"Greensleeves\\". Bernard Fox(He played the Rescue Aid Society Chairmouse in the Rescuers movies) doesn't sing as good as Davy does, anyway. By the way, those episodes had funny lines as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow, compelling folk album","review":"A very low-key, singer-songwritery album, with a strong stylistic similarity to Bert Jansch's solo work. Ashley is an old-time compatriot of the Fairport Convention crew, and as on his older albums, there is a sense of genuine distinctiveness, a feeling that this is indeed a unique, individual voice, an unassuming artistic presence that seems shorn of the professionalism or showmanship of practically any other folk singer you can think of. Features contributions by Brit-folk stalwarts such as Danny Thompson, Simon Nicol, and Robin Williamson -- t may be a little too mellow for some listeners, but it certainly has a genuine allure. Interesting album, definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Things","review":"This is a terrible movie. It looks like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie. I doubt if there was a script. The acting (if you want to call it that) was awful. How this thing made it to DVD is the biggest mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids!","review":"Very gory, keep kids away. Even those that like cheesy movies or B movies may have a hard time with this. It is about some hippies that live in an amusement park/wild west attraction that one hippy inherits from his dead uncle and turns it into a commune. Before you know it they are using drugs, and trying to solve a mystery. The horseman that haunts the place is killing them off one at a time. It is also sold in a two pack with a movie called Carnival of Blood. If you are looking for anything related to the actual Washington Irving story about the headless horseman, it is called the Legend of Sleepy Hollow."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Hippies Make Movies...","review":"...This is the result! A disjointed dog-log of a \\"film\\" about (what else) a guy and his hippie friends who inherit a ranch. An old caretaker soon tells the tale of the headless horseman and his curse, which (supposedly) brings about the deaths of a few of the fuzzy young people. Unfortunately, this is all shot through a home-movie camera by someone who must have seen MANOS and said, \\"Wow! Now THAT'S a movie!\\" While not as mind-scorchingly awful as say, FRANKENSTEIN ISLAND, it's close! Yecch!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Savings on to the Consumer!","review":"At least part of the cost of a magazine subscription is determined by the cost of the materials used in its publication. The cost of paper will do more to influence the price of a newspaper or magazine than anything else. The printing press, the ink, warehouse storage, and finally the cost of actually mailing it out.So why is a digital version, which eliminates all of the materials cost, and most of the delivery cost (pennies for bandwidth) priced the same as or more than the print version?Consumers aren't stupid, and I have no intention of paying for this product until the publishers pass off some of the savings on to the consumers, giving us a financial incentive to go green, instead of trying to take advantage of our desire for convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costs more, quality poor","review":"I have enjoyed Hitchcock and Ellery Queen for many years. The Kindle editions are crude renditions of these high quality publications. The transcriptions are filled with errors, especially replicated lines of text or odd insertions of text as a result of typesetting or scanning artifacts. The magazines include some illustrations, and since the originals are newsprint the monochrome pictures should be beautifully rendered on Kindle. Instead, they are often poorly scaled and blurry or blotchy. Sometimes, a JPEG filename appears instead of the picture.A little proofreading would go a long way. I have canceled my subscriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"long time subscriber","review":"I have loved AHMM for over 2 decades. I will continue to subscribe via Kindle, but fail to understand why it costs more this way. However, it will continue to be worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange substitution","review":"I ordered this item and I was pleased with the prompt delivery. When I opened the box, however, I found a shipping label for the speakers and a set of glassware - drinking glasses, but no speakers. I cannot imagine how that substitution occurred. Amazon says the speakers are no longer available and my money is being refunded, and they want me to ship the glassware back. Unfortunately, I'll never get back all the time this has taken . I should have just driven to the mall and fought the crowds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"Amazing center channel speaker. Ended up buying a second one for another system. Only gripe- the wood grain finish could be a little nicer, but sound wise it's beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally adequate","review":"I picked these up to add to our \\"home theater\\" experience. We have a less than ideal space, ancient main speakers, an ordinary TV, and average technology IQ. These speakers turned out to be totally adequate. They were easy to set up, sound good, look good, and definitely improved the quality of our movie watching. I wouldn't consider them music speakers per se, and wouldn't recommend them to audiophiles, but they are totally adeqaute and inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"Have owned KLH in the past but these are the best. Great sound at a great price and very nice looking too.Am happy to recommend them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable, Great Quality, Discount Price","review":"Not only is this headset affordable, but it's very comfortable to wear and the quality of the components is greater than I would expect. The boom is flexible and can easily adjust to where you need it to be and the headphones sit comfortably on my ears. The adjuster on the wire is a good touch and I've found it useful. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome","review":"After about a weeks of use the audio jack snapped in half for me.. since then i just replaced the wiring with the one from my old set.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I've had this product for a while now and after using it for 15-20 minutes it hurts my ears. All of its weight is supported by the top of your ears and it leaves a dent from the pressure at the top of your ear, right where your glasses would sit.The headphones sound quality is ok, but I have people complain when I'm using the mic that I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Also the spongy mic cover has worn out and fallen off. There are 6 barbs like on a fish hook that held the cover on that are sort of sharp.I'm looking for a different headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre behind the ear fit - the darn thing keeps slipping down","review":"The headset has a great price and is pretty reliable, but it doesn't get a good fit on the listener's ears. It sort of loosely hangs NEAR your ears instead of neatly fitting on your ear like most headsets. Because of this, the quality of the sound of the game, or anything else you are listening to, is significantly diminished. You can hold the ear-pieces against your ears for better sound, but that is so cheesy. It would be a lot better if it fit tightly to your ear without having to use both hands. The behind the ear fit is too loose and doesn't work very well. But aside from that, the device is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad","review":"The microphone stopped working after a week and the headphone frame is really uncomfortable around the ear. I returned it and got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for...?","review":"I bought this product and 20 minutes after using it my ears hurt. Not only that, but the headphones are too big to fit pretty snug yet the mic is too SHORT...so, who is this designed for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"I am still using it. I personally do not like the cord and connector. When you use it for a long period of time, your ears might hurt due to headset's hardness. If the ear support was softer it would have been a 5 stars. Good price and very nice microphone though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset","review":"This headset is excellent not only for games but for VoIP. It works great with services such as GoogleTalk, and TeamSpeak. As well in game works great, and sounds amazing. It has a clip to hook it on to your belt or shirt or something I am guessing though it is pointless. As well it does have a notch holding the headphone and the mic wires together which kind of sucks if your headphone jack and mic jack are far off. But you can counter this by simply hooking it into your speaker jack. And with the 10 ft cord you're never to short to reach anywhere while listening.Great price for what you're getting. And the volume option on the cord is good to have as well, along with the option to turn the mic off. Good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mic can't reach!","review":"This is a really great set of headphones, except that I have a problem getting the microphone to register my voice. When I wear them properly, I have to talk very loudly for the microphone to pick up my voice, and I'm using full gain in the operating system. So, I'm now wearing these around my neck and then extending the microphone up in front of my mouth so people can hear me. I'm running everyone's voice through my regular computer speakers. This works, but clearly it isn't pretty and it isn't the intent of the product. So, I'm looking for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I bought this for playing World of Warcraft and I'm going to have to get a better headset. This one is comfortable enough for extended play, and the sound quality is good, but the primary reason I bought it was because I needed a microphone as well for talking with my friends while playing. The microphone is either not sensitive enough, or the arm is too short - but whatever the problem is, my friends tell me they can barely hear me even when I have the settings up to full."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard of the Ears....But not the sound","review":"I play for long periods of time and I use it for my ventrilo server. After awhile it does tend to pinch the tops of your ears and make them sore, but really all you have to do is readjusted them every so often and they work fine. The sound quality is amazingly good and for the money they are well worth it.I also use it for skype and people say they can hear me better then ever, also highly recommened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh.","review":"If you wear it for a long time, your ears hurt. The sound quality is acceptable, if not, great. The mic volume can be low sometimes, as my friends had to ask me to speak up multiple times.The volume changer that is in the middle of the cord is very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuts ears, bad sound quality","review":"First, the sound quality is very, very poor. In part it may be because the earphones are not adjustable in any way so the ear pieces just half-heartedly cap over your ears. The around-the-back band is loose, and also non-adjustable. I am not sure how the people playing instruments in the ad picture manage to leave them on. The over-the-ear design is horrible; they cut into the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great behind the head headset!","review":"The sound from this headset is really good. This is my second behind the head headset from Logitech. The previous one I had for several years and only replaced because I accidentally dropped and rolled over the earpiece with my chair. Otherwise, I have always been satisfied with the Logitech headsets and for the price, it's an unbeatable value."},{"rating":"1","title":"These will irritate your ears to the point of madness!!!","review":"I recently these from Amazon and I must say that I'm extremely dissapointed in them... They have really weak sound... it's very light on the bass and overall the sound is just not that impressive but the worst thing about them is that because you have to put them behind you ears, it will irritate the hell out of them!!! I had to stop using them because I feared it would've given me blisters...bad sound, bad bass and definately BAD DESIGN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Headphones; Bad Mic","review":"If anyone wants great sound expected from Logitech products, this pair of headphones does the job. But for me, a gamer, these headphones are inadequite.First of all, these headphones take a little getting-used to, but will feel comfortable after a couple days of use. Beware though, the headphones do not come with an adjustable piece which goes behind the head, so some (such as me) may find it very cumbersome with these headphones only secured to your head with the over-the-ear plastic.Secondly, the microphone on the headphones sorely lacks voice recognition: I had to move the microphone right in front of my mouth for it to pick up anything. On top of that, the microphone broke after a couple weeks of use.Overall, I would go to another Logitech product if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Very nice set of headphones, and the mic is great too. Only problem is that it can get hurt your ears to use and the headphones let alot of sound get into the room but other than that it is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"This product looks great in the images here on Amazon and the internet but once you put the headset on, especially if you are wearing glasses, you ears will be killing you by the end of the night. For some reason the headset has a long crack along the part that goes around your head where the wire is held. That is what hurts the user really bad because it sort of cuts into your ear. And after about two months the headset gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-term treasure","review":"Stopped working after 3 months of use. Used it for Skype, but now people on the other end can't hear me.It was good while it lasted, I guess.Overall, not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"The headset works well. The price was cheap. The only downside is that its uncomfortable. My ear turn red after 30min of using the product. It annoys me so much that it discourages me from using it any further. Overall it works fine for its price but as for being comfortable, its hard for me to adapt. Hope this review help those who are seeking a new headset. If you are looking for a cheap, good one... this is fine if you dont mine having red ears. I recommend those who are looking for a headset to be highly comfortable with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine, earphones a tiny bit uncomfortable","review":"So functionality is great on this headset, but it is a little bit uncomfortable to wear after about 2 hours. I have a big head though, so people with normal-sized heads shouldn't have a problem at all. Given the price, this is a great deal though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not structurally sound.","review":"The door of my PC case closed on the wire, and almost severed it. I admit this was my fault, however I would think it should be just a little more rugged than that. My friends said the sound quality through Ventrillo was terrible (they frequently asked me to repeat myself at many different volume settings), before and after the cord issue. Additionally I too had issue with my glasses, and the headset not being comfortable. I ended up having to go to a store and buy a different headset to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch!","review":"Things things KILLLL my ears. Whoever designed them is a dumb*ss. 30mm drivers...so the sound is not good. Well, good enough for video games I guess, but invest 30 more dollars for something that sounds good."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!NOT FOR PS3!!!","review":"Despite showing up under an Amazon search for \\"PS3 HEADSET\\" this item is completely incompatible with a PS3 (it uses 2.5 jacks, not USB). The item would have been fantastic had I needed a PC Headset, which I don't.Nothing against the product, just more against Amazon for mis-labelling a product. I had to return it. Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Carefully","review":"I bought this headset for what it was. When I got it-- and wore it-- it made my ears hurt the way it's worn.I'm saying this: I'm not wearing it wrong and it makes my ears hurt. I'm disappointed with this product; they could have produced something a little more ergonomic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I use this headset with Ventrillo so I talk talk with guildmates playing WoW.Pros: Comfortable for long gaming sessions, Quality of sound reception is clear, very little to no background noise, mute switchCons: Covers both ears so so muffles computer speaker system, mic on the left side so cord drapes across chest unless computer is to the left of the desk (great for southpaws!),gets in the way of glasses(kind of but not really, the least of worries)Over all, great headset! I have been very satisfied with what I got and recommend it. I would say though, don't pick it up from Amazon directly, the third party vendors affiliated with Amazon offer a better price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, but lacks a shelf life.","review":"The Logitech Extreme PC Gaming Headset is a fairly cheap headset. It works well for what it needs to do, but it also doesn't have a shelf life. What I mean by this, is you can expect to see it fail after 6-12 months of use. I had about seven of these headsets and I've since stopped using them after they all failed within a year.I'd recommend it for a casual gamer, but for nothing else. This isn't the kind of headset you can use daily and expect to still work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone is pretty much useless.","review":"The sound on the headphone is decent, especially considering the price.However, I've been trying to use these with Ventrilo and other voice-chat programs and the microphone is barely audible. I've turned up all the microphone settings both in the system control panel and on my sound card's control panel without any luck. No-one can understand what I am saying unless I really shout into the microphone and even then only occasionally.I tried to see if Logitech's website had any hints but they don't list this product on their site. In fact, it looks like they're trying to pretend they never made this sorry excuse for a microphone headset.If you want to listen only, these are probably fine. However, if you want to be able to use the microphone, you shouldn't consider this product. Choose something where the company's website AT LEAST admits the product exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I was looking for a headset to use with skype. The sound quality of this headset was great. However, after about 30 min of wear, the fit was quite uncomfortable and the minimal adjustments it allows didn't make it any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadjustable","review":"Sound quality is fine. Don't know how well the mic works, but other reviews indicate that it's is fine.However the only fit adjustment available is the mic on a ratcheted swivel. If you are tall, say six feet or more, and have a typical build or if you are just built heavily these are definitely not the headphones for you. You end up with poor earpiece placement so regardless of the sound quality you can't hear that well. Then the arm that goes over your ear ends up pinching. Finally the band squeezes the back of your skull to the point of headaches in short order.Top that off with packaging that must be destroyed before you can get the product out results in arguments when trying to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find that this product is very good, and suits my needs.","review":"This product is good because, its nice and light,it has good sound, and it suits my needs for what I do,and and I've notice that a lot of TV people use it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS-- 3 times microphone stopped working","review":"My boyfriend bought two of these headsets for us to use as a V-day gift. We got them on the 15th of February, and today is the 23rd. My microphone stopped working on the 18th, and Amazon sent me a replacement headset. My boyfriend's microphone stopped working on the 21st, and my NEW headset's microphone just stopped working today.Honestly? If it's not a mouse, don't buy anything from Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent value, but you can do better.","review":"Still a fairly decent headset for the price, it picks up audio very well, but best when there is no background noise (obviously). I use this to record podcasts, and it definately does the job nicely.HOWEVER - if you are looking for a headset for gaming purposes, you can literally get the improved model of this headset for the same price or cheaper at Wal*Mart, so I would recommend going that rout. Also, it is true what the review say about the behind-the-head design. If you wear glasses, this could be a problem, and extended use beging to hurt your ears.All in all, I am still happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work with PS2!!!!!","review":"I bought this headset after doing a search under \\"USB Headset\\" this device popped up...so I assumed of course it was usb...it is not, it has standard pc jacks!!!

I'm more in pain since I use glasses.:("},{"rating":"1","title":"good stuff... [not actually so on re-reviewing after longer use]","review":"Bought in October 2006.Performance wise the headset is definitely worth its cost and more...but i do find the headphones a little uncomfortable around the ear as my ears begin to pain in a while of wearing the headphones... my friend who bought the same thing with me finds it comfortable though.Barring this problem (which actually is quite critical), i think it is a great product worth more than the price amazon is offering it at. - 3 stars[On re-reviewing on 10/20/08 I would give this only a 2 star out of 5, though I am not able to change my previous rating.

Some might say that it is flimsy, but I'd rather have the weaker plastic on it, so it's not crushing my ears. The microphone is very flexible, and I've been told it has a clear quality.

Reading the reviews on Amazon, I expected the subwoofer to be weak (it is), but I expected the speakers to be good to excellent. They are fair. This is actually the first item in my multi-year history as an Amazon shopper that I am going to the trouble to return. The speaker system I ordered for my computer sounds better. If you just need a cheap system that's better than the speakers on your TV, this might be good for you. Otherwise, shop around and maybe spend just a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Georgia novel","review":"Definitely one of my new favorite authors, Charles Martin paints a beautiful picture of my home state.

Yes it was sweet and kind of sappy, but it was also very well written. It had a great flow that kept me turning pages to find out what would happen next. The characters were presented very well and honestly it would be hard to say exactly which one I loved the most.I'm certainly not a doctor, but I thought the medical information used was well done and greatly enhanced the story. Did I predict how it would end? Probably, but one can always hope. Hope and faith was what this story was all about!5 Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Oh, how good this book sounded! I read a review in a Christian newspaper and quickly ordered it. After introducing the main characters, the author introduces a secret history that any 7th grade reader will figure out within the first 30 pages. While some secrets revealed early will only make a reader long for the details, this one doesn't. The story lacks any nuance, subtlety or intrigue. Some books are merely a disappointment, this was upsetting for the fact that it was even published and got the press."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't end a book don't start one","review":"This book was an interesting, captivating page turner and I could hardly wait to find out the ending. Unfortunately the ending was a confusing,unrewarding, empty let down that pretty much turned reading the bookinto a exercise in futility. I would not recommend this book to anyonewho does a lot of reading. The best book I've read this year is Peace Like a River. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Syd's Opinion","review":"I liked this book, and I didn't like this book. I liked the author's views on pornography--I totally agreed with him. I loved the way the little girl prayed, and the importance that the author put on our relationship with God, and that in the end, God is really the one calling the shots. I loved the love story of the doctor and his wife--the fact that it lasted literally a lifetime. I loved the doctor and the fact that he gave his whole life away trying to help others. I loved the way the story was arranged and how he kept me guessing. On the other hand, I was a little confused by the chapter when the little girl \\"died.\\" I didn't know what happened--I went back and read it several times to see if I had missed something. I had hoped for a little romance between the aunt and the doctor, but that story line was left hanging. I would like to read more of his books.

Later, I received a note from ANTOline that explained that their system is FULLY AUTOMATED and that they had sent someone \\"running down to shipping\\" to try to stop the order. I ordered the bags on Sunday. They notified me of shipping on Wednesday that they had SHIPPED the order, apparently having taken some three days to try to stop the order.

All the books in the \\"Winning Chess\\" strategies are excellent and the serious, developing tournament player will benefit by carefully reading through all of them. What I liked about this book in particular is that it is never dull and does not inundate the reader with complex examples. Each position or game chosen clearly illustrates the point of chess strategy that is being made.I read this after reading Silman's \\"Reassess Your Chess\\" (another excellent book), which is probably why this book was easier to read through.

I have been lately getting into Bardo Pond, FSA, and Roy Montgomery. I also just picked up some Charalambrides at Other Music in NYC. In addition to rounding out my collections of such artists, this collection introduced my ears to Loren Mazzacane Conners. I find all of the music represented here hard to categorize. Space rock, experimental rock, avant rock, etc. Whatever you wish to call it, this music is transcendental, transportive (if that's a word), and trance-inducing. It's also very challenging (at times) and very rewarding. This \\"sampler\\" is also an easy/efficent way to jump into this type of sound.

I used to be a regular walker, but had gotten out of the habit (been about 10 years). I was impressed with the low impact aspect of the series, as it is easier on the joints. The belt is fun, but breaks easily. I'm tall, and ripped one of the bands right off. Got a new one, but the construction is poor. These videos will make you break a sweat. The good news is that the Surgeon General recommends 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week. This is an easier way to get that, plus lose a few pounds. Once you get used to the moves, you can turn the sound down enough to just hear the instructions and play your own music. She sure is chipper, but truly trying to help people. Over all, worth the cost of the videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great workout....","review":"I have been a fan of Leslie Sansone's workout tapes forsome time. I especially like this set. The pacing of theexercise is faster than her \\"Walk Away the Pounds\\" tapes froma year or so ago. Even though the workout is the same lengthit feels like you are done faster. These tapes have a greaterfocus on the exercises and less of Leslie's patter thatI know others have found anoying on other tapes. The exercisebelt that is included is a fine tool. On occasion I substituteher weighted balls because I think that they work the arms betterthan the bands on the belt. I highly recommend these tapes toanybody who is just starting out on a fitness regime, peoplewho are not good at mastering difficult choreography, and anybodythat finds workout tapes intimidating. Leslie is a very likeableeasy instructor to follow and the other participants on thetape have a variety of body types. There are no spandex princesses on this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Two years ago I weighed 350 lbs and had health problems.

The tapes are so easy to follow, you can do them in the privacy of your home in air conditioning with a small amount of space.

Combined with healthy eating, I'm using Leslie's tapes and losing weight. I started with the one mile tape, but I was finding that when it was over, I could still do more (plus she chats way to much). I'm doing the 2 mile tape now with the belt and it's perfect. I'm getting a great workout, without spending too much time on it, I don't have to get dressed and go anywhere and I feel great!

The belt is scratchy unless I tuck my shirt into it, which is hard when some of my exercise shirts are short...Overall, I REALLY like it though... for me it was worth the money. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The belt! A goofball sales gimmick!","review":"Leslie Sansone is the queen of in-home walking. Some of her walking tapes are great, that is some! But since her entire regime involves walking, there isn't much else to do but create more walking videos, right? So, how do you sell more videos about walking, plain old walking??? I know! Add goofball gimmicks, like a belt with cheap bands. Come on now, how ridiculous is this?The belts have very weak rubber bands. They don't support the strain of pulling; they break easily. Once broke, the set is worthless.Also, the music is horrible! It's noise!The walking is low impact, including her powerwalking 3 miles tape. It isn't strenuous.

Wait for something better!","review":"sitting on top will hurt you because of its poor design. The bottom part should reach another inch and a half to the front.Could at least be another inch longer on main part top to bottom too. In my opinion, Doc Johnson should offer at least 3 sizes of this toy because anyone over 4 ft. tall might find this toy uncomfortable in certain positions. Also the top part on the longest part could be just a little thicker in circumference and instead of a dumb handle for the bottom that robs another inch of fun and adds to the discomfort, it should be a flared base instead! Bottom line, wait for an improved version and don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!!","review":"Much better than the Aneros. Does exactly what a prostate massager is supposed to do. Withen 2 minutes after insertion I had cum dripping out of my penis without it being touched.

I highly recommend it over the Aneros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"The Mens Pleasure Wand is small which made inserting really easy. It fit Snug which made for handsfree. The only thing it didn't do is actually hit the prostate. The Pleasure Wand has a really strong quiet vibration which makes you sphincters vibrate which is a good sensation. Before i got my Pleasure Wand, i thought the body of it would be soft but when i got it and held it, the plastic is really hard. The Device looks as if the vibrator is just a normal bullet with a control, molded into a men's prostate toy. Over all for it being advertised as a prostate massager, it didn't satisfy the job for me. The good side of this is that its inexpensive, ships fast, and arrives discretly. shipped within 4 days of my order date, love the fast delivery, if only the device can deliver what its promise to do.On a sidenote i have only used it once, i will use it again to see if results change and i will add more information."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit working after 3 uses","review":"This prostate massager only worked three times. first would not turn off without removing the batteries then quit all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most sentimental and straightforward of all the Hamsun novel I've read, but it was still very enjoyable.","review":"I especially liked the second half of the book. The plot is typical of Hamsun, featuring obsessive love, self-destructive behavior, and characters who try to deny the things that they want most and do the opposite of what they should do. However, the level of Hamsun's distinctive craziness (e.g., midgets, neuroses, nervous breakdowns, harelips, murder) is much more subdued in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Containers only...","review":"Maybe nobody else is as goofy as me, but I thought this product had paint in it.

I didn't even get very far. It sounds wonderful, a book about some of the greatest Christian minds. It reads like a 4th-graders research paper. Muggeridge inserts so much of his own thoughts and experiences its almost like we're reading his biography. His bios of these brilliant men are muddled, not described chronologically or in any other apparent order. If you want a VERY basic overview of these men, maybe this book is for you. If you actually have the intelligence to read anything written by any of them - this book is far beneath you."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely scratches the surface","review":"The writers reviewed here in this work are great men of faith and explorers of truth.

Even after going through tutorials and guidebooks, I still found it slow going. I finally got a copy of the new version of Sibelius and am just floored by how much better I like it. As a Mac user, I especially appreciate the ease and aesthetics of the Sibelius user interface. Plus, there are some Sibelius-specific features that are just really thoughtful (especially the Ideas palette -- great for sketching out compositions or saving alternative melodies). Music notation software is expensive: do yourself a favor and try both before committing."},{"rating":"1","title":"most un-user friendly music notation program","review":"Unbelievably hard to use. It takes forever to input notes, simple things like chord symbols are difficult to figure out, and figuring the layers part is impossible.Get Sibelius or wait until something better comes out.

However, as a librarian, I am appalled that my professional journals rated this so highly- I will never give this to anyone without making sure that they know there is offensive, outdated language in it. To hand this to a child who is dealing with adoption issues and not preparing them for passages such as \\"some adopted kids just consider them\\" (adoptive parents) \\"their real parents\\".... \\"why she gave you away\\" is cruel. I hope that future editions will have better editing so that the true value of the book is accessible. Overall, it is well written, organized and teen accessible....except for those passages that would be a slap in the face to the adoptee reading them. This is a book to be used by teens on their own.

It is battery operated with no on/off switch! If in the woods for any period of time you must remove the battery to conserve and then reinsert and recalibrate. Ridiculous. Would be difficult in the rain, snow or very cold temperature or if dropped in the snow.2.Directions for setting this unit up is very cumbersome and you would have to carry the directions because they are so complicated. If you took battery out to conserve then it would have to be set up and recalibrated everytime.

They had never used compasses before, let along digital ones. We showed them how to press the mode button to get to the compass function and to hold it flat. They had absolutely no trouble using them, one of our groups even took first place in the challenge! The only reason I docked the units a star is that it seems silly to have alarm clocks and other functions built in, but not to include a battery saving on-off switch. That said, it is a rather simple matter to insert the battery upside down for long periods of no use.These compasses are very accurate, easy to read, and well worth the $15 we paid for them. If kids who have never used a compass can take one of these and win an orienteering challenge on their first go, then it serves its purpose well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sightless","review":"Concur on the complex setup and nearly unreadable instructions.

(The best thing? \\"Button D\\" actually takes more letters than even MODE. What was the writer thinking? Why did he bother?)Only a dim, blurry photo relates labels to letters on the instruction sheet.This is typical of the user interface and the instructions.Even more important is the lack of both a sight, with which to find the heading to a distant object; and a straightedge, to align with a map.One star, because no matter how accurate it is, it's useless if it can't be operated or read.

The Cook's Illustrated people like it very much, and other alternatives are more expensive and have significant disadvantages. I love the capacity, and I like having a glass rather than plastic pitcher.Perfect? Hardly. The base of the blade is made of weak plastic, and the lid has mysterious, badly designed holes that one tries to keep covered while blending. It could be quieter and the motor could be less buzzy.

She needed a replacement for a similar brush no longer made.Just a heads up that others might find the brush too stiff to use. I gave the brush 4 stars because otherwise it seems like a good product.

It was not made well at all in my opinion for the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap.","review":"Snapped in two with the first use. It's made with particle board.

I have purchased four back brushes in the last few months. Three have broken almost immediately. Each was made in China and, after close examination, they are made of very thin material under the rubbery grip. This one has not broken yet, but it is made in China and has very thin material under the grip (same location the others broke). The brush itself is rather nice, but the wood brush area split after the first use and bristles are beginning to fall out. I give it another week at most. I think Fuller, while very expensive, is probably the best value. Stores need to recognize the junk and stop pushing it to us as consumers.

Yeap - for the price. I'm actually getting another one as I write this review. UPDATE 2/12/2012 - Well the one I purchased in 9/2011 just broke - and get this - at the same spot as the last one.

Anytime I need Adobe Help, I have to minimize Adobe, click on the special desktop icon, and then go in search of the specific item I need help on.

(I have replaced the cables with Monster brand and bought a new DVD recorder so I KNOW it has to be the TV). I'm reluctant to take it to a service center at this point since sometimes it works fine.

It also describes how elite students are socialized for power; and how their social contacts and schools help them gain acceptance to the best colleges and, later, into the best jobs, with the full complicity of the college admissions officers.

This book did nothing of the sort. Instead, it repeatedly stated the importance of volunteering for your community.

The only substantive padding on this thing is on the borders; the body of the bedding (where the animal mainly lays on) has almost no padding to speak of! I should have heeded the warnings from some other reviewers. Also, the material of the bed sheds very easily, creating a potential of the animal ingesting the small furballs and the negatives that come with that.

One accident from my puppy, and it would be game over. What are they thinking, not waterproofing or making it all washable???This is not poofy. It is soft and fuzzy and the dog does like to rest her head on the bolster. Best of all, all of it goes in the washing machine. Bing bang, done.

Most of the time she just uses it as a relatively comfy seating area when she grooms herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits the Firstrax Port-A-Crate","review":"I bought the 24 by 18 bed to go inside the 24 by 16 version of the Firstrax Port-A-Crate The pad fits inside the crate perfectly. I've had them both for 2 weeks but our newly adopted dog just started sleeping in there tonight so I can't say anything about durability or fuzz flaking off. It feels plenty cushy to me and the price was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bed!","review":"I love how soft this bed is, and how BIG it is!I was pleasantly surprised about the size. I thought it would be much smaller.More importantly my puppy LOVES this bed!The only thing I don't like is how easily fuzzes come off, but my dog does try to dig a hole in it sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Bed is extremely soft and comfortable, and also is very machine washer- and drier-friendly. We've washed it about 5 times since we've had it and shows absolutely no signs of wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Improved","review":"Purchased this bed as a bundle with Giant airline crate and water bowls. This bed is not ideal for crate use - it has a satin fabric bottom that slides everywhere. A fleece bottom would have made more sense. Also, this size is way too small for Giant kennel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bed","review":"This was the second bed I purchased for my dog. He is a lab and fits in there well. He seems to like this bed much more than the previous bed he had."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it!","review":"We were looking for a replacement dog bed for Trixie. She has a good bed in the bedroom, but during the winter we wanted another for the living room. We had looked at several on line but for a large dog they can be $100 or more including shipping. This is an excellent alternative. It was modestly priced, arrived promptly and shipping was free. Wish the base was a little thicker, but the bolsters are excellent. We threw a fleece cover over it -- cream colored bed, black dog -- and it's perfect. She loves the bed and uses it for lounging around family in the evenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's better than a hardwood floor, but not by much.","review":"My dogs will lounge on hardwood floors just to be around people, so at least this can take the chill off during the winter months, but if you're looking for a plush bed or crate pad, this isn't it. Within days of using this inside my dogs' crates, the bottom layer of cushion had essentially disappeared. The only fluff left was in the side bolsters. One of my dogs still used the bolster as a pillow, but the other decided to chew on it and had all the stuffing out in minutes. These beds, even at the largest dimensions, can easily be tossed in the washer, but that's really the only good thing I can say about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This item came much sooner than expected. It is much softer than the previous mat I had in my puppy's kennel. I checked a local pet store to see what the 48x30 mat would cost and it was $61.00-- And this one's quality was so much better. It has more chushion on the bottom than I expected and was nice and fluffy. Very pleased with this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bed","review":"I now have three of these pet beds for all three dogs. Three sizes. The little dog (17# )uses his in his crate and loves it. It fits perfect in his crate. The two other dogs (30# and 85#) use theirs on the floor. It gives them a soft comfy place to lay. They like the turned up sides to put their heads on too! I wash them ( I have a front load washer) about once per week to keep them from collecting too much fur, and they wash and dry great! I even find the cats snuggled up on them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect bed for my pup","review":"My puppy loves this bed. I purchased it because I knew she would be growing quickly (8 weeks old) and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a bed she may grow out of quickly. It is made of minimal material but still soft on the base and around the sides. Sides hold up very well and do not flatten with use. I will probably buy a larger version of this bed once she grows out of this one.Another added benefit is it's light weight and very easy to carry around if you travel with your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintegrating","review":"It seems to be molting.

But we have it inside next to our bed and the thing sheds blue fuzz like crazy. Would be best outside or in a crate, not on your carpet or other flooring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I really like this bed. It's the first one my Great Dane puppy did not destroy. And, it looks nice compared to the other beds I looked at, since the dog bed is in my living room. Also, this is one of the few that come in a giant size if you are looking for a large crate bed. Awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fleece sheds worse than the dog . . .","review":"The fleece fiber comes off and gets all over the house.

Not a penny more. I am constantly having to vacuum because the fleece material falls off of the bed! My dog does not chew, so I know it's just the poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Bed","review":"This bed is the perfect size.

I've had this product before and have been pleased with it -- needed it for a soft crate I'd ordered and it fits well in the crate and give some nice comfy edges for the dog with the rolled edge. There isn't much padding on the bottom, and I usually just spread a light fleece over the bottom, but it probably isn't necessary. Also depends on where the crate is sitting and whether I'm using a ground pad under my crates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product","review":"Fleece balls up and is everywhere.

Will not purchase from Midwest again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped to shreds.","review":"The picture makes the bed look alot more sturdy than it really is. I have a chihuahua that is very active and loves to chew and romp around. I was disappointed at how flimsy this was when I opened the box. After having this for a week, my dog has almost shredded this thing. He has other beds that he likes to chew on that have outlasted this. Overall, poor quality. Very thin. I think he ripped it apart because it was not very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crate bed","review":"We bought one of these for our traveling soft crate. It's a very thin bed, but the fact that it's machine washable has made it a great addition whenever we need to go anywhere with our shiba.

It is very well made and soft. The color is very nice. It will be easy to keep clean. My cat loves it! I have many of these pet beds around for both my dog and cat. They love each one of them! You can't go wrong with this pet bed, no matter what size you choose, or what pet you are purchasing it for. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great except for the fuzzies","review":"This is a really good dog crate bed. It's the second one I bought (I also have a smaller one to fit my smaller crate). I primarily wanted one that would fit the whole crate to protect the crate bottom and this fits the bill. My dog really loves laying against the raised siding. My only complaint is that it produces lots of fuzzies that I find in the bed and around the room, even after multiple washings. But they're easy enough to pick up. I would certainly buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent replacement","review":"I purchased this bed to replace the one I bought with my pup's kennel a year ago. It doesn't fit perfectly, but it was clean and soft and my dog loved it... until she tore two holes in it the first day.Definitely not the product's fault, and a few pillow cases have prevented any similar destruction for a few weeks now.Quality product for the price, and I'd give it five stars if it was offered in a size that better fit my dog's kennel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed even for the most finickiest of cats","review":"I got this for my 16 year-old cat who is extremely picky. She absolutely loves it! The funny thing is that she purrs when she sleeps in it, which is something she rarely does. I can't believe how much she has taken to it.I would recommend putting some cat nip in the bed when first introducing it to your cat as a way of letting your cat know its for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent...","review":"This product fits great in the MidWest crate and it helps make the crate feel softer and cozier. I did not give it 5 stars because I feel that it could have stood to use some more filling since it feels a little flat. This pet bed is alright when used along with a nice soft blanket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow so nice, need one in my size!","review":"This bed is not only visually appealing it is perfect for any pet. I would say up to 30lbs as most pets do like to curl up. I was actually surprised at the size and quality. It truly is a great product. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I got this fleece bed for my pit bull puppy when he was 10 weeks old. The padding is almost non-existent and it shedded like crazy. He is now 10 months old and the bed is still in his crate, only because it's softer than the hard plastic, but I wouldn't recommend it. For when he's outside of his crate, he has a chew-resistant bed with which I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and cozy","review":"it looks nice and cuddly but cat doesnt bother with it..however she doesnt bother with the expensive pole/playground, 80 percent of the toys, most catnip and being called, begged or bribed. However it looks like a normal cat would like it alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was okay while it lasted.","review":"Our dog decided that this bed was a good chew toy, and unfortunately the bed didn't have much to offer in the way of defense. Overall the bed is very thin and flimsy, not much padding at all. The sides were chewed out so easily, I woke up one morning (about 2 weeks after getting the bed) to find all of the stuffing ripped out and the fleece was all torn apart. Needless to say it went in the garbage and I won't be buying another one for our dog.This may not be a problem if your dog doesn't chew, but ours does, and it is a problem that he can destroy it so easily. Looks like we need to invest in something a bit higher in quality next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shed fluff constantly!","review":"We bought this bed for our puppy to use inside a Midwest Crate. While the stitching and seams held up great to multiple washings and her chewing, after about the fourth wash it started to shed its fuzz. The constant clumps of fluff coming off of it were really annoying, but I could have dealt with it if the pup wasn't insistent on eating it all. No amount of my trying to get all the loose fluff off of it seemed to help, it just constantly shed. After only two months, we've decided to toss it. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Retriever Approved","review":"This bed is well liked by my 75lb golden retriever - it is the perfect size for him. The construction is fine considering the low price. As long as he doesn't decide to turn it into a chew toy at some point, I think it will last quite a while. It can easily be rolled up for travel use too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"My 5 month beagle mix has destroyed this already.

A very cheap imitation of the real thing....I have 4 mats that I purchased 2 years ago with regular washing that are in better condition than the 4 I purchased from Amazon late February...buyer beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough cushion","review":"After reading all the positive reviews I chose this bed over others. I must tell you this the color is wonderful but the bed falls way short of what I expected. If your dog loves a soft bed DO NOT purchase this bed. I am having to use a blanket in order for her to be comfortable in the bed other wise she will not use it. So if it's comfort your little fur baby requires DO NOT purchase this. I found one the exact same size to fit my crate at Big Lots and it has about 6 inches of padding in the bottom for the same price that I purchased this on for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was initally impressed with this bed and our 6-month old boxer liked it. It fit in her crate nicely. But after several days of use, it started shedding and in less than a month it was useless. The material is very thin and ripped easily exposing the stuffing in the bolster. Our boxer is not a destructive dog; this just did not hold up well under normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Within days of receiving this product it began to fall apart. I ordered two of them and it happened to both. The last dog bed of this type that we had lasted for 7 years. I doubt these will last 7 weeks.

Would not purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG MESS!","review":"At first I thought these were great--perfect liners for our dog kennels. It didn't take long before I started finding little fuzzies all over the house, stuck in the rugs so badly that the vaccuum wouldn't get them out. The fleece from the beds just falls off, my dogs weren't even scratching it apart or destroying the beds, they just fell apart on their own. Then I made the bad decision to put the beds in my van for a trip. Holy cow--I will never get the fleece fuzzies out of my vehicle!!! What a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks down easily","review":"This bed is perfectly sized for a kennel however, my lab mix puppy destroyed it almost immediately.

Our other dogs loved the coolaroo beds but our new dog (thin and nervous) wouldn't get on the raised bed at all. Finally purchased this bed and she loved it immediately. She stayed on it for 12 hours straight. It took two days before our other pup even got a chance to try it out. Now I'm ordering a larger one for him. I haven't washed it yet but I did order the fleece version b/c of the other reviews. Being able to wash the bed was a huge selling point.

So it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cushy","review":"This is a nice addition to my puppy's crate - the softness, fit - but it doesn't have any cushiness in the bottom of the bed. The fabric is nice like the sides, but the cushiness of the sides needs to also be on the bottom. It is thin and rests on the hard plastic of the crate bottom. I put a folded blanket in with the bed to make it more comfy, but that makes the crate too small and uneven.. I also had some shrinkage when I washed and dried it. Some reviewers said they liked the padded edge, but my puppy can't rest his head there - he's then up against the wire of the crate sides. All that said, my puppy hasn't complained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad quality fleece","review":"I'm adding one more vote to the bad fleece comments. After less than three weeks of use the half of the bed our puppy had access to is threadbare.

Once i got it open and put it down for my dog, the fleece fuzz was just falling off it with every thouch. I actually had to take it away from my dog because he liked to lick it and chew it a little and the fuzz was just getting everywhere and i was afraid of him ingesting some and causing problems.

He has been sleeping in it practically all day every day for a couple weeks now.Our cat has the weird habit of biting/sucking on the edge as he kneads. He is 3, and he wasn't weaned unusually early, but I guess it makes him regress. It's kind of cute, but I'm glad this thing is machine washable!

Although I would like to find a -not so flat- bed for my Pup; Because he usually sleeps on a satin pillow that is cushionier then this. This is actually just a little flatter then i expected but for the price what do I expect. It's just that all the super nice cushy beds are up to $90? Don't ask me why...

It fits perfectly in the crate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bed for a short while","review":"This bed was great for about 6-8 weeks. I washed it a few times, and now it is shedding white \\"fur\\" like crazy. It sticks to the dog and there are tufts of the fleece all over the kitchen as well as the living room carpet.

If your dog is at all mischievous like mine they will tear this thing apart.Even when my pup isn't trying fluff gets all over the house, when she wakes up in the morning there will be small balls of the bedding all over her feet and mouth. The bolster for the head rests are nice, but there is almost zero padding where they lay their bodies.If the bed did not shed so much, it would be great, but for me it is just 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought this for my dog's crate. The size is perfect for his little crate. I don't think this pet bed is really meant for daily sleeping use. The bottom doesn't have a lot of padding. But it's good for when my dog needs to stay in the crate. It provides some padding aside from the hard plastic. You can wash this pet bed in the washing machine, so it's super convenient. The only problem I have is that my dog's hair is stuck in the fleece. I've tried many ways to get it out, but it's rather difficult. So it doesn't look very appealing at the moment with the pet hair stuck in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed, Cinnamon, 36\\" x 23\\"","review":"do not waste your money it is cheap trash worth 5 dollars max it cost more to return it than its worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Thin and non-durable.

It is actually one very thin sheet of \\"fleece\\" fabric with a bottom layer of crunchy, noisy plastic type of fabric.This equals no padding at all, except for the side bolsters. The sound makes my dog crazy. Before this one I had a smaller Precision brand crate pad (when he was a puppy. I would highly recommend that brand over this cheap immitation.

I just washed one and pieces of fleece were coming off it when I brushed it with my hand! Wow! This used to be a dependable, high quality product..

This is the large (42x26) bed and is in the crate with the divider in place which fits fine. The bed is not very thick but my pup goes right in his crate and seems very comfortable on this bed. The rounded soft sides on this bed are really what my dog seems to like. He almost always sleeps with his head propped up on the side or has his neck on the side and his head hanging over. If the sides were any higher I doubt that would be comfortable to him. As far as durability goes, we have washed the bed three times so far in our front loading washer and it looks like brand new, no wear and tear at all. I think this is a great value for putting in a crate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed beyond belief!","review":"I have had Midwest Quiet Time Pet Beds since I got my puppies in 2003. I had mostly used the Fleece ones but then I found the Gray ones and they were perfect. They helped hide the dirt and stains. Then in June I saw the Cinnamon ones and decided it would look better. I purchased 2 of 36 x 23 beds....from the beginning they started shedding. I washed them several times hoping that they would stop shedding. My dogs always had fuzz on them and it was all over the house. After a few weeks of washing them thinking they would stop shedding, there were some bare spots. This was the worst product I ever bought. I was so disappointed in this product.

I even tried kind of \\"combing\\" some of the fuzz out with my finger tips to get rid of it, but it just kept shedding fleece -- from nickel-sized balls of it up to half-dollar sized ones!

After 2 weeks, I put it back in her pen and put an old towel on top & she no longer had the urge to dig.If I get another one down the road, I won't get the fleece option.

What can I say, the quality is nowhere near the Deluxe pet bed.

I grew up reading the Christy Miller series and then later the Sierra Jensen series. Departures is a story that was rediscovered by the author Robin Jones Gunn this year as she was packing up boxes to move. The story was only available for a short while and so Robin decides to make it available again. The book has 2 parts. In the first story, we follow Christy Miller as she has just said goodbye to Todd. She joins her family on a vacation back to the Midwest and we see her encounter a long lost crush. It's a fun, lighthearted story of Christy depending on the Lord and finding herself in the process. In the second story, we watch Sierra Jensen as she goes on vacation with her friend Jana. Sierra doesn't feel ready to grow up and be involved in relationships. We watch as she comes to peace with who she is and what God has in store for her.

For the most part, the book comes from the perspective of Powell and Cheney, with important additions from other key folks at the Pentagon and White House.The beauty of reading about the GHW Bush Administration is that one also learns about the GW Bush Administration, for many of the key players came back for an encore.Woodward did a top notch job of discussing important issues in a way that appeals to the general reader.

Colin Powell is a hero and a great pragmatic man, which mkes me long for the pre-Clinton days. History would be much different if Goerge the 1st stayed in power just 4 more years.

Compared with this recording, all other performances of Beethoven's piano and cello sonatas are eclipsed. And the reason is obvious: these artists are playing from the heart and not from the score in front of them. Mr Perenyi and Mr Schiff play these sonatas as possessed by a musical demon and an angel: tender when needed (seldom in Beethoven's music!) and tremendously ardent in the passages where Beethoven is himself.The artistry of these virtuoso musicians is of the highest level in these recordings. The sound quality is excellent. It looks as if a higher power than human made such a recording possible - everything in it is elevated.

Then I was mad that I'd spent time reading it. The ending just does not fit the build up, and is a major let down.There appeared to be excellent research into the the historical time period. The swiftly changing political structure was presented in a manner that fit the story and provided the reader a framework to understand how certain books were seen as dangerous, politically threatening or valuable assets. However, the mysterious quest that the \\"hero\\" goes on ends up being laughable. It seemed to be used more for the author to demonstrate his understanding of the political structure of the times.I would recommned \\"The Name of the Rose\\" instead of this book.

What I discovered was that it is entirely possible for the same author to write both fabulous non-fiction, and one of the most appalling pieces of fiction I've ever read in my life. I forced myself to stick it out to the end, convinced that it simply HAD to get better. But the ending was so ridiculously stupid that I actually had to go back and read it again, because I was sure that I must have read it wrong (I hadn't).

I started reading this book expecting to have the intriguing and intellectual experience of \\"The Name of the Rose\\"...and was so terribly disappointed. King is certainly knowledgeable, but that knowledge creates a jumble of a book. One gets the feeling that King would rather try to impress us by the breath of his knowledge, rather than the depth and more so, rather than give us a story that holds our interest. Just sound and fury signifying nothing. His characters are poorly developed stick figures, and by the time I was 3/4 of the way through, I really found I no longer cared about the mystery at the heart of it. How boring was it?

It is meritorious on two levels. First, it is a gripping account of ocean racing in fierce storm conditions, and secondly, it is a dramatic series of the personal stories of the various people who survived, died, completed the race, and won the race. Most memorable was the author's description of media tycoon Ted Turner (who was at the time also an expert sailor) and his response to the race and it's disastrous aftermath.

Some sailors called it a freak storm, others said anyone taking a sailboat to sea should always expect the unexpected.

I found this to be wrong ...It does not play any of the rewritable DVD formats, like DVD-RW and DVD+RW. Since DVD writers are popping up everywhere, and many of my friends already have DVD writers on their PCs, it's hard to imagine an expensive DVD player NOT playing rewritable discs.I found a Sony model that for the same price does play the DVD rewritables.So once again, price does not mean the same as features.Make sure your progressive scan DVD player play a variety of computer writable media type BEFORE you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"H07 error-me too!","review":"Yes, my Panasonic DVD player just died today (3/9/06) after a long and illustrious life of 1 1/2 years.

Once again the sound is completely recognizable as G Love, but gone from this album is the creative lyrical arrangements and jam-feel musical background.Songs like \\"Parasite\\" and \\"Praise Up\\" are often repetitive and lyrically \\"blah\\". \\"100 Magic Rings\\" repeats its name-sharing chorus nearly 50 times throughout the song.While the album is certainly a long shot from the quality work that has appeared from G Love and Special sauce previously, it is still one that will always have your butt moving. I would give the album only 3 stars, but I just can't bring myself to trashing this album completely. If you can get over the non-creative aspects, you will find that musically the album is mediocre, but coming from a band who is possibly beyond their talent at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!?","review":"I am so disappointed in this CD!!

Earth to G., what happened???Although I can't explain it, I've decided that there are exactly two kinds of G. Love albums: the knockouts like \\"Philadelphonic,\\" \\"The Hustle,\\" and the debut album that bowl you over with their jazzy, laid-back rhythms from start to finish, and the one or two where they've turned all the dials to \\"suck.\\" The good news is that most of their CD's fall into the former category; the bad news is that if you start with a disc as lame as \\"The Electric Mile\\" you may never want to give these guys another chance, and that'd be a shame.All I remember about this disc is selling it off in horror after 3 or 4 listens, as it was just lifeless, uninspired and boring, which is not what this band is about.

Let's publish another DaVinci Code!","review":"If you look at the titles of these two books, \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"The Darwin Conspiracy,\\" the similarity seems obvious. And the approach to storytelling is similar too. The problem with this endeavor is that the secrets being unmasked are not nearly as startling or interesting... or even believable. I much preferred Darnton's \\"Neanderthal.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Darwin Conspiracy by John Darnton","review":"I first read about Darwin in Harry Thompson's \\"This Thing of Darkness\\", also released as \\" To the Edge of the World\\". This treatment of essentially the same subject was brilliant compared with Darnton's effort. In fact I am certain that if Darnton had first read Thompson's novel, he wouldn't have bothered to write this insipid and implausible book.If you are like me, you also quickly lose confidence in an author when he doesn't get the historical facts right. In one scene during the voyage of the \\"Beagle\\", Darnton has a character say\\" ...the Wedgewoods, to whom he is related both directly and through his wife...\\" The Beagle left England December 27th, 1831 and returned five years later. Darwin married in 1839.Busted Mr. Darnton!Don't bother with this book- read Thompson's much better treatment of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same lyrics, different tune","review":"How do you review a book when the major problem you had with it was its \\"surprise\\" conclusion? Without specifics for certain. Let's just say that if you can't get enough of Political Correctness, you'll like this book. As for me, I'm sick of the predictible moralistic self-loathing that takes the best of premises (like this book) and dashes it into a regurgitation of the same old anti-European, anti-Victorian, anti-white propaganda. I'm a fool to have expected something more...something less predictible.Again I cannot really explain, in detail, my disappointment without giving the ending away...suffice it to say if you liked this you'll probably enjoy anything written by Martin Bernal and his ilk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining read","review":"I really liked this book. It's very well written. Better, I think, than the DaVinci Code (I think Darnton is a better writer), although the latter has a more mysterious story. I'm making the comparison because clearly the book was fashioned in some way after the success of the DaVinci Code. Both are historical fictions and touch on important figures, and they're both engaging and entertaining enough to cause an all-nighter or two.While the DaVinci Code actually makes you think -- wow, could the whole book, or at least substantial portions of it, be really true? You don't quite get that feeling here at the end. Still, the ending to the Darwin Conspiracy is fantastic and when one considers the people in question and their beliefs, there is little doubt that others like them throughout the world who've had similar beliefs were closer to the truth than the rest of the civilized world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays fast and loose with history and yet purports to be based on fact","review":"I just finished this book and have to say I found it quite disappointing. I expected a fun story about scholars on the trail of a historical mystery--a la A.S. Byatt or something like that--but unfortunately the gross distortion of the history of the Beagle voyage, of Darwin's life, of Wallace's life, and many other details really ruined it for me. I don't mind a little literary license, but painting Darwin as a thief, murderer, and fraud goes way beyond mere embellishment for the sake of the plot. Another reviewer recommended Harry Thompson's To the Edge of the World, and I heartily second that recommendation. Thompson's book is a great read and is written with enough literary embellishment to bring the story to life, but not so much as to grossly distort it. I don't know why Darnton has such an axe to grind, but it doesn't make for a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Darwin Got the Idea for Natural Selection","review":"This is a historical novel with a twist of alternative history. When two scientists locked in a rivalry over Charles Darwin come across some papers of Darwin's daughter's, they are forced to regard their hero in a different light. Apparently Darwin was also locked in a bitter scientific rivalry when he went on the voyage of the Beagle -- and his nemesis never returned from that fateful voyage.The conspiracy referred to in the title has nothing to do with the efficacy of natural selection, but why would Darwin not want to say where he got the idea in the first place. If I say anymore I'll ruin the plot.The book contains marvelous period details and research give this exciting thriller an enjoyable edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color NOT orange!!!","review":"Bought this item thinking it was orange, so I bought seat covers to match.

It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach.

It takes too long to load, is too slow, and in some cases requires you to modify your computer's settings to properly view animations.iLumina's website promises that more animations and features are on the way - but nothing has ever been done, with the exception of a new \\"edition\\" coming out every year or so.

It is very well assembled with great picture of well respected Yogi's. The form of the positions leave nothing to be desired. The descriptions of the positions and the subtleties of what the pose requires was well written. It isn't unusual for me to use the same phrasing as they do in the book because some cues can't be better said. Perhaps I'll out grow this book, but as a beginning teacher, I learned a lot from it. I love the amount of detail that the book gives because there is always more that you can accomplish in any Yoga pose, and you must work at the level of the students you're teaching and remind them of things that may be automatic for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reviews of over a decade are right: excellent instruction, depiction found here","review":"I recommend that anyone trying to establish a home-practice of yoga purchase this book, then immediately take it to a store such as Staples, have the binding replaced by a spiral binder and use this book open flat as a teacher right next to you on the floor or a table where you can reference it throughout your practice. This is truly a classic and when the student is rusty, it's a great place to 'begin again'. The correct action in each pose is clearly stated to help the student working on his or her own avoid injury. Modifications are included.

Study them daily, do the poses, and in every way your life will begin changing for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for dynamite sauce","review":"I purchase this mayonnaise regularly, usually more than one bottle at a time. I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce, although it is very nice in sandwiches as well. This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it, and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise.The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever. You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just tastes better","review":"I always used to hate mayonnaise, and couldn't imagine using it as a regular condiment. Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise.Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto, which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami. Umami is a special flavor, found mainly in Asian cooking, that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness. Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking, especially for making salad dressings. That hint of umami makes all the difference.Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans. Aside from tasting great, it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge, knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty","review":"I read about this brand of Japanese mayonnaise somewhere and was curious to try it. It is quite delicious; it tastes richer and heartier, somehow, than your typical Hellmann's or Kraft mayo. I believe it may have more egg yolks. They say it has more umami, and I agree. I have to knock off a star, though, because it's a bit ridiculous to charge almost $9 for a bottle of mayonnaise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really mayo","review":"If you like real mayonnaise, you're not going to like this. This is more of a flavored oil \\"mayo\\". Might as well get Miracle Whip.Really, it's a different taste and texture, it's just not Mayonnaise.So like the other reviewers, if you hate real mayo, try this or Miracle Whip."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the new system, though I couldn't really play it.","review":"The new system is great, though slightly complicated, and the races/classes are new and fresh.

Everything about the Alternity rules system lends to fast play, giving more room for roleplaying. The support for this product is excellent, Wizards of the Coast has a web page for any updates, free adventures and add-ons. Try out the quick-play rules there and see if you like it.

Modern D20 and D&D; 4e, for example, are still inferior (less realistic, flexible, fun, and intuitive)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern to Far Future RPG's are in your hands!","review":"Beleve me I have tried many systems for future RPG's. From a rather limited experence with Star Wars RPG (Which I did not like), to the complicated Masterbook system, to even trying to adapt the Saga Rules System to space. Nothing worked for me, either it was stupid, complicated, or just to vague for my tastes. But TSR's new Alternity game is perfect for me. The fastplay rules are good, and the whole system is very good. The rule book is hard to understand at first, getting familiar with all the new concepts is a bit of a challenge. But over all a very good experence. I gave it an 8 because TSR did a very good job of requiring the Gamemaster guide to play however."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS D20","review":"The alternity game was the forerunner to D20 it wasn't even supposed to be mainstream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious reliability problems and terrible service","review":"I have had this product for 6 months and it has broken 3 times with the same problem. There is something wrong with the power supply, as out of the blue it simply refuses to power up. To make matters worse, Panasonic does not do their own service (in the NY area, at least) and the 2 different shops I have tried both failed to fix it. Each kept it a few weeks and returned it, only to have the problem re-occur. I also had trouble with picture quality, which one shop denied existed but the other improved. Panasonic hasn't helped me at all, despite contacting their consumer affairs division. When it works, it's a nice TV, but thus far it's been out of service for over 6 weeks in 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good without HD, Great with HD","review":"Super for DVDs and HD signal. Not as good on non-hd tv signals.I recommend digital cable with HD for best picture.Sound is very good for a TV. Sometimes you don't want to fire up the home theater system just to watch TV. This does a great job with audio, even music and movies, but still no comparison to a home theater system.It's fairly deep, so measure your cabinet or shelf before you buy it.

It may be that this version played well onstage, but it plays very poorly on screen.Quite frankly, this version bores me to tears.I wish I could recommend it. I show parts of it to my 9th graders each spring so that they can see how differently Shakespeare can be interpreted, but they and I both hate this version and yearn to return to Branagh's interpretation.I await a better production to use for comparison with the Branagh version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Imitation of a Masterpiece","review":"First of all if you haven't seen Akira Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon,\\" the masterpiece upon which this film was based, go and rent or buy it now. It is simply one of the most fascinating and compelling films ever made. In \\"The Outrage\\" director Ritt tries to capture the spirit of Kurosawa's film and adapt it for a wider American audience, but fails through mis-casting and a bit too much consious aping of the original film--portions of \\"The Outrage\\" are almost shot-for-shot copies of the same scenes in \\"Rashomon.\\" For better American adaptations of Kurosawa films see \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" (\\"Seven Samurai\\") and \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" (\\"Yojimbo\\" also remade as \\"Last Man Standing\\")...or better yet seek out the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better films of the 60's","review":"Pay no attention to Maltin's dsimissive review: this is a fine film. The entire cast is in excellent form, with DaSilva's miner and Robinson's snake oil salesman particularly noteworthy. Newman's performance as the bandit is peculiar but fascinating, and often hilarious. An amusing and thought-provoking movie from the 60's, a decade that gave us some of our best films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calculus 101","review":"I bought this book after seeing it recommended by supposedly knowledgeable people. The author seems to be promoting tradestation because he describes how to code some of the information on tradestation.This is useless to me. You have to have a calculus degree to have any chance of understanding his systems. He doesn't ever fully explain any one of the systems. I looked and looked and couldn't find it anywhere.It seemed to me that he gathered a bunch of data and threw it into a bookwithout a clue as to what it was. An absolute waste of money. I have purchased many books on trading and always found something useful in them. I found nothing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I really disliked this book! I have read dozens of books on technical analysis, and in my opinion this is among the worst. I say this for 2 major reasons. First, there are hundreds of typos in this book, some of which are major. With typos in many of the formulas, it can be nearly impossible to follow the math in the book. Second, most topics are only given a cursory overview in this book. One would think, given the size of the book and the number of mathematical formulas, that the book was a thorough resource, but it is not. It is overly repetitive (adding pages without value), and most of the math is simply there for show (and not well explained)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NONTRADER'S BOOK ABOUT A LOT WITHOUT DETAILES","review":"Another book by someone not trading, but having a name as books writer.

It is rare to find a movie so passionate based on real events. This story is real life, that is what makes it so emotional. Hotel Uganda is the closest comparision I can make to this movie. It is very sad that this movie did not go national release instead it was a limited to a few theaters across the united states. This is no B-movie, high quality throughout, and a story that needs to be told.Joseph Kony is the biggest child murderer in history. Yet because it is Africa no one cares. Feeling sorry for them, saying words of support, that is not enough. If you want to help people, give. Give money, give time. They don't need words, they need action. This is still happening everyday.One of the most troubling but true to life parts of the movie is the donation solicitation.

Being a born again Christian myself, I almost gave up on the film in the first few minutes due to the graphically bad language, but I'm glad I hung on. I've always felt that genuine faith shows it's fruit in action, and this story shows the length some will go to help others. It's a hard film to watch, but it shows that God can change anyone if they will let them, and a life of true faith will not be boring, but it can rock your world.

I watched Hunger Games last night and its mind boggling how that movie got so much hype. Butler did a great job in this movie. Not sure how they could of made this movie any better. After watching this, I thought, maybe it was just me that thought this was a great movie, since the lack of publicity. So I came here to Amazon to see what others thought, and I relieved to see that I wasn't the only one that liked this.This movie will open your eyes, and make you think.

However, it has a greater underlying moral purpose: the trials of those living in war torn areas who suffer unheard in refugee camps, the struggles of Americans who battle a lifestyle of violence and drugs v. a life given to Jesus and how that faith is tested when faced with greater suffering, and that ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A WORLD IN NEED! I would recommend this movie not just for its uplifting faith but for the reality of the struggles of faith when faced with overwhelming suffering and the determination to act to help. The main characters are not perfect people; you see the struggles they have with faith throughout the movie. And there are still people in refugee camps around the world that need our help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good real life story","review":"Very interesting tension in this film.

Butler is Magnificent","review":"This is a movie that will shock you, touch your heart and make you want to 'do something.' Sam Childers hits the depths as a human being, finds redemption in God and rehabilitates himself. As an act of Christian charity he goes to Africa to help with a building project. As he visits relief camps in the Sudan, he is appalled at the attacks on innocent villagers especially the atrocities perpetrated on children. He finds himself becoming more and more obsessed with saving as many children as he can. He sells everything he owns, depriving his own family so he can keep his orphanage going and take care of the children he has saved.All of the performances were superb, there is wonderful chemistry between Gerard Butler and Michelle Monaghan who plays Sam's wife, Lynn. Butler brings Sam Childers to the screen in all his bold, tough glory but he also brings the emotion that drives Sam.This movie touched my heart as no other has in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing true story","review":"This is an excellent true story about a man who was on a 'one way trip to hell', and how God reached out and saved him.

I guess that it was either fate or luck that made me listen to her selection of Wagner Lieder.As I have always been a fan of alto/contralto's, I find Stephanie Blythe's voice to be smooth, creamy, solid, and very thrilling!!! I really like all of the Handel arias (which are top notch!!), and I will spend more time with the Bach.This Virgin Classics CD is up to Virgin's usual high standard of recording, though I do wish that her voice was more centered between the right and left channels. Then again, my new system still needs some dialing in in my room.I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes vocal music, opera, and best of all, for people who simply like stellar singing!!!Well worth the 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I only have the LP","review":"I purchased the LP back in 1985 and fell in love with these concertos.

So different from the curtsey stuff you hear from composers from the \\"stil galant\\", Bach really does his own thing. These particular concertos are alot of fun. Composed during Bach's mature period in Hamburg, there is alot of interesting theme development and crazy little runs that Emmmanuel loved to compose.

In regards to its function, it performs wonderfully and does everything it claims to do.However, aesthetically, the curtains are a bit disappointing. It's made of a stiff canvas which predictably keeps the very deep wrinkles it comes with and has a somewhat plastic-like feel and look. They're also quite light in addition to being stiff, so they don't fall and drape the way that you might expect ordinary curtains to. Because of that, they tend to stick out at the ends and let in cracks of light if they're not adjusted into a suitable position.I give them four stars because they are fairly inexpensive drapes advertised to block out light, help insulate a room, etc, and they do just that.

Amazon is always great about those two things, so I don't want to artificially inflate the rating because this product is awful. I give it one star for the fact it does black out the light, and another for the color being as I expected. Otherwise, it falls short on all accounts. It is terribly cheap, worse than at a Red Roof Inn or Motel 6. It smells like plastic. The wrinkles would not shake out and you cannot iron them on a hot enough setting to remove the wrinkles. You cannot tell from the photos that the entire back side which faces your window is white plastic. There are other blackout curtains on Amazon that do not have this but block out as much light. We finally found them, and they are not much more expensive. But they are 100% better looking and feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a headache","review":"I bought this game after trying it in the stores first.

Then, on the seventh day, it rested...or rather, it died, apparently from a rather serious power supply problem. My dealer (not Amazon) tossed this hot potato into Panasonic's lap, and dealing with a manufacturer like that can sometimes be like trying to flatten the Rocky Mountains with a tablespoon. I am proud to say I now own the world's most expensive paperweight, as I watch my nine year old, twenty seven inch JVC, and the Panasonic takes up space on the spare bedroom floor, gathering dust, and waiting for a resolution which may or may never come.

If I unplug and replug, the power (light ) briefly comes on and then goes off. This seems to be a systemic problem with this model, since I see several customers have complained about this issue.

No problems.The battery could last a little longer (around 2 hours) but that can be solved by picking up the extended life battery (Panasonic CGR-H601A/B Rechargable Battery Pack for Portable DVD Players).This model does not have a memory stick slot, as do other higher end models. But it does handle MP3 CDs just fine.The only real complaint I have is that the sound system can sometimes not be loud enough on an airplane--the sound of the engines overrides the sound from the movie making it hard to hear some softer sounds or dialogue. Noise cancelling headphones go a long way to correct this shortcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"I am not sorry I bought this product. The screen is big enough for one person, looks fine and you can play with the aspect ratio, which comes in handy. The audio needs to go through a headset -- the speaker stinks.

Ed & Jennifer Yourdon's book quantifies the types of problems that may arise. Jim Lord takes the next step and discusses how bad things may get and what you can do to prepare.My only serious criticism of the book is that it doesn't quite connect all of the dots. Much of what is described in both this book and the Yourdons' is: banking/financial crisis, followed by power and telecommunications problems, followed by breakdowns in some government services. Any of these problems may lead to civil disorder. Taken as a whole, massive civil unrest seems almost certain. The Yourdons don't acknowledge such a possibility.

If you like Vogueing you might like this. Listen carefully to make sure you really like this everpresent voice. I love contertenor singing, but I could not abide this.

More importantly, though, the paper lanterns do not hang straight at the top or bottom; you can even see the glue at points. It makes the lamp look really cheap, worse than the $25 ones I use to have in college.

Why is she never explained? A lot of the descriptions are corny. I could go on and on... like why are there gaps in the story?

It's an ideal resource for a teen band that's getting buzz and needs to know about all those contracts and deals that are starting to come their way. Just like the title says, the book is a plain and simple guide. It's not designed to entertain, but inform.

The boys in the band are really getting away with the tunes by this time and as much as I hate to single anyone out Jerry Donahue really is brilliant on these discs.an underated player in a very underated band.Fairport where no slick roadshow of studied proffesionalism, and as with many great live bands it is the slightly sour moments that elevate the sweet to real heights.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"San Sucre Mousse","review":"I purchased this product because I am diabetic and was wanting Key Lime Pie.

The gimmick of the silent and black and white film wore thin real quick, and was done much more humorously in Mel Brooks \\"Silent Movie.\\" That movie was funny! \\"Singing in the Rain\\" dealt with the transition period from the silent-to-talkies with far greater skill (music, dancing, humour etc.....)

I have watched older silent movies and got more out of them then this one. The captions where not good at all, acting was ok, but I think the only good thing in the movie was the Jack Russell now he could act, he made the movie as far as I am concern.

It had many of the same scenes as \\"The Artist,\\" had many more big stars, and had a wonderful scene in which Marcel Marceux (or however you spell it) delivered the only sound line in the movie.

In addition, it is supposed to contain the subtleties of French humor. So we were extremely disappointed by the whole experience: it is ridiculously melodramatic (a love story across the divide of success), everything is exaggerated to the point that it edges out all humor (the dog is the best character of all), and the plot is nothing but stereotype (a has-been struggles and gets a chance through the girl he once helped by chance). For the life of me, I can't see why anyone would think this is an artistic masterpiece.This is a complete bore, never hits a good emotional note, and not funny. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic","review":"Great out of the box thinking movie. Really liked it. Classic drama. If you want action or explosion it's not for you.

It seemed that nothing was happening in the story and the music was starting to grate on my nerves. But since I already paid for it, I kept watching. Unfortunately it didn't get any more interesting. I was not impressed. Usually an Academy Award Winner is a good show; this one, not so much.I was aware this film was silent before I rented it, but I didn't know that it wasn't widescreen. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bothered renting the HD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"I guess it didn't stink on ice. But no one apparently ever sat down and worked out what the film was supposed to be. If it was supposed to be an exercise in making a new silent film in the old style, it just didn't happen. And who would care, anyway, outside of a film class assignment.If it was supposed to be a new form of silent film, at least it wasn't the classic style. But again, who cares? It wasn't any kind of new story. Tiresome.If it was supposed to be a film about the silent film era, it was seriously marred by the inept attempt to emulate the old silent genre.Yes, it won Oscars. But note that you can win Oscars any day with a halfway competent film about the film industry. SAG people are such narcissists.So, meh! You'll probably want to see it, just because... But don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Film Valentine","review":"Yes the film is ni 4:3 aspect ratio, black and white, and contains no spoken dialogue. But there is planty of music (including a nod to Vertigo) and so much charm. It seems strange that some viewers are not able to appreciate this unconventionally presented but quite comprehensible story of devotion, loyalty, and perserverance. The perfprmances are all excellent and the black and the cinematography outstanding. There is genuine joy in this film, especially with the two leading characters. The dog and the excellent character actors also add a moral dimension that is not too serious but enlarges the emotions.

Ten minutes of this rental and my guests and I wanted it turned OFF immediately.Sure it's cute and creative and I respect all of the artists involved, but this was not my cup of tea!!!I'm not the only one who feels cheated out of the cost of viewing this film - The film's marketing team did a great job at deceiving people. I actually thought that my high-tech A/V system had an audio malfunction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated...","review":"This movie slogs along on some tried & true Hollywood tropes & lots of long slow stretches of treacly sentimentality. The \\"hero\\" is supposed to represent an icon from the classic period of silent film but from the few movies you see him performing in it's hard to tell if he's supposed to be Fairbanks, Chaplin or Valentino. I think The Artist would have worked better if the Artist had been portrayed as a consistent character with backbone & spunk, but ultimately he's just a cartoon Norman Maine, from A Star is Born, wallowing in self-pity.Harold Lloyd made many films in a similar vein but every scene was filled with inventiveness & humor as well as pathos.The dog should have received the Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow.

Despite that, I still think it is a good purchase, and it is good music to read to, relax to or drive to.

The first, an import(H.I.T.S.), featured a previously unreleased song(\\"If You Go Away\\"), which alone was worth the extra cost. In 1999, during the Boy Band Revival, a slightly different collection was released, with a companion DVD also available. Then came Super Hits in 2001 and the newest, Greatest Hits, in August 2008. The compilations from 1999 and 2008 gave a better overview of their hits and the import was worth the money at the time, because there weren't yet any domestic compilations. However, Super Hits gives a good sampling of their early hits and if that's all you're looking for, you won't be disappointed. But a better greatest hits album would give a more accurate range of material--think Janet Jackson's \\"Design of a Decade\\", or Paula Abdul's Greatest Hits. Still, it's a good CD overall and very inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relaxation & Meditation","review":"Most people who are serious about meditating yearn for a combination of sounds that harmonize with music.

It is hard to meditate when once into a nice mood an electronic oboe or electronic piano comes blairing to the forefront. I wish Hans would have not put so many different instruments into the composition. It is a nice driving CD but is not conducive to meditating deeply.This CD needs more natural sounds and less electronic sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I ordered this boot for my 05 4runner.

It's probably my own fault, but I was expecting stories of the cultural importance of soccer/football in different parts of the world. Instead, I feel I've gotten a poorly written set of stories about psychotic fans/owners/players, etc that take the game too far. So much so, in fact, that I'm afraid to go to a game overseas ever for fear that it's either fixed or that I'll be beat up for no apparent reason other than the fact I'm there.To be fair, I don't think of politics a lot, so that doesn't interest me as much, but even the writing was sub-par. Many of the chapters ended as if the writer just ran out of things to say.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Book to Read","review":"As an economist by trade and a soccer fan by passion - I really enjoyed the book. It was a great sociological review of the world - across many different societies - from the US to the Ukraine to Spain.

The book is quite entertaining and fun to read - and if you stop for even less than 1 second - educational!

It IS, however, a very American perspective on the game which is likely to be pretty unfulfilling for readers coming from cultures with longer histories with soccer. Conversely, it was quite satisfying for me as an American because it does manage to capture the sense of frustration Americans have felt with the lack of traction the game has gotten in this country, and the sense of hope that it is finally reaching critical mass.If you are an American reader, and you care anything about where the game has been and where it's going, the book is worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful read ...","review":"... that lives up to its title.

As other reviewers have said it starts out rather depressingly, but then where I differ with others is that it doesn't get much better. I love the game of soccer and this book makes it into a rather depressing sport throughout. When one tries to explain a culture through sports, especially international soccer, one better have the historical ties nailed down, not just based one on because somebody told me so, or I think so kind of conclusions. Finally, I don't think there was much of a point to the book other than the author got to see a few great stadiums and teams play. For that I'm envious. There are other books like \\"Soccer in Sun and Shadow\\", or a 'Season With Verona\\" that can give on a better feel of soccer and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work on soccer around the globe and at home","review":"Franklin Foer's creative and intelligent work on the impact of soccer around the world is a great read, a real page-turner. His nine essays show how soccer can be seen as an important part of globalization, but at the same time, has helped burgeon the anti-globalization sentiment in many locations. Foer's expeditions around the world give the reader a chance to understand the meaningfulness of soccer to different societies, with all the positives and negatives that come with it. A must-have for any fan of the world's game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor copy of the original","review":"This book is a poor copy of Simon Kuper's Football Against the Enemy. Everything covered here was done better (and a decade earlier) by Mr. Kuper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Had Read Reviews First","review":"\\"How Soccer Explains the World\\" came recommended from Amazon as similar to David Winner's \\"Brilliant Orange\\", which should be in a very different category all together. I loved Brilliant Orange and have long been ready for a similar book, but this was not it. Not only is the grasp of football (soccer) passable in this book the connections to society are clunky. Foer is a good writer, but as many others reviewers have pointed out his facts are a bit off and could have used much more research and deeper understanding of the non-football elements. I didn't come away with a deeper understanding of anything presented in this book.I not only wished I hadn't bought it, but not sure I will pass it along to the shelf for others to read at the community center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off of an earlier work","review":"This book is a pretty blatant knock-off of an earlier (and better-written) book, Football Against the Enemy by Simon Kuper. That's the better book to buy. While I don't fault the author for wanting to cash in, it would be nice if he at least would acknowledge the inspiration for this book, rather than lamely pass it off as his own \\"theory\\". (Someone might also want to tell him that this is a hypothesis, not a theory.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, bad execution","review":"I have to admit, some of the parts of this book have lingered with me, having read it over 5 years ago. The excerpt about being on a boat with Irish fans traveling to watch Celtic vs Rangers was escpecially fascinating.I have to say, however, that I was completely deflated by the chapter on Iran, which was based entirely on someone else's PHD thesis. If I'm forking out good money on a book about soccer globalization, the author should have at least taken the time to go to Iran himself and interview people. As an Jewish American, however, Foer was probably not looking forward to that trip.Foer is a pretty decent writer, and I breezed through most of the book, which says a lot. But he is not a seasoned investigative reporter yet, and that shows. A good first effort, and perhaps better stuff ahead from the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DELIVERY","review":"the book is in horrible shape even though i bought i brand new, and on top of that it took forever to get delivered so i didnt have a book for class."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book for commuters","review":"This isn't a book, so much as a collection of essays on a common theme. Foer picks a country and talks about how football/soccer can explain some piece of that country's culture. The essays can be enjoyed separately or in sequence, and were perfect for my morning train rides to work. He never does develop an (unlikely) theory of globalization and only makes inconsistent and half-hearted attempts to develop it, but the content around soccer and culture is plenty entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stay out of the field...!!!","review":"This book is a bigotry masqueraded behind the veil of a \\"scholarly work.\\" Every rule of rigorous work has been violated in this piece of work building on the darkest but forever smallest side of \\"soccer.\\" Wasting this great opportunity to reveal the multi-dimensional power of the game the author invests his bitterness against the sport page-after-page. A sweet revenge for \\"soccer\\" rejecting him in his early age? Well... my advise to the author... keep on running away from the ball sir... and please stay away from it!!! You are RUINING THE GAME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Promising, Contents Letdown","review":"This book begins with much promise, but is let down by the contents. More like a personal narrative of how individual parties in various countries live with soccer as a backdrop to what they do, the book does not answer the question posed in the title as much. While readers' interest may be raised with this rather creative title, Foer fails to deliver as much. I suppose the more accurate title would be: \\"How Soccer Influences\\" rather than explains the 10 different cultures mentioned in the book.The best part of the book is the way Foer deals with the counter-cultural role Soccer plays in American culture. That I feel is the strongest part of the book. In a sense, while the other 9 are pro-soccer, the USA projects itself as anti-soccer. If soccer is a synonym for globalization, the USA will make an interesting case study because it is the stronghold of globalization.conrade"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different way of looking at thing","review":"Overall a pretty interesting look at the world. The author looks at how different countries treat soccer, and what that says about their culture. Due to the fact that soccer is a pretty much universal sport, it does act as an interesting way to compare cultures. In fact one could make the argument that he actually leaves a lot of material on the table in examining cultures and economies through sport.My biggest complaint is that it often becomes way too travel essay like. I am glad he likes the game and all, but frankly his enjoyment of the sport isn't interesting enough, I had never even heard of the author previously. Stick to the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glib and poorly researched","review":"Foer has a good idea -- explain how the world works through the eyes of those involved in various soccer clubs -- but he does a pretty poor job with this book. Part of the problem is that he seems to want to do the least possible amount of work which means what he produces comes across as lazy and ill-informed. I wish he'd spent more time talking to more people in each of the countries he visited because you get the impression he spent about a weekend in each place. This is a disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read - poorly researched","review":"This book is an easy read and the author has an entertaining style of writing.HOWEVER - the stories of this book are badly researched and reflect his personal experiences/opinions rather than actual facts. The title of the book is misleading - there is no \\"theory\\" of globalization that he tries to prove or explain. Some of the facts he states are outrightly INCORRECT and some statements about the different countries/cultures quite outrageous.If you want to know a little bit about the different soccer teams and cultures in the world, go ahead and read this. But don't expect any great new knowledge of \\"how soccer explains the world\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"(From Planeta Journal) - This second edition by Humphrey revises the nuts-and-bolts information about traveling in Honduras and provides an entertaining read for anyone heading to this Central American country. This guidebook has great details about Celaque National Park, the petroglyphs of El Sauce and even an analysis of the country's maquiladoras. Honduras seems to have it all -- Caribbean beaches, coral reefs, ancient Maya ruins, colonial villages, and virgin forests -- but it takes a good guidebook to get you there. Independent travelers will relish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Two Bruce Willis movies on one blue ray makes this a must have for Bruce Willis fans and the price is at a excellant value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"I will leave all the technical and musical reviews to those who want to do so, in short, this album is worth all the pennies you spend on it. Mere words will not do these recordings justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Early Revisionist Work","review":"This book is less about who wrote the Bible and more of a glimpse into 19th century revisionism. Originally published in the late 1800's, Gladden discusses much of the then-current scholarship regarding Biblical authors and canonical development. However, given the time period in which the book was written, the book skews hard towards the revisionist school of thought, which usually denies the traditional views of authorship. There has been much scholarly work done in the 100+ years since this book's publication that refute many of the author's arguments. Instead of this book, I recommend interested readers to pick up \\"Who Really Wrote the Bible\\" by Clayton Howard Ford. This book should be taken only for what it is: an outdated revisionist work, representative only of the ideas of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Only Valuable as History","review":"Washington Gladden was a Progressive that wrote \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\" in the year 1901. Many of the arguments in this book are outdated, disproved ideas of liberal theology. For instance, on the Bible Gladden writes that the Greek word \\"graphe\\", translated \\"Scripture\\", was not used as it is today until after 400 A. D. This was questionable in Gladden's day and has been proved false by archaeology, most notably by the discovery of a fragment of the Gospel of John dated at 125 A. D. John's gospel uses \\"Scripture\\" in a similar form that Christians use it today.Gladden was a revisionist who wanted a religion that would support the idea of the Kingdom of God on this earth (see Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Gladden). This book is an interesting study into the theologically liberal mind of the 20th century, but is not a book that one can depend on for factual information about the origin of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful product with wonderful price","review":"I paid a penny for this product and it works as well as any I have purchased from Verizon."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function C(a,e,n,u,r,s){const g=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(o(),p(g,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-484f54b1"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/37.md","filePath":"guide/37.md"}'),R={name:"guide/37.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
