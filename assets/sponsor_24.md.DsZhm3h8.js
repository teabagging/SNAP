A few days later I got 1 more loofah dog, packing slip said 3. I guess you get the picture .... I emailed ozbo requesting the last 2 dog toys be sent.

For Example we have only one knob fixed to each draw as the screws don't fit. We tried calling the customer care number at Stork Craft, but in vain as we got through with great difficulty once (when we were told that they will be sending the missing parts - this never happened!) and subsequently never got through.

The instructions are terrible, the quality is poor, the middle drawer does not go in correctly and I cant even get the door to the tower on completely because the screws dont line up.

When I saw the color of the wood, I thought, \\"Hmmm, this looks darker than I expected.\\" But I thought it was my imagination. So I built the dresser anyway. Took me a few hours, but that's OK.I then open the stork craft rocking chair box, also labeled OAK in color. I pull out the first wood piece. It's exactly the color I had expected something labeled OAK to appear ... and NO WHERE NEAR THE COLOR OF THE DRESSER. Turns out, the dresser they sent me was Cognac.

Even though a piece came broken, Storkcraft immediately sent us a replacement one. However, when we order this same dresser combo for our second child just now I was surprised to see all the inside shelves, baseboards and sideboards are an ugly, cheap particle board white. When we called Storkcraft customer service they acknowledged the change, but didn't have a good reason. This taught us a valuable lesson - beware of buying furniture online when there's no photos of the inside.

It looks great, it worked wonderfully for the first 7-8 months, then it started falling apart little by little. By the time my baby was 13 months old, the Beatrice dresser/changing table had the bottom drawer completely off its railing and the backing falling down bit by bit. So, even though the price is right, if I had to purchase a changing table all over again, I would not buy this piece. I'd spend a little more and get a better quality item. However, I did purchase a Storkcraft stages crib and that item is still in wonderful shape... so, maybe it was just a fluke that the combo dresser/changing table didn't work out so well? Who knows!

I called customer service at Storkraft and they were nice but they stated that I would do better by returning it to the store I purchased it from or I could wait 3-4 weeks before they could send the replacement parts for those that were damaged. On top of that, the CSR stated that the new parts sent may not match. So my husband and I are furious.

The same drawer wobbles when you pull it out and the top one catches and you have to yank it to get it out. The cabinet on the side the shelves wobble and there is no catch for the door the shelves actually stop the door. I didn't order this from Amazon and I got the dresser/hutch combo for 300 some odd dollars and I wish I had not gone with this brand. It is all particle board with a wood veneer.

Ikea has better furniture than this.Just to make it clear, there is NO wood parts in this furniture, it is all pressed wood except for one support beam in the back. The wood feels flimsy and scratches very easy. There will be a dent if you put something heavy on top of it. I am a very handy person and it took me over 4 hours to put it together. The way the item is arranged is very disorganized and they need to learn from Ikea because I can put together Ikea Furniture in about an hour.IMHO, I would pass on this. I know the price is good and it looks decent in the picture but you can find something better. I am going to keep it only because I spent so long putting it together that I don’t want to waste another 5 hours taking it apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer service does not exist.","review":"I will not buy another Storkcraft item.

Unless you go to the very high end solid wood furniture that would cost well over 3 times this price it is a very good value. Checked all the nuts and bolts. Everything is there. If you want a decent looking nursery piece that will function for you after baby is older you would be hard pressed to find something less expensive with better quality.

The instructions were a bit confusing and some of the pictures were incorrect. I am just crossing my fingers that this piece of furniture will last at least a year.

There were several dings in the wood finish when we received it and several more created in assembly, despite using utmost care to try and put it together without damage. We were missing two parts for assembly as well, two drawer bottoms. My husband just want to Home Depot to buy something suitable since we didn't trust contacting this company for support since the claim about the product wasn't entirely accurate.

The hutch surprisingly enough was in great shape, but the combo tower is another story. I purchased these two items the first week in February, allowing plenty of time for delivery and set-up, or so I thought. First off, you've never seen such poor quality in a piece of furniture that costs as much as these two. There were chips, scratches, and no paint, on certain pieces. The right side panel, which is a neccessity for this piece was completely cracked in half, leaving it useless. I contacted storkcraft about the matter, and they asured me that the replacement parts were on the way. I'm still waiting....after a month.

The dresser is particle board with a very thin wood topping; it cracks and falls apart when things are screwed together. The finish had splotches that were not painted and some areas were noticeably darker than others. I'm a little worried the dressed won't hold up for long and it definitely wont hold up if it ever needs to be moved from this house. Overall, my husband and I thought it was a cheaply made furniture with an over inflated price. I guess that's what we get for trying to buy a dresser that was a little less money than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still happy after a year use","review":"I've been using this changer for over a year now, and I really like it. It was initially frustrating to put together, so if you're not pretty competent with assembling and adjusting this kind of furniture, it could be trouble. Once built, the unit is sturdy and attractive. My only ongoing complaint is that the drawers do not have full sides, and this limits the capacity they can hold. Also, while it doesn't bother me, if you're looking for the finish on all your nursery furniture to match exactly, this may not be the best bet. I have a crib from the same line, and the finish is slightly off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, junky furniture","review":"We shopped around and got this piece for a great price, figuring it might last a while--I have just finished assembling it, and I can say it's the junkiest piece of furniture we own (which includes entries assembled from IKEA, Target, and Overstock, among others)- screws are misaligned, holes were drilled wrong, and the wood is total junk (basically particleboard);I'd be shocked if it lasts a year, but even if it does, it will have issues with drawers being misaligned, and the \\"wood\\" scratching constantly at the slightest provocation.Bottom line: get something with more quality even at a higher price if you plan to keep it for over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed!!","review":"When this piece of furniture arrived, all of the holes cut for the screws were much too big, so when we tried to put it together, it just kept falling apart.

Spend a little more to get a piece of furniture that's better quality, easier to assemble, and safer for your child.

It matches the crib we bought almost perfectly in color. The area to place the changing pad seems a little smaller than what I expected but we'll see how it fits once I get the changing pad for it. The assembly for it was a bit ridiculous and took my husband many many hours to put it together.

My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces. Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college.

Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board. Several pieces arrived damaged. We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it. If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart. Also, the drawers are very shallow. Don't expect to store much in this.

It was fascinating. Then, I put this DVD on and everyone in my family fell asleep! I tried to keep them interested and have the DVD help explain some of the underlying theories that I found so interesting in Dan Brown's book, but the \\"expert\\" interviews were sloppy and not engaging. When I switched to the extras, hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book, the glimpses of Westminster Abbey and The Louvre were very brief while the Rosslyn Church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work. I wish they would have held still a little bit and let us LOOK at the place!I have seen many good documentaries in my life, but this is definitely not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring Further","review":"Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE is pure fiction yet being based upon the latest theories about the Leonard, Da Vinci Jesus's bloodline and Holy Grail studies.If you want to explore deeper into such studies upon which Dan Brown's bastseller novel based, this DVD is a nice guide.While this DVD may serve well for Davinci Code enthusiasts, it lacks or ignores the serious criticism cast upon from a number of researchers and theologists. So it is by no way well-balanced and may not fit for the material for serious debate.Enjoy it as pure entertainment. It gives you more insights than King Solomon's Mines series or Indie Jones series.Verdict: Typically has the TV documentary flaw...For pro- Da Vinci Code fans.Rating: 80 out of 100Recommended for: DA VINCI CODE enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Nothing revealed, nothing decoded","review":"This was a poor attempt at capitalizing on the success of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. The book, which is wildly successful and has sparked controversy throughout the world, and the movie, which is milder but still controversial both attract a lot of attention. This DVD simply tries to take that attention and turn it in to profit for the producers.There is nothing profoundly interesting about this DVD. There is no new information and the DVD fails to truly point at the myths and facts from the book/movie. It merely states what the book says and why the book says it or what the book is based on without any corroboration.Truly disappointing to a conspiracy theorist at heart. I expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unbiased Viewpoint","review":"I recently attempted to research the authenticity (or lack therof) of the Shroud of Turin. I quickly discovered that most sources are so biased that it was almost impossible to get any reliable information. I expected the same when I ordered this DVD, and was curious to see if DVD was \\"for\\" or \\"against\\" the \\"Da Vinci Code\\". Imagine my shock when I found all of the speakers to be completely objective, in my opinion. I was so fascinated by what the speakers had to say that I have done a lot more research and have ordered several books on the subjects covered. I'm glad I ordered the DVD instead of the book version because it is much easier to judge the veracity of someone when you are watching them speak, instead of reading their words on a page. I highly recommend this DVD to the many people who were intrigued by the \\"Da Vince Code\\" and want to discover how much of the book, if any, is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive cover box: this is a pro-Dan Brown DVD, not an opposing view","review":"Like most people, before I spend money on a DVD, I read all the cover descriptions first.The back cover starts with a breathless announcement about Dan Brown's book. Then it lists a series of questions by the book's detractors.Based on the cover description, I honestly thought this DVD was going to be a reasoned \\"second opinion\\" regarding the historical information that Dan Brown uses as part of his novel.I had no idea that the DVD was actually just a rehash of the same theories minus the mystery-thriller context. I'm guessing the marketers deliberately meant to ensnare people of faith into thinking they were purchasing an opposing view.This DVD should be called: \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" Part Deux."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided expert's review","review":"The DVD is really a deception. All the experts invited are the ones that support Gnostic theory. I was hoping that I can see a balanced view related to this subject. Instead, I only see the point of view of the pro Dan Brown's experts. I think we should invite the famous evangelists, theologists, and scholars from the protestant, cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue. The DVD does not even discuss why the Gnostic theory was rejected in the first century."},{"rating":"1","title":"DaVinci Excuses","review":"Dan Brown is so full of bunk that his breath smells bad! This is a compilation of much of the same garbage that he included in his book. He tries, not very convincingly to prove his points.

In the meantime my right cursor stopped working. So, in the middle of the 2 week fishing season that I look forward to all year, I sent the whole unit back to them priority mail and they got it in 36 hours. They took 2 days to work on it and then shipped it back FedEX..... I got it 8 days later (12 total days out of service). I opened up the box and tested it. They did not even touch the head. It still had all the old settings, the right cursor still did not work and there were little flecks of salt by the connector that were there when I sent it in. On top of that, they included a USED transducer with it. So, my review would be simple.

Amazingly, this book is decent compared to his current novels (Gemini, April Shadows, Broken Flower, Attic Secrets, Heavenstone) but the drama in this book feels more contrived, almost like a teenager wrote it with drama and weirdness in mind. There was some effort here, but ultimately this book falls flat due to the whole drama with Cinnamon's mother, the miscarriage, Grandmother Beverly, and the like. I honestly can't recommend this for anything more than a cheap and entertaining (barely) read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"As much as I love V.C.

The central argument seems to be that if something cannot be explained then it proves that it is the work of a creator. Setting aside advances in knowledge that might see the currently not explained become explained, we only need to glance back in history to know that many thing ascribed to the creator are now well understood. His arguments simply put do not even come close to justifying his conclusion.This book seems to be written for the simpleton, avid creationist, or both.It rates one star for its interesting anecdotes on complexity found in nature.

Most of the book takes place in the 60's/70's following the life of the 20 year old protagonist, Toru, who is in love with his dead friend's girlfriend. There was a mini epidemic of teenage suicides during this time in Japan and Norwegian Wood touches on that topic. Murakami develops rich and complex characters like Midori and Reicho (2 friends of the protagonist).The story is narrated by the protagonist's older self at the age of 37. You gain a better understanding of modern Japanese culture while reading a very entertaining and rich story. Very pleasant read! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful Murakami Read","review":"I can't really add more than the other reviewers here have already done but this is a delightful Murakami book. It's happy and uplifting but is not exactly a straight love story. This IS Haruki Murakami after all and it does have it's share of the surreal and bizarre but not as much as in some of his works such as Wind Up Bird. IF Murakami could ever tell a straight story then this may be as close as he's going to get. My wife, who has never read a Murakami novel, asked if I haven't yet gotten tired of the pattern or template of this author or haven't I figured out his formula yet. The answer is there is no pattern. He just spins tale after tale with bizarre elements without pattern or formula. Add Norwegian Wood to this random mix of storytelling. It's a highly recommended great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's so beautiful it hurts","review":"the title seems especially appropriate - as with music, the impression of this book upon the emotional reader's memory is strong and lasting - and will almost certainly be recalled many times at the mere mention of a simple image or series of words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TEN-STAR NOVEL","review":"I COULD NEVER GUESS SO MANY PEOPLE MIGHT SHARE THE FEELINGS I EXPERIENCED WHEN READING IT. BUT SINCE I DISCOVERED IT IN 95 THIS IS THE BOOK I GIVE TO THE PEOPLE I LOVE DEARLY, A PRESENT OF FRIENDSHIP, AS WORTH AS NOT EVEN A GOLD RING COULD BE. MURAKAMI IS A MASTER OF PUPPETS, AND PULLS THE STRINGS OF PASSION AND EMOTION WITH MERCY AND COMPASSION FOR HUMANKIND. GREAT HARUKI, YOU ARE A GIFT OF GOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great read - first book I've read by this author. First book I've read set in Japan. Glad I downloaded it and looking forward to exploring more with this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"It is one of those books that comes along and sneaks up on you. By the time you put it down you realized that it has moved you. When Watanabe read Midori's letter I felt an emptiness in my stomach as if she had written the letter to me. The whole book is like this. You can't help but fall in love with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely tedious","review":"I can't believe that this is supposed to be one of Murakami's best works. It is extraordinarily dull, even for him. The usual (perhaps \\"original\\", since it's an early work) self-absorbed Holden Caulfield-esque protaganist, the usual self-conscious references to Western literature and music (is this why Murakami was so popular in Japan, because he refers to painfully often to the \\"exotic\\" West?), the usual UN-selfconsciously misogynistic perspectives of human relationships. I suggest you try Wind Up Bird Chronicle, then give up on this author altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norwegian Wood-MUST READ","review":"Norwegian Wood was a great read. I could hardly put the book down. The author paints a wonderful storey which allows the reader to picutre each moment of the book. I still think about the characters even though I finished this book over 6 months ago. I would compare the writing to that of Women of the Silk and Memoirs of a Geisha (both great books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"I could not get interested and eventually gave up. There are too many good books to read without wAsting time on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una lunga bellissima malinconia","review":"Questo romanzo è riuscito ad immergermi in una atmosfera irreale, ma allo stesso tempo estremamente palpabile che mi ha regalato sensazioni difficili da dimenticare. Il personaggio di Midori mi ha fatto innamorare mille e mille volte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - but please don't trivialise youth suicide","review":"A well-written story of life, love and death, set in a University and institutional environment in the late 60s. The author rolls out many musical and literary references evocative of the times, but this is overdone and seems to be used as a heavy handed mechanism (cheap trick?) to constantly remind of the era. The protagonist and his circle encounter many suicides in their short lives - and unfortunately, to my mind, Norwegian Wood trivialises the raw agony of this blight on Japanese and Western society. Still, an interesting character study and if nothing else, it drives you back to a great Beatle's classic to fathom a connection with Murakami's tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel that I must have known the characters","review":"This is my first Murakami novel, and I was not disappointed. It is sad, happy, romantic, erotic and very personal all at the same time. The writing is brilliant and perfect so I do not know how anyone could fault the translation. The characters are so real that I feel that I must somehow have know them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drug free sleep aid.","review":"Based on the high reviews of the book and the author, I got this book, Norwegian Wood, to read while travelling in Europe. Without fail, and regardless of whether I was tired or rested, this book put me to sleep.At the price of US$5.99, it is cheaper by far than a prescription sleep aid and cheaper than over the counter sleep aids with no known side effects.I guess I'll keep it as a cheap sleep inducer to replace textbooks and technical manuals. It's a lot smaller and lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Waste Of Time","review":"I've read three of Murakami's books, and quite frankly, I don't understand his appeal to so many people.In this book Watanabe is a listless, dull, young man. To give you a taste for his depth, witness the following excerpt of a conversation he had with a friend who, according to Watanabe, had a profound insight into Mozart's music: \\"...with Itoh's smart and heartfelt commentary ('There - that part., \\"How about that?')....\\" Other conversations throughout the book are equally stimulating.I struggled to get through this book filled with suicide and depression, without any insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Norwegian Wood experience","review":"Curious from reading interviews, commentary and reviews about Murakami, I decided to read one of his works to learn what I had been missing. After meandering through his sophomoric verbiage and scenery I now know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reality and intimacy of the characters - just magic","review":"I appreciate Murakami's wonderful ability to create such real characters, to whom you become so drawn to. At times, it's difficult to read Toru's real hope to set up house with his first love, but you can always feel that this will be an unrealised hope. Even those characters in Norwegian Wood that you never warm to (and I think most can easily name one in this novel)are necessary for the lessons that Toru learns throughout the novel.Even though Norwegian Wood is a novel that looks at so many things like loss, unrequited love, relationships, there are many moments filled with humour, hope, and the promise of new beginnings.Love the J. Rubin translation. Well done Mr Rubin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant and authentic","review":"Norwegian Wood is my the first book by Murakami that I've read, and without a doubt it will not be the last. To be honest, I was a little skeptical after reading the first chapter, and almost let it go after this point, but a few days later I picked up Norwegian Wood again, and am very glad that I did. Murakami's exploration of human psychology and sexuality is brilliant and authentic, and although I have no way of comparing Norwegian Wood to his other works, I find it unfortunate that some are contending that this novel is \\"too conventional\\" and not up to par with his other works. Norwegian Wood is an excllent book in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, romantic but NOT pathetic!","review":"This book is my second favorite by Murakami. I think his strength lies in his style of writing. As if you read Bukowski without swearing and vulgar stuff.I can't add anything that is not written, and I don't wanna spoil it for you. Go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Murakami","review":"This was the first Murakami book I read. Very enjoyable reading. I specially like the naked and sometimes crude descriptions of human nature. Although seen as a little anti-tide towards Japanese culture, many of its subtleness is present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murakami, sans spirit world","review":"If your looking for the unconventional weirdness of the Wind up Bird Chronicle et al, this isn't the place to turn. Norwegian Wood is surprisingly straightforward. It works well because Murakami really gets the texture of college life, the boredom, the weird way you sort of slip into other people's confidences and intimacies and out of them again as quickly, the strange, unbalanced people everyone seems to end up meeting and getting involved with. It's a very wistfully gentle sort of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little quick read... and then it's over!","review":"It's the kind of book that takes up a few hours in a day or two (or a few commutes) and you're finished. Lovely and sad love story, original for sure but deep? Not so much. Murakami definitely has the magic touch for writing some highly readable... I was just disappointed that the story and characters didn't evolve a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murakami's Realistic Novel. Great Translation!","review":"I want to put in my own two cents here. There are other reviews which cover the novel in more depth.First: I find this translation pretty amazing. I read a lot of Asian literature and know that poor translation (Brothers ~ Yu Hua) can tarnish what is a sterling story. I have also read virtually every Murakami novel, many more than once. I do enjoy the variety of translations, but I find that Jay Rubin is the best, especially with the newer novels.Unlike other Murakami works, this contains no mystical creatures, weird capitalist mascots, or alternate dimensions. I recommend this novel but remark that it differs greatly from his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, mysterious, and fantastic.","review":"While not as complex and creepy as \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is far more affecting, and set me off on a Murakami kick. Although some seem to dismiss the book as a simple love story, Murakami's penetrating eye raises it above potboiler status. Toru's travails are ultimately universal, despite the iconoclastic story-telling, replete with Murakami's usual quirks. The greatest thing about the book, I think, is the gentleness of it, the silence. Even though it is chock-full of Western references (beginning with the title), the book has the simplicity and inevitable quality of a Japanese brush painting. And it only took fifteen years for an authorized English translation..."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful little love story, but much more","review":"i don't understand why murakami has been so reluctant for this work to be released in english. while it is on the surface a much simpler tale than \\"wind up bird\\" (although there are springs!), it's still poetic, beautifully sad and often quite profound.toru, his japanese everyman, tries to be a good person and get through life with as little interaction as possible. unfortunately he's surrounded by death, which takes many terrible and beautiful forms.murakami is always up to sly literary tricks: toru brings a copy of mann's \\"magic mountain\\" with him on his first visit to the otherworldly asylum where naoko is \\"hospitalized\\". it takes quite some time before someone asks what he's reading, and her reaction is delightful.my only (tiny) reservation would be that it lacks the feeling of open-endedness in conclusion- there aren't enough loose threads, something i've come to enjoy in murakami's work.still, a splendid and deeply emotional work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't a huge fan of this novel","review":"I wasn't a huge fan of this novel. I found it to be slow and boring. It's probably boring because not a lot happens to the main character. He's a loner who is tormented about being in love with someone who doesn't love him. The only other thing he does is meet psychotic people and sleep with complete strangers. I know that sounds like a good plot but it's not. I didn't develop any interest in the book until half way through and then I was just let down by the ending. When I read the ending I threw the book. No Lie. It was so disappointing, it didn't answer any questions and left me confused.I know it probably sounds like I hated the book but that's not totally true. Even though I found most of the book to be boring it had its moments. I think what kept me from hating it completely was the writing style and the characters, who all have interesting pasts.I would like to warn any readers that are horrified by smutty content that there are a lot of sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly boring and flat","review":"i can usually trust readers' reviews but i felt like i was steered in the wrong direction with this book. i thought this book was so flat. if it were a food, it'd be communion wafers. i can appreciate the story of young love, the coming of age, the loss of innocence but the characters are so emotionally weak, obtuse, stupid. i really disliked this book. this was my first haruki book. i wish i had read another one of his books before this one. i'd like to give him another chance but this book left a sour taste in my mouth. correction: it left a chalky, bland taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murakami Revisited","review":"Toru is a student who cannot come to grips with his life. He loves Naoko, who is even more unbalanced than Toru. Naoko winds up in some obscure institution. Toru is ready to fall apart, but is rescued at the last moment by a real-life woman.No doubt the story is written beautifully and, standing on its own, should be recommended. But: If you ever read any of Mr. Murakami's other books, then you know the contents of this book without reading it. After a while, it gets to be monotonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Anna Karenina","review":"The best love story I have ever read. All of Murakami's works are excellent but this is his best. If you haven't read him then buy this book now - excellent - you will not put it down until you are down with it.

This felt as though it was rushed through production or something - most of it sounded like something a Music Major put together for a class project. The lead guitar was the only redeeming feature - it was really above and beyond the quality of the rest of the CD (the lead guitar is why I'm giving two stars instead of just one).The entire CD is very repetitive - many times, all of the instruments are playing exactly the same thing over and over and over. The male vocal sounded forced.I will give Trans-Siberian Orchestra another chance by purchasing a different CD sometime in the future, but this was a real disappointment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Sort of a classic now it's a great Christmas album with a unique mix of orchestra and rock instruments as the Trans-Siberian orchestra usually does."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just \\"Wizard's in Winter\\"","review":"Great CD!

Big mistake. It took but 30 seconds of the first song to know what I mistake I made. I buzzed through the remainder of the album and, like other \\"1\\" reviewers, found it closer to sattrical comedy rather than serious music, ie, some wannabe '80's rock band trying to make a Christmas album as a platform to fame.This is not the form of orchestra that I had in mind. I thought that it would be something close to Manheim Steamroller, but it was more \\"heavy\\" with the guitars to the point that musically, it was irritating.But, quite obviously, others appreciate their music and their genre. So, my recommendation is be sure to listen to the samples that Amazon provides (I bought my CD in the store and never previewed) before you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are OUT of ideas. Save your money.","review":"I love(d) TSO, I love Savatage, & I was VERY excited to hear this. Bottom line, other than a couple of the instrumentals, this is a weak, repetitive, formulaic droner. NOT worth your time, there is nothing here that wasn't done better on the last 2 Christmas albums. I regret the purchase, but I still love thier other stuff. Also, that blues singer STINKS. His songs were the only low points on the last two albums, and it seems like you can't get away from him on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"I am sorry, but I did not like this. :( I love and do mean LOVE the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but I did not like this.

My first impression of this CD? \\"A Spinal Tap Christmas\\" However, that assessment may be a bit too harsh. Spinal Tap was at least entertaining.This reminds me of what would happen if Marillion married Krokus and had kids. They'd celebrate the holiday season exactly as TSO. Great production values / pretentious and overblown. Kind of like watching an off, off broadway production of Phantom. Good try, but lacking in creativity and originality.I'm going to stick with Mannheim Steamroller...(And, by the way, Marillion is a great band)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I'm a great fan of this cd, and i can't get enough of it! sure the songs with lirics start out bad, but they are still amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..............","review":"Let me first say that I am a huge fan of both Savatage and TSO. However, this album is more of the same. Some songs are done very nicely, while others have a kind of broadway type feel. This is the only TSO album where I have to skip several tracks because they are so bad. If you are a first time TSO, get the first album Christmas Eve and Other Stories. I agree with the other reviewers in that a lot of the same songs are found in watered down renditions on this album. Good attempt, but the first two are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL HAIL THE KINGS OF CHRISTMAS!!!","review":"PAUL O'NEAL, ROBERT KINKEL, JON OLIVA AND ALL THE PERFORMERS SHOULD BE PLACED UPON A GOLDEN CHARIOTS, DRAPED WITH JEWELS AND PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS OF AMERICA!

TSO at their worst","review":"Compared to TSO's other offerings, this almost stands out as an example of how to do everything wrong. With the singular exception of \\"Wizards in Winter\\" (Track 3), which is worth a solid four stars, everything about this album is sub-par. The narrative is unclear and uninspiring, the reimagined traditional pieces are few and far between (and disappointing compared to similar offerings on TSO's other albums), and, worst, the classical-modern fusion that defines TSO is lacking to the point of being nearly absent.If you don't already haveChristmas Eve and Other Stories, get that instead; it is significantly better in every way.

It's so ridiculously over the top, like a really bad standup comedian/comedienne or Broadway musical that feels they have to shout at you to get you to like them. As another reviewer has noted, screaming and in your face musicianship do not make you great. The lead singer's screaming on O Come All Ye Faithful is especially painful. He sounds like a drunk demanding respect from the end of the bar by screaming at you for looking at him the wrong way. Many of the guitar \\"solos\\" sound like recycled bits from bad 80's hair metal bands. It's \\"look how loud we are! Look how we're screaming! We're passionate, damn you!

It's a pejorative and reactionary attack on four non-traditional Christian religions. Many of the assertions regarding the four sects are laughably wrong or horribly outdated (such as claiming that many Mormons secretly practice polygamy and refuse to baptize blacks, or the baseless attacks on the morals of Mary Baker Eddy). C.S. Lewis wrote that a religious belief that cannot withstand challenge is a religious belief not worth having. The defensive and provincial mid-century attitudes of this author, however, appear to be primarily motivated by a desire to stop readers from thinking about some of the most dynamic variations of Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Missing Something?","review":"The four major cults?

He didnt translate the papyri we have now! Though the LDS Church did purchase it.I admit that the JW's and SDA may be cults (they meet all of the criteria) I highly disagree that mormonism is, because it meets NO criteria for it to be a cult. also christian science, though its theology is dangerous, is not a cult either."},{"rating":"1","title":"VB Scripting - say goodbye to cross browser compatability!","review":"A fine book for Intranet development - a seriously flawed effort for Internet work.

I discovered that one of the weights was completely bent which was why that one was SOOOO hard to use. I called Sport Block and they sent me new weights and paid to have the old ones returned to them. They made the return hassle-free which I really appreciate and the new weights work PERFECTLY, the weights don't stick together at all. I do wish I hadn't had to go through the hassle of having them be so frustrating to use (before I had them replaced.) I am very surprised there is not a better quality control system in place with the company, but at least they made it right and I am very happy with the weights now."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"I ordered my powerblock weights because I needed more options and fewer weights lying around.

I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of weights and saves a bunch of room!","review":"My friend got the 50 pound Powerblocks and recommended I try the 24 pound ones. I've had my PowerBlocks for a couple of weeks and use them with the P90X program. I love them.They are super easy to adjust, and the set-up time for lifting weights went down exponentially. Instead of having to move multiple sets of weights, I just have to move one set! Also, if I find I chose the wrong weight (too heavy, too light), they are quickly adjusted. The 3 pound increments are convienent too.My only complaint is that I am not flexible (wrist doesn't been like it should) and sometimes my wrist hits the side bars on supination curls. Other than that, I don't even notice the side bars.I highly recommend the PowerBlocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I love the sturdy, compact nature of these dumbbells.

I was more than disappointed with Amazon.All in all the product is great! Excited for the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"I bought the set, because my trainer has the elite set, which I liked. I received the set damaged - plastic was broken and plates were off on one of the blocks.

I ended up reordering the 45 lbs set instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really allows for easy changing of the weights","review":"I bought this for my husband for his birthday - thinking I might be able to use them as well. I was alittle concerned about the comments about the 'lock' not being sufficient but decided to try it. The locking mechanism for changing weights is streight forward and if you really pay attention to what you are doing you should not end up with a loose weight - that said - you really do need to pay attention. I like that I can easily switch to a lower weight and use these as well, and then put it back to my husbands weight for when he uses it. We really like this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect weights for home use","review":"As a graduate student living in an apartment, I don't have a lot of money or space for exercise equipment. Fortunately, these take up practically no space (they're easily stored in a closet or even a drawer) and are worth every penny. They look nice, provide a comfortable grip, and are perfectly adjustable.My only complaint is that the plates clink around a bit when you move the dumbbells around; I've found that adding a bit of padding (a wedge of cloth, for instance) can cut down on this noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great if you need to change weights quickly","review":"I bought these weights to use with P90X and while they are ok for the price, I can't recommend them for use in P90X because you have to change the weight too often and quickly. I found the plates and the pins to be cumbersome and easily misaligned. You can insert the pin and not actually be in the correct spot and then the plates shift while you are doing reps. Its not so easy to add or subtract weights. If you are just going to stick with the same weight for most of your routine, then these would work fine, but in P90X I am sometimes using three different weights for one three exercise circuit.I got my husband the bowflex dial weights and those are MUCH better in terms of ease of switching weights although they are twice the price. I am going to go back to the traditional dumbbell weights for ease of switching."},{"rating":"2","title":"love em!!","review":"So i got these in yesterday this morning was the first time using them and i LOVE my new weights!!

Jon and Robert have a winner in this book! For the \\"neato\\" tutorial check out Flash Magic by D.J. Emberton and J.S. Hamlin, but for a complete reference to the power of Flash4 this is the ONLY book to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is the best Flash book I've seen so far (I haven't seen Flash4 Magic though I hear its good).Anyone familar with the Bible series knows that it is not a tutorial based book, but an indepth reference book. The Flash Manual often gives you a list of tools and short discription (if that, look at the section on ActionScripts if you don't belive me). The Flash4 Bible goes through each tool or feature and explains what it does, how to use it, tips on using it with other features, and cautions on potenial pitfalls. What more could you want?This book even has a full section on ActionScripts, that's FOUR Chapters!I wouldn't recommend this book for someone trying to learn the basics, but for anyone serious about learning Flash, it's a most have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"Flash Bible is not just a book about Flash 4, but IS the book on Flash 4. Keeping pace with internet industry is tough enough if your a web designer, but if your a writer for a internet software manuel then your job is even tougher. This book details the information that the \\"quick\\" books have to leave off. For the beginner the first quarter of the book emphasis what is needed to get your flash site started. For the advanced users there are some great new and exciting things to learn (especially if your a reviewer) if you take the time and read some of the great advanced scripting techniques used by the authors and associates. All in all a great reference material book for those advanced users. and super material for the beginner if combined with the peachtree Flash 4 quickstart guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this book is useless.","review":"Understand this; this book is the Flash Guide.

Case in point, look at the opening page of Chpt 8. It list Masking after Guide Layers. Guess what? It's not there. Other sections refer to this as well in Chpt 8 but it's missing. No section on Masking at all, anywhere in the book. Plus a no-frills CD-Rom and an unimpressive color page insert section.

Let alone the editors; let alone IDG?A bible serries book usually has more info than most books. But this book is just a collection of bits and parts -- without going into depth in any area.

I hope no one else does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak. Avoid this one.","review":"Unless you're looking for another reference to sit there and get dusty along with your flash 4 user's guide, don't waste your money.This guide's top down approach lacks any depth or educational value.

You would be better off to keep your money and use it for something else. Dont like to spend my time and money on a product that is FREE with the program. I was looking for a book that could assist me with this great program, not just a reprint that cost me money for information I already have to choose from for FREE !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I agree with the reviews giving this book 1 - 2 stars. This book was very dissatisfactory compared to other books in the Bible series. I ordered this book along with the flash software. I found that going through the tutorials in Flash and using the online help was much more useful. Also, there are many websites that offer information on Flash. I'm going to be ordering Flash 4 magic to learn more of the advanced techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic - A Big Disappointment","review":"This book falls far short of my expectations. My experience with the IDG Bible series is that they are thorogh, and complete - this voulme is neither. If you are new to Flash, this may be an option - but I would advise you to save your money and read the manual, and other online resources. Those of us who want to continue developing the advanced features of Flash are wasting our time with this book. It is by far the worst in the Bible series I've read. All in all - a very big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough tutorials","review":"The fact this book covers all the basics such as the what the tools do is good. But, this book brieflly covers how to make flash movies. The book could of given a few tutorials and the CD doesn't hardly have anything on it. The CD could of been packed with flash movies, instead just a few crappy movies are on it. The sections, \\"using flash with othe programs\\" is about half the book and could of been used more wisely by giving advanced tutorials."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Flash bibles...","review":"Frankly, as someone who does nothing but Flash work and is now teaching it, I would not recommend this book. It's basically a more expensive and slightly better organized version of the manual that comes with Flash. In a few cases where I tried to apply the information given (using forms), the info was actually faulty or incomplete and led to frustration rather than enlightenment. And this is from someone who knows action script very very well! Essentially, there are two books that stand out for me. For folks who want to learn Flash design and animation basics - Hillman Curtis' Flash Web Design is the best. For those who wish to learn action script, nothing can beat Flash 4 Magic. Both have real world examples and source files to back them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a \\"Bible\\" publication","review":"I have come to expect a certain level of professionalism from the 'Bible' series from IDG Books. However, this latest attempt falls far short, and I will more carefully consider my purchases from here forward. I received the book a few days ago, and have determined that it was written in no more than three weeks. The majority of content is straight from the Flash Users Guide - most of it covering interface and tool descriptions. There is little in the way of in-depth discussions that relate to real-world applications or the finer points of architecture and workflow that should be considered when undertaking a serious project with Flash. I wouldn't recommend this purchase to anybody who already has the Flash users manual and an internet connection - more can be learned online in two hours than by reading this entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really \\"The Bible\\", Really!","review":"The Flash 4 Bible bills it's self as \\"100% comprehensive, authoritative, what you need\\".

The tutotials got me doing stuff immediately... compared to this book... it would have taken me... a number of chapters before I would have done anything useful.The last 1/3 of the book is a little more useful in regards to the scripting language.I would not recommend this book.

Not friendly, poor and incomplete examples, yet you can't say it's an advanced book.I gave up by chapter 12. If you want a headache follow the Pill technique on page 134. Which is a shame since that should be a very simple excersice. This is the worst software reference book I have ever purchased (and I buy over 8/year).

For such a powerful program and for such impressive sites that can be created with the program, the book does not even do justice to the program.I recommend the Macromedia-sponsored Flash 4 training courses.

Period.Some of the reviews presented here have been equally amusing. I found the discussion of the \\"atheist philosophy of religion\\" quite enjoyable. \\"Open your mind\\"?

My kitchen scale tells me it is 6.7 ounces, not the promised 9.6 ounces in the product description. Additionally, the lid construction is a bit dubious. There is one tiny spot weld on each end of the handle to hold the handle on. I'm not sure how long the handle will remain solidly attached to the lid.I have returned mine and will seek a better lid for my new saucepan :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Political theory in Jewish thought","review":"Rabbi Goren's deep knowledge of the sources, and when it comes to political theory especially Rambam are reflected in this collection of writings. Rabbi Goren has a clear idea of the meaning of the Jewish state and he expresses it in this work. This is a highly recommended work for all who are interested in Jewish thought in regard to the political realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bug In The Soup","review":"I own several Bicycle Game programs, and I have found flaws in each. The first is called \\"Bicycle Card Collection,\\" and the Cribbage Program freezes in the middle of play. Then you must resort to Ctrl. Alt. delete to get out of the program all together. While playing Gin Rummy, after the deck runs out, another deck appears, and you the player have no control over the discard cards. This program is by Microsoft.Next there is the Bicycle Board games. Dominoes does not function properly. When lying down a tile, at a certain point in the game the program skips, then lays downs several tiles in sucession, and leaves a gap on the playing board, then allows tiles to be laid just anywhere.Next there is Hoyle Board Games which operates well, though not according to the rules. There appears to be a flaw in each game. At a certain point they seem to just break down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a well done game","review":"I was hoping for some new and interesting characters, but this game has the same boring ones that my old game uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for stand-alone storage","review":"I purchased this for my magazines and craft books. I already have several different ones from various sources. This is the first time I bought this style. It is wonderful for my craft books, which I keep on a table in a corner of the living room. Very convenient to pull out one that I want. And because it flares out at the front, very easy to rifle through the books for the correct one.On the other hand, because it DOEs flare out, it is not as good for my magazines, the holders of which are lined up on a cabinet in the spare room. I will have to get a different style for that room, but it is still very handy, strong and attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE, ENCHANTING. A WONDERFUL READ!!","review":"I've never read such a moving and emotionally thrilling novel in a long time. Glory and Two Arrows and their people have gone through hardships no one should ever endure. Emotionally equipped. Guaranteed to make you appreciate human freedmom. The romance and love between these two are moving and real. You can relate with each character in this book. I cried at the very end. I hope there is a sequel to this book.. A MUST READ!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta kinda, not really","review":"My only problem with this book is the credibility of the heroine and her sudden trasistion from vehemently rejecting the hero and insisting that fiance will come for her to falling into bed with the hero and deciding that she loves him. There was hardly any transition and while the key reasons for her to fall for him were there, there was no gradual softening. Her behavior toward Two Arrows went from winter to summer, skipping spring entirely. It ruined the book for me and it will be one of the few books that I purchase that I WILL NOT read again or keep in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this kind of belt clip.","review":"I love these simple little belt clips. Every time I get a new phone I always order two. They cost almost nothing and keep the phone closer to my belt that the fancier ones. I'm not even sure if I get the same brand every time or get it from the same distributor. I buy two because now and then the spring clip breaks when I'm getting into a car or something. This one had a new problem though. One time when I was getting the phone out, that little tab on the top broke off. Now I'm on belt clip number two. Hopefully it won't happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better price than Ebay so far","review":"San is a large manufacturer of these type products known for quality control. This supplier shipped fast and in excellent condition. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love this book!","review":"It's like a 'find the hidden objects' puzzle, but it's non-fiction today's trend in education.

However, the two chapters that come closest to the Enterprise Storage topic were basically written by two hardware vendors and are not very useful. I bought the book based on it's title and association with Mark Minasi but wouldn't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding contribution.","review":"Terry Brown's edited volume is a very important contribution for those seeking to understand global struggles over homosexuality within the Anglican/Episcopal tradition and other Christian bodies.

They have learned exactly how to use it and actually do a great job with it -- so it is educational. It is also very durable and has survived a few falls. However, the picture quality is SO bad that the pictures are completely useless! They come out grainy, yellowed, and either too dark or over exposed. (I can't believe some of the customer photos on this page were taken with the same kind of camera we have because they are MUCH better!) It's a shame too because the kids have actually gotten some really great shots that I wish had been taken with a better camera...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my four year old!","review":"We got this for our daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!!!It is practically indestructible and easy to use with big buttons.She loves using our expensive digital camera and this is a great alternative (especially if you can get it on sale!)The pic quality really isn't that bad either! Great for a 3-10 yr. old's 1st camera plus it's super feminine w/ the pink and flowers which she loves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This was the only thing my 4-year old daughter asked for Christmas and she was SO excited when she opened it. Like others said, the battery compartment is a nightmare. We spent 20 minutes trying to install the button cell battery and never succeded. The camera froze almost immediately. To fix it, you have to un-screw both sides and pull the batteries. We never got to see the quality because the camera won't run long enough.Also, the software is not kid friendly, its just some off the shelf junk. Tomorrow morning we are going to return it and get te Disney camera or something else. Fisher price, you failed us on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old because she always wants to take pictures. After reading the other reviews regarding this product, I am TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!! You would think for the price of the camera the viewing screen would be a lot bigger, considering the size of the camera. I was very, very, very disappointed in this Fisher Price product. I bought my daughter an inexpensive digital camera with 2.1 megapixels for her to practice taking pictures. Disappointed in Bolingbrook, Illinois"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Pictures","review":"Sure, the camera is tough and my 5 yr old thinks the games are cool, the pictures are so crappy he got bored with it in minutes. It is near impossible to take a clear picture b/c of the poor quality. If you breath the picture comes out blurry. He likes the idea, but he prefers disposables b/c he can \\"see\\" what he took pictures of. I am very disappointed witht his camera! It costs entirely too much for what you get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bombproof","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves this camera!! She takes pictures of everything. The quality of the pictures is what you expect from a kids camera, but they are not terrible. This thing has been abused by both my 3 and 1 year old...Keeps on working!! VERY DURABLE.. Definitely worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive for what it is","review":"For how much this camera costs, it'll be cheaper to buy a used regular digital camera on eBay and give that to your kid. And I'm talking ones from two years ago that were built tought, not the newer lightweight models, as the older models can take a beating.My kid loves my old Sony 3.2 megapixel camera. And because of the quality of the photos, they make for great archiving and printing not like the awful photos this camera takes.Furthermore, if you want something durable, most real-life digital cameras are available with a waterproof external case, which actually works as a great case if your kid drops the camera and would still be smaller than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible photos","review":"kids love this camera despite the terrible quality of the photos and display. camera phones take much better photos. if, like me, you are interested in saving the photos your kid takes for posterity, buy another camera. the photos this camera generates are unviewable.my advice...wait for a better alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for a little one","review":"We bought this camera for our daughter for her birthday. She has had so much fun with it. It is easy for her to use and take pictures just like mommy and daddy do. The camera has been bumped and dropped and still works great. I suggest shopping around, sometimes you can find a gift pack that includes a memory card and travel case, for the same price, or less than the camera itself, that allows your child to take more pictures and put the camera in a case like mommy does. I do however think the price is kind of high for the product you are getting. The pictures don't come out that great, good enough for a 3 year old but not good enough to put in frames and hang on the walls. When taking a picture, what shows up on the viewing screen isn't what you see through the view finder. The view finder allows the child to see a larger area then the picture they are actually taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable, not easy to use!","review":"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday and she was so excited to use it. While it worked great for about an hour- she took 160 pictures. It holds about 80, so then we had to scroll through and delete each picture individually- there should really be a way to delete all- then she took another round. After that the battery died. And died again. And Again. You get the idea. We were using regular alkaline batteries and they would go in about 2 hours. Then we started having problems with it mysteriously freezing up. You would have to unscrew the battery compartment take the batteries out and then put them back in again, only to lose the pictures that were on there. I will be contacting customer service as soon as I can reach them when they are actually open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a tough toy","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves to take pictures of her baby sister with her new camera. It is really tough (based on the fact that it has been dropped several times and continues to work just fine). It does not take the best quality pictures, but keep in mind that this is a toy. It is slightly overpriced, but my daughter was worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"I bought this camera in 2006 and it broke the same year so my child didn't even get to use it more than a year. The computer inside crashed and we couldn't retrieve the pictures my child had taken. They weren't of great importance, but she loved the camera and took pride in using it herself. the batteries dont last very long in it so I would recommend rechargeable batteries or get a case of regular batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this toy camera!","review":"I bought this camera for my granddaughter for her sixth birthday. She has always wanted to \\"take a turn\\" with my digital camera, and now she has her own! When she opened it on her birthday she said \\"Is this a real camera?!\\" She immediately started taking pictures and she knows how to look at the pictures and delete the ones she doesn't like. I help her download them on the computer so she can see them big and when we print them, they really turn out well. I was surprised that the pictures are actually as good as they are with this being a toy. I bought rechargable batteries and a memory card. The batteries last a very long time and with the small memory card, the camera can hold over a thousand pictures before it is full. We love this and I will buy it for all of my other grandchildren too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F.P. Cameria review from Grandma T","review":"My Granddaughter was thrilled to get this camera. It made her feel like a big girl. I bought it for her 4th birthday and I would say it was her favorite gifts among many, many gifts.

It has 1.3 mega pixels and a slightly larger LCD screen at 1.6\\". It costs a little more than this model does but worth it if you want to actually keep some of the photos taken. Here is the Amazon link for it:Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera - Pink (New Version)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with pictures!!!","review":"We recently purchased this camera for our daughter's third birhday. She loves it!!! It is so easy to use. The pictures actually come out nice. They are a lot better then we expected! The photo program that comes with the camera is excellent!! It is easy to use and fun to created slide shoews with the kids! I would definately recomend this to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this camera for my 3.5yo daughter for Christmas. What a disappointment it was. The quality of the LCD display and the pictures are so poor, you can barely make out what the picture is. I was so excited when I saw this product come on the market, as my daughter likes to take pictues with my digital camera. I had thought about buying her an inexpesive digital one until this one came out. But now I'm regretting this purchase. I'm returning it today. It is too frustrating for her to use when she can't see any of the pictures she is actually taking, just sees a whole lot of fuzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"It is tough, it's held up to multiple drops, etc. It's also very easy to use, my almost 4 year old mastered it in a few minutes, my 15 month old just takes pictures of her chin or belly. I haven't downloaded the pictures yet, but there are some really cute ones on there, the quality on the screen is pretty bad, I'm hoping the actual pictures are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My four year old for Christmas","review":"We purchased this for our four year old daughter for Christmas. She loves the camera, and it is very easy to use. However for the price it could take much better pictures. The pictures are the quality of a $[...] pen camera, or a camera phone (most phones take better pictures than this). Oh Well,she likes it, so the money was well spent! But come on Fisher Price invest a little in quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"When I purchased this I was concerned it might be to young for my six year old. I have to say its perfect for any child from 3 up to 8 or 9. Its so simple my daughter loves taking pictures and can delete easily what she doesn't want to keep. I think its a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"it serves the purpose","review":"the camera is tough, light weighted, easy to grab, easy to shoot and view the pictures. The viewing of the pictures and the screen could be better, just because they are kids, it doesnt mean that they do not know the difference of clear and blury. If you consider it a toy, then its ok, but expensive. On the other hand,the main attraction on a digital camera its the screen and the viewing of the pictures and this one is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for a 3 yr old!","review":"I think this is a great camera for a 3 yr old!! My daughter got it for Christmas this week (she'll be 3 in Jan.) and she had all the buttons figured out in about 5 minutes. She was able to center people in the frame, too. I was worried about getting a lot of ceiling and floor shots, but she does great! yes, the lcd screen is pretty low quality, but it's $[...] for a toddler!! What do you expect? It takes okay pictures inside, and I imagine it would take better pictures outside. The software it came with is great though! It lets you do a ton of stuff with the pictures, and is very user friendly. You can do great slideshows and share the photos online. I have even been using her software to upload my pictures from my camera to! All in all, my daughter loves it! And her being so excited about doing it herself and seeing 'her' picutres is worth more to me than a low quality lcd screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is amazing!","review":"I always knew that they could make a camera that was durable enough for kids, but we never expected it to be affordable. This camera was a Christmas/Birthday gift for our son, and he is having a blast taking pictures of his new baby sister, and all of his toys and friends. The TV seems to be a subject of many of his photo's too. The camera takes great pictures, and has been dropped a few times already with no problems to report."},{"rating":"2","title":"my girls love this product","review":"I bought a pink camera for each of my three year old twins for Christmas. Its easy for them to use and they love it. I did have to return one camera to Mattel as it was draining the batteries.

She can scan through pictures and delete the ones she doesn't like. She loves the camera and I have been surprised by the battery life....much better than my digital!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Children love it, Questionable resolution, Loud!","review":"My kids love this toy. They have been fighting over it constantly! You will most definately need an additional SD card as they go through the camera's memory pretty quickly.Others here have complained about the quality. It does appear lacking somewhat from what I see on the LCD screen. I have not had a chance to hook up the software and download and print pictures so I cannot say as to the final quality.Here is my one complaint about the camera: Why do they have to make it so loud! Every kids toy seems this way. I can hear my daughter beeping her way through pictures from the other side of the house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Entertaining toy ever","review":"This is a toy that you can give to your kids and not be afraid for them to brake it or damage it. My kids love the camera. They have so much fun taking pictures. The only thing that i found kind of bad was that the pictures once you take them and view them on the camera they are not very clear. But hey for the prize and for the durability of the camera is not a bad investment. I recommend it. Your kids will love it and so will you! now you don't have to worry about them taking your expensive digital camera when now they can have there own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottom line is our daughter loves to use it","review":"Price, resolution, and display quality all go out the window when your kid runs around shooting their own pictures, gaining an understanding of how a camera REALLY works (composition, creativity, capturing a special moment).Ease of use, indestructability (so far anyways), and simple uploading make it worth the other compromises.This is NOT a high tech camera, but it IS kid-friendly. We have not added the extra SD card yet, since it is so easy to upload the images.We have had ours since July, paid $59.888 for it via [...]; cannot say we have any regrets.While I do wish the resolution was better, for my photo albums sake, I would still recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the Picture Quality","review":"This camera is a nice idea however it isn't worth a dime. The camera is durable but my daughter only used it once. She got it shortly before we had our second baby. She took pictures of her new sister and none of the pictures were worth printing. My daughter is a natural photographer and was disappointed to see her pictures on the computer look so bad (blurry, grainy and dark). Now we let her use our camera. Hopefully they make a much better kids camera because the idea is a good one. Don't waste your money on this camera. It would be wiser to do your research on cheaper digital cameras and get a regular camera instead. From our experience cameras take a beating and continue to work. Thank goodness because ours has been dropped many times.

What I love about this program is that there are 4 different levels of difficulty displayed for each exercise. I can choose to go easy on one exercise and step it up for the next, I'm not tied down to a particular form or technique-there are a number of techniques I get to choose from for every exercise. I also like how this isn't a fad workout, but actually just using your own body weight and strength to tone youself into a healthier body. Only takes 20min, 3 times a week to get results, and when working full time that is all the time I've got.Great program, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more out of Clarks","review":"These are well-made, nice looking casual shoes. I've had them about 2 months now and they're holding up great. I work in the office and wear these about 3-4 days a week. My biggest complaint is that there is no cushioning in the shoes. The insole is very thin. After 1 week I bought Dr. Scholl's gel insoles just so these would feel comfortable. I wear these for about 9-10 hours per day so comfort is very important to me. The shoes are slightly longer than other shoes I've purchased, but I've been told that Clarks tend to run long.

Nothing but static the whole time I would try to talk on it, it did not lie snuggly next to my jaw line like the bt500, which I really loved. But over all those things, this was the most uncomfortable ear piece I have every worn. I can wear the bt500 for days and it never bothered me, but within an hour of wearing this one, the back of my ear became very sore.

She had some very good, descriptive parts, like her description of a hurricane's movements--tops, I really liked that. But the vampire stereotypes were rather tacky and clichéd, and killed this book for me. I felt the story was rather weak, as was the characterization. I did like the fact that Casey, the main character, was not your usual beauty queen heroine you usually get in vampire novels.I suppose this novel didn't rock my boat because I'm not a fan of stereotypical vampires, and because I've read much better contemporary vampire tales, such as Brent Monahan's The Book of Common Dread and its sequel.In conclusion, it bored me, and I felt like I had to fight my way through to finishing it.

It is more scientific than I expected, which I actually like a great deal, but it is different from what I originally thought I was buying. This book is less of a \\"how to raise your child\\" type book and more of an \\"evolutionary and biological cross cultural study of infants and children and how different child rearing practices influence personality and culture\\".

The Roger Sanchez mix, however, is great. Very up-tempo and highly danceable. Darren Price does his usual good job (although I still think his mix of Born Slippy Nuxx is the best mix he's done for them).

Beyond The Limits is the uplifting and very highly recommended autobiographical story of one woman's strength and personal determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"the rest of the story: an insider's view","review":"I'm writing this review from the inside, from the perspective of one who lived some of it. My opinion of this book can be expressed by citing one example. On page 45 the author describes Mt. Huntington, near Denali, as an 18000' peak. Look it up on any map or in any encyclopedia. Mt. Huntington's summit is 12240'. This is in the \\"second\\" edition - the \\"revised\\" edition - the edition in which one would expect unintentional errors to be corrected! In describing a mountain the author has actually climbed on, the author overstates its altitude by FIFTY PER CENT!?!?!? Trust me, the author's accounts of the events I witnessed or participated in are no better. I apologize to readers who bought this book twenty years ago, for not speaking up earlier. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good memoir of a woman climber","review":"A good memoir of the first American woman on Everest. Enough personal information to get to know the woman behind the climber and gripping climbing accounts. A excellent account of two expeditions to Everest complete with interesting group dynamics. Although this is the only book on Everest by a woman I have read, I found it to comparable to anything ever written on an Everest expedition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow introduction to Java Web services","review":"This book is essentially a rewrite of the free Java Web Services Developer Pack Tutorial from Sun. The book's writing is clear and the explanations are good but the text covers only introductory level topics. I expect a good textbook to go into a topic in depth, to point out problem areas, advanced techniques and the \\"gotchas\\" of a library (e.g., Jason Hunter's excellent \\"Java Servlet Programming\\"). All the screenshots and double-spaced code examples hide the fact that there's not much information here.The security chapter has nothing to do with Web services at all but is an introduction to JSSE; nice, but not what I paid for.Also, one of the book's advertised features is a web site with an \\"Ask the Author\\" section but I never got a response to either of my questions.Deitel's \\"Java Web Services\\" is a far better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overview of basic topics, but fails for anything beyond","review":"I've gone through several web services books looking for information about SOAP with Attachments. When I got to this book, I was surprised that it was actually giving incorrect information. Regarding SwA it says that binary data can't be sent inside of XML, so you need to use SOAP with Attachments (pg. 208). This is completely wrong, since binary data can be embedded in XML.The book was already written pretty poorly before I got to this part. Once I hit this part, I knew this book was bad. The author obviously does not know much about XML, so how could you trust him/her on any uses of XML?I give this a 2 over a 1 just because it does cover the very basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent title for creating cultural awareness","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that the pictures are wonderful, and the text (though minimal) is good. My 3 YO son really likes this book, and as others have mentioned, it works on several levels. I can see us using this book for several years to come to emphasize the fact that different cultures around the world DO have lots of things in common. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars was because the captions giving you more information about content of the pictures is all collected at the back of the book. So if you want to know whether the picture is from the Philippines or the US, for example, you have to keep flipping back and forth. It seems like there could have been a way to incorporate these endnotes into the text directly without destroying the effectiveness of the book as a charming elementary reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"a low-key intro to the cross-cultural world","review":"A terrific collection of photos that introduces both similarities and difference.

Personally I thought the book was a bit of a yawner. The author obviously enjoyed reading his own words because the book could have been shortened to about half of it's 320 pages.

The characters were flat and you never really cared who dunnit!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was half as fun as the reviews led me to believe","review":"I was expecting a laugh out loud type of book, if I believed the reviews. Instead I found a too long book with a wry undertaker, whose witticisms were at best, forced. This book had it all - politics, sex, mystery, and theater- perhaps to appeal to a wider audience. I will try his next book in the hope that he settles down and writes a good mystery. As for this book, I think the best thing was the title! Oh and rotaries in Boston are called rotaries, not roundabouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable","review":"Effortless, good-humored prose; well-developed, quirky characters; and a malodorous whiff of politics make for a very entertaining book.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Murder Mystery ever read!","review":"A great book. The lead character, an undertaker, has a great sense of humor. This book kept me laughing, even through the murders."},{"rating":"1","title":"One small step above watching TV","review":"I know this is a popular series, but we just don't get it. The game is chock full of MTV-style cartoon music videos, and our son just gravitates towards making them play over and over. He only occasionally gets bored enough to try some of the supposedly educational games, and gets little out of them.He's a bright three year old who does well with some other educational software (including BabyWow and Reader Rabbit) so I blame the software, not him. It will indeed keep him entertained and out of his parents' hair for long periods of time, but it's educational in about the same way that a Snickers bar is nutritional: lots of candy, with a few just barely helpful nuggets inside.We don't let him play this any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY HOT","review":"I loved this book. It is perhaps the best black lace book I've read(and I've read several). Lots of really kinky action and a well-developed plot, although that's not really so important. The ending was a bit disappointing, but all in all, this book was scrumptious, and I'm going to share it with my boyfriend. If you like this one, you'll probably also like Hostage To Fantasy and Darker Than Love, also from the Black Lace Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexyyyyyyyyyyyy!","review":"This is great stuff. If you like Olde Englande, tightly laced up corsets, voluminous petticoats, and handsome men in tight breeches wearing velvet masks riding around like Dick Turpin satisfying every woman in sight then this is for you. It's 'Forever Amber' with full-on sex scenes. I loved it, it was a total turn-on and I'd recommend it to anyone. Superb. Reading the pages is like actually being there with all the sensations, sights and smells of sex in the seventeen-forties. YUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well developed scenes but loose story.","review":"The book is really about a young woman's fall into decadence.After Lord William dies, his will is discovered to be missing. Both of his sons, Valerian and Drummond Hawkesworth, were estranged from their father and both seek to inherit. Drummond returns from somewhere (not sure) and discovers that his brother is incontrol of the family estates. He realizes that his brother will kill him if he does not have a plan to get back into the manor and disguises himself as a highway robber. Meanwhile,Valerian, the evil brother torments Lydia and the household in his older brother Drummond's absence by bringing in his mistress. Amongst all of this deception and intrigue, Lydia manages to have intercourse with just about every character in the book. She is not a victim. The book has very hot scenes that are ff,mm, group,and fm.Unfortunately, I did not like the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I love this book. Its one of my many favorites from Black Lace. I read this book many years ago and still remember it very well because I kept my copy till it fell apart.

This is a good thing and bad thing too. The reason it's bad is because they just ripped off Kid Rock (yea!! KID ROCK!) . They sound like a chealer verison of him. But the good part is that I burned many copies of this cd and am selling them as a \\"long lost\\" Kid Rock cd called \\"So Damned Tough\\" to dumb pathetic fools on Ebay. I actually got an email from one of them telling me how great the cd was! HAHAHA. Poor fol. There's no way to tell the difference between pimpadelic and Kid Rock unless you know who you're listening to. Except pimpadelic sound older. In conclusion, musically this cd [is] so bad, but im giving it five stars because im stacking mass figures because of it. peace out [fellas]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite 110bcd!","review":"Marked as 110, it comes VERY close - but the chainring bolt holes are shaped like ice cream cones, and the chainring bolt just barely won't fit in the holes. It'll fit in the widest part of the hole - that is, the ice cream scoop - but to fit on more than one, the chainring bolt would need to be slightly narrower, which isn't practical, because chainring bolts are fairly universal.

But anyone will appreciate the way in which this book makes clear that Bladerunner is even more relevant to cultural history than most of had supposed it is. If you read this book, you will not only learn about Bladerunner, you will learn a lot about art, government, religion and politics. Highly recommended for hardcore BR fans and anyone who believes that people are still creating works or great merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once more with Feeling","review":"Having discovered M. Cunningham through the novel The Hours, I was looking forward to Specimen Days. I was not disappointed. In each of the 3 stories in this novel, he celebrates life through the inspiring words of Walt Whitman. But each story finds its own way to appreciate the life we are given. Cunningham's sense of the tragic leaves me saddened at each turn. I found myself moved to tears at the end of this novel. My heart was heavy for the losses these characters experienced. What profound and powerful prose he puts on paper for us to ponder."},{"rating":"1","title":"ponderous book","review":"I was very eager to read this book, but the excitement fizzled as I trudged my way through the first part of this novel. While the writing is exceptional, \\"In The Machine\\" was very ponderous. Admittedly, I didn't finish the book and don't plan to in the very near future, but I've wondered if anyone else was as disappointed so early on. For anyone new to the author, read The Hours for a fantastic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and depressing","review":"I absolutely loved The Hours, and thought his other two books were good as well. So I was looking forward to getting this one. What a disappointment. While the writing is as good as ever, and the Whitman threads and the connections in time are interesting, the book is one big weight of doom and gloom and horror and sadness. While Hours also had depressing moments (which unfortunately the movie seemed to take as its prime MO), it also had moments of laugh out loud humor. There was none here. No humor, no human kindness, no hope. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is that it is well written - well enough that I actually wanted to read the whole thing. Otherwise I'd not recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT The Hours","review":"Wow.What a weird and disappointing book!I LOVED The Hours- but this is on par with The Mermaid's Chair, in terms of its failure to measure up. TMChair is no \\"Bees\\" and THIS is no \\"THours\\"!If you enjoy historical fiction AND SciFi, you will like the way Cunningham bridges the two genre; otherwise: forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear to me what the theme of this book is","review":"Specimen Days consists of three stories, with in each of them a woman, a man and a boy. The first story is located in New York at the time of the Industrial Revolution, when a young boy has to take the place of his older brother when the latter dies during an accident with the machine that he operates. In order to safe the girlfriend of his deceased brother he mutilates himself... The second stories plays in the present time and portays the life of a police woman who tries to prevent random violence from people with mental problems and who is more or less overwhelmed when all of a sudden children start committing suicide bombings... The third story is located in the future, when Earth has made contact with another civilization and a Nadian and a humanoid flee from theme park New York to go to Denver. It is unclear to me what the common theme of the book is and the stories were not overly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse. I kept hoping it would get better. Each part, however, went further and further south. Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise. It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone. Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman. The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to come out, I love all of his other books. I only got through half of it..I find it depressing, boring and just strange. I'm really disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I've read all of Michael Cunningham's novels and The Hours is among my all time favorite books. As a follow-up, Specimen Days is so awful, it's almost shocking. Perhaps I can be generous enough to give Cunningham some points for ambition, but he's operating in two worlds (the second and third sections) where he is just in way too deep and where his natural talents just do not fit.I won't betray any plot points except to say the third section, which takes place in the future, should have been scrapped before it saw the light of day by Cunningham or his friends (who read his work prior to completion) or his editor or someone else who values his reputation. It's just horrendously bad.And don't get me started on the seemingly tacked-on Walt Whitman \\"theme\\". Ugh.I hope Cunningham rebounds with his next novel by returning to worlds and emotions and themes with which he is more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at his best","review":"Michael Cunningham is such a fine writer that even when he is not that good, he is still above average. In \\"Specmien Days\\" he is above average and not much else. This is a rather disappointing piece of work. The novel is actually a trilogy of three smaller novellas. Unfortunately in this case the whole is less than the sum of the parts. The first part is in my opinion the superior one. The middle part reads like the screenplay of some generic police procedural TV drama. The final part, the most ambitious one almost descends into B grade science fiction. The writing remains first rate and Cunningham does succeed in transporting us into another space and time. But one gets lost in this space-time warp and the fleeting ghost of Whitman can do little to rescue us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"Very interesting novel. First time reader of this authors work and he is very good. Love the constant references to Whitman.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mostly Successful Experiment","review":"I enjoyed the three novellas that comprised this book, but now feel a little bit like an English professor who must grade his student's work. For that is what Specimen Days feels like: a creative writing project that hits more often than misses. The first story is hard to get into but ends on a transcendent note and is quite involving. The second is also well done, with an ending that is unexpected and terrifying. The final story, though, is a bit weak. Cunningham has never tried science fiction before, and Like Beauty is a bit stilted and has some inherent problems (also, it's too much like a Blade Runner concept). However, Specimen Days is well worth reading, and any book that makes me want to go back and read a poet like Walt Whitman is worthy of recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I admire the author for taking risks with this story. The first two stories are compelling and disturbing, but gripping. The last...well, I don't think the author has a future as a science-fiction writer, but he made an admirable stab at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers of literature, buy this book","review":"Some years ago a friend handed me a copy of The Hours and said, \\"I think you'll like this book.\\" What an understatement. Loved it. Love the writing--the carefully crafted, beautifully organized, lovingly offered prose of this writers' writer. And just this week, another friend handed me Specimen Days and said, \\"Did you read The Hours? You would probably like this book....\\" Again, profound understatement. Specimen Days has reminded me once again that we are utterly lost without art. It is the poets, the writers, the artists whose heightened sensitivity (to use Wordsworth description) and courage combine to show us the world as it is... and it is only in seeing the world through their eyes that we come to the awareness that something needs to change.... Specimen Days is a tremendous creative work. Bravo, Michael Cunningham, bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars but should be 1","review":"I'm sorry but I can't believe the hype for this novel.

In \\"In the Machine,\\" 13-year-old Lucas spouts Whitman's verse, faces grief and finds love only to be tormented by his dead brother's voice in the machines in the Ironworks where he is employed during the Industrial Revolution of the 1920s in New York.The next story, \\"The Children's Crusade,\\" is in 21st century New York City with African American police detective Cat investigating a band of Whitman quoting children terrorizing the city. The final story is \\"Like Beauty,\\" dealing with the futuristic android with a Whitman poetry chip implanted in its circuits and its journey with Luke, a young boy, to find its maker. The novel is artistically constructed and showcases Cunningham's flair for language and developed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, enjoyable and innovative","review":"Michael Cunningham is not afraid to innovate, to challenge, to extend an idiom to and beyond its limitations.

It offers little, if any, real world advice to the would be podcaster. It is a book full of unorganized, run-on thoughts strung together with out-of-the-blue segues.

By telling the unique stories of 12 young women in 12 cities, it's like a collection of shoujo short films. Though the animation and music seem about 10 years too dated, the story and characters are interesting and engaging enough to compensate. The blend of drama, humor and even the occaisional horror or meditative, philosophical element lends each episode a unique flavor and tone as well. Some episodes are a laugh riot, some are more contemplative, but it's never dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Noses","review":"This set contains twelve different stories about twelve different girls, and every one of them has an ugly nose.

The only thing that could be added would be a chapter on how to best apply anti-perspirants and deodorants. I know several people who could benefit from reading such a chapter.

With some modification and a hand made gasket it was fixed, only to find out that the valve itself did not maintain a good seal when turned off and it leaked.

If not go back and do some more smoothing till there is no leaking. Then add more water and swish it around to get the filings out of the jug.

Even so, those in the medical field will find the stories far from juvenile and quite rich in detail, spiced with references to Klawans' favorite baseball players and musicians. Included in the collection are interesting historical vignettes, including one about the 3rd century Roman emperor Maximinus I. The title of the book comes from the chapter devoted to the neurological condition that caused famous symphony conductor Arturo Toscanini to drop his baton while leading the NBC Symphany Orchestra during a performance of Wagner in 1954.

Aside from the audio quality, (the vocals sound hollow and tinny and the P.A. system eats it at the end of Peaches En Regalia), this album is a prize in my Zappa collection.The surprising improvisations by Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, the humor, the ethos, the pathos, the Porthos, the Aramis,the Brut Cologne.

As it is pictured, the dress looks like it should hit the tops of the feet, but it barely came past my daughter's knees, and she is a very petite 10 year old. I ordered the size 8/10. The top of the dress was also HUGE around the chest and shoulders area, not cute and fitted as pictured. She was not happy that she had to wear a shirt underneath for modesty's sake. The collar was also too big and very awkward - wouldn't stay in place and the velcro to hold it on was badly placed. She chose to go without it. Overall, we were both disappointed with this costume. Would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"The sound is good for the price. My rating is low because the CD door is a finiky beast.

Of the five shapes he managed to hammer in, 2 snapped in half when he struck them with the hammer by accident. Lastly, the cork board is really small.

If you don't know much about Chicago R&B, it's a great place to start. It has fine coverage of all the major labels and some of the smaller ones.

The story concerns Father Ambrosius, also known as the Wanderer, who has rescued two boys, one from a demon and the other from Viking raiders and he rescues an Irish Wolfhound named Seamus.I collect books that feature Irish wolfhounds in the story, so one never knows what you'll find when you read the book. The book, written in 1972, is out of print. It is religious in nature, but for the not-so-religious, there is a lot of action along with love and redemption. The story is not preachy and events are told in a rather straight forward, matter-of-fact tone leaving the reader to draw their own conclusions.The wolfhound, Seamus, is integral to the story and embodies the best characteristics of this noble dog!

This game ain't Tenchu, it ain't Bushido Blade. There is no feeling like a Samurai. They might as well have made this a 2D scrolling action game.

I bought it after reading the reviews on line and I must say that I was thouroughly disapointed. I totally wasted my money. First off, the players move way too slow, and you are limted with only a few moves. I kept playing hoping that it would be better, but gave up after a couple of days out of bordom. I would compare the gameplay, fun rating and overall playability to that between atari and the first nintendo. Don't waste your money. It just goes to show you that some of these reviews are illegitimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible game save design","review":"Just imagine that you have spent hours playing this game and your dog comes walking by your PS2 console and pulls the plug from the wall. No problem right? WRONG! You will have to start from the begining of the game. You lose all of your game data because this game allows you to only load the data one time! So if you can't make it to a save point while playing (which there are very few)or you reset your PS2 by accident, you have to go through everything all over again. In all fairness it would have been a great game if it wasn't for that small detail. Depending upon the decisions you make, you can determine the outcome of the game which is pretty cool. I should also mention that the game has also frozen up on me a few times and of course, I had to start ALL over again. A good idea for a game but just not playable.

They are plentiful but in the end you are limited to your choices of what to say/who to follow/where to go and often times you'll find that some of the endings are similar, which isn't all that great of an idea considering that there are only six endings to the game.Other than that the game offer a wide variety of weapons to choose from (swords mostly) and a variety of characters to interact with. (GEEZ, that old man is annoying!)All in all though a good game, especially for the unique who is a hybrid of PS2 and Akira Kurosawa fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never played it, never will..","review":"From so many reviews, they suggest highly for this game and give it a 5 star rateing.

Theres alot of samurai, ninja, and whatever else there is in a name for martiel arts games comeing out. I'll wait for Onimusha 2, Shinobi and many others that seem to have boggled my expectations. This \\"Way Of The Samurai\\" tends to lack alot for me just from reviews, images and personal recomendations that suggest, don't bother. Don't waist your money, save it for a future release.

That's what a good book does ... it makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"In Perfect Madness , Judith Warner successfully exposed a strong view being held by some groups of professional women about motherhood in the new millennium. It is all about securing career growth while being a mother, a path that demands less presence by the mother in the life of her child(ren), while at the same time is fraught with the pressure to be the ideal mum that children always dream about, the mother who is always there when needed. It is a rising conflict in motherhood in the rapidly professional America where the specter of single parent families is growing everyday. However I think this book should have toned down its strong feminist perspective. It is a good read though. I like its hilarious side the most.The style employed here is similar to that in The usurper and Other stories with incredulous events."},{"rating":"1","title":"If someone is having this much of a problem...","review":"...with their life choices, they really need to look within themselves (and possibly to a professional therapist) for answers.Our society, culture, and politics are what they are; we all live and work within the same framework. Yes, adjusting to parenthood is difficult but people have been doing it for quite a few generations in this country and somehow they've all managed. One can choose to feel guilty and anxious day in and day out, or one can choose to feel grateful and joyful at the fullness of one's life. Lamenting that Europeans do it better is neither here nor there and is not helpful to the average American woman.Soul-searching and taking responsibility for what your life looks like is what will help women, not wishful thinking. All we can control are the choices we make, regardless of what the growing pains of the post-feminist era in this country may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"review from a stay at home mom","review":"I really enjoyed this book. After having my second child I became so depressed that I started taking prozac. I felt like I was the only one who felt like \\"What did I get myself into?\\" Reading Perfect Madness made me realize that there are many mothers who are having trouble indentifying their new selves. This book also gave me a few good laughes. I would reccomend this book to any mom. The only thing that I questioned is that the author did come across a little bitter. Then again so do I!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have the cure for mommy madnes!!!","review":"I have a great cure for mommy madness and a terrific new reality show all wrapped up in one! We will take all of the rich, urban white women suffering from mommy madness and have them swap places with poor mothers in exciting location such as inner-city Detroit, Harlem, South Central L.A., Little Havana in Miami and under the local interstate overpass. Next season, these poor overextended mommies get to trade places with moms in exotic Indonesia, Haiti, Sudan and El Salvador.I suspect that once they have seen real suffering and experienced true hardships their affliction will be gone.Another thing, can we please ban the word \\"stress\\" from the Englich language? It now seems to mean \\"made up problems by someone who has too much free time\\". A hundred years ago no one cokplaimed about being stressed out, not having enough me time or having low self esteem. These are all just outcropping of too much time and money and not enough sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Solutions Leaves Us In The Mommy Trap","review":"I couldn't agree more that \\"Perfect Madness\\" doesn't help anyone. I have read a lot of books on similar subjects and the only one that is different is \\"How To Avoid The Mommy Trap,\\" by Julie Shields. Some mothers are like the ones in \\"Perfect Madness\\" and some mothers and fathers overparent, but we don't have to. Perfect Madness starts several levels behind the \\"Mommy Trap\\" and never catches up. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, a truism that is especially true for mothers stuck somewhere they don't want to be or somewhere that is not good for their families or themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big warm pat on the back","review":"The book succeeds at the least in being an interesting read and quite a we're-all-in-this comfort if you're a mother working in or out of the home, or both. Though she's interviewed but a small slice of society, Warner taps into the extreme performance anxiety many American moms are facing as we try to cope with what society's dealt us. And it's not senseless whining, as other reviewers have claimed -- there's a clear agenda here, but it involves getting together and getting some big policy changes through -- in the interests of mothers and children, for a change. If more women understood that's what needed, fewer would blindly accept that mothering is a \\"sacrifice.\\" It needn't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Thinking Ahead","review":"As a father of a one-year-old, I am extremely disappointed in Ms. Warner's portrayal of today's American family, in which the father is essentially deemed useless and the mother is two steps away from the funny farm. While my wife puts in her fifteen hours in the office and on the road, I work around my part-time job and household chores to help guide my son through his day. It's hard, and we lose our share of hair, but if we didn't have to sacrifice the greater part of ourselves for the sake of our child, we couldn't call ourselves parents. Ms. Warner is right -- we live in a priviledged society. This means we have more control than any generation before us in planning and providing for our families. Those who complain now should've thought ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not that good and/or helpful","review":"I was hoping for some good anecdotes, science or SOMETHING, but really it was just a lot of whining. Also i feel like i was reading the same thing over and over again, just in a different chapter.

No mandatory paid maternity leave, check. Antiquated expectations of new mothers in the workforce, check.But after awhile the litany of \\"madness\\" that surrounds some of the women seems helplessly self-imposed. Don't spend two months pay on a birthday party, if it's so maddening to do so! Husbands are also portrayed as clueless jerks who would chew off their own hand before doing laundry.The book started to have some moments, but it relied too heavily on a small group of women who need to take some initiative in their lives. There's a lot of fodder for the pathetic deal women and mothers get in this country, but it doesn't come through here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! It will leave you feeling horrible, as well!","review":"I read this book for a book club. I don't know WHERE the author found these women, but they aren't like any I know! Warner writes of a mother, for example, who is literally wasting away and dying because of all the effort she expends for her kids. I consider myself a feminist, but this book goes too far with the \\"poor us, poor mothers, we are so abused by society and our families that we have no identity of our own\\". It is torture to read, and it writes about a very small percentage of over-the-top mothers. Also, it reads as a pompous academic tome, rather than in the conversational tone I prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is a Parody of Her Ownself","review":"Judith Warner says that motherhood is too full of stress, anxiety and finger-pointing but she proselytizes that we are all doing it all wrong. Does anyone else see the contradiction?Warner says that she could more successfully handle motherhood and a career -- she could do it all -- if only she had more help. Does anyone else see the contradiction?Warner says that motherhood is unbearably hard. Isn't absolutely anything worthwhile unbearably hard? (As well as tremendously rewarding, exhilarating, fun and challenging...)Warner needs to understand the choices she is making as a mother, writer and woman... and live with them -- enjoy them. I was a career professional and am now totally happy and content raising my children. I choose to be happy raising my own children.This book is a disservice to our generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wealthy Whiners Unite!","review":"What a sad statement about the state of preppy culture. Of course, none of it is their fault. The pressure is too much. This book is a manifesto alright, about how wealthy American women are wimps. The pressures being, as Ms. Warner told Salon, \\"how many sleepovers should my daughter have in one week? As Colonol Kurtz said, \\"The Horror, the Horror.\\" Which is an appropraite quote to use when faced with people who have everything finding a way to whine about it. You live in Eden Ms. Warner. Figure that out. Get over yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a GRIP!","review":"I saw this author on Nightline last night. Wah, wah, wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. No you can't have it all, duh!

Don't waste your money on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"This book attempts to give voice to perceived laments of dissaffected or disallusioned mothers, who were under the impression that they could have it all in terms of career and family.

If I was going to keep working, I might have to take out a home equity line on my house.\\"Oh, boo hoo.While Ms. Warner is accurate in showcasing the neuroses that defines many moms today (ie, getting into the right art class or obsessing over birthday party plans), her book is mostly a big whine fest about overeducated women who have the luxury of staying home with thier children, then pout and obsess because thy are not happy with their choices.Out here in the real world, most of us are not so nervous. We are too busy with jobs and actually doing the job of parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unserious","review":"Judith Warner overgeneralizes from her own personal experience and that of a small segment of society (which is self-evidently atypical of society at large), anecdotal evidence, and unsupported assertion.

Instead what I found was a nearly unreadable and repetitive history of how we got where the author thinks we are now. Every chapter repeated the previous one, with a few changes in wording. Yes, we know women have not been equals in the past. I was hoping to hear more about how current moms deal with issues, not how our mothers were treated in the past. I was extremely disappointed and will not be reading Judith Warner again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't be serious?","review":"Yawn...Newsflash...raising a family is work and requires sacrifice...and parents have been doing the job for quite awhile now..even in pre feminist times when their priorities were clearer. Gasp!!!Some people are able to do the job without producing 'columbine students' without nannies, travel, and privilege...Go figure.This book is a good sequel to Prep. I am definitely for respectful treatment of women but not at the trivialization of motherhood and the whinners who can't figure out the obvious...or use poor women and men to supplement through daycare etc. their own lack of committment.Given our culture this book presents fodor for discussion but not as intended.

Although there is a lot of thread on the reel, the retracting elastic gets too tight and breaks when about 6 feet of thread is extended.Additionally, the thread on my reel had taken on the curve of the reel, instead of lying flat. I expect that the thread is twisted as it is placed on the device, causing this flaw. This caused it to have a curvy wave like very curly hair. The result was that the I.T. was more obviously reflecting every light source than if it was strait. I tried to use the I.T. on another reel, but it kept coming off, due to the curliness.The I.T. on this reel is stronger than others I have tried.If you are looking for a powered reel, I have had very good results with the Tarantula, which doesn't have any of the problems of this reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions","review":"No instructions come with this thread reel.

Many of the poems are love stories as well.The content is very diverse, and that is nice as well, along with some well known Spanish poets that we have all heard of before makes the book a nice keep sake. If you are a poetry lover I would get the book anyway, where else can you get a text with Andalusian poets in English. I would definately recommend WISODOMS OF ISLAM if you would like a wonderful book in content, spiritual odes, and real love! For Allah that is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love poetry","review":"While I don't consider this \\"Islamic poetry\\" this small collection of poems is really beautiful.

In this book, Cola Franzen has translated several score mostly brief poems of the period from the Spanish translations of the Arabic done by Emilio Garcia Gomez. I don't have the languages to evaluate them as translations, but I think any reader of the English will be delighted with the result: these poems are clear, vivid, courtly, elegant, passionate, and of great general appeal. For anyone particularly interested in Al-Andalus, this is a must have book, and can also be strongly recommended to readers of poetry in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of detail","review":"Very short easy read book.

Kirchwey accomplishes said task by engrafting technical words upon each other, words that outwardly have little in common. Moreover, Kirchwey's great use of setting enables me to feel the location of each poem. I need not piece stilted descriptions together in a linguistic, logical manner, but rather, I subconsciously gain a poignant and fluid perception of my surroundings. And again, I think Kirchwey achieves this through diction specific to the time and region. He magically engrafts the past with the present, my familiarities with his familiarities, and our modern-day collective representations with those of peoples' long ago.

Boylan's music is as satisfying as the early work of other California icons, like Warren Zevon and Ned Doheny. The music is deliciously mellow, but barbed with tart lyrics and sharp rhythms that snatch the listener from blissful reverie. Steely Dan and Jackson Browne are obvious influences. His last two albums in their entirety would have fit perfectly on one CD (and they all deserve to be heard). Unfortunately, they don't all appear here. On the other hand, this CD contains a few new recordings, something fans haven't had from Boylan in a quarter of a century. According to his website, Boylan, who owns Spinnaker Records and a publishing company, is recording new material. Let's hope it's true.

I couldn't even finish it. I wound up skimming to the end to see what traumatizing event would afflict Ice. It's a shame, because Ice's story had promise. I bet the real V.C.

This book feels nothing like a true VCA book with multigenerational family drama and secrets.I'm not sure what Neiderman was thinking when he came up with this series. I doubt that this series was inspired from the notes that VCA left after her death.

Redmond's first effort moves along quickly and generally holds your attention. However, there is little depth to the characters, and there is little suspense because you'll be able to guess what happens well before it actually occurs.

But then I realized that this book was just not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"What promised to be an exploratory novel of the haunting side of British school system life of mid-century turned into a rather lame horror novel of unleashed \\"evil\\" power. The first half of the book, despite some trite language and cheesy dialogue, had intensity and the potential to develop a frightfully wonderful relationship. I had originally seen it's British publishing as The Wishing Game, and the marketing on that and the American version leads one to believe it is going to further that relationship to a potentially murderous level, but it veers from the Heavenly Creatures route to something akin to teen occult films like The Craft. It's prologue and epilogue structure were also rather tired, and technically present questions about plot holes and knowledge when fitted against the story line, but can be ignored. I just offer these quick thoughts as an alternative to the rave reviews others have posted, just so you have a broader scope before going ahead and getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost so good","review":"I started this book with a sense of foreboding, the back cover review saw to that. In its early stages, Something Dangerous (aka \\"The Wishing Game\\" in Britain) is excellent. The actions of Rokeby towards his teachers and his class mates leave you feeling a little dubious. Would a 14-year-old actually ever act like that? You get over it and assume he would, but just as you get to the really good scenes, the author resorts to the use of infuriatingly wrong punctuation (! or ! ) and UPPER CASE FOR SHOUTING. It is all so disappointing. The reader is clever enough to spot a shout if the author is up to conveying it. I do not think Mr. Redmond is and there the novel falls apart. There are just a few things wrong with this novel, but they destroy the atmosphere of the story. You want to get immersed in the words but are constantly being put off by the delibrate basic English errors. A shame"},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback","review":"Oh, God, another much-pushed much-hyped novel that proves itself unworthy. There's a strong sense of place and the author conveys a good glimpse into life at a British public school, but the author's style is shallow, melodramatic, and annoying, as is the characters' tendency to SHOUT AT EACH OTHER IN CAPITAL LETTERS! I felt like I was reading a young-adult novel -- except a lot of YA novels are better than this one. Robert Cormier's 'The Chocolate War', for example, also set at an all boy's school, is a much more powerful, intelligent, shattering work -- and addresses the issues of evil in a much richer fashion -- than Redmond's attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous new writer: loved it and was scared to death","review":"As the other reviews here say, what's so clever about this brainy chiller is that it threatens violence all the way through, keeping you right on the edge of your seat and letting you project your own fear into the narrative.

He's clueless about how 14-year old boys interact (in any era.) He presents a world where each of these boys analyzes every emotion he feels; everyone converses endlessly about their relationships with each other, sounding like 30-somethings in couples counseling (even a pair of twins).The adults are completely anachronistic; women are surprisingly savvy about battered wives syndrome, and in general everyone sounds like they're on \\"Dr. Phil.\\" I'm surprised this was even published in Britain. This guy seems never to have read anything about the culture of public schools of that era. I guess fiction editors don't edit anywhere anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel.","review":"I adored this book. The story and characters Patrick Redmond created and how the story went was nothing short of amazing. I was a bit overwhelmed after reading 'Something Dangerous' in fact I was moved to tears and felt pyshically ill for a few days.The ending took me by surprise and there is a part of me that wishes it had ended differently but another half still wishes to understand what really happened. Jonathan and Richard were my favorite characters. Jonathan, the boy who craves love and attention from his father and who had that boyish charm about him that would make anyone fall in love. Richard the disturbed, angry boy who grew up hating his father and refused to let anyone get closed to him after his mother died, that is until Jonathan came along.It was very refreshing to read a novel like this because of the subtle hints it gives you to the deeper relationships of the characters.

We purchased one that broke on the 3rd bottle of wine so we returned it for another one which did exactly the same thing. We never had any problems with our original corkscrew and even gave them as gifts. The \\"sleeve\\" that slips down over the bottle top has little plastic \\"stops\\" that broke off after one or two uses. Very disappointed because the design and mechanics of this corkscrew are great. It removes the corks as slick as a whistle usually but when these pegs break the \\"sleeve\\" slides down and makes it inoperable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires engineering degree and the touch of a surgeon","review":"I've seen two of these break. The part that encircles the neck is fragile. If someone who hasn't read the instructions tries to use it, they never get the encircling part latched properly.I read the manual and did everything right except I attempted to pull the cork, without removing the foil (admittedly not a good practice) and it broke immediately. It was a friend's and I had to replace it, leaving me with a foil cutter extra. It's a good foil cutter but not worth$50."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need three arms...","review":"I returned this--absolutely unusable. Could not keep bottle engaged WHILE pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good corkscrew","review":"This purchase replaced an identical WineMaster Corkscrew that was nine years old. The old corkscrew broke after moderate use (about 3 X week) over those nine years. A minor inconvenience: the foil cutter on both corkscrews didn't stay on the corkscrew because little plastic ears snapped off immediately. The product itself works just fine; most of the time the cork comes out in less than two - three seconds. The only negative is its size; it takes up more space than other corkscrews. This is a quality product that should last, again, nine or more years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks VERY easily","review":"Our Vacu Vin wine opener partially broke in the first week we owned it. There is a plastic internal part that broke off. The part is sort of a stopper to keep you from moving the housing that goes onto the bottle too far. We limped along with this opener for the next year - mechanically it is a great design and we love it for that. But finally, while opening a bottle, the housing shattered. I don't understand why they don't make this otherwise great wine opener with metal or some other stronger material. It just doesn't hold up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while, then - not!","review":"This item was a gift, and worked well for a while, then the rubber gripping surfaces detached, one by one. They were designed by a sadist: while it was possible to reinstall them, the operation took way too much time and caused much frustration. I did find that if you were left with at least two functional grippers (of four), and made sure they gripped opposite sides of the neck of the bottle, it would still work (after a fashion). But finally one of the little plastic parts inside the mechanism (mentioned in several other reviews) shattered. Now it is (sadly) just a conversation piece, and I've gone back to a $2 lever corkscrew - it isn't as pretty, but it works just fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent source of inspiration, insight and devotion!","review":"Charles Swindoll has written a devotional that is an excellent source for spiritual growth and insight.

If you go on the Washington by Dark bus tours, this book is better than the photos most of us take for the monuments.

I heartily recommend this photo essay to any Washington, D.C. visitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah....fishy!!","review":"There is a very good reason there have been so many attempts at a successful solo Aquaman series. The reason is that Aquaman just can't support his own title. The character actually isn't that interesting. His supporting cast are one note and his villains are normally pretty lame. Now all this doesn't mean all the books are bad but there just isn't enough there for longevity. Here, in I believe the sixth volume of Aquaman, the status quo changes for him and Atlantis, but its still pretty boring. You can only have so many adventures in the deep before they seem repetitive. The story by Rick Veitch is pretty bland. The art by Guichet is good and makes the undersea stuff look dynamic at times but its pretty hard to convey cool looking stuff when Aquaman is inhabiting the body of a fish who has been eaten by another fish. Overall, an average read. Par for the course for Aquaman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute - keeps them busy","review":"Both my daughters look the CD while we are in the car in traffic.

While remaining inexpensive, it still gives a very close attempt at replicating the feel of a real snare. The gum rubber side is great for quite practice time, the rebound is solid without being too bouncy, and it's got a good feel to each stroke.

I really only want to learn how to play rudiments and increase my rhythm and speed. The pad is perfect. The grey side is SO quiet, you can play it with other people in the room and not annoy them. This side is made out of a \\"soft\\" rubber has a lot of bounce to it, A LOT. The other/black side is made out of a \\"harder\\" rubber, and has less bounce, but still enough. This side is also louder, i think of it as making a \\"tick\\" sound....this side could annoy people.The grey side I use, when i want to be discreet of play along with a metronome or song. The other side is when you actually want to produce a sound. Highly recommended for a practice pad.

It's about the same sound you'd get from hitting the bottom of your shoe, it isn't loud at all. The only bad thing I have to say about this pad is that the black side is almost worthless. It's louder, doesn't bounce nearly as well. I'd almost rather the back be just wooden, but I guess there isn't any harm in having a second surface to use. Overall, great pad, worth the 30 bucks I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This practice pad is perfect for just random jamming or rhythm practice, the different sides for different workouts are great! I love this pad, but it is not as pictured. Just know if you buy it, you will not get the black plastic base, what they will send is a wooden base and is a tan-ish color.

This,along with more tidbits of interest make for a very informative and great read. I would however prefer that they didn't go into such detail about the folklore of werewolves,and stayed more on the subject of the movie.

The freedom of information trials and the FLIR analysis, although important, were given a great amount of attention most likely because the author was involved in these two topics. The reader could easily skim or skip to chapter 11 without missing much. The chapters covering the reconstruction of the events on Feb 28 and Apr 19 however, were very good and largely unbiased, apart from editorial comments. The discussion of CS gas and related issues was very informative but scattered throughout several chapters. A diagram of the compound would have helped the author reconstruct the events in more detail.

Then he uses a metaphor to look at his metaphor. The layers of symbolism and poetic technique end up obscuring most of what is useful while only pretending to tie together the two original ideas. His partition of God's activity into two categories is arbitrary and artificial, which makes connecting them to the design of the human brain likewise arbitrary. How we engage with theology, yes, that could theoretically have something to do with the specialization of brain hemispheres, but that simply wasn't what I was interested in and not what I felt like he originally posited. While Ashbrook pioneered the integration of neuroscience and theology, I just don't feel as if he did it particularly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sharp Monitor","review":"I did a ton of research prior to purchasing this monitor.

Unfortunately, the very one track I definitely looked forward to most, the ski chase music from OHMSS, is in my opinion [messed] up. And, yes, there's also something wrong with the James Bond Theme. It absolutely doesn't sound like the original.

I think this because you really didn't know what Mamgwane was. She never talked or anything so there wasn't a real reason of her even being in the book. Another thing, in the United States, most people don't measure in kilometers and they do in miles so in the book they could have told us how many miles 300 kilometers was. I also don't think that Naledi and Tiro would get in the back of a truck in which a man they did not know. There were good parts of this book but there were few. One of them was when they woke up and they were in the shed and they were afraid of the farmer coming out to get them. The farmer would have killed or punished them.

It does not belong in aschool curriculum. It is a hurtful book, and wounds the spirit of a youngchild, who is only starting to discover their identity.

There are some sliding do-hickeys on the poles you have to slide up until a pin snaps into a hole.

I work at a lot of festivals where I set up a tent for my business. My tent was surrounded by other 10x10 tents and you can see where my tent was way smaller than the other tents. And when you have several people in the tent with you, the smaller size is very noticeable. I owned a 10x10 tent previously with no problem. I feel ripped off by the deceptive sizing of this tent."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-Z UP Canopy","review":"The canopy works well and is easy to set up. However, the instructions could be easier to understand. We recommend that the company make an YouTube instructional video to show how to set it up.

We are happy with this canopy bought from Amazon under the heading E-Z UP Sierra ll Canopy, which was inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-Z UP","review":"This e-z up is pretty big.

Despite carefully following the instructions, we could not completely open the canopy. Three adult friends saw us struggling and came to help out, and we STILL couldn't open the canopy! After about an hour, we gave up. The joints felt extremely tight, and since we were leaving the next day, we didn't have time to call customer service or tinker with the joints, so we returned the E-Z Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy up and easy down!!!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find thing is one big piece that folds out like an umbrella. I was expecting a bunch of tent poles and lengthy assembly process. The carrying bag is well designed and even has wheels to make it easy to transport. I have not tested it in high wind though but the supplied stakes look like they should do a good job. It's a big bonus that no ropes are needed to support this thing. It's also very tall so that you can easily walk in and out without ducking. The downside to being tall is that the sun has a lot of penetration except when straight above. It's worth adding a single roll-down tarp that can cover one of the 4 walls to have a great sunshade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Luck","review":"We purchased this based on positive reviews for our beach trips. I will say all went well the first day. However, the next day when we went to put it up, the canopy part would not fit properly. IT SHRUNK!!

Just watch out for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Assemble w/ TWO People","review":"This thing is impossible to assemble. My husband and I struggled for hours trying to prop it up to no avail. There is no clear-cut way to lengthen the legs to make it the correct height, the tarp is so tight that the struts will not push out, and, in general, the product is flimsy and cheap.

Rolling Thunder was an exceptional man with a unique spiritual connection, he was an intuitive healer who sincerely cared about people. The majority of people that knew him will tell you he had a human side too, he could be just like any other individual with anger Etc. The book shows one a good overall picture of who Rolling Thunder was and how he lived his life. A book of this nature is not an easy task, capturing Rolling Thunder in a written form is a serious challenge and Doug Boyd did a pretty good job of that. This is a hard to put down book, once you start reading it you will find in nearly impossible to stop.

Lie of the Tithe will blow this book away and cause anyone who reads this trash to throw it in the garbage. Shame on them for writing such garbage.It is full of guilt, condemnation, and manipulation.

I've written to them numerous times--they do respond but it's gone on for weeks with no resolution. I've asked them to call me, or give me a number to call them, but they say they \\"don't offer phone support\\". What?

I believe that Site Spinner belongs to this elite group.Many, like myself, who have worked for hours (or days, or weeks...) with html and scripting will find Site Spinner to be a powerful and elegant tool. One often overlooked feature of web authoring programs is the compatibility of the sites it generates with different browsers and operating systems. Although my projects do not make use of all of the options of SS, I have found them to have the same appearance when run on a variety of computing set ups.With experience, one finds that every piece of software has its flaws; undoubtedly, SS has some, but they, too, are few and far between!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely simple and extremely powerfull to use!","review":"Having tried numerous freeware, shareware and other -ware programs in trying to create my own website; I finally came upon SiteSpinner.

Within hours you are able to make the first pages of your website and the built in ftp server is very good. What I like best about SiteSpinner is that the forum is one of the best that I have seen. Any queries are answered with the speed of lightning; not only from the dedicated forum but also from the members itself.There is even a site which is built with SiteSpinner to help newbies..The only way to see how quick and flexibel the program is, is to try it out for yourself!

I've built many websites myself, writing them myself in HTML. I figured I'd take the easy way out and get a site building program to do it for me. I'll never make that mistake again. Either get a MUCH better product, or learn HTML yourself. It'll be easier in the long run.

It is decent web editing software.I gave it only 2 stars because it has a major flaw - You can NOT import an existing HTML page or file into it. You can only cut and paste text and images individually from an existing web site into the SiteSpinner work-window. (This is also acknowledged in a FAQ on SiteSpinner's site.)That means means you can NOT start with an existing web page, regardless of how simple it is. You must create a new page almost from scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This will be a quick review. For the money (I paid $25 for my full copy on an online sale) this is the best. I am quite used to Dreamweaver and have lost my CD and my drive took a crap. Instead of shelling out the hundreds of dollars, I have been in search of a good basic editor with WYSIWYG capabilities for quick sites. I have tried Kompozer and didn't care for it, among other free WYSIWYG editors just suck. I liked coffee cup, but feel SiteSpinner is just a bit better. You can edit your HTML in the same screen, it took me a few seconds to figure that out, so the person who said you can't didn't even take the time to look. Just look under the file drop down and select \\"Display Cod\\" or alt+c and the code is displayed next to the WYSIWYG page, on the same page. So for the buck, to me this was the best thing next to Dreamweaver. It is no Dreamweaver, but it gets the job done fairly easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"I have been using Sitespinner for 2.5 years and had never before published a website.

It doesn't have the concept of editing text in a table. Yes you can create a table. To put text into a cell of the table, you create the table, then create a separate text object, save that text object, then resize that text object, then drag that object into the table cell and hope that it fits. God forbid that you want to edit backgrounds or size of font. This tool is only fine if you're doing VERY simple design. DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL IF YOU WANT TO PUBLISH A NEWSLETTER!!!If you cut and paste the HTML into a publishing tool, the imbedded objects do NOT retain their positions. In other words, What You See Is NOT What You Get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long before Rod Stewart did standards","review":"The more you listen to this cd, the more you realize how great it is. Before Rod and Barry did these songs Leon Russell tried, and I believe succeeded in wrapping himself around nearly all of them here.

Contrary to the other reviews, I enjoyed the orchestra and can envision Leon with a philharmonic doing these standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"So he's not Sinatra","review":"If you want Sinatra there's plenty of music out there. If you like standards and you like Leon then what's not to like? This is most definitely not among my all time favorite Leon albums, but being partial to these old love songs I find it odd that people could find fault here. It would seem to me that if you know Leon's voice you would have an idea what to expect. As a fan of this genre I truly enjoy hearing different interpretations. If you do too you will enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Ice Cream?","review":"I bought this machine refurbished and it came in perfect condition. The delivery driver left it on its side when he dropped it off, so I had to wait 24 hours (per the instructions) before I could test it out. It was worth the wait. The previous reviewers aren't lying when they say this thing is loud. It's also HEAVY--which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. But...fresh ice cream in an hour can't be beat. And you can not only make ice cream, but you can make frozen yogurt, sorbet and granita (which I learned from buying David Lebovitz's book Perfect Scoop: Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, and Sweet Accompaniments). I've started using organic local fruit to make healthy (fat free!) treats, and used organic peaches from my neighbor's tree to make a heavenly frozen yogurt. This machine is worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest Ice Cream ever","review":"I was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker, but when it arrived it was just like brand new, including all original packing, perfect. I was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately, but again, it was quite strong in this regard, and froze the mixtures perfectly. Admittedly, doesn't make a huge amount, but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine MORE than makes up for it. And it's WAY quieter than the old fashioned freezers. ALSO it was half the price of a new one.

I suggest you purchase an ice cream recipe book if you plan to get this machine. There are many fun things to make and having fresh real ice cream is really a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably my favorite amazon purchase ever","review":"I have had so much fun with this purchase. Even though it was a reconditioned model, I honestly could not tell it had been pre-used. I can't think of any way that this machine could be easier (other than being less heavy!) to use and clean.

I was kind of wondering why there would be so many remanufactured units for sale so now I know it is probably because it is no that reliable to begin with. I would stay away from this item.

He toted a special handcrafted pistol and derringer, yet used no-nonsense dialogue as his chief negotiating weaponry.

It even shows how two animals who are ordinarily in a predatory relationship can still be friends. This ties into friendship between children of different backgrounds and interracial relations in general. The numerous illustrations throughout the book captured the facial expressions of the characters perfectly. A great transitional book for ages 7-9."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I live without it?","review":"A friend gave me this as a holiday gift a few years back. When I got it, I first thought, \\"what the heck is this stupid thing?\\" Was I wrong. It is one of the best, most useful gifts I have ever received. If you have ever attempted to save a partially used bottle of wine for a day or two by stuffing the cork back in, you need this! It allows you to enjoy a glass of your favorite wine with dinner, then seal the bottle and enjoy (yes, enjoy, not \\"tolerate\\") another glass later in the week. It is also great when you open several bottles for friends with different tastes. I like this so much that I have purchased several for my friends and family. It is an excellent hostess gift , too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Featured Reviews\\" are kind,","review":"this gadget doesn't work that well. True, it takes some of the air out, maybe as much as half, but that still leaves half the oxygen IN, spoiling the wine at a slower rate--2-4 days at best instead of 1-2. NOT the two weeks Madeiline Miller quotes. To really preserve the wine, try the inert gas cans $9 for 120 shots, less than ten cents per use, and they will keep wine fresh for two weeks or more. They are what the restuarants in Napa and Sonoma are using. I do like the Vacu Vin canister sets though, they keep moisture out well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Effective!","review":"The concept, design of, and use of this product is so simple that I said DUH! when I learned of it. We had previously used the the bottle stoppers that twisted to pour out the wine, but it did not matter as the wine would definitely have a bite after a few days. Using these handy little stoppers we have found most wines make it a week and sometimes as long as a week and a half tasting pretty close to the original. Definitely worth the money. I have read the debunking stories and they have a point, however, how many of us are going to open a bottle regardless of age and try to make it last several weeks? We normally drink ours within a few days at most, on occasion it might make it a week or two. This is a nice alternative to the \\"upper crust\\" theory of nitrogen, big vacuum pumps, etc. I simply have no desire to invest that much money as our purpose for opening a bottle is to......drink it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves your wine just fine","review":"The New York Times did a review of this device versus a few others and this one won.

As an avid wine drinker I could not recommend this product more. It does everything is supposed to do. The stopper really holds the pressure, unlike the Metro-Kane. The pump makes a clicking sound when the pressure is just right, which is an extremely helpful feature.I was initially looking for replacements to my \\"Wine Air-Vacs\\", a self contained stopper/air pump unit. These units had served me well for years, but the rubber stoppers were starting to wear out. Unfortunately, they are very difficult to find (and the prices really went up).Having used other Metro-Kane products, I thought I would give their stopper/pump combo a go. What a MISTAKE. The stoppers loose ALL their pressure overnight!! 80% of the time I come home to find a 1/2 bottle of oxidized wine. I began to think that this whole pump/stopper method of saving wine was useless, but I decided to try the Vacu-Vin based on all of the positive reviews.

I purchased this gadget at a local wine store and assumed that meant it was useful. That was a big mistake!This gadget doesn't do anything including seal the wine in the bottle when stored on its side in the wine cellar. Some of the time a bottle on its side won't leak, but it is just a likely to leak. I tried buying another set of stoppers and having my husband seal them as well as myself. No change made a difference. Sometime they work, and sometime they don't.Additionally, when you buy a nice Brunello or a Super Tuscan do you really want to risk it become an expensive bottle of vinegar, I don't.I purchased the wine stoppers for my foodsaver and am much happier with those. At least they don't leak.

We find it a necessity since my husband likes red wine and I do not, so we never consume one bottle of red in one sitting. There is no guilt felt when opening a bottle to have one or two glasses. When we want to have just one glass each we also have the freedom to have a different wine. The opened white wine is stored in the refrigerator and that extends the life for a few weeks. It is nice to have a chilled bottle ready for when I want just one glass. We have a large bottle that we use this stopper on, that we store the soured wine in for those bottles of red that went sour due to forgetting to finish the bottle, that we use as homemade wine vinegar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work","review":"When I first got this thing I was curious to see if I would notice the difference between an opened bottle and an unopened bottle 24 hours later, so I did a blind taste test. I couldn't tell the difference.My only issue with the thing is that it's hard to tell when to stop pumping. You also have to be careful to put enough pressure on the thing while pumping to actually make the seal. But once you have the seal, it seems to work fine. Then again, I've only stored my wine for 24 hours at most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome way to save my left over wine!","review":"My significant other does not drink. Not a drop!

Works as well, maybe even better, as the other one I got in a cork-screw removing set.How long does the wine last me with this gadget?

These are the better mouse trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"vacu-vin wine saver...doesn't.","review":"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and THE WINE SPECTATOR both reviewed Vacu-Vin years ago and found that nothing claimed was true. The product does remove the bouquet (volatile esters...got to have them to taste the wine), but not the oxygen (which was the point in the first place). According to TWSJ, and TWS...drink it, or just put the cork in it because the gimmick does not save wine.People that use them think they work because they typically finish the bottle in a day,or two. Young wines will do pretty well generally without help...but the loss of bouquet will be evident if you suck it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a cheat, but...","review":"I tried this system several years ago, It will extend the flavor of wine for a little while, but as has been mentioned in the previous entry, there is still some oxygen let in the bottle that will allow the wine to oxidize. A much better solution is to buy a can of compressed nitrogen to cover the surface of the wine and keep it from the oxygen. You still need to cork the bottle and keep it upright during storage.You can also use the gas layer storage method on oils, single malt scotch, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could it really work? YES, its a great Wine accessory!","review":"When I first got the Wine Saver, I had looming doubts. However, after much skeptizm, it definitely exceeded all my expectations.

It simple to use, just keep track of the rubber stoppers and make sure you don't throw it away with an empty bottle. Consuming wine on a daily basis, this at least gives me a little sense of security that the half empty bottle wont go bad as fast as without the stopper, it also makes you keep the bottle standing (recommended to reduce the surface area of the wine that comes in contact with the remaining air in the bottle) to lessen the oxidation process. The only 2 things that work better are: Consuming the wine that same day....or a certain neutral gas can sold around there.Wine Enthusiast Private Preserve Wine Preservation Spraythis will make it last as if you never opened the bottle, good for those of you who take more than a day or two consuming a bottle of wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preserve your wine an extra day or two inexpensively","review":"These stoppers are fantastic for preserving open bottles of wine for a couple of days. The hand pump removes some (but not all of the air) from the bottle slowing the oxygentation of the wine. Since the pump does not create a perfect vacuum, the fuller the bottle the longer the wine will preserve. Although the rubber corks lose some of their ability to keep air out after a few thousand uses (quicker in dry climates), this product is so simple to use and cheap that it will pay for itself after preserving only a couple of bottles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One kitchen gadget you can not live without","review":"This is such a great tool. It can be used for so many other things beside wine. The stopper fits in marinade, salad dressing and some soda bottles.

It does substantially prolong the shelf life of a partially used bottle of wine.As others have said, occasionally it seems to stop working effectively. I have found that introducing plain water into the shaft area relieves the stickiness and improves the vacuum seal.Does it produce a perfect vacuum? Of course not. Even expensive lab equipment doesn't produce a \\"pefect\\" vacuum. On the other hand, it substantially reduces the number of oxygen molecules which will come in contact with the wine, and that extends its life. If the rubber stoppers and the pump are aligned and used carefully, the pump evacuates a good deal of air (it does take quite a few strokes), and the reduced pressure lasts quite a while. You can always apply the pump again, if the storage period will be longer than expected.For a few dollars, it's a great gizmo. I'm getting another for my vacation home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Overall I think this is a great product.

I use mine all the time. It does preserve wine well and is quite easy to use, but I would encourage you to get extra stoppers and to use only Vacu Vin brand. I've found that other brands don't always work very well.For red wines at optimal drinking age, don't rely on the vacu vin for more than 1-2 days, 3 at most (and that will be too much for some). You may find that younger wines even benefit from a few days. This is worth trying if you open a bottle and find you don't like it.

Ms. Fraser has done an indepth research of the diet industry, examined the false claims, and explored the likelihood for permanent change after someone has lost weight by using a diet. This book promotes the idea that women should feel good about themselves and embrace their individuality. She stresses doing the best for yourself in your present self, take care of your self both physically and emotionally.

But author Hitt has taken this reportage a giant step farther by breathing life into those people. And he does so within a context of a dramatic and conflicting era in which Western forces are threatening the more sublime earth values---and spirituality--- of the once-isolated Florida Indians. Hitt's story has made the early Florida Indians flesh and blood once again, and that may be the greatest gift anyone can construct in their honor.

It is not well-written, and is boring to boot.

Whoever edited this book should be fired , and Flock needs to take an intro course in lit. I want to lock her in a room with Chuck Palahniuk for a week.

What I loved most,since I work in the mental health field, it was acurate portrayals of the people that I have worked with in the past.

But I think it was only ok and there were things in it that were very unrealistic. Such as, if you commit suicide, you don't get to voluntarily admit yourself. And you sure wouldn't be allowed to go wherever you want to on the grounds. You would be in a lock down ward.

The author does a great job of setting and explaining the main character, her history and family, and makes her a believable and likable person on her way to finding herself. I don't think the book ends with her being okay as some reviews state, but with her getting on the right path, though perhaps a little too easily. Where the book disappointed me is when talking so much about the peripheral characters. Most don't add much to the story. The book cover also says that the main character realizes that she's like the others in the ward when really she always thinks she is above them. I wish that this would have been explored more, but I still liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!","review":"LIFE CHANGING!I was browsing books at Target the other night and ran across this book.

This book gives us an inside view of what can potentially happen to any one of us, if we continually sweep things under the rug and never learn to deal and cope properly.An overall good.I would have liked to have seen an author's note on ECT treatment at the end however. I think there is a large stigma attached to this procedure, as is addressed somewhat in the story. However, it would have been nice to read some information on what ECT is about in today's world to inform the reader better of the exact circumstances surrounding Isabel's recovery.

Especially painful are the sequences which call for lots of brass; the LSO was so great at delivering a theme at full blast in an intense action scene, and the MIDI brass just sounds cheesey. The interpretation is poor in a few key sequences as well, too.Star Wars fans really deserve better than this; get the re-mastered trilogy set:<a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002YCVLU/qid=1121091193/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-8155271-9982339?v=glance&s;=music\\" target=\\"new\\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002YCVLU/qid=1121091193/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-8155271-9982339?v=glance&s;=music</a>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for war and a love story","review":"I would have to comment that the music on this 3-CD set have themes that i would not have notice if I watch the movie alone.

I am not certain that the music is entirely from the movies but it does bring out the music that accomplance it. I really love the orchestral movement on the story line of most the songs. They reminds me of the distant lands of the east. The high-pitch of the brass horn and the bravado of the beating of the drums make the music outstanding in addition to the classical. The set really match the sagas of the Star Wars trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Sorry.","review":"I could not tell the difference between the names of characters in this book, mostly because Ms. Bertin chose to step outside her field of expertise and write in a pseudo-oriental style, clashing with the sort of traditional Anglo-Saxon one she established in The Last Dragonlord [heavily laced with painfully modern romance novel dialog]. It was excruciating to see this mish mash of cultures.Some people [myself included] love dragons so much that they will buy just about anything with one on the cover [which is how I ended up with this book, and its predecessor.] This, however, is not a good contribution to draconic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book","review":"I have enjoyed this book and the other by this author, my daughter and I are glad that the Bard is now out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Revieved Item","review":"I never recieved the product, after waiting a full month for it I contacted the seller, they were unhelpful. ended up buying the book elsewhere, hoping for a refund here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and too many subplots","review":"Being a fan of McCaffrey's Pern, I was excited to find this series, especially given some of the other reviews of this and the Last Dragonlord.

Because she frequently skips from complex subplot to complex plot, it is difficult to care about the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel that is a must read!","review":"This book picks up where the other one left off a few months after the first, the Last Dragonlord.This book includes a new land, Jehanglan, the land of the phoenix.Some of the book is about Mauryanna, a new dragonlord, who cannot Change without horrible pain. Her dragon half is almost intent on smothering her at times.The story also revolves mysteriously around two mystical beings that have been held for centuries against their will. A dragon and a phoenix. But why? And to what end?That alone, I leave for the readers to discover.The story is a little more complex than her first book, with a new land and new names to keep up with. But even still, it's a book you don't want to end. And when it does, you want to know more.The writer is in the middle of her third book, Bard's Oath. A book I am anxiously awaiting for.

Either of these things apparently sell. They negate the need for good characterization, good dialog, and even a good story.There were a few good moments in this book, and for that I gave it an extra star. But it is grossly overpraised."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, Ms. Bertin","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I like books about dragons. A lot of people like books about dragons.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This sequel was strictly average. It has some interesting bits, and some exciting bits, but it never quite comes together. There is a lot of material that never really goes anywhere, and yet I still never got a good feel for the picture the author was painting.

High temperatures here in the summer months reach high 90's with the occasional day at one hundred degrees. This shed is in partial shade during much of the afternoon, yet the heat buckled it so badly that it had to be wired back together---it actually popped apart! It became so warped that the top will not close.Before that, during the winter, it contracted so much from the cold, (which, at worst, would be about 20 degrees at night) that spaces appeared at all the seams and water and snow went right in.So, what good is a shed that literally pops apart and is not water resistant?It is quite expensive and not at all reliable, unless, of course, you live in a mild climate where it is always balmy and never rains or snows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect small Storage","review":"This item was exactly what we were looking for.

After sweating about 5lbs of water weight out in the summer sun, a lot of four letter words, and 30 minutes of my time, my wife came out looked at it for about 30 seconds and said why don't you slide them in place?

The narrative itself is surprisingly involving, with three-dimensional characters, beautiful scene painting, and propulsive drama. Merwin's poetry here takes a roughly anapestic form, somewhat similar in sound to Longfellow's \\"Evangeline\\" meter. (And \\"The Folding Cliffs\\" has many other interesting parallels with that 19th-century classic.) The language is at times too prosy for my taste, and Merwin's aversion to punctuation often gives the tale a breathless quality that fights against the narrative tempo. Neverthless, this is a great artistic achievement that deserves to be read and (hopefully) imitated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveably dense","review":"I can't imagine this book being of interest to anyone other than serious Hawaiian history buffs or students of poetry. I'm not one who insists that his poetry rhyme, but some sort of meter, rhythm, or structure would have been helpful. In fact, the only thing that this has in common with what most people would recognize as poetry is its format on the printed page. It looks like verse, but it reads more like stream-of-consciousness prose, with thoughts, dialog, and descriptions continually running into one another.This is a good story that definitely hasn't been given its due before, but reading this version will send you screaming for the Hemmingway library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a paperback, not a hardcover.","review":"Even though this item is identified as being a hardcover book, it is a paperback book.

(I particularly remember her guesting on Barefoot Contessa, where she made a delish light lunch.)Anyway, she writes a mouth-watering preamble to every recipe and provides wine suggestions for main dishes. It's one of the few cookbooks worth actually READING straight through, rather than picking and choosing only the recipes that sound good.I've found some of the recipes a bit more difficult than others, but all the ones I've tried so far have been really good. AND the book has really inspired me to cook foods that I haven't worked much with before.

You may not even want to rent this movie.Nonetheless, I'm glad to see the cast and crew of Mystery Team do their part with a flood of overwhelmingly positive five star ratings.

Whimsical at times, yes, but not childish. Not everyone appreciates their brand of humor. If all your favorite movies has National Lampoon's in the title, this probably isn't for you. If you enjoy a fun comedy, with hilarious actors, than this is your film.Also to the people accusing the derrick comedy cast/crew/whatever packing these reviews, you're infantile.

Maybe it was just the excitement of seeing the show again but I felt this season was weaker than Season One. Sure, there were about 8 or 9 episodes that easily explain why this show went on for as long as it did, yet the majority of episodes make you realize the locale and the power of Jack Lord could overcome just about any lack of real story. True there are a few few gems including \\"Cry, Lie,\\" \\"Most Likely to Murder,\\" and the 2-part \\"Three Dead Cows....\\" but overall, I say Season One is a must buy and if you can view season 2 without buying new, go for it.

HOWEVER, it obviously was made with a lot of love for the fan community and the fan experience. That alone grants it an extra star. There are a lot of \\"in\\" jokes that are purely for the fanboys of the world.

The whole thing feels like a movie not made by fans of Star Wars, but by people who perhaps met a Star Wars fan in passing somewhere.The cameo appearances are nice, but just about every main actor in this movie is one of those annoying extras from other low budget 2 star movies.Dan Fogler ruins every scene he is in.

The movie was very well reviewed and had a big word of mouth following, and being a huge Sci-Fi fan, I couldn't wait to see it. The story however was extremely weak and filled with cliche Star Wars jokes. It was predictable, done, and really just lame. The only really cool thing about the film was the cameos. In this tiny independent film they had cameos by William Shatner, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Kevin Smith, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Seth Rogan, an impressive list to be sure!

If your not a fan of the Star Wars movies, don't watch it, simple as that. If you love Str Wars then this movie is for you.

The obvious easy nerdcore basis for the film belies what really works here and that is the dedication of the troupe of actors and creators. If you bleed for your obsession the way these guys do then you understand the especially real and down to earth tone of the final 10 mins or so. Some sequences are mildly forced but the jokes/gags really hit, even when you start to tire of the puns about a 1/3 of the way through the rest of the comedy works so it doesn't matter. I laughed alot, winced a little and yes, shed some tears for a movie that doesn't shun one for embracing the child within even as we grow up.Wholly entertaining and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too crude to fully enjoy","review":"As a huge Star Wars fan and general geek, I enjoyed a lot of things about the main story. However, the unrelenting stream of vulgarity finally overwhelmed the fun for me, not unlike when your toilet backs up and finally spills over onto your floor.This movie deserves an R rating for its large quantity of bad language, sexual references, drug use, and other \\"mature\\" elements. I wish it had been rated R, so I would have known that offensive content would make it not worth watching. I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone under 17. However, it seems aimed at Gen Y types who I presume have been desensitized to such things by media like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thoughtful autobiography","review":"This is an interesting look at a star's big Hollywood career. I stumbled upon it as I was reading books about Elvis and had read everything I could find written about their relationship by people on his side, and I was interested to read her perspective. Elvis is only a small part of her story; she has had a long and interesting career of her own and I was very interested to read her thoughts. If you like reading Hollywood stories of old, you can't go wrong with this book. Ann Margaret appears to be as lovely a person as she has always seemed. She is talented, intelligent and humble. I thoroughly enjoyed this autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pan, but has its limitations","review":"I used this for the first time last night, and really liked it - the nonstick is great. I was worried that the cheesecake might stick to the divider, but it absolutely did not - and I didn't add any extra greasing to it. This pan is great for dividing ONE recipe into thirds and then making them different. However, I tried to use 2 different recipes that had the same cook time and temperature, and almost ruined the entire cheesecake! The 2 recipes wound up cooking at different rates, so 2 of the sections were done about 15-20 minutes before the other section was. I think they'll all still taste fine, but next time I'll just use one recipe divided into thirds. In the end, this is a great pan, but has its limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Di Gi Charat","review":"Boy the Japanese have made animations for so long that they have ran out of inspiring and interesting material to write about.Prime example: Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat.Don't waste your money this show is about nothing with cute characters that will attract people with short attention spans.

None of these shorts can really be considered classics. The first three shorts are taken directly from the WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN tape. And the next two are taken from the A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN tape. The tape would be better if they included six episodes. I like ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES and TERMITES OF 1938, but those aren't really classics. Why couldn't they include some REAL classics on this tape like A PLUMBING WE WILL GO, DISORDER IN THE COURT, YOU NATZY SPY, HOI POLLOI, HOW HIGH IS UP? I could go on forever, but my review calls for a thousand words or less. They do better on the second Curly Classics tape with MICRO-PHONIES, MEN IN BLACK, THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS, PUNCH DRUNKS, & WOMAN HATERS.

The scene where Moe is stuck goes on too long.Notice that all three of these shorts take place in the forest, where the Stooges meet indians."},{"rating":"1","title":"superb singer, lame band","review":"I started off with Demon's third album \\"The Plague\\", which I really like because of its diversity and well-written songs. The first problem with Demon is that the drummer sounds uninspired and monotonous and that you can hardly hear the bass player. The second problem is that writing a whole album about summoning up ghosts and the dangers involved can get a bit naive or childish as is the case with this one. Lines that go like: Toootal possessiooon, I think he's possessed ! illustrate the mediocrity of the lyrics... Dave Hill is a great singer though and only his voice saves the band.

And it's just that same kind of readability that makes Scott Gray's book sparkle. The subject of sabermetrics always runs the risk of sounding like after-school homework. For Grey-and his subject, James-the tone is more like a fieldtrip to the ballpark. Some of the old-timers may not like it, but Bill James changed the way we understand baseball. And Scott Grey has provided us with a lively, entertaining, and smart way to understand James' importance to the sport. And where else are you going to learn why lemurs matter so much to the national pastime?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slapdash piece on a fascinating figure","review":"This book was a major disappointment. While there are worthwhile excerpts from James's writings, there's really almost no book here at all - no organzation, poor copyediting, almost no new research, no original conclusions, no point.It's hard to believe a major publisher would consider this a book and not a collections of cut & paste excerpts and note card jottings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"James found that it made a difference where one was pitching (or batting) because of altitude and fences, against whom (caliber of the opponent), when (pitchers are more tired in the latter part of the season), time of day (afternoon, or under the lights) - thus leading to more detailed statistics. Hardly an insight - such distinctions have been fodder for multiple linear regression programs (and more sophisticated analyses) for years.

They're not here. The biography chapters are pretty boring; so far as I can tell from the book, Bill James isn't that personally interesting a guy, and Gray isn't that engaging a writer. But I wasn't looking for James's biography so much as for an account of his ideas. (That's why I bought a book called \\"The MIND of Bill James\\"!) But it was all pretty thin. The appendix, which contains brief presentations of several of James's more influential ideas, was the most promising part of the book, but it was far too rushed.

It's smooth, it cuts close to the skin, and the results are great. That said, if I wanted wet, I'd use razors instead. When dry, however, the shaver is just awful. It doesn't give you that close a shave, has issues with hairs on the neck that go almost parallel to the skin (won't pick them up) and sometimes it catches hair in it and pulls it, which is very unpleasant. It just reminded me why I hate electric razors so much, and being a personal hygiene item, it's not something I can return.Two stars for wet shave only.

I've owned just about every high end model Panasonic came up with during that period as I typically change shavers once a year. I was initially very happy with this model it used to give me a nice smooth shave and I like the fast recharge time. I had a been using it a little over 6 months when it started malfunctioning. It shuts down within minutes of a full recharge and during the few minutes it's working it doesn't seem to be operating at full power. I am very disappointed and would not recommend it because of its unreliability. You'd be better off with one of the simpler, cheaper and more reliable models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Well, I typically use an electric razor for my chin only, as a blade will irritate it.

If you skip a day, and then try to use this razor, it and you will have a hard time of it. I use it in the car, on the way to work most often because it takes so long to get a good shave out of it. As for the build, it is excellent but efficiency is lacking. As for the wet feature what guy is shaving in the shower, give me a break and it does not better wet then dry?

I took it and told him I would exchange it for another knowing perfectly well I couldn't get my money back. I tried wet and dry for a couple weeks and was totally disapointed. This coming from a man that can use a 50 cent disposable for two weeks before it gets dull. I have a 10 year old norelco that works 10x better.

Ever try getting through to Panasonic's Customer Service line to exercise your warranty? Don't, unless you've 55 minutes to chill sitting on the phone. Then, when you finally get a live human on the phone, they'll tell you that the only option is to repair the product -- no replacement, nothing done to retain a customer of more a dozen years. To add insult to injury, YOU have to pay to ship it to a repair center!! Bottomline, this product is horrible -- this is a common problem for this model, regardless of what Panasonic PR claims. Avoid it all costs, even though it gives a great shave. At the price Panasonic charges, it's just not worth the headache. If I could dole out zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and furious","review":"When you hit the power button this thing will dig in and eat up some beard like nothing I've ever seen before...it ate up some skin too. As a dry shaver it was a little too rough on my face. I gave my skin two weeks and then I just couldn't take it anymore. It cuts close, maybe too close. Although as a wet shaver used with shaving cream it was fine but I've decided wet shaving is not for me.This is a very well made shaver. It feels like a high quality precision instrument. The pop up trimmer is the best I've ever seen. It made the Brauns seem toy like by comparison. And it runs flat out wide open until the batteries are about 5 seconds away from empty...remarkable. The shaver is also very quiet and vibration free. I admire it so much that I want to keep it even though I don't like what it does to my face.So the bottom line is that if it's a dry shaver you want then I'd look elsewhere but if it's a wet shaver you want then it's worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanyo Xacti Junk","review":"I bought a Sanyo Xacti. This ended up being the the worst camera purchase. The screen that folds out is a faulty design. It will fail, just depends on when. Our Xacti happened to fail the second day into our trip to Europe. For the $350 dollars we spent on this camera you would expect a better product, we bought it because it was the \\"Editors Pick\\" in Wired. It wasn't even a week old, and then to repair it was gonna cost $200 dollars, to which i have found other forums saying it would still fail again, sometimes within the first week of getting it back. The customer service is horrible, everything about Sanyo is a waste of money. Look at a Canon or Panasonic camera cause you will only be disappointed with this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Bought this less than a year ago. after only a handful of uses (all on land not underwater) I realized it was hard to use ability to hit buttons for still pictures while keeping hand still wasn't easy - resulted in blurry pics. Worse part is after about 5 times using it it stopped working wouldn't power up. thought it was a battery issue. Bought new battery same problem. It gets worse. Attempted to call support center 3 different times - each time after being placed on automatic hold for over 1.3hrs!!! The phone line automatically hung up. Never got through to Service! The thing has become a $250 paper weight on my desk.Ticked off consumer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for the price!","review":"I definitely like this camera. Live up here in Washington near Seattle so it's nice that if i want to mess around I can take it outside while it's raining. Recently took it down with me to San Diego and went to the beach, filmed a lot there and it was just great to have. Takes decent pictures and the videos are nice and do load very easy.Cons: Seen it before with other people, sand gets in the small cracks and makes noise when you move it but hey. And it can get slippery in the water so if you don't have a wrist strap get one, or at least get a piece of ribbed rubber to put on the side to improve your grip on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice camera","review":"I like the camera. The video gets jittery when you try to pan a scene. Also, the stabilizer is not real effective. The camera has trouble figuring out the light level but that is remedied by half clicking the shutter on an area with medium light for the picture.I've had it underwater. That is a great feature in itself for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"I bought this camera before my yearly fishing trip to Alaska and the camera functioned beautifully! I was looking for a camera that I could put in my pocket or backpack with out taking up a lot of room. The Sanyo Xacti VPC-E1 has worked out perfectly. I dropped it in the frigid Alaskan waters a few times and the camera came out working like a charm! Don't let a few of these negative reports scare you into not purchasing this camera. This camera is not a professional camera! Don't expect professional quality! Do expect to have a lot of fun with it!!!! Any digital camera isn't going to produce the best results with out light, DIGITAL NEEDS LIGHT!!!! Its compact, rugged and easy to use. Do remember to make sure the battery compartment door is shut and locked before getting it wet. I have not experienced any of the problems that some of the other users mentioned in their reviews.

But for $400, I expected a reasonable quality. There is a white spot in all images or videos I took. I remembered one previous review mentioned about this issue. He did an exchange, and still have the same issue.Also, the navigation button is too small. It is hard not to accidentally hit the wrong button. Another previous review also mentioned this problem.The image is ok if the light is good. Otherwise, the 6m (10m as claimed) is worse than my 3m Olympus.Also, the focus is also kind of slow. If the subject has a sudden move, it takes a noticeable time to focus. Again, for $400, it should have issues like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an accessory","review":"It is great to have a camera that can be used for video and still shots. HOWEVER, my battery charger broke down after using only a few times. The item a lemon since I had only had the camera for 4 months. I called Sanyo asking for a free replacement since it had broken in less than a year. They said since it was an accessory, it was not under warranty so I would have to buy a new one. It is ridiculous to consider a charger as an accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor ergonomics, and stopped working in four months","review":"Nice, compact to carry around but really poor ergonomics. It is tough to hold it in a \\"pistol\\" grip and use the thumb to press the various buttons.

I find out that they only have a 90 day labor warranty on this unit and I have to ship it from California to some \\"TV Repair\\" store in Illinois to get it fixed.

Screen picture quality is average. Controls are surprisingly limited. But the biggest problem is the video quality. Connected to a TV, I was surprised to see that for shots taken both indoors and outdoors on a sunny day, greens looked oversaturated, outlines were blurry, and very noticeable digital artifacting occurred in images of a running child. Overall I was reminded of my first VHS camera circa 1983.For shooting underwater it's affordable and brilliantly small. Unfortunately I won't get that far as I'm returning it for picture quality reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Camcorder","review":"Well this is a pretty sweet camcorder.

There is no static, as if the tunes were transferred from old 78-RPM discs, but the man's horn is unpleasantly shrill and the volume varies from cut to cut, a flaw that drives me nuts. There are moments in a couple of songs in which it sounds as if the original record or tape was heat-damaged. The tunes are not memorable, either. I found this at quite a bargain price, but still it didn't pay off. Stick to a remastered reissue on RCA Bluebird or some other major label for your Dizzy collection.

Andrews book I have ever read (it and Cinnemon are in a close race), and it is definitely in the worst series. I don't know why I continue reading these mini-series books when I know they are all basically the same book rewritten with new characters. Like other Andrews characters, Rose has to deal with the death of a parent, the self-centeredness of another parent, and meeting relatives she never knew she had. Sounds really familiar, doesn't it? Unlike the original Andrews books, where the writing was so descriptive that I could almost feel like I was there living through the events along with the characters (and did not want to put the book down for anything), the new books are so bland that it is a chore just to finish one chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"You know how some people say that 'so-and-so comes out smelling like roses', right? Not so for this book. Cinnamon and Ice were okay reads with bits of interest in them, but I don't know what book was worse, this one or Honey. This book just had such contrived twists and turns that in its own way, actually turned out to be rather predictable. So much is made of Rose's beauty, and the way she dances - the way she is described as dancing and feeling - are very cheesy and almost child-like. This book just doesn't work well in a series or on its own, it was just not very well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh! Ooh! I'm telling!","review":"Gather round children. Now, do you remember your kindly Auntie Kate telling you that some V.C. Andrews books lift bits from other books when they think you're not looking? Well, this book is a perfect example.Most of the first half of \\"Rose\\" is nicked from the first chapter of \\"Flowers In The Attic.\\" And from that, you should work out which one of Rose's relatives you shouldn't get too attached to (I don't do spoilers, honest).As to the rest of the book... bla bla bla scheming aunt, bla bla bla not-all-there mother, bla bla bla noble if one-dimensional boyfriend. Evan's character is pretty original, and that almost made me cave in and give this book an extra star. But the whole gratuitous storyline-repeating was too much to overcome. I can't believe they thought nobody would notice. People these days...(PS- Much is made of Rose's beauty. I wish, just once, they'd have an ugly heroine. Mumble mumble.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosacea","review":"This book is a tease. It promised shocking secrets, incest, ruination, and then it never delivered.

I wonder why? Could it be that less people are buying her books now that they are beginning to suck? That has to be it. This book did stink. I didn't like it at all. Too boring and bland. In grocery stores, you know that you have Charmin toilet paper and then there's generic toilet paper (which is cheaper). You have the big, wonderful brand names (FITA and Heaven) and then there's this cheaper, not so great generic stuff (The Hudson series and the Shooting Stars). That's what I think. Not as good. These are cheap carbon copies of the better books. Kind of like K-mart clothes compared to Kohl's. K-mart is the cheaper stuff, while Kohl's is better quality. Catch my meaning? I didn't like this book at all, though. The Runaways and the books prior to that were by far better. Ever since the Wildflowers, I was turned off.Did you know that Keebler soda crackers taste better than Saltines?"},{"rating":"1","title":"nuh uh, no beats, no melodies, no nothing","review":"This isn't a bad disc if you're a fan of beatless, melody-less ambient music. I am not which is why I gave this two stars (and returned it to the music store). Intriguing cover art and packaging but unfortunately that's the only interesting thing here. Pulseprogramming's tracks consists of slow waves of droning synth which lazily shifts tones and notes, kind of like listening to underwater recordings or white noise. Good for background music if you're meditating and occasionally an interesting bleep or blip will make an appearance. Overall, I found this to be a bit boring and not very meaty. It's missing substance, almost as if it's all surface with no depth. If you like beat oriented ambient this is not the disc for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart in less than a month","review":"This pouch looks nice, but I have only had it a month and it is falling apart where the belt clip attaches to the pouch itself.

Although this one was listed as being for a Motorola Razr, it worked very well for the Nokia N75 which is approx. the same dimensions, but 6mm thicker. This case works perfectly.I like the hole in the bottom, which makes the phone easy to push out of its case when you answer it. I also prefer the snap closure rather than a magnet... it's secure and it won't mess with electronics, watches or credit card magnetic strips.I also like that the case is actually solid black with white stitches - it didn't have the pattern on it that was in the original product listing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations","review":"The fur on these boots does not look or feel real.

The best songs on this release (\\"Here I Am to Worship\\", \\"Our Love Is Loud\\", and \\"God of Wonders\\") have been making the rounds for a little while, but the versions of these songs included here are even stronger than the original recordings. Other highlights include \\"Famous One\\" and an amped-up version of the old hymn \\"Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing\\" (although few people may know what it means to \\"raise my Ebenezer\\"). A couple of the newer songs seem overly repetitious, and the closer \\"Dance in the River\\" is one of those \\"you had to have been there\\" experiences, but the \\"wheat\\" is of high enough quality here to be able to overlook the \\"chaff.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than One Day","review":"I love all the Passion cds, however this is my favorite.

Several times I had to go back to previous pages to try to understand what was going on. The first few chapters were great, but the story got dull and repetitive after a while. Some characters did not make sense at all and were totally out of place in the story. Most of the women were too complicated and it was nearly impossible to figure out at times how they fitted into Johnny's life. It seemed that everyone was related and at the end the reader is left thinking that the whole story is one big messed-up incest drama. The characters jump back and forth in time and it's hard to keep up with them. Sometimes it's a good thing that every character gets to tell their side of the story because they are all a piece of a puzzle, but in Hot Johnny all the women were pieces of different puzzles and they never came together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters...","review":"This is one of the worst stories, I have tried to read this year.

Secondly you can only use muskets once, before you have to find a new one (the enemy uses it over and over again), or if you want to use the calvery sword you have to hit someone about 15 times by which time they have already killed you with there super fast reloading muskets. And lastly, the game is so short, in the 20 minutes I played it I beat the game. There are I think 5 easy levels.

Not having tried TOBS or Truefit and Hill yet, I am very pleased with this purchase and can recommend it without reservation.Get yourself a tube, match up with a nice double-edge safety razor (I got a Merkur adjustable a couple months back after being appalled by the prices of cartridge blades and would never go back) and find out what a pleasure a nice shave can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Product","review":"I am trying this product now. I can say it has a good amount of lather and the aroma is very pleasant. The lather is not as rich as either Taylor of Old Bond Street, Proraso, or Geo. Trumper.

I wonder. In any event, I cared little for this film because I cared little (or nothing at all) for anyone or anything in the film, except maybe the tree. As noted elsewhere, there were many starts that went nowhere as did the film itself. Perhaps this made it such a dysfunctional experience, portrayed at its best? It's a dysfunctional film about dysfunctional people living in dysfunctional situation in their own private dysfunctional world. I'm glad I rented it. I wouldn't buy it even though it's chock full of excellent actors.

Nicole Kidman's narcissistic (sic) character is like \\"Annie Hall\\" taken to poisonous extremes. There are a few humorous moments in the story, but overall it's like watching a human train wreck. If you're lucky enough not to deal with \\"successful\\" but neurotic, destructive people (lots of 'em in NYC for instance) and family pain in real-life, then this film may be of voyeuristic interest. But otherwise I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the movies that made me distrust all independent films","review":"Just pure torture to watch! I had to shut it off because I refused to waste any more time on it. The previews made this movie look so good, and I think that is what made actually watching it sting so bad. You expect something funny and poignant, deep but not heavy-handed and you end up with a bunch of mush that makes no sense and makes you feel terrible while watching.I don't mind movies that make me uncomfortable at times, but please have some sort of point for the discomfort!Total waste of actors' talents.I approach all \\"independent\\" movies with deep trepidation now because of duds like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"Do not spend your money on this trash. You find yourself watching just because you cannot believe that it's not really going ANYWHERE. You also tend to want it to be good because the cast has such promise.

I realize that movies don't always have true-to-life dialogue (\\"Juno,\\" anyone?), but this went way off the rails as far as the script. It felt very \\"stage-y\\" and overwritten.The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that although I didn't like the film, I DID watch all the way to the end, just to see what happened.

For me, it was like being locked in a small room with a group of people I either loathed, or merely disliked. There wasn't one person in the film I even wanted to know.

The film is already full of them.","review":"Pay no attention to the critics review on the DVD cover. This movie is not funny. The most depressed, dysfunctional, angst-filled family you'd ever have the displeasure of meeting. Plus, psychotic next door neighbors to boot. Jack Black gave about three minutes of comedy; the rest was a depressed, insecure, unemployed bozo with no redeeming qualities. Nicole Kidman was a paranoid, know-it-all, critic of everyone's life. This film just sucked. All tragedy - no comedy. Pathetic wriring and direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, well observed, but missing something","review":"While an intelligent portrait of a highly dysfunctional family that shares a lot intone and style with Baumbach's amazing \`Squid and the Whale', this is colder,more distant and less moving.That's OK, and it's still WAY above most of what's out there, but it's hard notto feel there's a great movie trapped in this good one.One thing that hurts is that (unlike \`Squid') the acting is uneven. I don't wantto cast stones at a cast this talented, but it didn't always feel to me like everyonewas in the same film.But this is one of those complex films I'll re-visit one day, and could imagineliking more on re-seeing, being better prepared for it's difficult tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...Very Terrible","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Nicole Kidman mumbled her lines throughout the entire movie like she was s bored or stoned! A terrible waste of talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations are in order.","review":"I gave this movie two stars instead of one for just one reason. It did deal with personality disorders which seems to be at epidemic proportions in our culture right now. However, the character of Margot has Narcissistic Personality Disorder not borderline as is discussed in the movie. I give it congratulations for unintentionally grossing me out more times than any other film I've seen recently.As far as the story of the movie, I would say that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The actors are very good, no question about it. Each one gives very fine performances. The problem lies in the script itself. It should have never went into production.This movie is definitely a rental if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Power is about all that's going for \\"Margot at the Wedding\\"","review":"When I found out about Margot at the wedding, I was a little hesitant, but thought that Nicole Kidman and Jack Black might be able to pull it off. Well, I was wrong! Sneaking to DVD past theatres Margot at the Wedding is a negative on Nicole's and Jack's resume with this poor scripted movie. The mood is very dreary, deppresing, and...Bad. You're introduced with Nicole Kidman and her son on a boat to visit her sister, who she can't get along with, to someone's wedding. Her son is chubby, long haired, and ghastly, yet we are supposed to believe it's Nicole's son. Everybody is very disturbed with an obviously messed up family. Anyhow, I am deeply dissapoited, and saw no point to continue watching with Jack Black cursing here and there and throwing things, to Nicole climbing trees, and... climbing trees. So if you haven't yet been plagued by this film, then stay far away from Margot at the wedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish the movie","review":"I tried - I really did - the house and Southampton setting lured me in.

Mrs. Davis presents a mix of recipes of (what she refers to as) 1.old world, 2. new world adaptations, and 3.American recipes. At best there are maybe 4 or 5 recipes in the entire book that prompted any interest. It is not clear why she would even include American recipes (they're out of place in this book). There are some truly weird recipes, such as Sangria made with Fresca, and orange soda? Just because they may be serving this in some tapa bar in Bilbao or San Sebastian does not make it Basque nor does it make it good! It is very sweet that Mrs. Davis has all these wonderful memories of her childhood in Nevada but her recounting of them is rather boring and uninspired.

When I listen to this with my kids I have to be near a volume control for constant adjusting. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better for older children(5+)","review":"Bought this for our daughter who just turned 4 and who loves classical music. We thought she would enjoy this. I have to say that the only positive was the pictures in the book where we can show her the various orchestra instruments. The audio is really targeted to older children yet still has good pieces. The text in the book is also geared towards older children(not even appropriate for us to read it word for word to her). It will be great for our daughter when she's a little bit older. So if you're hoping that this will work out for your pre 5-6-7 year old child, keep these elements in mind since we clearly were hoping for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction to instruments!","review":"I am a teacher assistant who introduced this book to children in an afterschool (daycare) program.

Also informative about how ballet shoes are constructed, and a behind the scenes look at the costume department, and general production concerns. A definite must for any dance or ballet aficionados, and for anyone considering it as a career, but also a joy for anyone who loves the performing arts.

I love watching good dancing on stage, but what this film reveals is the endless amount of work it takes to get there... the rehersals, the constant feedback from the trained eyes of teachers, the impossible stretches, and even the making and fitting of the pointe shoes.

This is, of course, the part that broke and the switch was rendered useless.I will admit that the grinder did a very good job with spices. However, 60 uses does not qualify as a well made product.For all the other reviewers who primarily use blade grinders for coffee beans and complain about dust and timing issues, I would highly recommend a burr-type coffee mill.

The coffee is somewhat chunky and very unevenly ground and the quality of it is very poor. I like Braun products generally, but this is a dud. The only reason I give it more than one stars is the fact that at least this one didn't fall apart like the krups one I had owned previously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is one of the best coffee grinders I have ever owned.

Having used a Braun coffee grinder for about 25 years with no problems, we anticipated a good, reliable device. However, the thing was a piece of junk. It was underpowered, didn't mix batters particularly well and, after the second use, it broke completely. It will simply not even turn on. I made several attempts to get help replacing it and was sent to a service center 70 miles away; they told me it wasn't worth gettung the thing repaired. Trying to navigate the Braun/Procter and Gamble website to register my disatisfaction was an additional nightmare. The Braun Multimix 880 is not worth the money being charged. There must be better products out there than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!","review":"This is a wondertool. I am an university student, who cooks, and this Braun machine is astounding.

Have used it at least 12 times. All the attachments are a plus!! The chopper works great and it is so nice to have a multi appliance vs. just a mixer. I purchased a plastic container with a lid and put everything in it to keep everything together. This way, when you grab the container you have everything you will need. I agree with some other reviews about the angle of the handle while in use. It is a bit awkward, but not enough to downgrade from a 5 star!! I would highly recommend this product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Multi-Mix 4-in-1 hand mixer","review":"When my 10-year-old Braun Multi-Mix began to sound \\"ill\\" I searched for a new one right away. I had to order it over the internet because no stores carried it here. It's the best small mixer/food processor I've ever used. It sits on my counter right next to the coffee maker. It will even mince a clove of garlic! This new machine even came with dough hooks. I made tortilla soup the other day and used the immersion blender attachment to blend in the salsa. You cannot go wrong with this mixer/food processor. It's got a powerful motor and so far there's nothing it won't mix or process."},{"rating":"2","title":"great kitchen appliance","review":"Love this product. I have an earlier version without the dough hooks. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she used it Christmas day. The one word that I can attribute to this product is Quality.

And the price I paid through Amazon was the best I could find by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for everyday use","review":"We'd been searching for a multi purpose mixer for a long time so when we came across this in our local store we were delighted.

I did my homework and decided to purchase the Braun MultiMix. I love the concept of the all in one. I was, however, sorely disappointed when I plugged it in and discovered that the mixer didn't have nearly the power or rpm's that my old mixer had. Needless to say, this mixer went right back into the box and back to the store. This is not the mixer for you if you do alot of baking. I ended up testing the power of various mixers in the store before I bought and chose a Cuisinart 5 speed that I'm tickled with:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I liked the way this mixer performed, however after less than 2 years the switcvh for the speed control malfunctioned and it would only work on high speed. Consequently I am unable to use it because some foods when whipped at high speed spatter all over the kitchen. Braun needs to review their quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Braun Standards IMO","review":"I ordered the Braun MultiMixer on the strength of reviews and based on my experience with their mini-chopper/stick blender which I have had for years.What a disappointment! The first one we brought home from the store did not work at all. The replacement was less than wonderfull:- the beaters wobble- the power is not impressive- it is awkward to hold- and there is no way to balance the unit on the edge of your bowl while you mix.Finally after less the 3 months of use, the unit cuts off in use due to a problem with the cord. A call to Braun reveals that I have to ship it to a Braun Service Center in a another city at my expense to have it fixed.Am I happy with this $40 purchase? NOT!Woulod I buy another one? NO WAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops for convenience but didn't hold up as well as it should have...","review":"This was a gift and turned out to be one of my all-time favorite kitchen items. I adore the chopper and use it all the time - so convenient and easy to clean. After about 2 years, the motor would only run at one speed - I think medium speed - but I still use it. Recently one of the skinny little beaters broke but still I am using it. I will be getting a new one just like it DESPITE lack of durability because I love its power and the chopper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor fails","review":"The concept behind this mixer is superb - the attachments make this mixer a very versatile appliance in the kitchen.

You will be too :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Multi Mixer - good choice","review":"Delivery was prompt. The number of accessories was surprising, considering the reasonable cost. Have not yet tried the dough hooks but the clever cutting blade feature, in its own container, does a great job choppping onions with just a few \\"pulses\\". Great addition to the modern kitchen.Downside is the many-sided chopping container rather than a smooth, round one for quick cleaning, but immediate rinsing after use ameliorates this design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I didn't want a standing mixer, so I ordered this.

Its nice to have one tool that is a mixer, can make healthy fruit smoothies, AND can make small batches of homemade baby food. I used this small chopper to make baby food for all 4 of my kids, the mixer to make cakes and other things, and the blender for smoothies for the kids. If you have babies, or plan on having them, this is great to have. The bad thing, is that the motor burns out. I don't feel I abuse it, or overuse it, but my first mixer burned out in about 5 years, my second in another 5 years. This is not a long term appliance. My current multimix is a 280 watt, but my first one was smaller wattage I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"Really like this multimix, lots of power.

I make these fabulous cookies twice a year that have destroyed my stand mixer and yet this little braun multimix has done the job for the last 5 years. Finally the motor gave out, but after what I put it through for the last 8 years, it deserves retirement and I'm buying another one just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multiple Attachments Make This A Winner","review":"I've used this little mixer more in the past couple of weeks than I ever used my stand mixer in ten years. It is so convenient to use, and it's small enough for easy storage.The chopper attachment is powerful and the cleanup is easy. I've used it for all sorts of veggies, and even minced fresh ginger in it. Fresh salsa was a breeze and SO much better than store bought.The stick blender works great. The motor is so powerful that you actually get a suction effect on the bottom of the bowl. The mixer is also powerful--it handled a cake mix with ease.I would have given it five stars, but I thought (from reading another review) that it came with a wall mount to hang it. This does not come with a wall mount, so storage isn't quite as convenient as I had hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great value","review":"The motor on this product really packs a punch. I've used it for mixing, chopping, and blending with great success (with one minor exception). Don't worry that it has only three speeds. That's all you really need.Although the instructions say otherwise, I wouldn't depend on this product for much more that a half pound of bread dough (single pizza size). When I tried to mix a pound of dough, the dough ran all the way up the beaters. The motor seemed up to the task though. Still I think I'll stick with my stand mixer since I typically make 2 pounds of bread or more to a batch anyway.For soups, (non-frozen) blender drinks, small chopping, cookies, egg whites, and host of other tasks, you can't go wrong with this product though."},{"rating":"2","title":"More useful than I expected","review":"First of all, I have had this for over a year now and never used the bread hooks so this isn't a review of that aspect.I mainly got this b/c I needed a new hand mixer and since it had good reviews figured might as well get some other features that I may use from time to time. To my surprise, I find myself using the hand blender and mini food processor as much, if not more than the hand mixer. Obviously the processor is no substitute if you have a larger \\"real\\" appliance but I don't and I have no desire or need to get a bigger one. It may take a little longer for certain recipes but it's still way faster than hand chopping. The blender feature is really nice for soups and sauces.My husband informed me that typically Braun's have really good motors and I feel that for the quality the price is good even for a hand mixer alone. With the added (actually useful) extras it is a very good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful multi-function mixer","review":"This mixer definitely performs as described. It is great at mixing coarse cookie dough, which is mostly what I use it for. My sister uses it as a blender and chopper and is very happy with it. This is a great product at a very reasonable price.

After choosing this model solely based on the reviews of the mixer, my wife had sarcastically commented that only I could have found a hand mixer with so many attachments (based on my love of gadgets). Since then she has raved about the food processor attachment and what a great job it does. We have used both the mixers as well as the bread hooks. We haven't used the hand blender attachment as of yet, although it seems as solid as any stand alone hand mixer on the market.The only feature that is missing is an all inclusive stand that would hold the mixer and each of the attachements.

Since I've purchased the camera, I have taken a number of photographs upon each of three special events, and each time, after taking many photographs, and wanting to take more, I would turn on the camera only to find a message of disc failure, and all of my photographs were gone, with only a memory of what I had tried to photograph remaining. My purpose in purchasing this camera was to have a means of taking and preserving photographic memories. This camera is not providing me with the advertised or desired results, and as such, in my opinion is defective. I would strongly urge anyone to reconsider their thoughts prior to purchasing this particular digital camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth $100 !","review":"Purchased this camera at Safeway for a hundred-bucks.

Works well in my car, however for some odd reason i plugged this into my Phone one day and i one of teh channels go out. Turns out its damaged right at the connector piece where it looks extra protected. I'm buying another one in case this was a fluke that happened but over all, its a good product. Just remember,Keep your mp3 player, phone or ipod on Medium volume when using this and turn up the music from your car. Then put up the volume on the device as another way to adjust the bass but never have it all the way up or more than 3/4 way maximum on the device otherwise bass lines distort. I've been using these things for years in general. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product","review":"It is what it is. I hate that phrase but it really does define this product.

It's either melted in there or hooked up in some mechanics. The radio doesn't function. The stereo makes annoying clicking noises. I would probably have to replace the whole stereo because of this $4 adapter. Having a tape stereo is pretty cool and I definitely didn't anticipate having to change the stereo so soon!I am going to give it a 2nd star for the benefit of the doubt, that it might had to do with my car model.

It can broadcast the music from my iphone 5 to the my car very well. For this price, I cannot think of a better product!There are a few issues.1. When I turn the volume down, I can clearly hear the sound of the rolling tape. It can be very distracting if you are trying to hear some tender music.2. When I use my iphone 5 with this adapter, I won't increase my volume on iphone to the highest. That would make the high notes sound raspy. Instead, I use about 70% of the volume in iphone, and increase the volume from my car if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!!!","review":"I purchased this item because I have a factory installed cassette deck in my Toyota Tacoma truck. I wanted to play my MP3 music through the cassette deck however there is no input for the MP3. This adapter slides right in the tape deck and connects to the MP3 with a 3.5mm plug, (standard plug connection). The playback is really amazing for an inexpensive adapter. I certainly can recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.","review":"There were a couple things wrong with this product. First, the 3.5 mm jack didn't fit into my device. It constantly popped out and wouldn't stay in. Also the sound quality wasn't quite as good as another cassette that I had. However the sound quality wasn't terrible. These issues could be specific to me and you can't expect much more from such a cheap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative","review":"This product if for sure not original, using the XM trademark, I'm super discouraged. Well, what goes around comes around"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Is Great, Cassette Has Minor Flaw","review":"Like many other reviewers, I found the sound on the Belkin XM adapter to be very good, border line excellent. The one odd thing about the whole cassette model is that these adapters have internal circular plastic spinners that actually move when the cassette player is on. And in the case of the Belkin, this movement results in a cheap plastic noise that can be heard during quiet moments or between songs. I unscrewed the cassette and removed the entire system of plastic gears inside, put the adapter back in my car stereo and ta-da, no more cheap plastic noise. Why would anyone design and manufacture these moving plastic parts when they have nothing to do with the transference of the audio and just make noise?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I thought I was receiving a belkin cassette adapter but I didn't. I got panasonic or something. The sound quality was HORRIBLE!! It was like super fuzzy and muffled and sounded nasty. I hated using it.

I got a better one from walgreens for $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"The device works but, the sound quality is very poor. There was significant distortion and static when music is played at any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassette is very noisy.","review":"I was excited to receive this item, and I received it very quickly from the seller. I tried it out today and was so disappointed because the cassette makes so much noise (clicking as others described) that I had to turn my music up very loud to try and drown it out. The sound of the music was awesome but I can't get past the clicking noise. Not worth returning. Maybe a more expensive model would be better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays no bass.","review":"I purchased this to replace my Monster brand cassete converter. I used it on my iPhone 4 on a 2004 Inifiniti G35x and decided to get a new one because the Monster one produced an irritating screaching/interference type noise which was difficult to get rid of. However, when I put in the Belkin Cassette Adapter, it didn't play any bass. Not that the bass was bad or not enough of it...it completely left it out. I swapped b/w the Monster and the Belkin to check a few songs and played with the settings on my car, but the Belkin just didn't produce any bass. The sound quality was horrible.Returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a loud HISSING sound","review":"Not a good adapter - you can clearly hear a static hissing sound in the background...even if it's not turned up high. Yes, it mostly gets drown out when the music plays - but it still feels like listening to an old record. So unless you're nostalgic for the good ol' times - I would NOT recommend getting this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracks + pops =useless","review":"I was afraid that I was purchasing a poor product simply because it was so cheap. Indeed, I purchased a poor product! When using the tape, the rear speakers pop & crack continuously making the listening of music miserable.Also, the tape does not appear how it is listed. There is no text inscribed on the tape as seen in the picture. The XM logo is fake, lacking the TM, or R symbol in the bottom right corner of the logo. This product is clearly a counterfeit.I would definitely recommend not purchasing this product. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best adapter I've tried so far.","review":"After having a horrible experience with the Monster-branded cassette adapter, I decided to give this much less expensive option a try. Honestly, it's much better than I could have hoped for for $6. The cassette is silent while in my cassette player, and the sound through the speakers is probably 85% as good as the same tunes played on the original CD. I've found that the sound is best with the Zune cranked up to about 27, using the car stereo volume to control the listening volume. If I reduce the volume on the Zune and turn up the car radio, there seems to be much more distortion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked poorly for a few months then stopped working altogether","review":"I bought this adapter around 6 months ago. I used it maybe once a week for a couple hours at most. A few weeks ago, it stopped working altogether and my car's cassette player refuses to play the tape.Quality-wise, even when this adapter WAS working, it was lower quality sound than the other cassette adapters I'd used in the past. My previous adapter worked for over 4 years with daily use... this one had pretty awful sound quality (I used it with an iPod and it was very touchy when it came to the \\"correct\\" volume... the sound would be sort of \\"blown out\\" if the volume wasn't exactly right). On top of that, it breaks after very light use for only a few months. Avoid this product! Wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely works","review":"Maybe I got a defective unit, but mine does not work right at all.

(I use IPod Classic 160GB)I recommend you buy it for this price.

Even my EQ on my mp3 goes to the tape too. Pretty good for the price. Can't compare quality to another but its cheap and does its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Not the ABSOLUTE best audio quality, but it works decently. I haven't had any problems with it ejecting or failing to work. It also seems pretty sturdy, unlike some other tape adapters I've had that you can instantly tell are flimsy and poorly made. So, all around good buy, especially for the price. Just keep in mind that when using this, or any similar product, you usually have to find the right balance of volume. Adjust the volume of your MP3 player first, until the audio quality sounds good, usually this is at a somewhat low volume. Then you can play with the volume as much as you want through your car stereo. Otherwise, the audio might come out sounding too faint or too crackly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"this item was a great price & it worked perfectly.note: it's pretty noisy when you don't have any music playing - other than that I highly suggest this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product doesn't work as advertised","review":"One star simply because the adapter doesn't work as the description says. From the decription: 'Works with iPod, MP3, CD, or any other portable player through the headphone jack'. Not compatible with iPod Touch or any other device with a headphone jack that I've tried. After I purchased the item, I received an e-mail that said the product that was being shipped was not the same as the one that was listed on the product's respective Amazon page. If you are looking for a cassette adapter, this is not the one for you unless you're planning on using it with XM radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This item didn't work!

Dont fall for the bait and switch like I did"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but...","review":"I ordered this to replace an older Phillips adapter that started to go bad. While this does work, it works poorly. The audio quality just isn't there. I have to turn up the volume on my car stereo almost all the way just to get it to a reasonable level. Even then the audio is distorted because the car stereo can only amplify so much before it starts to sound like garbage. The cable on the adapter is very thin so I think that's probably what's causing the problem. The cable on my older adapter was much thicker. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this if you want any sort of audio quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost of money","review":"Please be aware that this is not a genuine XM cassette adapter. The item came in the envelope in just a small plastic bag with no indication of brand/company address or whatsoever. The adapter is 100% not-working. I plugged it into the car cassette player.

As their are no jobs in the family living on week to week. So this was a surpise for her new car and it broke within 2 and 1/2 weeks of purchasing it. I thought Belkin was alot better than that.

Spent half an hour trying to get it to play my car. Finally gave up and considered the fact that it might have been my cars cassette player that was to blame. However I tried it in my mates car and it dint work either. Like the other reviews on this page say, customer care is very nice.

Don't spend your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"adaptability","review":"I have a Mercedes and fortunately, Mercedes continued to put cassette players in their cars while the American car companies left a gap by only supplying cd players as Ipod owners and roady satellite owners were forced to have adapters installed voiding thier car's audio warranty. There are other cassette adapters on the market, but none sound this good. The adapters at Best Buy, WalMart, and other places, just don't sound as clear and are not always adaptable. The XM gives good sound and adapts to all players, not just the Ipod or other players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent quality","review":"This product definitely give a great bang for what it cost me. The sound quality is clear when playing at medium volumes, and begin to distort if you raise the volume from the audio source. If you max out the volume from your car, the sound will be crisp, but you'll have a loud background spinning noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Works great! We use it in the truck all the time, the sound quality is great considering the speakers aren't all that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Its nothing fancy but it gets the job done. It is not the most solid construction, and it skips occasionally but overall a good product. worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy I've made in years","review":"This words Great in my 97 Cadillac. I didn't really want to replace my head unit because the computer feeds through it. So I tried this.. Couldn't ask for anything more. I was worried at first because there was a lot of static. Then I turned down the volume on my iPod, adjusted the EQ and BAM! Perfect sound... I will definitely buy another one if this ever fails but doubt that will happen. Get one you can't go wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"I usually pay 30$ for the same product at radio shack so I'm really pleased with the price difference it also came extremely fast!!I'm very happy with this product, these things seem to break easily if&when this one does ill definetally go through this consumer again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Shouldn't have gone cheap with this...I have a Hyundai Sonata 2002 and it does NOT work AT ALL...thanks for nothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it is supposed to.","review":"Sound quality is not as good as CDs but great for older cars to be able to listen to your iPhone thru the car speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I bought this to replace a similar model I had that had gotten old and was wearing out, but this one has terrible sound.

I had to go back to the old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin XM Auto Cassette Adapter","review":"I love this adapter!!

Popping, crackling, static. It sounds terrible. My wife has one for the iPod that works beautifully in my car, so obviously not the car tape player causing this. It was cheap, so I assume you get what you pay for. I'm going to contact seller today to see if we can work something out. If not, waste of $3.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE","review":"Got the item on time. Plugged it in, worked fine until I stopped the car. Started the car again, and then I was getting a very loud screeching noise. Tried it in another car with a different media (IPHONE instead of Blackberry), same problem. Now, no more noise, but it does'nt work anymore. To much of a hassle to send it back, since I'm across the border in Canada.My loss I guess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great with i-Pod","review":"A tip for those who mentioned the hissing they heard when using the adapter. Turn the volume down on the radio and use the MP3 player volume control. Solved the problem for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I ordered this it, but unfortunately the first one did not work- from the get-go, it had so much static and one could not hear the music. I called the CS, and I got a free replacement (customer service is excellent; however, sad to say, the second one only worked for fifteen minutes then it became \\"staticky\\". During the time it worked, the sound output was great; nonetheless, it still had static. I thought that my system may have had a problem, but after testing two others from two different people, I realized that something is definitely wrong with this product. I would definitely not recommend it, but I would recommend the store/merchant-very good customer service!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Works as advertised! No complaints. I had another one similar to this model until the cord that connects to the 3mm jack became frayed. This one has a right-angle jack and should hopefully last just as long (or longer) than my previous one."},{"rating":"1","title":"good fidelity, but rattling noises from cassette","review":"I decided to purchase this cassette-to-mp3 adapter after having tried an FM transmitter and getting too much interference/noise. The audio fidelity of this adapter is good, but its cassette mechanism makes a lot of rattling and clicking noises. I ended up buying a cassette-to-mp3 adapter made by Phillips (SAA2051H/17). The mechanical noise from the Phillips adapter is noticably lower, while it too has good fidelity, and the cost was also low (I paid $9 for a new one).By the way, the Belkin XM adapter did not come in manufacturer's packaging (not a good sign), and there is no Belkin or other labeling on it other than the XM logo. The Phillips adapter I bought from another vendor came in the manufacturer's high quality, unopened packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item are different from picture","review":"The cassette adapter I received is not in the box, it's in a plastic bag . No instruction or anything, I compare the adapter with the picture the seller povided and notice on the picture it have the NOTE: instruction on how to use the adapter print on it. The adapter I received don't have the NOTE: print on it. Sound quality is ok, same quality as a cassette itseft. So I suspect this adapter may not be a real one, could be FAKE,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like a good deal.","review":"Product works so-so....does not deliver a balanced signal...all one channel.

Nice product, skip the FM transmitters they are inconsistent and ultimately more difficult to maintain a solid signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I've had one of these before, and in addition to having low sound quality it made a scratchy noise at regular intervals just from being in the player. I was beginning to consider buying a new car stereo with an aux-in jack, but tried this first because, hey, if it didn't work, I was only out ten bucks. It works beautifully. It makes no more noise than an ordinary cassette in the player and has, as far as I can tell, CD-quality sound. If you want an MP3-to-cassette adapter, this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"For the inexpensive price, I wasn't sure how well this was going to work. I was using a tape adapter that had reached the end of its life and wasn't producing good sound. Upon switching it out for the Belkin Xm I was blown away. The sound is crisp and clear--way better than I expected. It sounds like it's coming from a built-in CD player, but it's coming from my phone streaming music from Google Music service. So pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud Clicking Noise","review":"Makes a loud clicking noise in my car cassette player. The clicking is easily audible through my music, even when playing the music at the loudest level I can tolerate. I am someone who can usually tune out extraneous noise easily. However, the clicking gets quite annoying very quickly. On the positive side, the product arrived quickly and the sound quality is otherwise good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I bought this because the original XM adapter cassette I received with my radio about 7 years finally wore out. This adapter seemed a lot cheaper. The quality was poor, and the sound quality was pretty bad. It works without problem, it just doesn't sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"Given the price, I am pretty happy with the quality of the sound. It might not be at CD level, but good enough for my 192kbs mp3 from my andorid cellphone. The only imperfection is that you could hear a tiny bit of click in the cassette chamber, when it is working, although I could not rule out whether it is the cassette mechanics to blame, since I have no speared one to rule out that possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total Fail!","review":"I ordered the Belkin XM Auto Cassette adaptor for my 2001 Audi which predated the era of in-dash CD players or Aux inputs. What I received instead was a Philips Cassette Adapter, a product listed elsewhere on Amazon. I figured they're probably all made by the same manufacturer with different brand labels, so I went ahead and tried it out. Unfortunately, all I get is badly distorted noise. I tried reversing the cord and flipping the adaptor to no avail. Bottom line - it just doesn't work with my in-dask cassette deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"The sound quality on this is terrible. I have an old Sony cassette adapter that is almost 20 years old and it sounds great. I got this for my wife's car and it's terrible. I ordered the Phillips one instead and it sounds fine. I would return it, but it's probably not worth the postage. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It worked great the first few times. I was surprised how well it worked until it started making a clicking sound and it would not play anything. It was only $4, so what can you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, cheap price, not so great for iPad","review":"Could just be the music device, but the tape doesn't work to well with the iPad at loud volumes. However, it works excellently at all volumes with all my other devices. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewinds every 2 minutes. Worthless product","review":"The tape stops and rewinds before an entire song can even play. Complete waste of money. Poor quality, bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Within a few weeks it stopped working. I would plug it in and the music would play and my the mode would go from TAPE to FM radio. It was getting jammed in my tape player, therefore I had to fiddle around with ALL the buttons instead of just the eject button.I don't recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I've used this adapter in both a home stereo and in my truck--works great in both. More importantly, it SOUNDS great in both. The cord doesn't get in the way at all.Hard to believe something that looks like a relic from the 80s can add so much enjoyment to a modern device! Music I used to listen to through earbuds or computer speakers can now thump through actual woofers. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"as described","review":"I works perfect, and amazing sound quality. far better than my previuos Universal Cassette Adapter. So, I would prefer my friends this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, solid adapter - buy with confidence!","review":"Take it from an audiophile, this is the one you want to buy.When it comes to any product that works with your music, it's usually best to not just go with the absolute cheapest component. Nevertheless, I'm more than satisfied with this cassette adapter- it's solid, the cord length is just right, and the audio quality stays clear all the way up until you blast the volume; to compensate, just pull down the 16K slider.Note: Other than the logo that's applied to the case, this adapter is otherwise completely unrelated to the XM satellite radio service.Enjoy your purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work as expected","review":"Use it for two weeks, it works as expected. The only con is the slight mechanical noise when stereo is not loud enough. It does look a little flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about 5 days","review":"Worked pretty good for five days. Cheaply made plastic pieces inside broke and it would no longer play music. Not even worth returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE worked well","review":"I ordered two of these just in case...It was a good thing I did as well, as one of them was broken. When I put it in my player, it made the player cycle back and forth from forward and backward play. It was incredibly annoying, as I could hear audio of 5 seconds, then nothing, then audio for 5 more seconds. At first I thought it was a function of my tape player, but then I decided to give the second one a shot, and it works like a charm. Not sure what is wrong with the first one, but at that price, I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative to expensive brands.","review":"This works just as well as any $50 casette adapters they sell at Best Buy for only a fraction of the cost. I have noticed that the more rigid adaptor cords break faster than the smooth, flexible cords, so I am glad that I purchased this one for my car. Sound quality is on par with any other brand, but not as good as a straight AUX plug, so no complaints here. The minimalistic design is also a nice touch as there are no ugly logos. Price is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of MONEY","review":"Cassette did not work in my truck. No matter which way I turned it. But what do you expect for $4. No even worth paying to ship the product back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Bought this as a gift for a friend who has an older built-in-the-wall cassette stereo system in her home.

As soon as I put the cassette in the deck it starts clicking (loudly) and won't stop until I eject the cassette. It's incredibly annoying because unless you turn the music up really loud you can still hear it.That brings me to the second issue: the volume is so low that I have to turn my stereo almost all the way up to drown out the clicking!But the seller is fast and it was well packed.. This is the second on I have tried. not worth sending back so I may try another one"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have splurged.","review":"I bought this because it was the cheapest tape deck adapter on Amazon.

The cheap Phillips one at Wal-Mart is what I ended up getting again,(same as the old one)The sound quality was far more superior.There's possibly one out there with better sound quality.

After about five uses, the sound deteriorated rapidly, and now, only a month after I started using it, listening to music is mostly listening to scratchiness. There is very poor sound quality across a range of music and podcasts. I do not drive my car every day, so in total, I've probably only used the adapter 10 times.

It might just be my car I'm not sure but when I just listen to CD's my car always plays them fine with or without bass being boosted. I'd recommend this HIGHLY though because you aren't going to have to surf radio waves to listen to your music and won't have to worry about any potential static or loss of station...which can be a problem when doing this long driving adventures across the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not disappointed...","review":"I WAS disappointed at first.

The only problem I had was the build quality, as soon as I took it out of it's packaging a piece of plastic chipped off on it's own.

But I do feel like the seller should have noted why this switched occurred. Communication is key to any business and this being a prime example.If they had included a note with my order saying something like \\"We apologize blah blah blah but we had to give you this instead because we ran out blah blah blah\\" then it would of left me in less of a conundrum where I had to double check online and in my invoice if I had in fact, ordered the right product.On the positive side of things, the order did come fast and the product itself is in new condition, clean, and no evidence (yet) of defect.To sum it up: Ordered Belkin.

Yes, the sound quality is good and you'll love it at first, but trust me, I've had two of these and they're just poorly made. Why not just make one with a thicker, more durable cord?!

But if you open and close (doing this would also be annoying, since you have to pump the air in and out every time) the container frequently, the freshness only lasts a little longer than normal rubber seal.

Its capacity is most useful for 1-2 people (maybe 3, frugally). At 50% off the storage containers are a huge bargain. I already had one set which I paid full price for a couple of years ago, and intended to buy another set as add on to another item purchase (to take advantage of free shipping).

I didn't get a rash so I thought everything was ok. Even put on my make up on top. My face looked flawless...the first day. By the third try I had given up on the product. Not only did the tingly feeling turn to my face feeling on fire, but I developed rash patches on both sides of my face. When I tried to apply my makeup after applying the lotion, it wouldn't smooth on like the first time. It kept crumbling and flaking off in some parts of my face. I guess I will continue my search for my dream face lotion.

I have her \\"Figaro\\" set, conducted by Ricardo Muti, which is marred by ridiculous tempi, but even that can't hide the perfect appropriateness of her voice for Mozart's music. Sweet, warm, not too big or \\"operatic\\"... she's just perfect for his music.We were coming home late one Saturday, me dozing as my husband drove, when I was awakened by one of the most beautiful arias I've ever heard. It enthralled us both, and we sat in the car in the garage until it was over and the announcer announced it: \\"Ruhe sanft,\\" from \\"Zaide,\\" one of Mozart's lesser-known operas. I bought the recording the next day, and have just about worn it out. It goes in my car with me every day and accompanies me as I roar down the freeway, trying to match her exquisite tone. Fat chance! But I believe that this recording will bring the same joy to you that it has to me, and I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange","review":"Ms Battle has a wondeful voice and a exquesite tecnique, but when she opens her mouth it sounds like she is losing somehitng: the feeling of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not leak proof and dust proof!","review":"I have had this for 6 months now and tried everything to make it quit leaking to no avail.

Real disappointing...this thing leaks at the front and all along the sides.Good luck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can Tell You Why I didn't like this book","review":"This book is a major disappointment for several reasons. First of all, the author spends an inordinate amount of time discussing the Eagles' managers and record company executives. He spends more time with Irving Azoff and David Geffen than with Don Felder or Tim Schmidt! Secondly, nearly one-third of this book is given over to a too-extensive discography of the credits of every single recording every Eagle ever played on - maybe this deserves to be written up somewhere, but not here. Lastly, he fails to give the reader a sense of the Eagles' place in music history and of their contributions to the music scenes of the '70s and '80s. Why did the Eagles move away from country-rock? Why did Henley's solo career thrive while Frey's failed? Why do so many of today's young country artists cite the Eagles as a major influence? What exactly goes on in Joe Walsh's head? NONE of these issues are explored. \\"Take it easy\\" on your wallet and don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To The Limit : The Don Henley Selective Memory Memoirs","review":"As an Eagles fan, I began reading this book with high hopes. But then reality set in. \\"To The Limit\\" centers around Don Henley, and must have been written with his cooperation because stunningly, no mention is made of Henley's scandal with the two girls in a hot tub, which made headlines and inspired his songs \\"Nobody's Business\\" and \\"Dirty Laundry.\\" Joe Walsh is all but ignored, which is strange since he is the group's most popular member. All in all, it sounds like the book was dictated by Henley. The \\"Untold\\" stories of the Eagles in this book are the stories of any band member not named Frey or Henley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"I haven't seen this much mindless \\"filler\\" since I helped grade high-school term papers. One-third of this barely 300 page book is clotted with unnecessary (and incredibly boring) lists of Eagles albums, solo efforts, guest appearances on other albums, zzz zzz zzz. If Mr. Eliot did manage to interview the reclusive Mr. Henley, he didn't get any earth-shattering information out of him. It's all been said before (ad nauseum) in other interviews. In fact, I got a rather creepy feeling that, although unauthorized, this book was heavily censored by someone in Henley's camp. Perhaps that was the reason behind the year-long delay in releasing the book. If you're looking for salacious, behind-the-scenes dirt you won't find it here. If you want to read about clever, talented, annoyingly childish ego-maniacs, then you might like this book. But definitely wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was something in here untold?","review":"File this book under \\"heard it all before\\". This book is little more than a Don Henley puff piece with a picture or two thrown in. Approximately a third of the book concerns itself with blbliography, the index, and what has to be the most incredibly overstated discography ever to grace a book of this type. Not only do you get an Eagles discography, but also one on each band member, INCLUDING any and all side projects they ever appeared on. There's very little new in here, in fact, there's very little in here at all, which leads one to believe that the Eagles were one of the most boring bands ever to survive to tiresome middle age. The only book I've read of this ilk that I consider worse is the Zep book by their former road manager. Do yourself a favor and do like I did, check this out of the library when you're sick, it's nasty out, and you'll be in bed anyway, only don't block off a large amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"told me what i wanted to know","review":"I DID NOT DISCOVER THE EAGLES UNTIL THEIR REUNION.

IF YOU LOVE THE BOYS, BUY THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It - and buy Don Felder's book!","review":"I found this book rather cynical and a bit too Henley centric (maybe because Henley granted interviews and the others didn't) - but I got the feeling of biting the hand that feeds you was here.Writing style is average (being a published author of several rock n roll books I have a right to that judgement) and others have already pointed out obvious errors and ommissions, which I won't repeat here.I got rid of my copy.If you want a good read, to laugh and to cry - get Don Felder's book. The first day I was reading that on the train I was so absorbed (and that was the pre-Eagles section on the David Blue / CSN era) I missed my stop and was late for work ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know he did that.","review":"As someone who was a child in the 1970s, I really wasn't hip to all the news of the day concerning bands like the Eagles. This was all old news by the time I was seriously listening to The Eagles. I liked the way Eliot weaved his way through the L.A. music scene to bring together what was the original Eagle's line-up and how he progressed though all the ego trips which caused the band to change(for the better ). This could have been a five star book had Eliot researched (or written) more about the abundant talents of Joe Walsh, Don Felder, and Timothy B. Schmit. I love to find out who is, and was, connected to whom, and this book does that for the average music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Wasted Time","review":"While the Eagles are surely worth a comprehensive, accurate and historical review, To the Limit is not that book. Eliot's look at the LA music scene in the 70's and the music business are the book's only redeeming features. New fans to the band should be warned there are plenty of factual errors here -- the Superbowl has never been played in October, for instance -- and the text focuses heavily on Henley and Frey. Perhaps the publisher was so busy lawyering the book because of Henley's outcries, copy editing was ignored. In addition, while Eliot acknowledges assistance from Joe Walsh, who gets very little attention (as does Timothy B.), Walsh's management denies he ever spoke with Eliot or participated in the book in any way. Perhaps if fans really want to know the Eagles, they'd be better off listening to their music. Thankfully I borrowed my copy instead of paying for it. Hard to believe they killed trees for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I am filing this \\"review\\" in the hopes of bringing down the average number of stars for this truly awful book. I love juicy rock bios, so I thought this would be just the book for me. Look how wrong you can be! The two main problems with this book are as follows:1) It is unspeakably boring. I honestly couldn't even finish it; the grind just wore me down.2) Factual errors. Others have already pointed this out, but it is especially galling to see George Grantham (the superb musician and singer from Poco) referred to as George Lantham. And how 'bout that gig in Hawthorne Beach? Where the heck is that? Somewhere between the City of Hawthorne and Hermosa Beach, perhaps. You get the idea . . . . It would drive you out of your mind if you weren't already bored out of your mind.Perhaps the fact that Amazon has 62 used copies (\\"from $2.95\\") gives you the best indication of this book's overall merit. Proceed at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. What happened to the Eagles happens a lot in pop/rock music.The writing of the book is superb. The description of the LA music scene in the 60s and 70s is especially good. I also felt that the writer listened to everone, not just the people who screamed the loudest.Eliot makes a wonderful point when discussing the relationship between Henley and Frey. The things that made them so effective together are the same things that drove them apart.I did not particularly like the Eagles when I started reading this book but it has now piqued my interest to buy a couple of their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing really new","review":"if you're looking for the dirt on the sex and the drugs, its tamed down. if you're looking for the conflict between geffon, the band, the managers and irv azoff, its toned down. the book comes down to henley and frey became starts, didn't think they received the respect they thought they deserved and were angry about it. but it does have a complete discophraphy of all members of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henley's Limit!","review":"This book was very pro Henley. He won't have to write an autobiography, it's already written. I just got done reading Don Felder's book, Heaven and Hell. I would recommend Felder's book.

This book shows why. It was hard to read and will be easy to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niven on it's best","review":"If you like Niven, this is one of the books to go for. The way in this books other creatures are described is Niven at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and adventures in Time and Space with Hanville Svetz","review":"This book is a great deal. The first part of the book, Rainbow Mars, is a new Svetz novel (novella? novelette? Whatever). Svetz is sent back to Mars in a time machine to find out if there was ever life there, of course since the time machines in Larry Niven's world don't work in a nice, linear fashion he finds out that there was life on Mars, life that was described in the stories of C.S. Lewis, Robert Heinlein, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, H.G. Wells and Raymond Gallun, and that's where the fun begins. In addition to the new story this book also includes all of the Svetz stories that were originally printed in Flight of the Horse, all in all a good read and a lot better than the other books that Niven has written in the last few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has he lost his touch?","review":"I found this book incredibly boring and difficult to follow, and I'm a huge LN fan. I do not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the first seventy-five pages...","review":"...and had to put it down. As far as I'm concerned, Robert Heinlein proved in \\"Number of the Beast\\" that it is NOT possible to write a readable novel with nothing but fast-paced dialog. I'm awed by some of Niven's other stories, but I had to drop this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This is actually a fantasy book disguised as SF. That, of itself, isn't a bad thing. But Niven's writing style is very disjointed and erratic; it has none of the polish that his novels with Jerry Pournelle (and Steve Barnes) have. It's as if Niven is writing with a wink and a nod to his huge fan base--the wink being for \\"in\\" jokes and a nod given to the hard-core fan who understands what he's writing about. He writes in such a way as to leave things out, such as transitional phrases or descriptions, assuming (I think) that the reader will fill in the rest. This was an awful book in a great package. Tor seems to be doing this lately: great packages for lousy novels (Card is one, Williamson is another)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixture of Old (Wonderful) and New (Lackluster)","review":"Larry Niven has written some wonderful books featuring some of the best ideas in science fiction. This book is half-and-half. The wonderful part contains a handful of delightful short stories from his 1976 book \\"Flight of the Horse,\\" now sadly out of print. The not-so-wonderful is an almost unreadable new novella set in the same universe. Mars is popular these days, and Niven should have been able to do a smash-bang job of working it into the \\"Horse\\" universe. Instead, he wrote a lot of dismal dialog and murky exposition with none of the life of the older stories (which I eagerly reread, confirming that they've stood the test of time).I could give this a mixed review: a compromise between five stars for the old material, and one star for the new. But save your money and look for a used copy of \\"Flight of the Horse.\\" And shame on Niven's publisher for not just reissuing a great older book and leaving well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off","review":"I seldom buy hardbacks since very few are worth the price. The exception is anything from Larry Niven. I have always purchased his hardback first editions as soon as they are released. Especially when he makes the effort to write on his own and not with that idiot Pournelle. Rainbow Mars was a mistake. A marginal work at best and only half the book. He reprints some old ho hum work from his early days to fill space. If you have to read it, wait for a used paperback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never have been published","review":"I've enjoyed the time-travelling antics before, but I never realized how much of a god-send the short story format is until I bought and then tried to read this monumentally bad piece of writing. Niven fans will be VERY disappointed and this pedantic work was obviously done for cyncial commercial reasons. Even force of will will not carry you through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of Time Travel Tales","review":"Each of the stories in this book, some of which were previously published as shorts in magazines, centers on a xenophobic and somewhat reluctant time traveler being sent through time to find things to appease/entertain the ruler and/or encourage funding for the time travel agency he works for. But unbeknownst to him or his agency, he is being sent not just backwards and forwards in time but sideways to parallel universes populated with creatures from myth and fiction.The concept is interesting and it could have made for a very whimsical series of tales. Somehow it falls short. The potential isn't realized. Niven, a highly competent science fiction writer, was apparently trying to stretch himself to write fantasy after meeting with Terry Pratchett but Niven simply does not have Pratchett's skill with words and ideas necessary to pull this off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointing read.","review":"After reading Niven's \\"Destinys Road\\" I was looking forward to another great plot with developed characters, but found this collection of stories lacking completeness. I kept waiting for the story and characters to gain some depth but sadly I was disapointed. The twists and turns of the plot with no real direction was very frustrating. Not to mention the unfinished endings. I would only recommend this book for very light sci-fi readers who just want a quick story tease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Niven's disappointment.","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Niven for many years and have found his work both technically plausible and readable. Rainbow Mars is neither. The inclusion of unicorns, dragons, and the borrowing of old SF plots set on Mars turn this into a \\"sword and sorcery\\" novel. The use of time travel was unconvincing, effectively no more than a \\"magic-wand\\" to link the story elements. This book was a major disappointment from an author I (formerly) expected to turn out high-quality science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After 60 pages, I closed it and put it on the shelf.

The main novel ended abruptly after 224 pages. The story could have been finished with success at Mars, leaving room for future work. Instead the remaining ninety pages are filled with reprints of old short stories on Svetz's time travels. I was very disappointed, if I could of opened a window on the jet I would of thrown it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Mars","review":"Dissapointing. Unforgivable planetery mistake. My humble opinion is: in an attempt to be 'compelling fiction' the story tends to confuse the reader, not propell her along.

Thumbs down for Rainbow Mars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing and not a lot of fun.","review":"I picked up Rainbow Mars without having read the earlier stories and found this book confusing and worse, boring.

It reads a bit like a fever dream, and is never very coherent nor logical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"I have never written to pan a book or record before but this book was so dissappointing, and the synopsis on the back of the book was so misleading that I felt I had no choice. I have read many great books by Larry Niven, and when I read the back cover I felt that I was in for another. What I got instead was an almost incoherent jumbled chaotic mess that barely had enough to it to limp to a two star rating. I found the fantasy intrusions to be particularly annoying. I didn't buy this book to read about Unicorns, Midgard Serpents, Rocs, Dragons, etc... As a matter of fact, had I even seen the word Unicorn on the back cover I would have dropped the book like so much nuclear waste. Not to mention the absurdity of the ridiculous \\"allied races\\" living on the Beanstalk (hangtree) Believe everything you have read, do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The Ringworld series keeps you thinking: understanding landscapes, cultures, and individuals. This does not. Another reviewer mentions \\"homage to past Mars novels.\\" I got this impression too, and not in a good way. The characters are flat and they do a lot of shooting at several Martian species. Or something. I guess this is what a teenage Niven grew up with, but it's tiresome for an adult whose mind has been worked by the Ringworld series. I had to put it in the seat back pocket and read USA Today instead. Glad it's a library book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a Larry Niven fan and liked most of his books. (Integral Trees was mediocre, but I finished.) However, I gave up on this book pretty soon, and I almost never give up on a book before finishing. I returned it to the library after I started the very confusing time/space (?) travel to Mars (?) chapter. Maybe I should have followed some of the other reviewers advise and read the short stories first so I could understand what was going on. The dialoge was trite and unbelievable. Even for science fiction/fantasy, none of the concepts made any sense.I consider myself even dumber for having wasted 1/2 hour on starting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Mars","review":"I am a long time reader of Science Fiction who has enjoyed Larry Niven's works but Rainbow Mars was a severe disappointment. I found the book, particularly the dialog, confusing and rife with non sequiturs. It's almost as if Mr Niven had written a book twice as long and then went back and deleted every other line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard or Soft Science?","review":"I found myself having difficulty classifying this book. From its lingering descriptions of the bizarre things going on, I at first assumed that it was 'hard sci-fi' where the scientific speculation is more important than the plot. But the science is ludicrous! It's filled with the kind of hand-waving one sees in 'soft sci-fi' where the science is there only to further the plot, and need not be more than superficially plausible.So is the focus on the story? The story is passable but doesn't set your heart racing. The bottom line is that it doesn't take itself seriously either.What Niven seems to be going for is a conversion of fantasy and old science-fiction ideas to a modern science-fictional genre. It's an entertaining idea, but everything still ends up feeling like fantasy. He's made a few cosmetic changes, is all--what Orson Scott Card described as \\"science fiction has rivets, fantasy has trees.\\" Rainbow Mars can't seem to do away with the trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Niven missed....","review":"I'm a hardcore Niven fan and have been ever since I first read \\"A Gift From Earth\\", but with that said - this book is mediocre at best. I suppose it is just a matter of taste, but I found this book to be tedious and confusing. I usually appreciate his sense of humor, (anyone who hasn't read Man Of Steel/Woman of Kleenex is really missing out) but this time I have to say I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most disappointing book!","review":"I hadn't read a science fiction book in several years, but decided to buy one when browsing a bookstore. I had always greatly enjoyed Larry Niven's novels and (especially) short stories, so I picked up this book. What an unfortunate choice! This book has few creative ideas. Since Niven is usually weak on characterization, this leaves little reason to read it. The references to some of the standard works on Mars are mildly interesting, but all-in-all, the book is dull and tedious. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sad effort from Niven","review":"This is yet another in the increasingly long series of truly bad books from larry Niven. Why do I keep reading them? I'm a Niven fan from decades ago, and keep thinking that the next book will be a return to previous excellence, but this is another disappointment.The book has some typically fascinating ideas, and Niven is obviously having some fun interjecting raw fantasy and mythology into his science fiction. Unfortunately, it suffers terribly from very poor writing and development. Imagine my surprise also when I discovered the story ends at the books midpoint, and the rest is filled with short stories on the same subject.If there's one thing I've learned, it's that more people will give a good review to a bad book, than a bad review to a good book. Trust the reviews you read, you'll save money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Mr. Niven's NEXT book","review":"I was excited to see Larry Niven had put out a new book, since his name seems to be a guarantee of an engaging read. This, however is an exception. To begin with, it isn't at all clear from the blurbs that this is actually a novella and a bunch of short stories (I blame the publisher for that). And the short stories are all just more of the same. I mean, how many times do we have to sit through the timeline changing and people are suffocating because the air is now clean? The problem, of course, is they weren't meant to be read back-to-back, but rather over time in various publications. Forgetting that disappointment, the novella has some interesting premises and characters... BUT the writing style seems to be a concerted effort to appear to be a 40s or 50s potboiler SciFi. Mostly it was just annoying.My advice is to pass this one up and go directly to Mr. Niven's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style gets in the way of substance.","review":"An author is entitled to experiment. This is one a failure of style. Should the reader have to persist so far down a bad road of staccato prose that he risks ruining the suspension of disbelief, or of trust that the style will get better enough to finish the book? I don't think so. Sufficient self-indulgence merits self-publishing. Didn't and won't finish this piece of corduroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, very disappointing","review":"I've certainly enjoyed Niven's work in the past -- but the \\"wildly funny\\" assertion made in the publisher's book description should have tipped me off here. I don't think *anything* I've read by Niven has made me crack a smile -- certainly nothing recent. Yes, I got all the \\"in jokes,\\" references to Burrough's Barsoom, etc., but they weren't funny.The main problem as I saw it was his writing, which was incredibly confusing and favored supposedly witty dialog too heavily over explanation/description (if you want me to imagine another world, you gotta throw me a bone or two).I don't recommend purchasing this. A better recent Niven book was \\"Destiny's Road.\\" While I still wouldn't stand up and cheer for the writing, at least it had a fascinating hard-science premise and enough world-creation to keep me going."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun, even if you don't get all the inside jokes.","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I suspect I would've enjoyed it more if I were more familiar with the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom stories. Recursive SF is like alternate history in that you have to be familiar with the original material in order to get full enjoyment out of it. Also, this is not much like most of Niven's other work, so that may be a problem for some of those who prefer only \\"Hard\\" science fiction. That said, I recommend this book for a quick, entertaining read. It does help, as a previous reviewer stated, to read the short stories first. In fact, I think the book should've been printed in that order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I felt that the story telling was rather confused, and that the premise wasn't working at novel length.

You can *not like* her voice, but to suggest that she has no talent is ridiculous. Her vocal style is different, but by no means lacking talent. She's emotive, sexual, keeps a very funky beat, and throws her confidence around in her lyrics just like you want her to.I guess the straight-laced-set might just not *get* Macy, but even that is suspicious, because several of her songs are very infectous. \\"Relating to a Psychopath\\" and \\"Sexual Revolution\\" demand multiple listenings right off the bat, and the rest of the album carries a similar theme, very listenable.Personally, I find her voice extremely emotive and pure, with a fine command of her range. To top it off, there's more intelligence within this CD than you'd expect from a typical MTV artist.And, oh yeah, the band is very tight and the sound is well-produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genious!","review":"This CD is genious. It was so underated and unexcepted because pop radio refused to play it. Everyone thought Macy was a pop princess after the success of her first CD and single that won grammys. But this woman is one of the most creative artists of our time. On this release she is crazy all over the board. It's funny, it's fun, it's catchy and everyone has thought the things she's stood up to sing about even if they don't want to admit it. When you listen to this CD, come at it with an angle of fun! Music is here to inspire and play with. Enjoy it, like Macy does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Center Ring","review":"Here's how good this album is. We thought her last CD, 'On How Life Is', was the finest debut by a Rhythm & Blues artist in many years. It appeared to give a much needed jolt to 'unrapped' R&B music. Well, this album kicks its... It is broader, more daring, more imaginative, funnier, sexier, more exuberant, more playful, and more expressive. There may be other R&B singers who flaunt the styles of blues, hip-hop, funk, disco, gospel, reggae and, perhaps, even raga, but we don't recall any with the chutzpah to sound like the leader of some wickedly twisted Bar Mitzvah band, just turn your smile into a blank-eating grin. This album is a circus and Macy is the center-ring performer holding the torch of Al Green in one hand, the torch of Sly and the Family Stone in the other, juggling a hundred other influences while balancing on the shoulders of Prince. Add her soulful scratch of a voice and this is just the tonic to lift the spirits in difficult times."},{"rating":"2","title":"no sophomore slump here","review":"Fantabulous. What breathtaking talent. Excellent follow-up to the incredible album #1. Only questionable spot is track 11, Oblivion, which is interesting but interrupts the otherwise smooth flow of the tracks-- should have left it as a cool b-side-- that's what takes away the fifth star. Only regret is that the day of the intimate m.g. concerts should now be definitively over-- she is a bona fide star.Let's hope Lauryn Hill can do as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing how a woman with no talent can sell so many records","review":"Macy Gray has one of the most hideous voices in popular music today. She sounds like a duck being choked or something. Since she has no talent, she thrives on media hype to help her sell records. Maybe she's a good songwriter and if she is, she should get someone else to sing her songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macy Records a Disgracey","review":"I will preface this review by saying I own Macy's first CD \\"On How Life Is\\" and it was a good CD. But I noticed that it did not prove to have a very long shelf life for me. But for some reason I purchased her sophomore offering The ID without having heard even a snippet of a song from it. I gotta say. WOW! WHAT A DISSAPPOINTMENT! I have listened to the whole CD at least five times now and you know it is bad when you find yourself not looking forward to hearing even one song again. This is really bad. Her voice is terrible, unintelligible at times, cartoonish and gets more irritating than a chancre sore that lasts for too long. I wish I could give you one redeeming feature but I cannot. ...I shared it with several people at work and all of them returned it to me stating they could not finish it. To sum it up, this will be the FIRST CD that I will have ever taken to a place that buys used CD's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"Well... at least the album has a fitting title.In the liner notes, 'the id' is defined as the actions one does before thinking. That perfectly describes this album. It sounds jumbled and very spur of the moment. She made this album before thinking about how bad it was and how it would ruin the reputation she established with her debut. Almost every song is a half-baked idea that wears out its welcome at the 2 minute mark. They are funky, I'll give them that, but otherwise this is not worth the buy. I would suggest her debut or her third album. Both are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore slump not for Macy","review":"Hot on the heels of 'On How Life Is' comes Macy Gray's 2nd album, 'The Id'. And like its predecessor, this album is an impressive mix of catchy melodies, freaky lyrics and Macy's unique voice.While there really isn't anything that screams MASSIVE HIT like I Try did, there are a large number of standout tracks on the disc, with a good blend of mid and uptempo songs. The highlights on the album include the somewhat rock-y 'Relating to a Psychopath', the jaunty and fun 'Sexual Revolution' and the tender 'Sweet Baby'. However my favourite track is definitely the bizaare circus/carnival tune that is 'Oblivion', which includes sparkling lyrical gems like 'I eat my marimbas' and 'I tingle when I sing/Bling bling bling ting ting ting'.I could have done without the instrumental 'Blowin' Up Your Speakers' though, which threatens to do just that with its weird cacophony of noises.However, on the whole, this is a great album and is definitely worth spending your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love her or hate her, she is catchy","review":"As a huge fan of Macy Gray before the mainstream found out about her musical style, I found myself eagerly awaiting what would her second album sound like?The Id, released earlier this week, has to be some of the most bizarre musical stylings of any albums of late. Taking her song writing to another level we have \\"Relating to a Pyschopath\\" to My Nutmeg Phantasy\\" to \\"Gimme all your lovin or i will kill you\\" On the Id Macy finds herself with few radio friendly upbeat singles, she has plenty of slow grooves that tell a story. With Macy you have to look past the music and examine the lyrics.I have a few favorite tracks, the funky, circus quality of Oblivion, the hidden track of Shed, and the opening Psychopath.Call Macy crazy, call her whatever you want, but call her weirdly individual, and that is what this album is. A sure fire bet that will end up in your cd rotation almost instantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"spacy macy","review":"This is way ahead of its time.

Either way, they're awful!!! Why are they getting so much exposure for NO amount of talent whatsoever?? It's really sad that people can actually tolerate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Sore Throat + huge rotating fan + chalkboard scratching = Macy Gray. If thats music to your ears then go for it, but im just trying to save you some cash. Macy Gray is THE WORST vocalist I have EVER heard in my entire life. Professional that is. Do not support this whatchamacallit. You know what I mean but you know I can't say it. I honestly believe that my vocals screaming when I'm falling from the bridge I jumped off of after I listened to this trash is better than her best singin on a good day. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONALD DUCK?","review":"The first time I heard \\"I Try\\" on the radio I thought a new Disney album had been released and Donald Duck was singing a tune. It was quite amusing.Then I find out that it was someone seriously trying to sing! Seriously people, Macy Gray CANNOT sing! Her voice is horrible. Some people say that she is very talented?! What is she talented at? It's definitely not singing.So far this album is bombing on the Billboard charts compared to her first one. Let's hope people don't buy this album, she'll be a one hit wonder and then she will go away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Id(iot)","review":"Worst fad ever. People went along with this? She looks like a Frankenstein Sasquatch, and she has a voice to match. Man, people say Brittany Spears can't sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"On How Life Is Part 2","review":"If you liked On How Life Is, then you'll like The Id. And that's what's great and what's disappointing about this album. \\"Don't Come Around\\" is by far the best song Macy's ever done. Other songs like \\"Harry\\" and \\"Sweet Baby\\" sound like less exciting versions of \\"Why Didn't You Call Me\\" and \\"Still\\", respectively. Also, \\"Give Me All Your Lovin' Or I Will Kill You\\" sounds like \\"I've Committed Murder\\" all over again. But musically, it's entertaining and so is the overall album, just not groundbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"after the Shock wore off","review":"the thing about Macy Gray is that to Me She isn't the worst thing in the Business far from it&in fact She is a Bit Different as a Artist for what goes for being nowadays but having said that, Her voice is still hard to Digest.Somewhere Between Mary J.Bliege,Rod Stewart,Eartha Kitt,&Tracy Chapman is Macy Gray&it isn't moving me except to crack up.Now the music has Funk Elements there but Her voice&Lyrics Never Rise to take it anywhere.Her concepts at times are interesting but that Voice Shoots it down as do Her Lyrics.also with some of Her Subject Matter&Lyrical Content you feel there is a Shock Value trying to Be Reflected but it wears off really soon&The Material never Recovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate me for saying this","review":"You have no concept of how badly I cannot stand Macy Gray. For sure she is one of my least favorite celebrities on the planet. And if you've seen any Award shows where she's been present, you'll understand why. However, that's Macy Gray the person. Macy Gray the artist, on the other hand, is by and far the most impressive soul and r&b singer out today. The Id's genre influences range from Soul to even straight out rock. The almost too obvious follow up to her massive single hit \\"I Try\\" is basically an identical song (\\"Sweet Baby\\") with a quicker beat and less catchy hook, but one of the standouts none-the-less. From the first track (Psychopath...) on, all will be continuously impressed by her irritatingly irresistable sandpaper voice and know how for huge hooks and catchy lyrics. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much improved over \\"On How Life Is\\"...","review":"I was initially disappointed by Macy Gray's debut release, \\"On How Life Is\\", due to its sparse number of tracks (only ten, no hidden tracks or anything) and the similarity of some (most notably \\"I Try\\" and \\"Still\\"). It was still an awesome album, but I'll have to give top points to \\"The Id\\" as the current best Macy Gray album. Thirteen tracks, including the hidden track, \\"Shed\\", is more than enough. And the offerings are plentiful. \\"Relating to a Psychopath\\" is just as good, if not better, than her first album's opener \\"Why Didn't You Call Me?\\" Also excellent is \\"Sexual Revolution\\" with its slow intro and disco transition, \\"Freak Like Me\\" for its oldies-style melody and \\"Sweet Baby\\" just because it's the best! (Do you really need another reason?) And, despite other fans' hatred for it, I thought that the end track, \\"Blowin' Up Your Speakers\\" was awesome! Macy Gray truly struts her stuff on \\"The Id\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding Me?","review":"Second best CD of the year? Yes, Macy Gray has some songwriting skills, but in case you hadn't noticed, the womancan't sing.This alone makes any Macy Gray CD 3 stars at best. Not to mention the fact that the music on this CD is one big collage of cliches. She should take up writing poetry books or perhaps letting other artists perform her stuff, becausesongwriting is the ONLY skill that her music displays. Two stars is generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIGFOOT IS BACK!","review":"Macy is back with another album. And it's good. The Sasquatch of Torchsongs reminds everyone why she is the new queen of soul. Her voice echoes with Aretha Franklin poignancy while the production of her album rivals any of Jay-Z's often hyperproduced lp's. Overall, a great album; definitely a platinum seller, if not for the craft of her music, than for the sheer size of her torso. (I wonder how much hair she has growing in other parts of her body. Yeeech!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macy the ID ...","review":"Three letters missing from the album title - see below.Though there are some good musical arrangements on this one, if you really want to enjoy it , just leave the pause button intact, then reflect peacfully on something nice, other than Donald Duck singing for more dope money .Three letters missing - i, and an o and a t ."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst voice heard in a long time!!","review":"I don't understand the hype with her, her vocal quality is just horrible. Song writing's not that hard, so what if she writes her own songs. I'll sooner be more impressed with someone with mediocre writing skills that can at least sing well than someone who's the total opposite...as she is.

This is not to say the book is difficult, since it is not: the prose is clear and straightforward. However, \\"1000 days\\" is far more introspective than a typical armchair traveler read, and this makes it more about Blasi's inner life and the changes in attitude and values she experiences after deciding to change her circumstances.I found it an extraordinarily thoughtful and intimate book, almost like reading a personal diary, and the embellishments of an exotic locale and gourmet recipes did not turn it into another cliched \\"life with the eccentric locals of generic popular place #4\\". Instead I found myself absorbed in Blasi and her choices. I will look for more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this a bestseller?","review":"I rarely write book reviews, but I had to warn people about this book. This is a prime example of a desperate, pathetic woman. If there are any really independent women out there who don't feel so desperate for a man that they are willing to move halfway across the world, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It shimmers and shines, just as the water in Venice","review":"Romance was everywhere in this book. To go back to the printed word as a reconnaitre for me in Venice, was a total joy. Marlena makes every footstep an adventure. Her writing style is exhilerating. The words and phrases literally jump - with her passion and depth for Fernando and their growing worlds as a couple and their love of Venice. Having just finished it, I'm going to begin again tonight! Thankyou, Marlena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Venice, as seen through the navel gazing of De Blasi.","review":"I found this book ponderous and self absorbed. Unfortunately, so much written about Venice falls into the same category, so this is not the worst of the genre by far.The writer is obsessed with food. This is not, in and of itself, a bad thing, and the passages about local specialties and famed Rialto markets were interesting. But by the end, if I had to read one more line about The Stranger's \\"blueberry\\" eyes, I thought I would scream. Eyeballs should not be described as foodstuffs. Likewise, the endless obsession with finding Mongolian lamb for her wedding outfit was tedious beyond tolerance (perhaps it was the lamb part that kept her going).I see from other reviews that many found the book romantic, the ultimate fulfullment of a fantasy. Realists, be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Surely it's many women's dream to be attracting a stranger and marry off to a Venetian, but this is a really boring story. I tried to read it many times and just can't get into it, although I'm a big fan of Italy and Venice is one of my favorite cities. I enjoyed reading the \\"Mediterranean Summer\\" by David Shalleck much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overuse of words","review":"Her passion is evident, but it didn't need to be described in so many words. It was almost an overabuse of adjectives. It's fine to paint a picture, but it need not be the Sistine Chapel. The cover, which is spectacular, actually said it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 Days in Venice","review":"Very unlikely secenario. Confusing read. Is she a writer, is she a cook, does she write about cooking. Not clear. The stranger's character, not well developed. The unlikely romance is bizarre and storyline gets put aside for home decorating and cooking issues at times. I don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Uniteresting","review":"This book was soo boring. I love travel books and I love Venice so I was very excited to read this book. I put it down several times and made myself finish it. I was puzzled as to why she wrote it. There was no intimacy revealed. You can't really get into her shoes and understand why she just left her life and moved to be with someone who sounds like a complete loser. They were interesting and this book was a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much richness","review":"The greatest appeal of this glittering memoir is the self-possession of its author. Here is a woman who understands herself well, and she shapes her story with great skill and aliveness. De Blasi paints many beautiful word picture for us, revealing the inner and outer richness of her lush mid-life adventure. She is equally articulate on the history of Venice, the psychology of love, and gourmet cooking. I wasn't riveted by every chapter, but A Thousand Days in Venice left me admiring De Blasi as a woman and a writer. I came away from this read with a renewed commitment to the romantic life and a wish in my heart for De Blasi's lasting happiness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"I am a person who always reads a book to the end.... even if its bad. This is one I just can't seem to get through. I've read 3/4 of it and I just can't waste another minute on it. The author does describe Venice in great detail and the nice cafes etc. I kept waiting for this story to get interesting and it didn't. I kept waiting for the love story to blossom and it didn't. I don't understand why all the high marks for this book. I don't leave many reviews unless I really like a book or unless I really disliked a book. I just felt the reviews on this book are a bit misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Days In Venice","review":"As I had read her second book A Thousand Days in Tuscany and enjoyed it,I felt I should read it preparing for a trip to Italy. I was not disapointed. Such a wonderful story that is well written with an American perspective and sense of hummor.I cannot wait to discover Venice and the Italians. I will go with an insider perspective on all things Italian and what makes them tick. Being a foodie and lover of wine, her background as a chief and food writer made Italy come alive.Only wish that I had saved it for my new Kindle2to take it to Italy with me!Love that new device and glad I waited for the slimer better device.In this age of doom and gloom it is an escape from all that and to know there is a love out there for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"little to learn here","review":"I bought this book based on receomendation in Wine Spectator, hoping to learn more as i may wish to build wine cellar. Well, I learned little if anything from this book, except that the writer has a very high opinion of himself. My advice: look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The author assumes we all have the ability to acquire a 4,000 bottle collection of wine, and at times looks down upon those of us who enjoy wine, but don't have the proper credentials to qualify as wine snobs. This book needs more practical support for those people who want to collect a variety of good value wines, and store them over time. This book does not deliver on that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep searching","review":"In my opinion this book is really more about wine collecting then it is wine cellars. There is some decent info about building and keeping a wine cellar but the most of the pertinent information on that subject in this book could have ended on chapter 3 possibly 4 if you're interested in cataloging your wine. The bulk of this book is made up the author's personal antidotes that might give some insight into wine cellaring but can be difficult to trudge through while he uses terms like \\"grocery store wine\\", blasts the wine critic in the Wall Street Journal for recommending cheap wine (gasp!), or tells the story of how his dad first started cellaring wine using the closet in the maids room in the back of his house \\"leaving just enough space for the poor woman to hang a single with dress uniform on a single wire hanger\\". If you need a 152 page book that has 70 pages on the core components of building a wine cellar shouted down to you from a very high horse... this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practical but off-putting","review":"Beyond the valuable practical advice offered in this book, particularly in using Excel to organize a wine collection, and helpful delineation of wine collector \\"types\\", I was put off by the obvious focus on über expensive wines and the sexist nature of many of the comments and stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a wonderful and informitive book on herbs.","review":"This book was very informitive on the uses of herbs for medicines in the Middle Ages.

Vertically, it worked all the way to 650 mm for my Sharp 65\\" (an unusually long vertical dimension). Only caution- I drilled bigger holes than spec'd in the instructions into the wall.

This mount advertised it would accommodate a 3 stud installation ... which is true, except they fail to mention that expanded in the 3 stud configuration, it won't accept mounting of some TVs.According to Sanus, my TV has a 12\\" mounting pattern on the back which is too narrow for the mount when it is expanded. Their solution was to offer to sell me expansion brackets and even charge me shipping on them!If you decide to use this mount expanded, make sure that your TV still will mount to it!Oh, on top of that, the bolts and screws are metric... if you need to pick up longer lag screws (in my case) it will be impossible to find longer ones at your local Home Depot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't ask for much more but then, I guess I could","review":"Easy to follow instructions and incredibly sturdy.

I'm about 2\\" off to the right which 98% of the population won't even notice but I have to nag about something. Oh yea, it's really heavy too (see \\"incredibly sturdy\\" comment above) so I did need an extra set of hands when bolting it to the wall. I will say this, if you've never hung more than a collage of 4 x 6 prints of your kids on the wall, hire someone to hang your TV. There are plenty of home theater installers out there that you can hire to do this and most will have some nice tricks to hide all the wires that still need to be run to the TV.

It is fairly easy to install with great directions. The bracket allows you to slide and tilt your tv, or lock it in.Now for the bad news... this product is recommended for the Sharp Aquos LC65D64U 65\\" LCD. However, it does not come with the right bolts for that TV. This poses two minor problems: You have to buy the bolts and you have to enlarge the holes on the bracket. The bolt size is M10x1.5x35mm (size, thread, length). They can be picked up at home depot (and make sure to get some M10 flat washers too). You will also need a file to enlarge the holes on the bracket (took about 10 minutes for all 4 holes).If you are planning on installing your own wall mount, the modifications should be easily within you abilities.Overall great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanus VMPL3-B Wall Mount","review":"I purchased the Sanus VMPL3-B for my Sony KDl60EX700.

The instructions could have been a little more clear, and the main problem I encountered was incorrect hardware. I probably had at least 20 bolts left over for different TV installations, but the ones for my TV were not in there. I trip to Home Depot solved this, but you have to be careful you are getting the right size, length, and thread count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk !","review":"Bought this bat house because of the description.

She likes the noises and buttons for sound, but they are not necessarily key to her playing with the kitchen. We are ecstatic that she is happy with it.The previous reviews are correct in that it helps to have two people to put it together.

Make sure you go slow when applying the stickers."},{"rating":"2","title":"best kitchen i've seen by far","review":"i had absolutely no problems putting the kitchen together and the dishes and utensils were pretty good quality given some of the baking and cooking sets that were received as gifts were cheaply made.

It keeps her occupied like no other toy she has. She loves to help me in the kitchen and now she has her own, her size. I read other reviews about this product and I didn't have any of the problems other people say they did. It was easy to put together, I do, however, recommend using an electric screwdriver, it'll go much faster that way. My daughter thinks the overhead light is the coolest thing ever and no worries, it shuts itself off within minutes if they forget to. So no wasting batteries. This kitchen is well worth the money I paid for it and has all the storage space they could need for thier dishes and food. My only complaint, actually it's more my daughters, is that she wishes the faucet made noise like everything else does.Anyway, all the doors fit right and it is sturdy. My advice is just take your time assembling it. I'd say it took me about an hour to put it all together, decals and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen","review":"We have had this kitchen for our son for 2 years and it is holding up very well. It is a lot of fun and quite sturdy. Try as we might we went through a phase where he liked to open the oven door and stand on it. Well, it took that misuse very well. We have not had any issues with this kitchen. I love the neutral colors. Who says only girls should play with kitchens? So many of them are all pink!

She got it months ago for christmas and plays with it constantly. It wasn't too much of a pain to put together but there is one flaw that I feel is worth mentioning. The two compartments that house the batteries for the sound functions are a bit of a pain to put on and off and the connectors that hold them are very brittle. So the combination of the two ended in breaking some clips. I think they could have designed this a little smarter considering the rest of the is so well built. Also our sticker set that we got was printed incorrectly, we got a new one pretty fast though from step 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kitchen","review":"My daughter is 1 and this is her favorite toy, and I know she will enjoy it for years to come. I assembled the kitchen in one evening - easy, but definitely helps to have a power drill. There was one piece missing from the box - the clip for the phone. I was disappointed but I called Step2 and they were so helpful and sent the piece out immediately at no charge. Customer service was excellent. This kitchen has plenty of doors and drawers for younger children to enjoy exploring and then taller cabinets and sound features (buttons and burners) for older ages. We love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kitchen out there","review":"I researched every kitchen (numerous times) and found this to be the best. When I went to buy it every Toys R Us (the only place that sells it unless you order it online) in New Jersey & Northeast PA was sold out! Hence it's popularity. Very dissapointed I figured I wouldn't be able to get it for my 21 month old for X-Mas. Then 2 days before X-mas I walked into BJ Wholesale and to my surprise they had them right there and instead of paying toys r us price of $154 it was only $119 for the exact model. My daughter can't get enough of this toy. She loves the overhead light, as soon as it turns off she turns it right back on. The cooking sounds are also great and there is tons storage space. My only negative is the phone is hard to put back on the hook, even I have a hard time. Also the other reviews say it is hard to put together my husband did it in about an hour with no problem, just make sure you use and electric drill. All in all I think this is the best kitchen out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!!!!","review":"We bought this kitchen for our 2 year old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely LOVES it!!! I did a lot of research before I finally settled on this one and I'm glad I did. The kitchen is so cute and there is a ton of storage space and she loves the sound effects. It does take some time to put together, but considering the end result, it's completely worth it!

I highly recommend this kitchen!!!!!Lisa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just bouth for my 20 Month old...really nice but...","review":"What is the deal with the pot and pan that this comes with..ours are flat bottom and they do not activate the noises on the burner. The burner has little buttons that need a pan with a rim or something underneath to activate the burner...but ours do not. I read the other reviews but no one else seems to mention this. What's up with that? Now I need to go figure out if we were given the wrong pans with our set.It is a great little kitchen overall and my daughter is loving it big time. It's only the grownup that notice the water faucet and fridge not making any noise! But hey, we paid for it so we should voice our complaints!Again, overall a great kitchen. Pretty expensive considering no running water noise and the pots and pans don't activate the burner noise. You have to buy the extra food..it's a must to get the value out of this. Ours came with no food...even though the advertisment showed that it came with at least a few items...not in ours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen!","review":"This kitchen is a little pricey - but it's well worth it!

The same thing happened with O and I in this section of the game. My husband said he saw it giving her incorrect info in another area of the game. Now she's sad that I took her game away and I can't get a refund because I lost my receipt and the toy store won't take opened software. Apparently, there was poor quality control on this program.

However, there was some very disturbing material that I think was unecessary and could have been left out or changed. Where as some people would have dropped their jaw in shock over the final revelations, I found myself saying, \\"Oh, c'mon.\\" It was farfetched. I think I enjoyed the narrator (on audio CD) more than anything who often reads for this author and there was some humor that had me bending over at the waist.

Also he uses words I never heard before to describe something,rather than stopping to look it up I would have to guess, otherwise I'd lose what little plot there was at the time.

Not all of us choose gardening as our major-at least 90 percent of the college graduates have majors that they like, and those majors are definitely not gardening.

Yes, it is that horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing... !","review":"Bill Cosby's sense of humour makes you laugh in places but as one of the readers said earlier \\"this book has no sense of direction\\". So, after reading it the question \\"now what?\\" still remains unanswered. And quite honestly you don't even get a hint to guess what the answer is...Mr. Cosby is an undoubtedly clever man but maybe in this particular piece of work he gives us an insight into what he was like during his university years?The book is fun but very disappointing in sense that this isn't what you'd expect from the title.

Having completed this read I must admit to a real sense of disappointment; while the book tries to come across as tongue in cheek it reads more as a rant against higher education.In fact, it is a clean alternative to George Carlin's rantings which seem also to have gone from biting and funny to just biting.The entire book basically rants that your diploma is worthless and a slings out a \\"might as well give up now\\" attitude. The more I read, the more I kept waiting for Cosby to yell \\"Just Kidding!\\" but it never happened. No, it seems that we are getting a glimpse of the anger building up in him back in 1999 which has been driving his lectures of late.While the book is funny in a dark sort of way I cannot recommend it as a gift for any new graduate as it would probably not deliver on your expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is so true","review":"Bill Cosby does it again.

The coarse setting isn't course enough to use in a french press. The coarse setting grinds the beans finer than what you will get from a coffee shop for a drip maker. This makes for a very cloudy cup of coffee. I have gotten a better grind using my old blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"lightweight, but disappointing","review":"Grounds come out uneven, there is a lot of static electricity, so the grounds go all over the counter. The various parts fit loosely and get looser as the machine ages. And it's really loud, esp, in the morning. After several years of putting up with these shortcomings just bought a Solis Maestro. Cost more, but you get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, Messy, Messy!","review":"Well, it grinds ok, I agree with other posters about the fine grounds, but I'm not the coffee fan in the family here, so ignore my opinion on that. However, I am the one that makes the coffee each day, and oh my is this thing MESSY! The static provides a mini-coffee explosion upon opening the canister, the grounds get stuck in the duct that leads to the canister and they have to be dug out with a knife/spoon something to that effect. I really wouldn't recommend it just on the basis that it is SO incredibly messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"why so spendy","review":"I ordered this from another seller for $40.00 with minimal shipping charges; have no idea why it is nearly $200.00 on Amazon. That is a huge discrepency.

Somehow I don't think that all its good reviews reflect such an extreme price.I've seen it elsewhere for $60-100; I can't understand this discrepancy in price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Messy","review":"I feel this unit grinds the coffee just fine. There are a number of sizes; however, be ready for a mess. It is impossible to empty this unit without the grounds going everywhere. I put a towel down and it still manages to go everywhere - the floor, next to the towel and on the towel. There are too many areas on the grinder where coffee grounds accumulate - on the lid, where the grinding comes out, when emptying the collection container - it is a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Avid Coffee Drinker","review":"It's too slow, too messy, and it is noisy. Dismantling and cleaning usually results in changing the grind setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"I've owned mine for about three years and am now looking for something less messy and less loud. It takes a good couple of minutes to grind enough for a single cup of coffee, and if you're trying to do this while someone is still asleep, household discord can arise. Because the canister for the grounds does not sit firmly onto the grinder, you have to stand around while its grinding to keep it from coming off. Perhaps because the burrs have become dull, for about a year now I have to regularly hit the top of the container to keep feeding the beans through the grinder as it operates; otherwise it gets stuck and no beans are ground. All of this fuss leads to a pretty messy counter. Braun definitely needs to improve on this design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"I had no problems with coffee fines spilling onto the counter. If others did then they had the lid(s) loose or the catcher was not snugged up against the machine. You should hear a \\"click\\" when the catcher snaps into place.Yes there is static electricity - thats a characteristic of plastic. Just get a small paint brush and brush out the fines. The use of metal or glass for the catcher would cause other, more annoying problems and would also add to the cost.I had a Krupp before this and the Braun works as well with one minor exception. The Braun throat design for the feed into the grinding mechanism is such that the last few beans fly around and take extra time to be \\"captured\\" and ground. The Kraup design was such that the beans slid smoothly down the shoot and the last few did not bounce around to the extent that they do in the Braun. Without that I would have rated it 5 Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Efficient","review":"This is a very nice coffee grinder. It is a little bit messy but for the price I am very happy with it and would purchase it again. It has a wide range of grind settings which is nice. I also like the fact that you can store almost a pound of beans in the top hopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one!","review":"We used the first version of this grinder for twenty-five years. We bought the current model after the orignal stopped working because we didn't want to be without our Braun. The new one works very well also. Have not experienced the clean-up problems that some describe. However, we grind the coffee, tap/remove the lid, and then use the scoop to remove the needed coffee while leaving the cup on the grinder. This is a very good grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Static Cling","review":"I really enjoy a great cup of coffee and the Kmm30 does a wonderful job of giving me the grind that I need to accomplish this task. In fact, my husband and I have become so hooked on the fresh taste of our coffee that we just can't find a good cup of coffee when we are away from home.My only complaints are (1) the static cling from the grounds on the inside of lid and the cup. It does seem to jump out at you, but I find if I tap the side of the cup before I open it it will not create such a mess. (2) the coffee tends to stick in the chute and has to be scraped out with the slanted handle of the coffee spoon.This little grinder has been a work horse. It's just under two years old and it has probably ground coffee for more than 1200 pots. As I said earlier, we love our coffee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arlington, VA","review":"I don't find this too messy as others have reported.

There's a warranty, but by the time you pay to ship it back and put up with the other hassles, it is easier to just go buy another grinder--not another Braun. It is a pain to buy a premium priced product and get so little for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and hard to clean","review":"I bought this grinder a few months ago because the grinder we had was a little messy and we love fresh ground coffee. Bad idea! This one makes more mess than any $10 version out there! It's hard to get the residual beans and grounds out of the grinder, the grounds fly out the back while grinding, the force of grinding causes grounds to stick to the side of the holding container (no matter how coarse the setting), and static makes them fly everywhere when you try to scoop them out. I've ended up scooping the grounds out over the sink to minimize the mess- so much for convenience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess!","review":"I bought this grinder because it was the most expensive at Target and I figured you get what you pay for. Wrong!Not only is it messy when you open it to remove the grounds, but ours sprays grounds all over the place as it's grinding!!!Our daughter has the same one, and hers doesn't spray when grinding, although it does make a mess when opening the canister, so I suppose we just got a lemon!I'd never buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early failure","review":"We were replacing an old coffee grinder with a brand new identical unit. The new unit was shipped promptly. Unfortunately, the unit failed in operation on its second day in use. We shipped it back, but we cannot get a replacement since the item is on back order. Our account has been credited. We have never before had any difficulty with the Braun grinder and expect to purchase another when they are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and complicated","review":"I got this as a gift to replace my simple little grinder that I lost the top for. This thing has way too many parts and is a mess. There are 2 compartments(one for beans and one for ground coffee) to clean and one falls off whenever you pick it up - then the ground coffee falls out of the hole where it connects. The 2 lids fall off of these 2 compartments. It also seems really slow compared to my old little blender style. I am going back to the simple one piece blender type of grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made, barely functional--stay away!","review":"I owned a terrific German-made Braun burr coffee grinder for over 30 years and loved its quality, solidity, and reliability, so I was expecting a similar experience with the Spanish-made KMM30, and was I unpleasantly surprised! The parts fit together loosely and the conical bean holder is so wobbly that I couldn't believe such a product would carry the Braun label. The square hole from which the ground coffee sprays into the holder gets completely clogged with coffee dust, which spills all over when you remove the holder, and which is simply impossible to clean--what a mess! The timer switch also serves as the ON/OFF power switch, but requires so much effort to turn back to 0 that I was afraid I would break off the switch each time. I could go on, but why bother--just stay away from this one if you want to avoid real heartache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Grinder Available","review":"We had the predecessor of this grinder for about 15 years and it finally just gave up the ghost. It grinds coffee finer than any other grinder I've ever seen (even commercial ones) which means you can use LESS coffee/cup.We probably ground over 100 pounds of coffee with it and the only thing we did was keep it clean. You can't ask for much better service than that from a home appliance.We're going to buy another one as soon as they become available."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a forbidden treat!","review":"I read this in seventh grade after finishing Letters From Camp.

It's an easy read.I know that is was probably under my reading level, but you need a book that's just entertaining and fun to read once in awhile. Just because it's meant for younger kids, doesn't mean that older kids or adults wouldn't enjoy the story.

One of my favorite parts is how the fifth graders sent in their design ideas for the fountain. For example, they wanted to have more things to drink than just water, like chocolate milk, chocolate shakes, lemonade and soda.

The sound of gun shots would have created panic among the group of prisoners waiting to be killed.The inmates confess blatantly that under untenable torture they told their interrogators everything those wanted to hear and denounced as traitors even the most innocent of their compatriots.The movie creates a nearly unbearable emotional climate by showing the extreme excesses of a Marxist ideology going mad, killing even intentionally children and babies.

What I found a bit dissapointing is that there is almost no mention of the few western prisoners who perished in Tuol Sleng, by doing so I think the director could have invoked a lot of extra world-wide attention on his film.

There are one or two that show a lot of talent by the creators, but the rest are derivative, overwrought, stiffly-animated one-line jokes without a punchline, or well-animated scenes which have too flimsy and confusing a story to really hold their own. If you want terrific examples of animation and character design from students and pros, try [...] or [...].

Swing music is mostly big band music requiring good reproduction for full enjoyment. Yanow is constantly recommending the French Melodie Jazz Classics, famous for completeness but notorious for poor (if any) remastering. For example, he criticized the Lionel Hampton small group sessions from Decca for their incompleteness, although they are cream of the crop and vastly better fidelity than the more complete Classics. No mention of the Mosaic set that is both complete and magnificently remastered.The mini-biographies are OK, but don't distinguish the best from the rest very well. There's little here that isn't covered better in the Penguin Guide, or on The Web. Well, he does cover the \\"Swing Revival\\" bands, but I've listened to some of the groups he lauds and found them a pale shadow of the real stuff from the '40s.My copy ended up in the garbage pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent book, Yanow isn't afraid to tell it like it is!!! D","review":"Yanow covers almost every aspect of swing(he's left out Banu Gibson!), with a few acceptions. From Louis armstrong's Hot Fives & Sevens to Glenn Miller, to Squirrell Nut Zippers. Surprisingly the tough jazz critic likes Bran Setzer's Dirty boogie Cd, and gives Squirrel Nut Zippers HOT cd, a rating of 9(out of 10)! A great book and Yanow tells it like it is, if it doesn't swing, or the musucianship is poor he's not afraid to say so. a grea thonest book that will tell you what cd's to bu yand what to skip. Includes an interview with big band leader Lavay Smith(he gives her cd a perfect 10 rating)! Even a whole section here on modern swing including Big Bad Voovdoo Daddy, Cherry Poppin Daddies, and more... Fun book to read while stuck on the toilet, I keep one in all three of my bathrooms, and one in the car for when I go to record stores!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing","review":"Swing takes readers into a world that few of us know.

Beautiful arias abound, accompanied in many places by very characterful orchestral music. Especially beautiful, indeed stunning, is Ottone's recitative and aria \\"Qual portentoso fulmine\\" in the middle of the second act. The quality of Chance's singing, including his amazing breath control and consistency of sound, is beyond comparison. Chance, and some of the other members of this cast, also recorded L'Incoronazione di Poppea with Gardiner - another highly successful recording which I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.

My only complaints are that it seems a little flimsily made, and that you get a split second of static between each mp3. But it does what it's supposed to do. As a clarification of an earlier post by another user, I note that the device does remember which mp3 file you were on the last time you started your car; it just doesn't remember where you were in that file, so it starts the file over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it is...","review":"This is a basic product to play MP3 files from a flash drive over your car stereo.

I tried this in 4 different cars with 4 different MP3 players. Two of the cars I wasn't even able to get the music to play through any station.

The concept is very good, however, the reliability is not. I will make a concession that maybe I'm doing something I shouldn't with it, but I really think the product just went bad. I hooked up an external cigarette plug to an external power supply that pushes 2.5A @ 12V DC. A car cigarette lighter is usually 10A 12V DC, or maybe 15A tops, so I doubt I put too much amperage thru the unit. It is possible I put too little juice thru it, but I doubt it, considering it takes almost no juice to run the unit. Anyway, I ran it on a torture test last week, and it failed. I ran the unit for approx. 8 hours, and the screen started flashing, and the unit kept rebooting. The song would play for a few seconds, and then cut out, and then try to play again. My advice is don't buy this unit--buy the Soundfly instead--it's a much better unit.

Just think what your coffee smell like after you used it to grind garlic or pepper. You can't wash it so the smells stay. Over time wipping with tissue just won't do as the coffee or spices residue builts up inside the grove and crevices. My coffee has a very unique smell and taste after some uses.I can only wash the plastic cap. It is also very noisy. This morning it just stop dead. I am throwing this junk away without any guilt.

I stopped very soon when smoke began pouring out of the unit. Maybe I got a dud, but beware of this product. Seems you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Except for the cheap feel it is perfect!","review":"It is hard to find a grinder with all of the features you like in one machine. I have owned several Krups, but now the plastic cup on top is too shallow and if you grind a full amount you can't invert the ground coffee into the clear cup. Some have very inconvenient cord storage...often fraying dangerously at the point where they bend upon attaching to the grinder. I have tried the Melitta Burr grinder...the static electricity (a major consideration) made a mess every time I used it...gave it away.

Its starting to wear out now - seems to stutter on occasion, but most of the time its still fine - so I'm glad this model is still available. I expect I'll be replacing it soon.And in fact, this grinder is what originally started me on the road to becoming a Braun tools fan, not just for kitchen tools, but anything motorized.

It turns out the button depresses a thin plastic bar that turns on the motor. This piece of plastic is about 1.5mm thick, so no surprise it broke.

His graphic poetry and stories of what sin really smells like are shockingly true. This is down to earth christianity!

He was sufficiently versed in both the folk and classical styles to convey the way these folk song settings rest securely in both traditions. The Dyer-Bennet is currently available as a special pressing from Smithsonian Folkways. Until I heard Wolfgang Holzmair's performance, I've been disappointed with other versions, which lacked the warmth inherent in the material. Holzmair has a subtle and unpretentious voice that is perfect for these songs, and he's accompanied by the Trio Fontenay, who have a similar delicate delicate touch. This disc, currently a special pressing from Arkiv Music, will appeal to lovers of Beethoven's chamber music as well as to those who want to hear this material in a way that combines the strengths of concert music and folk ballads."},{"rating":"1","title":"I passed on this one at the store!","review":"I LOOOOOOVE pepper grinders.

At first, I kept these around, hoping I could figure out how to use them.It would have worked better if the nut were meant to stay still and the grater part turned -- much like a turning cheese grater works. Like the cheese grater, the whole nut could then be grated quickly with no waste at all. No idea why it wasn't designed like this.I'm sad to see the very same grater is still being sold as bad as it was years ago -- esp given the price.

These have 10 packs, and each pack has 5 tea bags of each flavor mentioned. This is only 50 bags for $21.88, which is not a good value when the 96 bags of 1 flavor is the same price, or less. Had I known this, I would not have ordered. There's a chance that you may not like one or two of the flavors, and you'll end up with 10 or 20 tea bags you'll never use.

The story recounts the adventures of an American girl living with her family as they struggle through the Depression. Grace is an imaginative, engaging child, and the period details are fascinating, and subtly worked into the story (as I recall; this review is based on my childhood memories). Grace's relatives and friends are all lively, believable characters. Their difficulties are realistic enough to give readers the sense of what it was really like to live during the Depression, but the book has a lighthearted, comic tone that keeps it fun to read.

For me the power of this book (and of the man himself) is its ability to excite the interest of the layman. As a wannabe teacher, I find Kaku's presentation to be brilliant in terms of his ability to excite his audience and give them 'wow' moments. Sure, maybe he doesn't present a totally complete and unbiased opinion of the subject matter (although I am not one to judge this), but he may spur the interest of a few of the next generation of comologists and to for me that is what is important - keeping people informed and turned-on to science so that they will pursue the subject and generate the next round of discoveries.

In fact, Kaku's book seems to me less informative, less well explained, and covering less ground, than Greene's. At some points it seems like you can feel the author giving up before the difficulty of explaining his material without maths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book by Dr. Michio Kaku","review":"Once again Dr. Michio Kaku has written an excellent thought provoking book on various physics concepts and theories. Dr. Kaku does an amazing job introducing the reader to complicated and often hard to grasp scientific concepts such as M-theory. He then explains the background and thinking of these scientific theories so that the reader is able to comprehend just how profound and meaningful these concepts really are. In all the reader is left thinking deeply about concepts that are foreign to most people but ultimately profound in the world of physics. A great read especially for someone with an interest in physics and extraordinary topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+","review":"I'm going to make the review simple. This is an excellent book. Unlike other scientists who attempt to write for the public, Kaku has the ability to communicate his ideas and his knowledge effectively.

I had watched The Universe on the History Channel, and thought I'd pick up one of Michio Kaku's book. I have quite enjoyed this detour into physics.Kaku is masterful at explaining a broad array of concepts to the lay person. I have no background in science and was able to understand what he presented without having to re-read what Kaku wrote, which is an achievement.I will forewarn readers: this is not a science vs. God book, despite the first line (and one or two pages in the middle of the book). It is instead a delightful treat into pure theorhetical physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem Luncheon","review":"This bag is functional but it has problems.Firstly considering it only holds up to a 15 inch laptop it is BIG although it doesn't look so in pictures.Secondly it has very few compartments. Two largish compartments on the bag and a webbed pocket on the flap. If you plan to carry any more than a few flat documents around then forget it. Extra compartments to seperate phone/wallet/pens/batteries/etc. would have been welcome.So to sum up the luncheon is a very big bag which holds very little. Also it has the stupid design flaw of having gaps in the top unless you tuck in the sides when the flap is closed. What's the point of a bag made from space age, waterproof material if there are gaps which let in rain? Stupid.On the positive side it is quite stylish and the fabric is really tough. If you plan to pay over $100 for a bag then you should expect better design than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always the same","review":"I heard many cd's of Ugo Orlandi, and each time I hear it, the more I hate it. He plays always the same kind of music, always the same things, if you ever heard one of his cds, then you heard them all. There is no artistic evolution . And nowadays, there are very good mandolin players in the world, such as Gertrud Troster, Caterina Lichtenberg, Fabio Machado, Carlo Aonzo; also the fact that he only plays original music written just for mandolin, makes him one of the worst mandolin developers. A musician ( violinist, pianist, whatever) should play all kinds of music, not only the ones that were composed to their instruments, otherwise they would be limiting the instrument capacities!!

I must admit I was highly impressed with this CD also. It has John's flawless transitions and every track is a winner. It has fewer vocals than Progressive Euphoria, but on this CD that works out fine. The mood is wonderful and warm. It's organic beat just makes one move and smile. The music just takes you away to beautiful places and times. I look foreward to exposing my music friends and patients to this excellent CD. It is another example of how talented and creative John is. My highest ratings to White Label Euphoria and regards to this fine mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wishing Tree - Very Nice Marillion Side Project","review":"The Wishing Tree was a side project of Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery and was mainly a showcase for his guitar and the vocal work of Hannah Stobart. Stobart seems to be the main focus of this release and she indeed has a very nice voice. All of the other members of Marillion also appear at one point or another. I have not listened to this in a long time, but I really enjoyed it when I pulled it out. Stobart has a great voice and reminds me a lot of the woman who used to sing for White Willow (her name escapes me at the moment). The song writing is done by Rothery, Stobart and John Helmer who has also collaborated on a lot of Marillion stuff over the years. The music is fairly mellow for the most part, but Rothery gets in a few of his patented melodic solos here and there. I also dig the lyrics. This is an album that came and went without much of a splash, but I would think fans of Marillion or White Willow would dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working great for our two kids!","review":"Have bought other things from Kiddopotomus and have been pleased as well.

The car seat I have has a large piece that goes across the top to secure it to the car.

Now, let me start by saying that I have had three Rodney Yee tapes or DVDs and every single one was too hard for me to do. Either he moves too fast from pose to pose, or he does poses that end up straining my back. The AM part of this is no exception. His poses are too difficult. The PM part of this is all right if I could do it more slowly but it's hard for me to keep up with the instructor. However, the DVD is worth it just for the Suzanne Deason part (Stress Relief) which is calming, easy on the body, and makes me feel good when I'm done. (The AM and PM make me feel cramped and sore right away when I finish.) So now all I do is the Stress Relief one. Worth it though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"starting to exercise?","review":"I've done aerobics, steps, pilates, running...you name it!...but I've never consider yoga as a workout routine, I started practicing yoga and bought this dvd, It is perfect! specially if you are a beginner why?, THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: it has a section where you can learn the name and the posture of each yoga position, which is essential to know if you are a beginner!, the AM workout is great!(all of them are good, but this is my fave)although I just started practicing yoga, I see significance changes in my body and well-being, when I am exercising my form, posture and flexibility is much better! if you are new, be patient, but worth a hundred fold to try yoga and/or combining it with your regular routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginners!","review":"I just received my DVD and only had the chance to do the stress relief yoga. So far, unfortunately I only can attend my yoga call once a week due to a busy work schedule. I think it is a very good yoga dvd for beginners and the 20 min. time range is just right for me. I easily can take 20 min. in the afternoon to do the stress relief and it helps me greatly to continue my work more focused. I had purchased the \\"Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss\\" DVD and started with this on but unfortunately I got a bad copy and it skipped tracks. It seemed to have good exercises but I think the am/stress/pm is the better one for beginners. I also like the visual backgrounds of the DVD. I do not like most of the others I had previewed that where in a studio environment. Again, in my opinion the best DVD for a beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a work out at all","review":"My husband and I had been doing a 20min. beginners yoga video by Rodney Yee and were looking for a little change up, so I got this video. It's terrible in comparison. The segments are supposed to be 20min, but half of it is spent talking so you don't get to do many moves. They also don't hold you in the positions for very long. I suppose for a very very beginner and for someone who needs to figure out how to relax and isn't looking for the stretching part of yoga this would be a place to start.On a side note the choice of clothing for the instructors is distracting in a very bad way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bacis Yoga - Heavy on the prop usage","review":"The workouts are a nice addition to any yoga regimen. The only downsides to this DVD are that the menu is a pain to navigate and it is not set up in a very intuitive manner. Secondly, this program relies heavily on props. I would go so far as to say that you would be doing a completely different set of poses without using props while doing this DVD. This is a plus and a minus, using props so heavily in poses was new for me, so it was interesting to learn how to use them, but I had to go and buy the props before going through the DVD. If you have props, and are looking for some guided yoga, poses this is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is barely even helpful for beginners","review":"I waited on this product for quite some time, and was highly disappointed when I finally received it. I enjoy doing yoga, and consider myself to be in the \\"Experienced beginner\\" range. I find this to be more mediatation oriented, as the instructors provide very VERY basic moves that relax more than invigorate in all three vignettes. This was marketed in a misleading manner, as I think this is intended for those looking for a mediatative guide, or someone perhaps that has been injured and is restarting the workout process. Or for someone that is just beginning their work out routine. The only endearing quality that I can find is that this offers the viewers a detailed content section on the DVD selection menu. I am an avid fan of Rodney Yee, and even his segment was a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great ...","review":"I recently rented this DVD. Thought I would try before I would buy. I enjoy Rodney Yee's AM section. His voice is calming and it's very relaxing but he doesn't hold the poses very long. Suzanne Deason's voice is annoying and she is like \\"Speedy Gonzalez\\" ... waaay too fast to relieve any stress. Did nothing for me. Patricia Walden's PM was too difficult. Again, too fast! She doesn't tell you how to change the positions. I didn't find it very relaxing. I'm happy I only rented this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The All-Day Yoga Workout-A.M., Stress Relief, and P.M. Yoga","review":"Bought this DVD used but am taking it back. I'm fairly new to yoga--took 2 5-week sessions with an excellent instructor. I was looking for something to do at home when I can't make it to class. The poses were too fast in the stress relief segment and there was way too much use of the brick (she must have said brick a hundred times). The P.M. session was just too silly. Rodney Yee is good but the rest of the set is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beginning!!","review":"These 3 programs are short and easy to squeeze into a busy schedule; and they all leave you feeling great. There is a slight feeling of being rushed and not really being able to sink into a pose but that's how they stay within the 20 minute time frame. Sometimes I know I need to stay in a certian pose longer so I do and then rewind and pick up where I left off. All in all this is the best DVD (also avail in video) for a beginner. I have 7 others and I like this one the best & I use it the most. Namaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not for beginners!","review":"Each of the three workouts contain poses that are too difficult for beginners and some that could be very hard on the knees. The AM section doesn't give enough time for warm up before going into some severe stretches. Also, the instructors move through the poses too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scenic, but boring","review":"I am just beginning yoga and found this DVD quite beautiful but exceptionally boring. The yoga instructors are quite good and Rodnee is a peach, but both are not very athletic looking. Rodnee was nice to look at but had no personality. I hope they can get more exciting instructors to do the series over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the DVD Chapters","review":"To be able to skip the introductions, you need to be able to locate the Chapters on the DVD. I am making this note because it took me a bit to figure out where the Chapters were. (Wish they were on the Main screen!) From the Main Menu, go to the Bonus section, where you'll find the Chapters area. Then you can specifically pick which part of AM/Stress/PM you wish to begin with, skipping the introduction.I am making this note after reading a comment an earlier reviewer wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully shot, but needs more instructional detail","review":"The scenery in this DVD are gorgeous, but for a beginner it needs more detailed instruction and some of it just moves too fast. I like workout videos that are attractively filmed but for yoga I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of beauty for instruction. I was really looking forward to the stress relief workout but I can't get through it. Suzanne Deason might be a great yogi, but I'm having a hard time getting past her voice and find her direction had to follow. The \\"extras\\" on poses and props are good. Overall, a nice looking package but I had to get another DVD. This one just didn't give me enough of what I need right now - more detailed instruction and less distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Boring","review":"At times, it's nice to have a relaxing yoga session, but this one was boring. There are three different sessions to choose from, AM Yoga, Stress Relief & PM Yoga. All three were much too simple. The flowing poses in Stree Relief were nice but I didn't find them to relieve stress. If you're inflexible and new to yoga then maybe this would be suitable but if you have any yoga experience, pass on this one. Thankfully I was able to rent this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga you CAN do","review":"I highly recommend this program. I've been doing it for about 3 months. Totally on for about 1.5 months.. sparastically for about 2 weeks (and I missed the calm, so) I'm back to full on. I do only 1-2 work outs per day and NONE after 8pm.. They really get your 'chi' moving. I mistakenly did the PM yoga right before bed, and I was up until 3:30am!I've recently started a nother exercise program \\"Power90\\" and this Yoga series is the perfect compliment after each day's workout.. really targets tired muscles and relaxes them with out making your body feel ready for nighty-night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!!","review":"I just bought this yoga tape today -- and threw it away today too.

I am just concerned about the lead warning on the box stating to wash hands after handeling because lead is \\"known in the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects...\\". S'mores are generally eaten with ones hands so the use of lead in any children's product seems out of place. Otherwise they built a neat toy. And maybe they could have included a light bulb or found one that was not so hard to track down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible toy","review":"This is a horrible toy. First, the box is not clear that it takes a strange lightbulb to produce the heat. It requires a 60w small round bulb with a small base. Cannot be candle shaped bulb. Must be round.Next, in order to put the bulb into the smore maker you have to take a screwdriver and unscrew two screws. That removes the light base.There is a small metal can that looks like half of a soda can that most be placed over the bulb. It must be pushed down to expose the screw holes that hold the bulb to the maker.YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE BULB AND SODA CAN EACH TIME TO CLEAN THE UNIT IF YOU GET MARSHMELLOW ON IT.This is a horrible toy and it is not like an easy bake product.

I thought it would be a good idea seeing that it it snowy and cold outside and would love to have something warm and gooey to eat! We waited and waited and waited for the marshmallow to get brown and no luck. It was warm enough for my son to place on his chocolate square and melt it ever so slightly. He enjoyed it and asks to make them everyday! I did tell him that during the summer we will make them by campfire and that during that time it will go much faster and the marshmallow will be brown. I'm glad I didn't buy it and someone else did but when comes to a good reveiw it depends on who is using it, me or my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a microwave don't buy this toy!","review":"Hi, I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas.

This is a snapshot, if you will, of many of the giants fully formed, and some, like Gavin Bryars, in the larval stages of their genius, so it makes for a fascinating read. Nyman's prose is pellucid, and his explanations cogent. My dream is that Michael Nyman will someday return to update this book and offer some insights on the new, strange paths, experimental music has taken in the age of the personal computer, robotics and the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat superficial","review":"For me the most useful thing about this book is that it has a lot of score excerpts that are useful if you're teaching at a university with a poor library. In the last few years a lot of valuable primary source material and interpretive writing has become available in book form through publishers like Musiktexte, and in scholarly journals like 'Perspectives in New Music'. I think the book is a fairly superficial survey, and I know its often used in introductory courses, but I don't like to recommend it to undergraduates because it's not a model for good scholarship because of the lack of citations like footnotes or endnotes when information comes from other sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Garmin","review":"I bought the X9 to take to Afghanistan with me as a backup navigation tool. Fortunately I did not use it as a primary tool. First, when it arrived, the battery would not completely charge after the first charging. I was able to send it back to the supplier and received a replacement. When using the X9, it is slow to aquire satelites. The Garmin that I was using for primary navigation is much better, quicker and more reliable. After using the X9, mainly for a watch, it just stopped working after about 6 months. The display went blank. By that time, I no longer had the box or receipt. I sent Suunto a letter requesting some kind of support. They never replied. Buy a Garmin and save your money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unreliable!!!","review":"This watch has a many features relying on its GPS function. Unfortunately, the watch cannot pick up any of the signals for the GPS to work. Hence, it is only being used as a traditional watch. Even as an ordinary watch, it needs to be recharged every two weeks. Suunto's response to my complaint was that their new model X10 should work much better. (They declined my offer of trading in my X9 with cash difference for X10.) I did not expect a reputable company like Suunto to falsely advertise a product, let alone not stand by its product. Some of us risk our lives, e.g, military usage, relying on technology like GPS and will often assume that what company advertises is true. We can carry other GPS devices but I paid a lot of money for this watch to replace those devices. Suunto should be ashamed of its product inferiority and its product support or lack thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mill has a fatal flaw","review":"I never imagined I would splurge and buy a pricey pepper mill, but have always wanted a good one. But when I got a Amazon.com gift certificate, I couldn't resist. I like the idea of a ceramic grinding mechanism, adjustable grinding size, and heavy stainless construction. When it arrived, I filled it with peppercorns, and turned it 1/2 turn. It broke. The method for connecting the top of the mill to the stainless steel shaft is a weak plastic part. Since it came apart when it broke, I could see that I was lucky mine broke immediately, so I could return it. There is no way this mechanism would hold up for extended use. And when you pay this much for a pepper mill, you want extended use. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"G Mark","review":"Dvd cover is the most important and this one was ok.

Director Tony Scott lets nothing stand in the way of the action, yet still manages to present characters we care about and an intelligent story (screenwriter Mark Bomback) that clearly explains the factors that led to the disaster and the steps taken to rectify it. The result is an efficient, thrilling action picture that is easy to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Runaway train never comin' back...\\"","review":"Taking a cue or two from 1985's Runaway Train, Unstoppable is a breezy, flashy, yet undeniably entertaining Tony Scott vehicle. Scott favorite Denzel Washington plays a veteran train-man who, along with rookie Chris Pine, find an ordinary work day going straight down the toilet when an unmanned train carrying toxic chemicals rages through western Pennsylvania. Such things as story, character development, and even the laws of physics to a degree are inconsequential. Despite that though, Unstoppable somehow manages to work regardless. Washington and Pine are both insanely likeable, the action is wonderful, and the film is surprisingly suspenseful as well. Rosario Dawson is also on board as a driven operator guiding our heroes along, and she fares better than anyone else here other than our two heroes. All in all, Unstoppable is a fun blast while it lasts, and you can't really ask for much more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"A great movie for the whole family to watch.

But unlike Pelham, there's no crime story here unless you count criminal incompetence. What we do have is an exciting if slight workplace thriller, a mad dash across a mythical Central Pennsylvania after an empty train going full throttle toward a populated area--oh, yeah...It's also filled with dangerous chemicals.While the film has some nice touches, if seldom rises above a made-for-TV kind of plot. Though a far cry from some of Tony Scott's real turkeys (Domino comes painfully to mind) this director has done better work.

The obstacles and problems are all the sorts of things you'd get at a Screenwriters 101 course:- There is a train full of schoolchildren coming the other way.- The head boss corporate guy is trying to cover it up and/or cut corners.- There's a nice little town in the way that looks like Main Street 50 years ago and it's going to get wiped out.Although not a total train wreck (excuse the pun), I think director Tony Scott needs to step up his game."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than clowns from outer space","review":"Good acting, great cinematography, worst story line ever!

The continuity errors are ridiculous from the start and the fact that it is based on true events make the people involved seem like morons. Police shooting at a stop button on the train which is next to a fuel tank - genius. The only thing that could have made it worse would be for John Cusack to pop up with a 2012-esque performance.

I knew before watching \\"The Taking of Pelham 123\\" that I shouldn't like it, and I knew afterword that I probably still shouldn't have enjoyed it. The same is somewhat true here. The story is elevated because of the cast - Denzel Washington, as always, turns in a workmanlike performance. Chris Pine doesn't exactly stretch his acting legs, but he does fine as the new guy. It's never bad to have Rosario Dawson in your film. Plus, Kevin Corrigan's in this one. The story is pretty simple here, and there won't be a lot of surprises. It's probably worth 90 minutes of your time, though. The Blu-Ray picture quality was excellent. I won't comment on the sound quality since I am installing some new flooring and currently have the surround sound in storage - that said, I can only assume that would enhance the viewing.

It's not a great film but not completely horrible either.

As the name suggests this is about a train run amok laden with toxic chemicals and heading straight for a populated town. This is a movie where one can easily speculate the end but the film succeeds because it was partially based on real life experiences, the editing, action sequences and the direction stand out. The lead actors do not have much to do but play out the age old rookie and veteran roles. I could not take my eyes away from the screen; the last time this happened to me was when I watched \`Speed' many years ago.

Going into the theaters I was a little hesitant thinking that this might be as bad as Pelham 123, but I was dead wrong. This movie was, as my review title states, surprisingly amazing. To be honest, the plot line and characters are nothing amazing...just another textbook story. With that said, if you are a movie fan, you'll be able to excuse that for the cinematic mastery by Director Tony Scott.And of course, it is hard to pass up a movie with Rosario Dawson in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anticlimactic ending.","review":"Comment: Although this was a completely watchable movie, I found that it had an anticlimactic ending. I like to tell a little story that describes the endings of movies like this. Seems that there was this \\"bomber\\" flying over Germany in WWII. It suddenly is hit by flack that sends it hurtling toward the ground in flames. Everyone on board is screaming \\"we are going to be killed\\". Just as they are about to hit the ground a voice comes over the intercom and announces \\"it's OK lads... we are safe... we just ran out of gas...\\"!!!

While that song was no doubt beautiful, I never felt the need to buy one of their albums. But while browsing CDs the other day this CD caught my eye.. The nice blue cover, the tracklist, and the fact that it had a sticker advertising this as their last album all made it sound like it would be a worthwhile listen... And I was right. These 9 tracks all have incredible emotion and atmosphere. While I can't honestly say this is an album to dance to.. It is however a perfect CD for those late night drives, or maybe something to just chill to while thinking/homework.Bottom line, if you're looking for something hypnotic and rich with electronics... This album won't dissapoint.

I unfortunately found Orbital at the end, and man I'm bummed even so. The glory days of the 90's were not my era, but my love for techno and music in general is strong. This album, is beautiful. I hate to say it but besides this, I've only heard Orbital 1, Altogether, and Middle of Nowhere. What I have heard though, what I've listened to in complete musical bliss, is amazing. I'll leave the analysis of Orbital's career to the true fans. What I can say is that this album was made by a true musician. I bet some people are thinking, \\"Well duh, it's Orbital\\". You gotta realize, it's one of those things taken for granted. Who gives a sheet if there's no more albums on the way. This is true music."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but...","review":"i love orbital. i really and truely do, but am i most definitely more of a post-snivilization kida guy. for most fans the blue album is a blessing, becuase it is the one most like the green album since, well, the brown album. oh man i'm a nerd. anyhoo if you like old school orbital you will love this. however if you are more into snivilization and in sides, you will agree with me when i say this final album sounds like some dj remix of a u2 song. in conclusion, i love orbital so i love this album but it is difficult to recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"I have worn Thorlos for over 10 years.

Wearing Thorlos, therefore, is a therapeutic \\"treat\\" for my feet. I've owned several varieties of Thorlos. I have these walking mini crew socks in both black and white. They offer excellent cushioning. I really like the padded section that sits on top of your foot in these. That helps minimize stress and pressure on my feet, making workouts a little more comfortable.

If you weren't aware of Michael Servetus, then 99.9% of the population are your brethren. This book explores not only his theological genius, but also examines his invaluable contributions in fields as widely varied as medicine and cartography. His long lasting impact on our political and religious life is also explained in fascinating (and well documented) detail. The authors are gifted historians.It is this strength that also becomes the sole weakness of the book. The authors endeavor to capture the full historical context of the world in which Servetus lived. However, too much marginally relevant context is introduced, which in some cases served to detract from an otherwise great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"History keeps repeating itself.","review":"This is a tale of two rigid and megalomaniac men butting heads. 500 years hasn't changed human nature - that's for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is an excellent book, it gave us a compact and well written story about Miguel Servet and Calvino.Miguel Servet was assasinated for his way of thinking, again we have another great thinker killed because of his written thoughtsIt is fast paced and not only gave us the story but also a brief analysis of the political and religious situation of the era and the repercutions on the futureWell done Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Flames--a great history lesson","review":"Michael Servetus, burned at the stake as a heretic by John Calvin, shares the stage with Martin Luther, Francis I, Charles V, Voltaire, and many others.

It opened a whole cast of historical people who deserve mention, especially Miguel Serveto, and tensions orbiting the Reformation. Once again, we have history unleashed.This is an erudite and beautifully written book. The Goldstones give you wonderful glimpses in a world being overtaken by technology, that once unleashed there, is no going back. The printing presses cannot be denied, slipping out of people's control. This is the paradigm faced by all political and religious leaders who never seem able to integrate into their minds, the force of a sea change. Also it is seems the people of modern Protestantism (especially Geneva) still seem little embarrassed by being bamboozled by Calvin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, but not his best","review":"As always, Neil Gaiman has managed to concoct a compilation of superb, fantastical, and even slightly (very) insane stories. And I love them all.That said, there _are_ many things missing form this compilation. It's left too many unanswered questions -- and as much as we all love a mystery, some of these could have (and, in my opinion) should have been answered in the seven stories. Delirium's and Destiny's stories left me slightly confused and waiting for more, in particular. It felt like there was too much left unsaid.Endless Nights is still a wonderful read, but a little bit of the magic and enchantment in the original ten Sandman novels is gone. It's a book that enriches your knowledge, but SHOULD NOT -- under no circumstances -- be read before the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mite disappointing","review":"I spent a $15 gift certificate when I bought this book, so I ended up paying about $11 myself. While I love Gaiman's work, I have to say that I would not have spent $25 of my own money on it.I originally bought the comic book segment about Dream, and it was fabulous. I was disappointed when I discovered that the Dream segment is the best of the seven. The others, especially Destruction, Despair, and Destiny, left me wanting more.But the art is beautiful, and will be enjoyed by long-time Sandman fans. I recommend you visit your local comic shop and skim through it before deciding."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toy","review":"I bought this scooter for my daughter's 4th birthday. She loves it.

It is very small, has lots of frequencies to choose from (important if you live in a big city with powerful broadcasts on most available frequencies), has a cool light that lets you know it is working, charges the iPod while you listen and really has no drawbacks. If I had to pick one out, it would be that the cable attaches to the lighter plug from the side so in some cars where the lighter / accessory outlet is tough to get too, you may find the plug to be a tight fit. Not really a problem though.

It seems to balance out the sound for all types of music. By balance I mean the bass and treble are not blown out on either end. I plan on buying a bag for it because the built in handle seems like it would be difficult to hold if you are carrying more than one item besides the I-boom.

I think some of the poses transition too quickly on the 20 minute workout since as a beginner, I am unfamiliar with the basic poses and their names. The first thing in the morning workout is great because it provides a good introduction and very good stretches and adequate time to transition. The only thing I wish either or both of the workouts offered were stretches for neck and upper back area, which is primarily why I even considered trying out Yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really for Beginners","review":"This kit is a disappointment. The mat and strap are good. I thought the block would be made from a natural material. I feel Gaiam includes this dvd in the kit because they couldn't possibly sell it to 'beginners' - it would be returned as not suitable. There are previews for a dvd that is for beginners, but not this one and I do have some previous yoga experience. It would have been helpful to have some written instruction, descriptions, pictures, and suggestions included for what to do on the way to being able to achieve the poses in the dvd. There are also annoyances like not being told in advance what will be needed for the series like the strap and and a folded blanket in the a.m. yoga. This is not a quality product and could be quite discouraging to a novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend who was wanting to get into Yoga - this kit is pretty crappy for beginners. The instructor just goes from pose to pose, without giving you really any instruction on what you should be focusing on as far as your form (very important in yoga), goes through everything really, really fast; the mat is pretty thin - overall I would not buy another product from Gaiam - it seems slapped together without much thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"for starters","review":"for beginners this dvd is great. Rodney Yee speaks very coherent and explains the moves in a way that one does not have to look at the video this is very important. This is much better then other yoga dvds I have started and it is not hard to keep up with. Note, the beginners, other yogis may find this more stretch then yoga but Yee is obviously prepping a novice for yoga, which I was. The training is very easy to master and is meant to regain flexibility before you put it to yoga.

You cut paper very, very thinly and then write \\"Hershey Kiss\\" in blue. Really.My kids enjoy practically everything. They are hugely uncomplicated. And they were very sad about this toy.

However, there is one serious problem with this device and that is the quality of the carafe. It's made from almost paper thin glass and the slightest little bump in the wrong area will create a glass fracture which envariably leaks from then on. And the replacement is so very expensive which leads me to think the Braun Company is in the business primarily to profit from their after market sales of carafes.

It is under a covered porch, so it doesn't get wet. We rarely have visitors that use the doorbell, so it was quite a shock to me that when I tested it, it wouldn't work. I replaced the batteries in the chime unit and the button unit, still nothing. Since I know a little bit about electronics, I removed the circuit board from the button unit and used a meter to find out which leads on the switch were used to activate the transmitter. When I shorted out those leads with a pair of tweezers, the doorbell rang. So it is definitely a bad switch. I agree with the opinion that this button unit is poorly designed. I'm not happy that it went bad in such a short time and with so little use, but I am going to buy a new button unit rather than spend a lot more to buy a whole new doorbell system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 80's East Coast Hardcore","review":"This is Eerie Von's (Samhain/Danzig Bass player) first band,and if you like 80's Hardcore Punk, like Minor Threat, Bad Religion,and the Bad Brains, this Disc is for you.Songs are short, fast and to the point.

Windclan, one of the four clans of the forest, has gone missing, and Fireheart and his best friend Graystripe are dispatched to find and bring them back. Tensions are starting to mount between the remaining clans - Riverclan and Shadowclan see Windclan's departure as an opportunity to extend their hunting grounds.

For instance, in the story, the cats travel in a group, and that's just like military people, they also walk and travel in a group. Also this story gives some cat facts, like the cat sniff to smell other cats scent, and that's how they know their enemy.

Otherwise, I say... stay away.My nieces, nephews and oldest daughter are thinking I'm pretty lame for buying this game.Good luck getting \\"Happy Points\\" & \\"Mullah\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"OWN IT, LOVE IT RECOMMEND IT!!!","review":"IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ADVERTISED AND WAS SHIPPED AND DELIVERED ON TIME...WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?

I'm giving it two stars because it is a rather uninspired biography. Sikov's writing style is somewhat annoying. He sometimes seems to be trying to be funny or he makes stupid political statements that are not called for or needed in the book. As far as I can make out his portrayal of Sellers as a complete nut is accurate. My favorite work of Peter Sellers are his Pink Panther films. Too much is written about what the movies Seller's worked on are about, then details of the making of these movies. It was interesting to read what Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk had to say about him, but all in all it is a sad portrait of a very bizarre person who had a great gift and ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Note Eddie","review":"Mr. Sikov biography of Peter Sellers bleats its way between celeb dish and tawdry detail. Gossip and the word \\"emponymous\\" fill the empty space between plot summaries of Sellers work. If you're interested in learning more about Mr. Sellers, watch him work. If you're more interested in what Liza and the gang have to say, pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disapointment.....very big","review":"I love Peter Sellers and all his movie work. This book does a great disservice to my memory of him. I really wish I hadn't started to read it. Did not finish the book and have no intention of doing so. Sometimes \\"warts\\" are best left alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Future Lite","review":"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom was a quick, fun read, with a great premise: death is optional. Unfortunately, this puts a heavy burden on the author, as some characters do get bored with being alive. Doctorow must then present us the reason one might stay alive (the so-called \\"meaning of life\\"). Though early on he hints promisingly that falling in love is a nice reason, both the protagonist and the woman he chooses (whose youth seems to be a real area of fascination) are so repellent as to make you stop caring whether either stays in love or alive.I hope though, that when people are widely able to Google the guy they just met in a bar from their bar stools, it's called \\"pinging their Whuffie.\\" Doctorow is certainly clever with words and ideas, but he'll need more interesting characters if he wants his books to endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, yet with wisdom","review":"It would be too simple to say it's a short sci-fi novel (clocks in at 200 pages), which it is. But Down & Out in the MK transcends the genre. It's a good story loaded with ideas. What impressed me most? Even though it takes place in a future when--among other advances-- people don't die (they just get \\"rebooted\\" from their most recent \\"backup\\")...the book's underlying theme is timeless: the depersonalization (for better or worse) caused by advanced technology. Fun read? Yep. But its wisdom takes the book to another, deeper level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just bought it...","review":"...after I had read it. Twice. Which is possible because Cory Doctorow lets us download the book plain text (or in what format have you) as a teaser from his site www.craphound.com.Which is a good thing, because otherwise I would have missed all the fun. The story is a classic tragedy, in a not so unbelievable future world where everything has gone P2P. Much future gizmo speak, but you get around that nicely. Also much word play, which helps to relate with the cast, and in particular the protagonist. Read it! And buy it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is an optimistic sci-fi here I've never seen before","review":"It wasn't until about half way through this book that I realized I was loving it. I think for the first half I just couldn't decide whether I even liked it.I mean in sci-fi I'm used to one of two things, either a bunch of grand space fighting aliens or super high concept future Earths of unlimited technology.What I am NOT used to, is a story about what Disney World might be like a couple hundred years from now.In a near-future where everyone has immortality and wealth is determined by respect (rather like \\"likes\\" on Facebook), the protagonist says Disney World should have the real rides we love, rather than advanced virtual reality. Even if it makes him so unpopular he drops to poverty. And of course his enemies want him silenced, even if they have to kill him (a frustrating, if not permanent, inconvenience).This book has a kind of optimism to its sci-fi I haven't seen before, and I really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish, not childlike","review":"The writing is imaginative, but incredibly childish and immature, and stretches out like a laundry list of the desires of an unpopular teenage boy. The conversations take place between what we're expected to believe are ultra-hip, super-cool people, but the dialog is so weak and strained it sounds like desperate teenage male ultra-nerd banter. The \\"romance\\" comes off as if the author has never had a serious relationship with a normal human female. Overall, although the world is large and unique, the characters and dialog are stereotypical of an immature, limited world view. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"really [weak] story that goes nowhere","review":"First, the good news about this book. It's a very quick and easy read. Unfortunately that is about the only good thing I can say about it.This story has no plot. The author seems so in love with his vision of a Utopian Networked Future, that he doesn't want to get it dirty with anything so mundane as real conflict. That is fine if you're building a dollhouse, but if you're a reader looking for a good story, look elsewhere. It is hard to care who care who controls DisneyWorld in the future. I kept hoping that the struggle for control of the Magic Kingdom would be about something bigger, more sinister. But if anything, this story is just a snapshot of what one guy hopes the future will look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This is a great read. If you dig Jim Munroe or early Neal Stephenson, then Doctorow is your man. A really solid first novel (and that alone is a rarity!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Hyped","review":"Unfortunately, I went into reading this book with high hopes. That, I think, led to my ultimate dissatisfaction. Other than whuffle (spelling? - i.e. eBay ratings applied to people, which I hope was meant to comically appear as technology gone awry), there are no really new groundbreaking ideas here. The storyline wasn't all that interesting and the characters were fairly one-dimensional. In the end, I really didn't care what happened to anyone. The book seems to be trying to combine the fantasies of a Disney and SciFi fan. Overall, I just felt it wasn't that interesting of a plot and just not all that well executed. Maybe that's just me though. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a big Disney fan, and even then, I wouldn't get your hopes up too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"It took me a while to make it through the first chapter,it seemed kind of dense. I'm glad that I kept reading on though, It just kept getting better and better. I liked the small Snow Crash reference later. A must read for anyone into the new age of Sci-Fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concepts better than the plot","review":"There are some good concepts in this book, but the plot was so flimsy in comparison I ended up not caring. It would have been a much better book with something grander than a power struggle over who manages the Haunted Mansion in Disneyworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not normally a sci fi reader, really like this book!","review":"Although I am not really into the sci fi genre I found a lot to enjoy. The writing was clever and pithy and the futuristic conventions were extremely interesting. I liked how he didn't go on and on explaining some of the futurist concepts but just let the context clarify what he means. (A society that has no money, just \\"Whuffie,\\" an instantly readable rating of a person's credibility. Creative and thought provoking).By the way, if you enjoyed the Walt Disney World and humor aspects of this book you might also enjoy Deep Water by SV Date."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Story, Less Concept, Please","review":"Nothing like reading a book that feels like the middle chapter of something. Too many out there concepts that were never explained so it was hard to care about what was happening to the characters or their choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Unsatisfying.","review":"This was three stories in one. The first was the story of where technology is headed. This part of the book is fascinating and thought provoking, even if some of the philosophical implications are dismissed too quickly. The second story is just a long-winded, fawning tribute to the Magic Kingdom. I like Disney World as much as anybody, but this just went on much too long without any real point. Finally it is a murder-mystery. While there is a bit of a clever twist here, it is extremely contrived and difficult to follow, and ultimately unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near-future story about the impact of a global reputation system and immortality","review":"Cory weaves a thoughtful story about the impact of a reputation system on an immortal society.A thought provoking story about how capitalism can be supplemented with a gift/attention economy.The protagonist is buffeted by the forces of the \\"whuffie\\" reputation system as he tries to compete against other \\"ad-hocs\\" in Disneyland. Various ad-hocs took over Disneyland (as well as the rest of the world) after the powers-that-be were ousted due to their inability to keep up with the creativity of self-selected enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, Poor Writing","review":"The thing with Cory is that he's a surprisingly bad writer, and he doesn't seem to know it. His writing is stiff, amateurish, and uninspired, and it sucks the life out of his (somewhat) interesting ideas.I am really not sure what kind of drugs critics are smoking, or what kind of payola may be involved. But regardless of what Entertainment Weekly says, whatever this newspaper or that magazine says, you shouldn't waste your money. Download it for free from Cory's site, read the first page, and look away in disgust -- this book is for people who think Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is great writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Great!","review":"Love, love, love this collection!

While I own the first 7 seasons on dvd, I am contemplating selling those of ebay or craigslist in order to buy this collection. The only thing holding me back from pre-ordering is the fact that it is not available in BLU-RAY. I just bought a PS3. Now that I have one, if I buy a movie or box-set, I want it in Blu-Ray when ever I can.I know that the Smallville has been available in HD for some time, and if they did not shoot all 10 seasons with 1080 resolution they can al teast re-master those seasons so as to include them in a Blu-Ray release of this box set...It really would be a bad bad business decision not to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"I got this box set for chrismas and got all the way to 6th season and then had problems with the disc.

My one-star rating is for the absolutely terrible packaging. The 62 DVDs come packed in two book-like containers. Each \\"page\\" has two DVDs in pockets which hold the disks so tightly that it takes considerable effort to pull one out -- they act as though they were almost glued in the pockets.

It is either too weak or too strong...very difficult to adjust. As for the carafe, I agree with the other reviewers. It broke just by placing it on a drying rack. The coffee maker is not what it's \\"cracked up\\" to be. My old Krups of 15 yrs. is more reliable and certainly better tasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best","review":"My first Braun 10 cup coffeemaker lasted 10 years. It didn't die; I gave it away. In shopping for a new maker, I found that they now all seemed to have an automatic shutoff feature. Most shutoff in 1 or 2 hours. This was terrible for me because I like to make a pot of really great coffee, and then drink it leisurely over a 3 or 4 hour period while working on my computer. I shopped and shopped and finally found the Braun KF-180. It made great coffee, the pot poured without dripping all over everything, and most importantly, it stayed on for 4 hours.Thanks Braun for thinking of us slow coffee drinkers who can't get rid of a pot in 1 or 2 hours. I loved this product so much I purchased it for my son and daughter, and needless to say, they love this product also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Coffee Maker","review":"Upon running a test pot of water through my brand new coffee maker I discovered a water leak coming from the base of the water reservoir level indicator. After further examination I discovered that the plastic nipple that the connecting tube attaches to on the reservoir was cracked. Probably due to poor assembly technique rather than a design flaw. That aside, I was surprised at the amount of steam generated by this coffee maker. It was so great that I had concerns about operating it under my kitchen cabinates for fear of damage. My previous 10 year old Braun never genertated this much steam. Because of my unit being defective and seeing how much steam it generates, I decided to return my maker and will look for another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coffee","review":"The flavor select switch can make even harsh, acidic coffee taste good by setting it to a weaker brew, which two other coffee makers couldn't. Easy to program, no bells and whistles overkill. I like that it filters the water, that it has a water level indicator and auto-brew timer, and that I can program after how many minutes/hours it shuts itself off. To improve it, the filter should be easier to lock into place. Sometimes it takes a few tries. Sometimes it swings back open in the middle of the brewing cycle, and that can get messy. I've tried locking it in gently, slamming it into place, and variations inbetween, but it's unpredictable. Looks locked into place, but may or may not be. Still, fabulous coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine is great - carafe is a nightmare","review":"I've owned the KF180 for two years. I have been satisfied with the coffee quality and features of the unit. The carafe, however, has made an otherwise positive product experience a negative one. I've had to replace the carafe 4 times due to cracks caused by water temperature differentials. I've owned several other units that use glass carafes and never have had to replace them. I've already spent as much on carafes for the KF180 as I spent on the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watery Coffee","review":"I'm writing this entirely to prevent anyone else from making the same mistake I did. That's my only motivation, it's a pain having to bother writing a review, especially a negative one. I bought this coffeemaker for my girlfriend's birthday after reading all the positive reviews. There was only one reviewer who said it made watery coffee and that he had confirmed with the manufacturer that it was designed to allow some of the water to bypass the filter and coffee and go directly into the carafe thereby effectively watering down the coffee. I was hoping he was mistaken. Unfortunately, he was right and Consumer Reports and all the other reviewers were wrong. It does indeed make watery coffee, even when set to the darkest/strongest setting. I took it back and got a Krups Aromaster instead which seems to work satisfactorily. Wish I had better news but forewarned is forearmed for the rest of you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe too Fragile","review":"The carafes are definitely not dishwasher safe. We've had two break in the dishwasher (yes, someone is a slow learner).

Sometimes this engages the shutoff and you just have to go back to the kitchen and hold the basket in place until enough water has gone through to lighten the basket, which is very annoying. Other times you end up with water and grounds all over the counter, dripping onto the floor. Yay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor value, buy extra carafes, they break frequently","review":"Very poor value for this coffee maker by Braun. Since Gillette bought Braun, they have subscribed to the razor blade method of making money...lose money on the initial coffee maker order, but make it up on replacement carafes. I have to replace at least one of these per year...sometimes two. I am very careful with hand washing etc. They are just made very, very poorly. Wafer thin glass.

The thing that pisses me off the most is that he DOES have talent but doesn't use it (often)! Rarely will he change it up and then you'd be like \\"whoah, that's tight.\\"I am a fan of Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, Dream Theater, Primal Fear, Edguy, and other power/progressive metal bands that have beautiful clean vocals, but this album just gays it up.The instrumental is pretty alright, though.

Just something that sounds like it. Don't get me wrong, the material he covered from Seeger influenced music is fine, not my favourite, but he covers it ok.

We have Windows ME, which the game works on, but didn't work on newer operating systems and even crashed one of grandpa's computers, causing him to comment, \\"Wow, this game is reallly old.\\" Well, that's relative, but once we got it loaded on the ME computer it has provided endless entertainment for our 10-year-old genius and battle strategizer. He figured out the controls and rules quickly. When I sat down to look at it, I couldn't find my troops and gave up! I especially like the different bugle calls b/c I spend most of my time \\"listening\\" to my son play the game rather than watching/playing. It's wonderful battle history and tactical instruction.

I love his voice, and he and his music sound better live than prerecorded. I have seen him in concert 4-5 times and have had the opportunity to meet him. If you have not had the chance to see/hear him live, then this CD is a close second to being able to do that. A nice thing about the CD is that his comments are at the end of each track, so you can just skip forward to the next song if you don't want to hear the talking each time you play the CD.Some of Michael's best songs are on this CD. Many of them feature a guest vocalist or musician, which you may or may not enjoy. I personally love the album. The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that he didn't introduce one of the guest vocalists, Sarah Groves. Perhaps he didn't do this because, as he said live at a concert, she needs no introduction. It's great to hear her awesome voice on a couple of the songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depth of Meaning","review":"I'm fairly conservative in my musical taste.

NOX reminds me so much of those great Japanese rpg's that I used to play on my msx I am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it.NOX is a much more hands-on rpg in contrast with FF VIII and as such much more enjoyable. Where as both games are quite linear NOX gives you much more freedom of movement with lots of hidden areas to find and explore.the only drawback is that the real-time fighting sometimes feels a bit hit and miss and lacks the strategic feel of turn based battle.However I found this to be the only drawback and if you have completed FF VII(7), which is so much better than the follow up, I strongly recommend this game.CheersShaft"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Game","review":"This game was excellent and fun to play. The game from Westwood has you choose from being a wizard, conjurer, or warrior, and fight off Hecubvah and her evil necromancers.The game has good graphics and it keeps you busy playing it. You can play the solo and defeat Hecubah or you can go online and play with other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Diablo","review":"This game is very similar to Diablo. It does pretty much everything Diablo does slightly better, though. The plot is more interesting, the graphics are better (than Diablo I), the spells are better, the monsters are generally more interesting. Most importantly, the interface is better -- especially when it comes to casting spells. I always found spell casting in Diablo just awkward enough to make the mage classes less fun than the fighters; here, spell casting is easy to do and extremely satisfying.I really wish Nox had been more influential. I played Diablo clones for years without coming across any that I enjoyed as much as Nox, and only ones as recent as Torchlight have had interfaces that seemed this slick."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Better Wait....\\"","review":"I bought Nox since it looked decent, but was not happy with the game. The reasons are that it brings almost nothing new to RPGs, and does not have enough innovation to keep me playing. Sure it has dynamic lighting, but the pixels are as big as a ultralisks aft orifice. After playing the game for two months I could not understand why some many magazines gave such a average game tons of \\"above average\\" reviews. Totally linear gameplay combined with a pathetic disney sense of humour make this game a 'bring me back'. Considering the amount of time Westwood took to get Nox to the markets many people who bought the game will soon clear some surplus space of their hard drives since you will not get obsessed with it. Tough Luck Westwood..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"After reading rave reviews for this game I was very eager to buy a copy and play it. Unfortunately I found the game did not live up to my expectations. I found Nox to be little more than a mouse \\"click fest\\". Much too linear and repetitive! In single player mode the protagonist is delivered to an area and the player clicks madly on their mouse until the area is completed. If you are looking for a CRPG I suggest you look at Planescape: Torment or wait for one of the upcoming offerings from Black Isle."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game","review":"this is one of the neatest games I've played.

Something as simple as Diablo, but with a story, an immersive world, and a few unique twists (like the conjurer class). However, after a couple of hours I was quickly proven wrong. Combat eventually deginerated into what could best be described as a mideval whack-a-mole. The challenge of combat boils down to this: try to get your mouse to center over a rapidly moving target, while healing and/or trying not to get hammered. Some of the enemeies moved some damn fast, I literally spent an hour running around in a circle while trying to hit this equally fast thing with a few dozen spells. Eventually I figured out the trick then that makes all combat trivial (no spoiler here). Then I felt no desire to finish the game. Wait for Diablo 2.

It is raw, exciting, hard, fast, driving metal and has to be played REALLY LOUD with the bass cranked up to make any sense. It's darker, meaner, and somehow has a more sinister feel than the band's later and more popular stuff. It also has a cruder feel to it, which is part of its appeal. It seems to capture that energy that bands put into their debut albums - the first from The Clash springs to mind - though the two are completely different musically. However although I am giving it 5 stars I am not sure that American audiences will find it to their taste. It is one to take a chance on. But I recommend you do.Technically the CD offers good quality audio - anything has to be better than my 27 year-old vinyl copy. I still can't make out what Lemmy is saying, but that is a reflection on his hoarse and gravelly vocals, not the CD. Lemmy is no typical screaming heavy metal frontman. As another reviewer said \\"Bon Jovi it isn't.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the die-hardest of the diehard fans.","review":"What's weird is that this album does have three completely stellar tracks: \\"Motorhead\\", \\"Iron Horse\\" and \\"The Train Kept a-Rollin'\\". These are absolutely worth having, so get them on No Sleep 'Till Hammersmith**. If you do, you'll not only get much better versions of these three songs, you'll have a great live sampler of early Motorhead. A debut album can be a good place to start for a collection, however the other tracks on Motorhead are nothing like what you'll find right after, on Overkill or Bomber, and the recording and production are as bad as it gets. Even \\"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\\" on this album just makes me cringe. You should be a rock solid veteran Motorfan before you consider buying this one. **Double check the edition. \\"Train Kept a-Rollin'\\" comes as a bonus track on the 2001 metal-Is Records edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negrita Rocks","review":"If you don't know Negrita, this is a good CD to start off with. Their music is rock with a good bass beat to give it kick. Think along the lines of GreenDay, AC/DC, Goo Goo Dolls, (I don't like giving comparative band names because everyone's opinion on music is different) but, within the Italian rock artists, they are one of the best. Far from traditional \\"Italian\\" style music (like NEK, L.Pausini) they resemble more of the American rock bands singing in Italian. If you also have the advantage of understanding their words, the humor and criticism of small-town life is amazing! It's definitely one of my favorite italian CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advice for a novice","review":"I am a novice robot builder.

Like \\"Martern aller Arten\\", which arouses thoughts of other coloratura roles. The high notes in this piece, which are astonomically high mind you, are the most powerful I've ever heard. Of all pieces, this, unfortuanetly, is the only true one of coloratura proportions. She needs to record more!! I see a possible \\"Caro Nome\\" or yes even a \\"Sempre Libera\\". The \\"Porgi Amor\\" and \\"Ach, ich fuhl's\\" are both too heavy for Mcnair, this is why I only give four stars. The \\"Deh Veni\\" and \\"Dove Sono\\", though, are just perfect for her voice.

The best way to play with this toy is against a wall, that seems to solve the tipping over problem, she can also unattach the fridge and the sink so that they are not so close together. The main problem with it is that its well made durable plastic which is heavy and its thin to be compact the two together make for a bad combo, its kinda top heavy. I don't regret buying the toy because out of everyhing she got her AND her 4 yr old brother play with this the most. They really like it and while I would like for it to be made better what matters is that she thinks its cool and plays with it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've got enough space buy a more durable kitchen set","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. She's almost 3 now and she still plays with it occasionally, but the 3 main pieces fall apart every time she uses it. The whole thing is very flimsy and gets knocked over all the time. We are short on space in our house so I liked the compact size and the wheels on this product. I purchased it despite negative reviews. My daughter does enjoy playing with it when it's in one piece, but she gets frustrated with it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, horrible execution","review":"I bought this for my daughter's fifth birthday after seeing it in a magazine. She had been begging me for a kitchen, but I told her no as we didn't have the space for it. When I saw this toy, I thought what a great compromise,a kitchen for her and space for me! Boy was I wrong! It will not stay together at all. Everytime she opens it, I have to snap it together for her. She has had it for less than two weeks and hates it now. On the upside my 16 month old son loves carting it around so it's not a total waste of money. For christmas, I'm just going to make room and get a regular kitchen set for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"i brought this toy for my daughter she is 2 years old. It would be fun if it didn't fall apart. It falls over very easy and the parts fall off very easy. Every time she opens the toy it comes apart. She would like to play with it but she can't because everything comes apart. Same your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"My daughter received this for Christmas. We were very disappointed! She is 18 months old and loved pulling it behind her, but when it came time to open it up it was all downhill....It was hard for her to open because the latch was pretty tight. Once I would get it open for her, she would get frustrated because the drawers are hard to open. You have to press on the drawer and then pull. The product was not sturdy at all. It would constantly tip over. When it would fall, the sink would fall off, and the fridge and stove pieces would fall apart. We ended up taking it back because of the poor construction and durability. I refuse to have to put a toy back together over and over again!I wonder if Playskool every tested this product with children before rolling it out on the market. It is a shame because it is a cute idea and my daughter seemed to really be interested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design; not very fun","review":"The kitchen does not stay together well.

The concept is adorable, but it continuously falls apart while she plays. It is not made to withstand any play without totally disassembling. It now stands in a corner of our Family Room totally closed up and never played with. At least in this position it doesn't fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I thought this would be a great toy. I have found it is very very frustrating! It falls over. I thought it would have something to help the stability - seeing that it is made for kids. I think saving your money for any other kitchen play toy will be the best use of your hard earned cash. It looks cool - but does not stand up in real life play time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy terrible toy that only frustrates","review":"This toy is poorly constructed and constantly falls apart. My toddler was very excited to have this toy but any interaction with it would end in tears and frustration. The kitchen doesn't stand up very well; the sink falls off as do other parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CONSTRUCTION! DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"My review is pretty similar to the others here --- while this toy seems very cute and does keep my 3-year-old entertained with washing the dishes, it CONSTANTLY comes apart. She cannot open the oven door or the refrigerator door on her own, and most times she can't even open the toy up to even play with it. It is so wobbly and always falls over - not a good thing when you're supposed to put warm water in the sink so they can \\"wash\\" the dishes. No matter how small an amount of water, what good is it if it tips over? I would definitely not recommend purchasing this. We are saving our money to buy her one of the larger kitchen sets. This toy is horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS REVIEW-dont buy this!","review":"OK- I had seen this in both Wal-mart and Target and thought it was adorable and knew my 2 1/2 year old daughter would just love it. I went to amazon.com and read all the reviews, all of which I read stated how hard it was for little children to open the stove, and fridge- also that it tipped over all the time. I went back and forth on buying it, and finally did purchase it anyway deciding to brave the reviews...well guess what? When she opened it on Christmas morning, it tipped over within seconds, she could not open any of the doors by herself so was very frustrated to say the least. The thing comes apart in 3 pieces, does not stay together at all! I didnt listen to the other reviews...Listen to this one! Don't buy it! This toy was a great idea or would have been if Playskool worked out a few things first! Don't waste your time with this prduct because you will waste your time putting it together over and over, and picking it up over and over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"These are feeble metal. There is no cover for the screen, or click wheel. Does not protect against even the shortest of falls. Easily breaks. I had mine for 2 weeks, then it fell apart.

This is over acted for sure. And, the costume/hair of Ralph is ridiculous. Someone should have fixed his hair color. I don't get that.The movie does have a good moral story, and if you haven't seen the first one, it's okay. Kids will like it.I think on it's own, it's okay. And, if you like any kind of Christmas movie, it's worth having. But, I don't think I can handle a 24-hour playback like the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Story 2","review":"It was alright, not as good as the first.

We have even been to the house in Cleveland, Ohio and I have a full size leg lamp. On the other hand, this movie is HORRIBLE! I had an extremely open mind about it and was really looking forward to getting it, but it was awful! The actors tried too hard to portray the original characters and failed miserably at it. I don't believe there was a lot of creative thought put into making it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"Not up to the original but so funny,especially when he works in the Higbee Department Store.

I have listened to hundreds of hours of Shep's radio shows and read hisstories and NONE look or sound like that trailer. The leg lamp never came backin any story I ever heard and though I remember Shep talking endlessly about hisfirst cars, I do not ever remember anything as silly happening as in that trailer.I worry greatly that this story is simply trying to make money off the legend ofShep and the original Christmas story. Seriously, Shep is legendary for his endlessstories over almost 20 years at WOR radio in NYC-- I can not believe that no onecould adapt some of those stories for an actual script based on his work. I willmake a final judgement on just how lousy this sequel is after I see it.

I can only assume that Daniel Stern gave his soul to the devil because why would a talented actor take a role like this and mold the beloved Old Man in the original to an extremely vulgar and argumentative slouch.And Ralphie...well, for some reason, they chose an actor with brown eyes and very badly dyed blonde hair. Were there no other actors with blonde hair and blue eyes to play this part? And how does Ralphie's mom afford botox? Was it even available back then?The movie is so devoid of any originality that the same gags from the first movie were rerun.

The actors had zero screen presence, a big contrast to the original movie where every character seemed to steal the scene.

When I heard there was going to be a sequel released directly to DVD, I knew I had to buy it. When looking at the description on Amazon, I noticed several negative reviews. Upon reading them, I noticed some were written even before the DVD was released, so I figured we would give the movie a chance. Boy, were we disappointed! None of us liked it. The actors tried too hard to be like the original characters and, bottom line, it was poor acting. Some scenes, while a little funny, were too far-fetched to be believable. And considering it was a family film, the profanity was unacceptable. Unlike the original movie where the father was always humorously spouting off obscenities (and you really couldn't understand them), the swearing here seemed forced. Save yourself time and money. Don't bother buying or even renting this movie; stick with the original and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very decent sequel!","review":"As a major fan of the first \\"A Christmas Story\\" I was very reticent about a sequel especially so many years from the first. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and story line of this story. Daniel Stern does a good job filling the shoes of Darren M. Braeden Lemasters is a very believable 16 yo Ralph (good job Braeden!) Nate Maulid as the Narrator is as close to Jean Shepard's Adult Ralphie as one could hope. The story as well as acting are a very good match to the original (which did not do well at the Box Office itself). I have read reviews from people who refuse to see #2 which I find idiotic and anyone who heeds to such reviewers is truly missing out on another fun and nostalgic Holiday classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Original is Best","review":"This was a gift for a true fan of the original movie.

It was funny in the original movie \\"A Christmas Story\\" when the father went down into the basement, cursing his head off, or when Ralphie said a bad word somewhere near the middle of the movie, but the funniest part was, not hearing the actual words. The makers of this movie seem to have missed that part of the humor and think that shock value is greater than implied suggestive material.

No weaknesses here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless bliss of jazz","review":"Mr. Davis provides an array of sounds matrimonially arranged. His passion of his music speaks for itself and he is in a class of his own. Though his style does reflect some of the forefathers of jazz, such as Miles Davis and Duke Ellington, Mr. Davis' music keeps you coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"We found the box easy to put together, but the part that controls the lid was too stronge for any child to get back down. We had to buy a new one. Can't tell about the durablity since we just bought it for our grandchild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe safety hinge","review":"We loved the form and function of this toy box until we attempted to install the safety hinge. Once it was installed, we had to put our entire weight on the lid to get it down and the pressure caused the screws to begin ripping out of the wood. Since we cannot have our 2 year old use it without the safety hinge, we had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I also ignored the other reviews and purchased this box. The weight of the lid pulled the hinge right out of the wood, which didn't install too easily in the first place. The press board was too weak to drill new holes, so you're left with a heavy lid that slams down if not held. We'll be taking this back to the store tomorrow. Sadly, it looked really cute in the nursery but my daughter only recently started walking and showing an interest in it, so the hinge problem didn't become obvious for a while. If I could give zero stars, I would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hinge tricky but great service","review":"We bought this toy box after shopping many places. I wanted something that was versatile and safe. The one on display looked nice, but we noticed the saftey hinge missing and ripped up holes in the lid. We assumed it was damage from careless customers. The box went together easily except for the hinge. The picture in the instruction sheet is somewhat misleading. We put the hinge on incorrectly causing the screws in the lid to pop out. Just like the display did. I called the manufacture. They emailed photos on how the hinge should be attatched. Only now the lid was damaged from before. They are mailing me a new lid for free! GREAT SERVICE! Before installing hinge I would suggest calling company and asking for the photos to avoid the confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toybox, need to get safety hinges","review":"This toybox is great. We got it for our daughters toys and it looks cute. We read that the safety hinges are a joke so we bought a good quality one from Home Depot and it works very well with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for young kids!","review":"We got this toybox as a gift. It is very sturdy and looks nice but it is not safe. When putting it together (which was easy until...) the safety hinges would not go in correctly. Once in and the lid closed the wood ripped. After drilling new holes and re-installing the \\"safety\\" hinges the lid will not close all the way and bobs at about 4 inches open. Way too easy to get fingers pinched in that!! We are taking this one back to the store. The lid is far too heavy to have without safety hinges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dangerous and unsafe toybox! Please do not buy!","review":"When we first bought this toy box, it was perfect. Until the lid suddently slammed down on the head and arm of my 3 year old, and onto the arm of my 6 month old daughter. They were both injured by this toybox when the \\"safety\\" (ha!) hinge gaveout without warning. If you own this toybox, PLEASE remove the lids for your childs protection. If you are considering purchasing this toybox, please don't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely unsafe!","review":"I bought it despite the reviews. It looks great... my daughter has gotten hurt so many times w/ it, we put it in basement for storage. THe top lifts and falls without any resistance. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL TOY BOX","review":"We bought this toy chest to store a few toys in. I saw it in the store and both samples that were out were broken, that should have been a sign, but I thought it was cute. Anyway my husband spent some time putting it together and the minute it was put together it broke when we tried to close the top. Also the back of it did not stay on we had to nail it in. I do not reccomend this toy chest at all, it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks..............literally","review":"I love the look of this toy chest and was pleased when I received it off of my registry. However when my husband and I were putting it together I was overwhelmed by the paint fumes. The smell was so bad I made my husband open up the windows and air out the room. Needless to say I may have been hypersensitive to smells because of the pregnancy, but it took 2 days before the chest stopped stinking up the nursery. Also the safety hinge is a joke. It does not work and ripped right out of the wood as soon as I opened it to place toys inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the cutest little toy box. My daughter loves it!!!!!","review":"We bought this toy box because it was the only white sturdy wood toy box that we could find. I am so glad I purchased it. It wasn't that hard to put together in my opinion. I also have all white furniture in my daughters room, so this worked out perfect for us. We got the little white Toddler bed, and it all matches so perfectly in her room. I hope it will be a piece of furniture that she will use as she grows into a teenager. Awww the thought of her growing up..........hehe. It's worth every penny!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes you don't want the best brush","review":"Humbrol brushes are way better than these. They hold a better line and last longer. But sometimes you just want to splash paint, or douse solvent quickly, or wipe off dirt. And if you just want a cheap, reasonably sturdy, and utterly disposable brush, you couldn't do better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality, Low Price","review":"These brushes are very basic, but that is a good thing in this case. They haven't shed at all, produce fine lines when handled correctly, and are easy to clean."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},C={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(o(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(W,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-df601493"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/24.md","filePath":"sponsor/24.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/24.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
