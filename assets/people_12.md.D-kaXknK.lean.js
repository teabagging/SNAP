His three books changed the way I think about presenting information, and added the invaluable term \\"chartjunk\\" to my vocabulary. I was enormously excited to learn that he had written about Powerpoint and could hardly wait to lay my hands on the publication. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait.To those thinking about buying this booklet (28 pages) let me save you the expense by summarizing it:PowerPoint slides don't have much information in them, and you're limited to a sequential presentation order.That's about it. His booklet is an extended indictment of the limitations of PowerPoint. Anyone interested in suggestions for Powerpoint improvements will find a refernce on the last page in a postscript to read the third chapter of his book, Visual Explanations, or visit his web site.Do that instead of reading this booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Tufte, but......","review":"Basically, this is an elegant set of arguments against using Power Point.... for anything. Everything that Power Point users hold near and dear are torn apart in this short treatment.The problem is that Tufte offers no way to use Power Point more effectively, except as a \\"low resolution slide projector.\\" So, if you want to bash Power Point and are not looking for ways to improve your PPT presentations, this is the book for you.I bemoan the wholesale conversion of lecture slides and overheads to Power Point for no particular reason other than to \\"become contemporary.\\" But paying even $8.00 for the privilege of being told not to use Power Point is probably not what most instructors have in mind.Spend a little more on The Visual Display of Quantitative Inormation and have something that truly teaches you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Constructive Criticism","review":"Tufte is an gifted analyst and communicator, but seems to have taken the easy way out on this publication.

For me, the story concentrates not in a comic book hero with no faults, but in a good intelligent and very kind person who happens to be an alien with special powers. The decision to use those powers to help rather than to hurt makes him maybe a little unrealistic for these times we are living in, but I love watching the series and believing for a short time, that we can be better and nicer, and that the world could be a better place if we were a little more like him.Most episodes are very well written, the chemistry between Lois and Clarke es terrific, and Clarke\`s parents are delightful, especially his mother, who is intelligent and funny.

I just noticed, while watching Season 2 that the DVD has had some minor edits. The ending of the final episode of Season 2 is edited to where at the end Clark asks Lois an important question. Originally, Lois responds with her own question that ends in a rather cliff ending remark for the season. On the DVD, however, the final episode of Season 2 ends with Clark's question, which if you've never seen the show will leave you with less anticipation. The editing like this is petty and really brings down the onset of Season 3. But none the less, it's still worth the money you'd pay for the dvd, just keep in mind the actual ending and you can sense the anticipation we all had in 1996."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season Two Better than Season One","review":"Wow!

When the beginning & end smartly dovetail into each other. When the humor for the most part inspires audible responses. And when one actually cares what the characters will face next, & how they will respond. But mostly the best sign is the book gets better & better as it goes along. Make you wonder where that will lead to, & if the author will have to courage to keep digging that path in futures tales.

Lovano, whose playing is rooted in the bebop tradition, here pays homage to his roots, and with so much heart and beauty and wit!This is easily going to be among the absolute top jazz albums of the year!If you're looking for beauty, classic elegance, lush arrangements, swing, cool phrasing, great songs and originality, look no further.

They gave me a runaround and passed me between departments, many times hanging up on me. Finally after another 2 months they told me that they were looking for a rebuild Ipod to give me as a replacement (The warranty clearly states that the replacement should be new). I wanted a new Ipod; as that was what the warrantee called for. After a few more calls they said they would issue a check for what I paid minus the shipping.

Many producers were simply scared to confront difficult material; they preferred instead to rehearse established conventions of white supremacy and/or 'redemption' associated with moving to the north of America from the 'unsophisticated' South. Graham's work represents a considerable effort of research, but her writing-style is unnecessarily prolix. She manages to make suggestive subjects sound rather mundane; this is due to a tendency to repeat herself, as well as using long rambling sentences. I can't help feeling that this is something of a missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure To Read","review":"I read this book when it was first published in hardback, perhaps 20 years ago and I am delighted, but not surprised, to see that it is still in print.If you are a fan of good writing and you think you might be interested in kites then get this book.

Now it's dead.","review":"I was excited to get a \\"one click\\" blender.After less than 6 months, it stopped working. I press the on/off button and it does nothing.Also, when it was working, it would sometimes blend in a single cycle and sometimes it would take five minutes of pressing, and shaking the contents to get it to blend evenly and smoothly!I think the \\"swirl factor\\" is wrong because it's not sucking down the ingredients like my old $20 blender did.Update: When I contacted Oster about it, they sent me a new one right away and it's still working. Also, I think the swirl is a tad better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"When I pulled the blender out of the box the silver metal overlay on the buttons was peeling up. I thought, no big deal, just cosmetic, if it works as well as it is supposed to who cares, I'll just super glue it down. It worked perfectly the first time. After that I couldn't get the glass jar to fit in the base correctly. Then it quit pulling ingredients down into the chopping blades so I had to stop it and push the ingredients down several times during blending. Sometimes the buttons won't shut off during blending so I have to unplug it. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD...Returning it tomorrow!","review":"As many before me have said. When this machine is on one of the programed cycles, it sounds like a jet is taking off in my kitchen. Honestly I have never heard anything so loud before come from something so small. I thought when I read other reviews about the noise, that maybe those people were just \\"Picky\\" and that it would be okay. Well....it is not! It seriously sounds like it is about to explode! Not to mention it could not even chop up cashews. A very soft nut. Yet I am supposed to believe it will chop ice? I then tried to blend a Yogurt smoothie and it would not blend. Pushed everything up the sides and just spun out of control mixing air. I had to do what I did with my old machine and constantly remove the lid and push all the ingridiants back down with a large spoon. Waste of $70+. I am returning mine tomorrow. This was such a waste of money and time because I now have to ruturn this piece of junk. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"I used this blender for the first time and it worked just fine. I went to use it the second time and it plainly wouldn't blend anything. Wouldn't crush ice, wouldn't pull the ingredients down for mixing as advertised - nothing. The blades spun like crazy, the blender made a whole lot of noise, yet nothing was happening. I tried taking it apart and putting it back together, thinking I had done something wrong after washing the parts, but that didn't change anything. Finally I had to blend 1-2 ingredients separately, several times each, then mix them all together and blend again before I was able to have a smoothie. 15 minutes of work for something that should take only seconds? This blender is absolute garbage.From the other negative reviews it sounds like this was bound to happen sooner or later. I suppose I should be thankful that it happened sooner - i.e. within Target's return window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"My husband gave me this blender for Christmas. The glass part never fit well into the base and I had to hold it down while blending. The other day I made a smoothie and took a sip and realized it was full of small black plastic bits!

This was the only blender I could find yesterday that met those criteria, and didn't cost over $200. So far, it has made one batch of smoothies, and performed well. I will update after I have owned it for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this blender! It's defective!","review":"I purchase one in June 2007. By November it quit working; it would just not turn on. I complained violently to Oster and they sent me a replacement unit and by April that unit crapped out with the same problem. I have had several Oster blenders over the years and they all have failed prematurely. Their quality is horrible and they obviously don't care.

It worked fine for a few weeks and then for no reason, the first 2 speeds quit working. Only the highest speed works and it is so loud I have probably ruined the entire family's hearing using it. When it is working, it works great other than the noise, but I had my old blender for 20 years and I don't think a blender should stop working properly this quickly or be so unpleasantly loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adapter for food processor broke after 5 months","review":"My food processor portion broke after about 5 months when it started making a loud screeching noise and the food processor blades stopped turning.

Worked pretty well during those 3 weeks until it suddenly just stopped working completely. Would not even turn on. I of course had thrown the receipt and manual away (stupid me). Oster doesn't even have this model's user manual available online. My only option for warranty work requires that I ship the blender (at my expense) to a 3rd part repair shop with my receipt (which I don't have). So, I'm out of luck and I have a $50 paper weight.

It is definitely living up to its reputation, as it blends large pieces of frozen fruit with ease, requiring little to no stirring. I also did not want a bulky appliance that is too large to store or take out, since I use this everyday. And when it is on my counter, it is a nice looking appliance. Also, the container is glass and the base is heavy duty. I avoid using plastic and will not put it in my dishwasher, so this container is healthy and easy to clean. The Vitamix is bulky, plastic, and 4x the price of this blender, and I think this one actually might be better!

The 15 page booklet contains information on each artist and the song they perform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four-and-a-half too low","review":"This album is worth more than five stars. Four and a half stars is too low. We played it so long out of the box we got tired of it. But now we're playing it again and liking it more than the when we first bought it.

For about $100, this camera is a steal! The picture quality is as good as HP, maybe even better! The camera feels strudy, the controls are easy to use and the menus very simple. Whats more, Kodak gives a one-year limited warranty. (HP gave only a 3 month warranty!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AS EASY AS PIE!","review":"I just recently purchased this camera because I bought a more expensive model with lots of &quot;Goodies&quot; on it and was very dissapointed with that model.

Kodak came through for us again..thanks Kodak!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Camera","review":"I bought this camera because this one is very cheap instead of others, when the camera arrival I took a picture and I love it. However, there is a tiny problem, when you use a night mode shoots, it is very sensible to movement, so there is a lot of photos shot at that mode and the result was not good. But now I took night photos in normal mode, and they look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted!","review":"I've really enjoyed this little camera. I did the usual, checked out all of the reviews, and I agree that it's a great beginner camera for a nice price. The picture quality is excellent, and uploading the shots is a snap.

It doesn't zoom, so unless you're close to something, it won't take a very good picture. Once the picture is scanned onto the computer, or printed, it's very grainy and pixellated. You can get other brands for a similar price that are much better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it.-first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined.-It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like 2 seconds for the picture to be taken.-It eats up batteries like crazy-It takes forever to turn on-If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight-The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home-It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for starters","review":"My husband has a digital camera and it was not as simply to use unlike this one.

You can easily blow pictures up without major loss of quality even at 8x10in. If you use the zoom (digital) the quality drops quickly.It does eat up batteries quickly so I recomend a battery charger but that is usual with digital cameras. The movie mode is also pretty good. The movie size is small (only 320x240) but it is a great for catching those special moments.My only complaint is that the camera does not come with a lens cover so extra care must be taken.The CX7300 is a great camera for it's price and is very user-friendly.

It was a real steal at about $100. The model I received was refurbished which may have been part of the problem. The battery life is horrible, especially if you're using the digital screen to take pics rather than the view finder. This past summer it completely shut down on me. It's great for taking general photos but not so reliable when trying to capture details. I recommend at least an 8MP model. I have a Sony CyberShot DSC right now and I LOVE it, although it IS a little pricier.Bottomline: this is a very basic camera with not a lot of shelf life.

This camera is extremely easy to use. I had no trouble reading the directions to set it up. I took 14pics and went down to the drugstore. I had to buy something called a sd card which is a little p-lastic thing to make the pics. They came out with such rich natural color. It was very easy to use the drugstore machine. I took pictures of a bright blue subaru. Have not tried the video or motion parts yet. Even in sulight the screen is easy to see. The reviews that said this is ideal for beginners were right. I'm 60 and a bit leary of gadgts but the drugstore machine was very easy to use.

However, I noticed some other reviewer complaining about the batteries being difficult to find because of the special need for a specific battery type.This is not true.I plugged in plain old Duracell cheapos and it worked fine. Do not hesitate to buy this camera because of this complaint, because it is a false complaint.The camera works very nice for the price, and traveling with it is easy and you don't worry too much about it getting stolen, cause it ain't worth much.Also, don't worry about the SD disk that someone else complained about, they are available in most stores (Target, Wal-Mart) as well as here on amazon, look it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Works, It Doesn't, It Works, It Doesn't","review":"Okay, yeah, its a good camera for the price.

Reformat the card, take the card out, recharge and recondition the batteries again, buy new batteries! Hmmm...doesn't work...so what does Kodak say? Did you get liquid on it...NO...did you buy our batteries...NO but they are Ni-Hi rechargeable which you recommneded...OK...well, send it off to us and if you aren't at fault we will fix it. It should take only up to 3 weeks. WHAT??? I need it now. I would like to get my money back and find another camera but alas we are stuck.

If you are not a tech wizard, and are confused by too many bells and whistles, this is the camera for you. Very simple to use and takes decent photos.Note: This camera has both internal memory and a slot for a SD card. If you opt to use a SD card (recommended), don't buy a high capacity 4GB SD card for this camera. Get a 256 MB card. That's right, 256 Megabyte, NOT Gigabyte. The camera won't be able to format the 4GB SD card. Using the 256 MB SD card will still provide enough storage for about 300 photos at the highest resolution. If you use the SD card, you can remove it and plug it directly into the card reader on your computer (if you have one). If you use the camera's internal memory, you will have to use the Kodak cable to transfer the photos to the computer and sometimes the used cameras don't come with the cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong items sent on both ends","review":"This cameria does not fit the kodak easy share CX 7300 this is the camera dock 3M873/ M883I was told by both ends this canera would workit does not fit AT ALLI would like Bob to send me the correct port for this cameria or refund moneyI am still waiting on the memory cards 3 of them and a battey charger to plug in car and housethis is very importand that I get these items soonboth people were wrong about the cameria fitting in this portPlease take cae of his matterbob send cards 3 memory cards and correct wire to computer and charger for auto and homeI must to a write off on visa if yiu cant send"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but out of date","review":"This book is written well and explains the technology well, and is a good reference for the basic design and set-up.

I enjoyed all the stories, but one in particular affected me like few other books or stories have. This was \\"Dragons in Manhattan.\\" I recognized myself in the narrator, Tuck, and identified completely with her. Although I couldn't identify with her situation (an alternative family) I could feel for her as she searched for herself, her family and her past. All 9 stories were written beautifully, with terrific descriptions- and if you read carefully, you may notice hidden connections between the tales, and obscure references to the Weetzie Bat books. I would recommend this book highly to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"goddess dreams","review":"I first discovered Francesca Lia Block when the bright, artsy cover of Weetzie Bat caught my eye on the public library shelf. I think it was destiny. Block is my absolute favorite writer and a goddess in her own right. This book collects nine stories, each powerful in its frankness and simplicity, yet strangely absorbing and addictive. Each of Block's characters, no matter how flawed, is beautiful, and by the end of each story you wish you could become the featured girl goddess. This is the kind of book which will mess with your head -- long after you've read (should I say devoured?) it, its stunning images and emotions will haunt your thoughts and dreams. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully tragic","review":"when i first read \\"girl goddess #9\\" i had no idea what was going on. after reading through a second time, i went through and examined each story, and read them all more carefully. block's work is absolutely beautiful. each story unfolds magically and is noted by imaginary friends and the wonderful scenery of california. reading more into each story makes one wish that the dream worlds that block has written about were real. a beautiful book that every teenage girl should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Eccentric","review":"I read this book as part of my Teaching the Reading of Young Adults course. I was completely unfamiliar with Block before reading this, and was not very familiar with young adult literature before taking this course. The stories were good, but the fact that they're all short stories left me wanting more. Each of the nine stories could have been at least novellas.Every story is eccentric, dealing with controversial issues, such as lesbian parents, teen drug abuse, sexually active teens, alcoholism, etc. And the author doesn't seem to condone or condemn any of these activities. That's just a warning to anyone who is considering a book like this for a teenager.I enjoyed the book. And if it suits your fancy, there are definite influences in this book of feminism, mysticism, and post-modernism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit for Francesca Lia Block","review":"9 more stories so quench the thirst for Francesca's great literary creations. Admittedly, Girl Goddess #9: Nine Stories doesn't hold a candle to Dangerous Angels, but it's still beautiful enough to be worth the read.Each of the nine stories is short, sweet, and greatly different from the rest. Each has plenty of emotions and feelings that the reader can relate to, not to mention Block's great cast of exotic characters.Whether you're looking for the book to curl up on the beach with, or read in the comfort of your own home, it's definately worth it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay...","review":"This book was okay.

I always had these same ideas in my head, but am not able to put them in words that would capture the meaning like she did. I felt as though she was backing up every opinion that I have. When I have a daughter and she is of ripe age I will difinately read this to her. It promotes a sense of acceptance for everyone. I love it and could read the stories over and over again.

The game is pain fully short and you will beat in within a week if youa re going slow.the armor types arent that different, there are only a few kinds of armor in the game and there is no advantage to any of them except Armor class. if you find a cool magicians robe, it will suck compared to plate armor and will offer NO advantage for a magic using character.It is a good game but come on, they promised all this freedom in the game and made us wait for it.

The main storyline was pretty boring, and you never felt like you were immersed in an epic adventure. As for my actions...the only thing that came out of me being mr. uber goodguy was that people would cheer for me as I walked by, or a couple guards would help fight with me on my quests.

The game is VERY quick to beat even if you do the various sidequests.

If you do only the bare minimum the game would probably take only 8-12 hours to beat and maybe 12-18 hours to beat with all side quests...for an RPG that is far too short.

The trailer that is shown on Cinematech has NOTHING to do with the game. There definitely wasn't any consequence for my actions as the makers would have you believe. Good or evil made no difference except you get a halo or horns. Big Whoop. And don't even get me started about the confining story line and the whole two minutes in took to beat the final boss and take the game back to EB.Lame, lame, lame. The makers should be ashamed.Rent it if you must. But resist the urge to snap the disc in half at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Motion Sensitive!","review":"I was so excited to get this game - but couldn't play it for more then 5 minutes because the character's movement made me feel so ill.

If you want to walk from one part of the world to another, you will have to wait through half a dozen or more \\"screen loading\\" windows.2) The game is very short. I played all but one of the side quests and still finished the game in a few days, playing only a few hours a day.3) While you do have some fredom to move around. This game is basically played on rails."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG GAME","review":"It says you where selling fable the lost chapters, when i recieve the game it was only the regular fable game (same game different content in the game) thats not what i ordered"},{"rating":"1","title":"wayyyyyyy toooo short","review":"I waited for this game for almost 7 months. FIrst it was supposed too come out in july, but it didn't. I thought the wait would be worth it, wrong. I played it for 10 hours and i'm on the last mission. Also the missions are so ez and boring. Ull never have to try more than once on most missions. Also there are no puzzles like zelda and when there r they take 2 seconds too solve. THis game really pissed me off because i thought that it would be almost as good as zelda, and that it would be my number 2 xbox game(halo 2 #1)Rent it, don't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Never Ending RPG.","review":"Fable, like any RPG, has great graphics, and reasonable physics. What other games don't have is the customization. Every action you take, wheteher good or evil, affects the way you look (good heroes walk around with halos over thier heads while an evil villian grows horns) and the way NPCs (non-player computers) react towards you. This game features a variety of clothes to fit your personality and a vast choice of weapons ranging from a stick to a crossbow to a great hammer and everything inbetween.The great thing about Fable is the fighting of course. There are three main ways that you learn to fight. Melee, Ranged (bow and arrow) and Magic. You can choose which you want to excel in or be great all around. Also, leveling up is convienent.All in all, Fable is one of the best and most realistic (for a video game that is) RPG around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"Lots of fun, my favorite RPG type game of all time.

I was looking forward to another RPG similar in depth to KOTOR, or even Gladius, but Fable falls way short. I wish developers would put more effort into gameplay and overall graphics instead of lengthy and uninteractive cut scenes.

From an evolving landscape that reacts to your every action, to unlimited freedom of choice in the decisions that will effect the game's outcome, to boundless secrets, and the promise of over 100 hours of game play. What we got was what XBOX RPGs are famous for, linear game environments, predictable character development, and a game that you can complete thoroughly in about 30 hours. If you weren't expecting Fable, the game is entertaining and full of action, beautiful to look at, and admittedly the Legend of Zelda for the XBOX. If you were, you are probably left feeling manipulated into buying a product that otherwise you may have rented and finished in a weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The path you choose will lead to your fate!!","review":"This is such a unique and new approach to a game. From the time you are a child to adulthood you make your decision as to what type of person you want to be. Are you a fighter, magician, a thief? Do you want to be help people or destroy them? Do you want to marry a man or a woman? Tattoos, hairstyles, clothing, shoes, and weapons, you have a choice in everything, and is what makes it so universal. You reall feel like you can inject some of your own personality into the character, not just playing a character that has been pre-created to look and act a certain way. I can't wait to see what will be done in Fable 2. Hope they add even more options, like piercings and gender selection and even more of the good stuff they have already injected on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun....super short","review":"I passed the game in 3 days of long gaming hours. but the game has allot to offer and is very addictive..if you like rpgs that let you do as you please then this one's for you. the customizable charecter is a cool idea, the clothing is good but kinda limited , in my opinion anywayz...but over all the game is really fun and if your that exploring type then it will prolly feel pretty long for you anywayz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoping for the Best... of the BEST!!!","review":"Now I don't know any taboo against rating a game before playing it, but I have read about this online, and it looks like a killer game, and I have never been wrong before when predicting killer games ('cept for Bloodwake...).

It's like Morrowind in that you can play it over and over again, and never play the same game twice. Action, adventure, even romance to a certain extent. This is on MY wish list for sure, along with Halo 2 and StarCraft Ghost. Any game that's at least on par with ES3 Morrowind, Ninja Gaiden, Star Wars KOTOR, and the ever-present Halo is a winner in my book!Xbox rules! (I just had to say that.)By the way, my name isn't J.

I used a clean standart lens wiping cloth to wipe the small dust and it was still able to create small scratches on the glass. Thats pretty bad quality. I even wiped it carefully and gently and yet it was able to scratch the glass. It's not noticable unless you hold it to the light but that still means that its pretty bad quality glass. So for the high price which I don't believe a piece of cheap glass should be at, means negative stars.-1 star for just okay UV Filtering. Its not special or anything.-1 star for bad quality overall.

Unfortunately, becuase it is so sensitive and often quite inaccurate, we aren't using them like I hoped we would.

Listen to the song \\"Coney Island Boat\\" where she sings \\"In the Good Old Summertime\\". FANTASTIC! So get this cd just for her brilliant performance.

She shines in that one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Old Fashioned Musical!","review":"This is throw back to another era, but if you are a Shirley Booth enthusiast like myself, you will enjoy her renditions of the turn of the century songs, which in some cases remind me of the songs in High Button Shoes, only, of course that show was much better! I think there is a plus with the delightful African American actress and songstress, Mae Barnes and her renditions of Happy Habit, and Hang Up...quite comical and good!! Also Wilbur Evans is a standout in his numbers! Will never forget Shirley Booth as Hazel and whenever I hear her voice I think of that character she played on Television for so many years...for Shirley Booth completists there is also \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", which was also a show of hers from the early fifties and is quite good...the music is a little more memorable from that show...Anyhow this is a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For cast album collectors only","review":"DRG reissue of the 1954 Broadway show BY THE BEAUTIFUL SEA is a curiosity.

I also spend most of the year in England, managing to juggle the constant flights between California and the UK, so I felt especailly drawn to this book since it was set there. When I started reading it, I found highly amusing characters and an interesting plot (although it was at times cheesy).

They don't know how or why they write so well, they just do it. Trying to explain how they gather inspiration is a waste of time. Hemingway said that if you talk about your own writing then you will be tarnishing something sacred. And I agree with that sentiment. Stop trying to analyze your writing. Instead, just write, and be grateful that you can write. Becuase most of us can't.

Two thumbs way, way down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Book","review":"I was very pleased with this book. This was a thorough introduction to body language and the exercises that the author recommends really help put it all into perspective. I finished the book last week and now find myself studying people all of the time, and constantly using the techniques the book describes to find out more about people. The book is easy to read and focuses on the main areas of body language - eyes, face, gestures, posture, proximity, etc. The information is introductory in nature, but the author provides titles at the back that you can use to explore the subject further. A practical book that was well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"I found Wainwright clearly an authority. His book is quite well organized. He goes into quite some detail for a book well under two hundred pages. How refreshing after suffering through all the fluff other authors proffer. It is not an easy read, but as long as you don't attempt to consume it all in one sitting, I suspect you will find it well worth the price of the book.On the downside, Wainwright does not seem particularly comfortable with the Exercises he asks his readers to perform. I would not be surprised if this \\"exercise\\" requirement was foisted upon him as a editorial imperative of the \\"teach yourself\\" series (his publisher)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Sweets': A Novel","review":"This book was a great read! As always, Andrews is very descriptive when it comes to details which kept me very intrigued, I hated to take a break. He takes you from the beginning of Baby Sweets, working in the fields, to living in their old town with all the twists and turns of her life and why it came to be that way. He gives you all the emotions the sadness, happiness, hardships, fear, etc., whatever you can feel, you will feel it here. The best part of Andrews books is that they all intertwine some way, after reading other novels by him I see how he refers to characters in other story he's written. With these overlapping stories you get to know a little more about his characters. Another great book to add to my collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling as ever","review":"I fell in love with Munch Mancini in No Human Involved, and I love her still.

This low figure of survival is accompanied by a high price tag, both economically and emotionally. Timmermans takes a candid look at CPR, exposing its myths and problematic areas, and I found his book historically well researched and balanced. I do have some reservations about some of the misleading statements he makes in chapter 5, especially his mistake of treating 'social inequality' as a synonym for 'unjust', accompanied by the false implication that social value affects survival during a hospital resuscitation effort. On the whole, however, he does a fine job and his extensive historical research and interviews with health care workers make this a fine book. It serves as an excellent antidote to the overly optimistic expectations generated by TV shows and CPR training courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a Class","review":"While their are some ethical issues that do need discussion I really wonder if the authors if took a CPR class. After being a First Aid/CPR/AED Instructor for the American Red Cross since 1986 Ican tell you that in a CPR and on the test it plainly states the objective of CPR is circulate blood containing oxygen throughout the body, especially, to the vital organs to prevent permanant damage until advanced life saving care can be provided. It's a stop gap until EMS arrives. This book is much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AW, IT'S BETTER THAN THAT!","review":"I liked this much more than the other reviewers. I put off watching it for a long time because of the amnesia angle. It's such a tired premise. (Like multiple personality disorder, the kind of amnesia you see in these films rarely happens in real life. These films make it seem like a common occurance.) But when I finally watched THE CROOKED WAY, I was enchanted. For me, the visual aspects of film are more important than any other elements, like plot or dialogue. That's why I love Noir. And this film, visually, is just as noir as it gets. There are moments of stunning beauty, and some images that are the very essence of Noir iconography. This is, of course, due to John Alton's genius. I also found the story very engaging. I see that the dvd is now out of print. I hope someone like KINO takes this opportunity for a restoration.

With the gears made out of plastic, the loose piece would probably have become loose no matter what.

This installment of the Dark Ages line has taken liberties and strays from original histories written in previous books. Perhaps it was an attempt to induct people into the new prefabricated, trendy and unimaginative WoD. Certainly it details the powers of the Fae in great detail, one of the few bonus parts of it. It makes sense that before the weight of disbelief crushes much of their power, that creatures of Fae had the capacity to rend mountains asunder. Ideally, this is a game that is held outside of the loop if you are a die hard Changeling fan. It can almost be said much the same for the Dark Ages line as well.

It also appears that someone forgot to hire a copy editor as there are many glaring mistakes that interrupt an already bumpy read.

That would be fine if there were a way to purchase longer lengths, but I'm unable to find longer lengths offered for sale.

All Fifth season has is different colors for each disc (didn't even bother to put cast pictures on them- Fourth did do that)and a promo for several other CBS DVD sets.I hope the sixth and final season has a lot better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Christmas Idea","review":"This gift was awesome, I cant wait for my dad to open it on Christmas :) I have to say it was higher priced than the last time I bought Hogen's Heroes season 4, but I can't complain!

Poor direction and very implausible ideas even for HH standards. Episode 1 year 5 - Hogan directs a propaganda film!!! Just too much of a stretch. The previous years were more realistic so you could believe in the comedy. It's almost like the POWS had free run of the camp whereas in previous years they had to work more and finagle more to achieve their schemes. To me the main comedy potential of HH is how the POWS improvise and negotiate to improve their conditions; even the smallest conditions. Year 5 it is almost as though they have as much power as the Nazis.I have not seen year 4 and hoping it is better. Borders only had year 5 so that is why I bought it. Years 1-3 are priceless of course. Now I understand why it was canceled after 6 years.

If you're an honest fan of HH, you've got to admit that the quality of the writing is noticeably deteriorating by this point in the series and that much of the cast (usually the Heroes) seem to frequently be 'mailing it in'.Seasons 1-3 were Hogan's best, but there are still moments to enjoy here. Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink), John Banner (Sgt. Schultz) and Howard Caine (Maj. Wolfgang Hochstetter) seem to be oblivious that the scripts are getting poorer and that series' end is in sight.

Not to spoil anything but it's ABOUT TIME those two got together, you'd think they'd have noticed earlier! The book has some great scenes, the Raiders of the Lost Arc scene with Katarn and Gorc. The murderous Droid 88 and Raan. Still some parts didnt click, the discovery of the Valley and the Dark Jedi who I had no feel for whatsoever. Save Yun, Jerec, and Sarris...alittle.

Encore! Dietz Does It Again!","review":"The illustrations and writing style, as in the first two, are excellent. I just have one question about this: why is it so relatively easy for Kyle Katarn to defeat Jerec? I mean, Jerec has a lot of the Valley's power here! It took thousands upon thousands of Jedi to defeat Exar Kun, and the combined Force power of at least 100,000 Jedi - good and evil - are trapped in the Valley of the Jedi! Yet it took only one Jedi's Wall of Light - Kyle's - to defeat Jerec! How does that work? Is Kyle's own power increased temporarily by using the part of the Valley power that Jerec hadn't taken yet? That seems the most probably thing, but I wish Dietz had specified. Oh, well. It's a masterpiece all the same.

And men are stinky and shouldn't be weak nice guys.That's pretty much it.Some of what is in the book has a ring of truth, but too often it was dumbed down to be funny and \\"approachable.\\" I'm not sure what the intended audience for this book was but since it is about marriage I assume it wasn't for teenagers. Much of it was written as if it were for teenagers in tone and flippancy, though.

I read it in hopes of finding a better understanding and instead found 2 people who sound very bitter and are trying to sell a book through humor and not real facts. Some of their advice include using sex as the \\"ultimate bargaining too\\" and ways to \\"realisticaly rate yourself in a scale of 1-10\\" and stay in your own playing field(like don't aim for a 8 if you're really only a 5). Scary stuff. This book really depressed me until my (Married) friends pointed out how utterly ridiculous it was. If you are single and searching, stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This book may cause you to throw it across the room.","review":"Some single friends and I read this book over a weekend get-together, and each of us, from varying dating backgrounds (forever alone, recently divorced, single for the moment) found it to be extremely insulting. At first we were open to what it was going to suggest, but after the chapters on women \\"shutting up\\" and \\"never marry your best friend\\" we could no longer take such trifle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny but realistic little book.","review":"I brought this book at the Christian bookstore in my town and it was so funny that I wanted two more for my daughters. The store did'nt have anymore so I ordered them. My girls 21 & 17 read them in like a day, laughing all the while, yet, finding topics that they actually wanted to have girl talk with me about, so I give this a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A + B = Bliss-filled marriage.","review":"My mother purchased this book for me. I think it was an \\"Oh, but she means well\\" type thing. I spent some time looking over the book and decided there are few things I have ever read that are more off track.The authors disguise biased, overgeneralized stereotypes of how all men and women act with really cute and catchy graphics. They tell you what to do and how to act so that you can attract a lasting mate. Because we all know trying to change yourself or hide parts of yourself to impress someone else is the best way to develop an emotional and intimate connection. The back of the book says playfully, \\"Oh, great, another one of those dating books, right? Wrong!\\" Actually, yeah, that's pretty right. Except I'd rather read all those other dating books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains why privatization is better than government control","review":"Dr. Asmus is with the Center for Policy Analysis, a libertarian think-tank. The book is an excellent blend of philosophy and real data, all of which is geared toward explaining how many of the functions performed by governments today would be better off in the hands of private enterprise. The book has two shortcomings:1. It was inspired by the election of Clinton in 1992 and the subsequent 1994 \\"Republican Revolution\\", and, as such, much of the material is time-sensitive and will soon be outdated, and2. Dr. Asmus' attempts at poetry.The main strength of the book is its abundance of real data to justify its points -- something often lacking in dissertations of opposing viewpoints. The only premise that the reader is asked to unconditionally accept is the idea that economic growth is good"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie","review":"The story is basically Poltergeist with a twist of black magic and demonic possession.

But as the movie progresses, the more it loses the originality it has and the more it looks like an Irish version of Poltergeist. I don't know why it's priced as it is .....that's a ridiculous price for this movie...and it's interesting to show to people.....I knew it wouldn't be a good movie though when I first rented it, because it hadn't been released in theaters, it went straight onto video. That's reason enoguh not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I almost fell asleep when I watched this movie. The movie is very boring and is not worth to buy.

It was enough to get me hooked. I then proceeded to listen to the clips of other songs on her website. All it took was one listen and I had to have it.This CD is not what you'll hear on mainstream radio. But you will hear emotion that is so wonderfully captured. In one instant, you'll think you hear hints of Tori, and in another, you'll know that it's not that. It just has a certain mix that is just its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful follow up CD","review":"Wind Chains is a melodic experience that you can't forget.Her sound pays homage to comteporaries like Tori Amos, yet Molly isn't afraid to be inventive and to express herself to the core.

I've had it for about 12 years now and it keeps time well with minimal battery use. It has 2 time zones, optional alarm and hourly beep, stopwatch with laps, countdown timer, and \\"indiglo\\" back light. Only down-side is the buttons are hard to push - they're little round metal cylinders about 1-2mm in diameter - pretty small & stiff to press, & you end up having to using your thumbnail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality it used to be....","review":"I thought this watch would be of the same quality as it used to be. Several years ago I had the same identical watch and loved it. When it failed and I was in need of a replacement I thought I would purchase another just like it based on my previous experience. Now I find the case is plastic? or at least not the metal it used to be and the band is a very chincy thin tin-like metal and overall is quite cheap construction. I am truly disappointed in the product. I question if it will last very long. I guess you get what you pay for now days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex Train Wreck","review":"Timex should be ashamed of themselves.

I wore the watch three times for a total time of about 15 minutes. The watch band kept coming apart. The pins that hold the band together kept coming out. I did notice the second time that it was not even the same pin but a pin in a different location. After the third time it broke I decided to send the watch back. I like my watchbands on the looser side so it was not tight on my wrist. The watch itself was good and I really liked the displays and lighting for nighttime. With this experience I will never buy another Timex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I had this watch for less than two months. It kept nearly perfect time, it was good looking and very comfortable to wear. After about 4 weeks, I noticed a pin working loose from the band. I worked it back in multiple times and didn't think too much of it. In less than 8 weeks, the band separated and I had to send the watch back. My main reason for buying it was the hope that the band would last, so I'm very disappointed. I have no idea if my experience was unusual or not, but I've bought a more expensive watch as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad clasp design","review":"Very nice looking watch, but the clasp design is very poor. When my boyfriend wore this watch the first day, he counted seven times that the end of the clasp would get caught on his clothes, or on items at work and come undone........very irritating, so we took this watch back after 2 days, and replaced it with another Casio which he has have worn that brand for the last 20 years now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex Atlantis 100 Bracelet Strap Watch","review":"Watch was basically fine. It was meant as a replacement. However, even though it was new, the strap itself showed signs of inferior quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I bought this digital watch. It looks very nice. It has a strong mineral crystal which protects dial from scratches and scrapes. It can also resist water to 330 feet. It shows time in a nice way.

He loved the watch, but the band doesn't work properly. When he puts it on, the final section of the watch band won't lock into place. I'll take it to a local watch shop to see what it will cost to correct it, but this experience has taught me that buying something sight-unseen probably isn't the best way to go...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor substitute for a great watch","review":"For years I owned a Timex Alarm Chronograph watch. It was a great timepiece, all stainless steel; it took a lot of hard use and still looked good. When it finally broke down Timex couldn't fix it but only offered to replace it with a watch with fewer features.The only watch Timex offered like it iwith the same features, alarm chronograph, timer etc. was the Atlantis 100. (I wouldn't be surprised if it has the same electronics inside.) However it is not nearly as good a watch. The body is made of plastic with a silver coating which wears off and looks shoddy. The LCD part is set deep into the watch, it is like looking into the bottom of a well, making the numbers hard to read. The clasp on the band has a way of becoming unhooked, just at the wrong times. I don't know why they stopped making the better product; I would buy it at event twice the original price."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EVERYDAY WATCH","review":"This was a Christmas present for my husband.

Nearly all of the (correct) information in the book is available plenty of places elsewhere, and by authors who truly know the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Stooges: An Illustrated History","review":"This book is amateurish and full of inaccuracies.

As a member of the Three Stooges Fandom Honor Roll (along with Jay Leno, Johnny Carson and Jerry Seinfeld, among others) take it from me: the errors begin on the first page and don't stop until the end of the last. The author misses all the Stooge's puns in Yiddish (believing that they are uttering \\"gibberish\\"); he mis-credits directors, actors, producers and misspells names, gets dates wrong, constantly refers to Moe Howard's grandson as Moe's son, but worst of all he completely misses the point of their comedy. The question is not why this book is so bad, it's why this guy bothered to write the thing in the first place, since he knows so little about the Stooges, their humor, the forces that shaped them and the actual members of the act from its inception in 1924 to its demise in 1970 (he leaves out most of 'em). AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Middling","review":"A nicely packaged book. If you're new to Stooge fandom, then this is a good book for you.

Really boring, and it felt like maybe my dad wrote it in 1970. I got an icky feeling from it, and was very disappointed. Sorry to the authors, but this just didn't do it for me. Maybe this is good for older people who are inexperienced lovers to begin with, and the idea of spanking sets you all a-tingle...but for me it was boring and hokey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tantra? Probably not","review":"I guess my biggest problem in looking over this book is that it has very little or nothing to do with Tantra. They do say this in the book, but insist on calling the book tantra which is very misleading. These are many techniques that ultimately enhance our attachment to our partner and our sensual experience, not as a means to free your mind and achieve liberation from suffering by removing all attatchments and aversions. If you are looking for a better sensual experience, though, then this book might be for you.Bottom line: Tantra is not about having a hot sexual experience. It is true spirituality. 99.9% has nothing to do with sex. Books like this that spin Tantra into further levels of misconception and media-trashiness are, I think, very harmful.Still, most people looking at this book are probably looking for a better time in bed, and a way to get closer to your partner. If that is what you are looking for, this book might serve you well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be called: The Black Tantric Path of Fools","review":"The religion of sensuality is the religion of enslavement.As long as your essence is trapped in the desire and attachments of the flesh you will never be free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax your mind & body to reach heightened sexual experience","review":"Red Hot Tantra is a pleasure to read on your own or with a loved one. The tantric lessons are accompanied by short stories, which are quite arrousing. I have to admit, I've read this on my own and have gained quite alot of self-satisfaction. Also, when reading Red Hot Tantra with my lover we keep the lessons in mind after getting aroused from the short stories and always have enlightening sexual experiences. The book has truely helped me relax my mind and body while focusing clearly on the moment. Reaching heightened senses in all aspets of sensuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"red hot tantra? not hardly, more like cold oatmeal erotica","review":"I don't know what happened between the author's intentions and the end result but this book has little or nothing to do with tantra, red hot or otherwise. It consists mainly of lame, pedestrian, badly written erotica followed by short chapters explaining why the erotica is/was erotic and how one might incorporate some elements of the fiction into one's real sex life. Fine: if you're the kind of person who has never before thought of reading erotica, but not so fine if you're a reasonably liberal, sexually educated adult who is trying to incorporate real tantric practices in your married sex life. I guess if you've been living in a hyper religious ultra conservative community and your parents never had the \\"talk\\" with you then just the fact that you're reading about people having SEX might be red hot; but for the rest of us, not so much.

We often obsess over our weaknesses, constantly trying to improve and cover them up. Instead, change your mindset, focus on your strengths, build your environment around them, and you will excel at a much faster pace. The author walks you through the process of helping to identify your strengths, build on them, and offers suggestions for changing the external environment to assist you in this endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to take charge of your work","review":"Marcus Buckingham is passionate about helping you identify your unique strengths and unleash their power. As you read and work your way through the program in this book, you will become convinced that growing through your strengths is the ticket to your future happiness, effectiveness and success. He refutes the approach of improvement by fixing mistakes as a dead end that cannot help you discover how you can be exceptional. The book constantly refers you to its associated Web site for materials that will help you work through the exercises. Buckingham wants you to act rather than just read a theoretical tract. Nothing presented in this book will help you without action and implementation. However, if you take up the challenge, you will become empowered as you take charge of your work through your strengths. We recommend this book because it contains just a few simple ideas that could change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"This is a fantastic book for taking practical steps toward putting your strengths to work.

Not a lot of substance to it, per se, but that's OK because the message is really about taking action. First taking the action toward self-awareness then finding ways to optimize performance (and enjoyment)through this self-awareness. Very useful tools to assist the reader in this endeavor.

No wonder, BusinessWeek survey found that 90% of managers in the US thought they are top 10% performers. No more strength movement! Be realistic! Employment selection has a long tradition to find the best people. The foundation that strength-movement is based on, in the first place, is not new at all to HR professionals. Many decades of research and practices tell us that high performance is far more than the application of individual's strength. Thinking about team-fit, organizational-fit, cultural-fit, a lot of things matter. Sad that some institution misuses its mighty marketing engine to promote a false management philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Put Your Strengths To Work: 6 Powerful Steps to Achieve Outstanding Performance","review":"I feel like I wasted my time with this book.

The storyline was based on a japanese manga comics about a poor girl going into an elite school and meeting the elite snobbish group of four guys called the F4. Because of her integrity she managed to befriend the F4 and started to hang out with them. The leader of the F4 started to like her and soon enough they became a couple. This box set will explain how Jandi befriends the snobbish F4 and how she manages to fall in love with Jihoo, another member of F4, while Junpyo became in love with her. This exciting love triangle will test both jihoo and junpyo of their skills to win Jandi's heart. Who will she pick in the end? Jihoo or Junpyo? Who does jandi really love? Is it jihoo or junpyo... And who will steal your heart?A lot of Hs quirks and lots of comedic scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This was the first drama i have ever watched and i have to say that i was not disappointed.

The storyline is classic and will keep you awake for hours upon hours. Even though I know the story by heart, I was still swept into the drama as if it was my first time. I also had to purchase the soundtrack because you will want to listen to these songs while you are driving to work or running on the treadmill. Do yourself a favor and watch Meteor Garden and Hana Yori Dango. Can I pick a favorite version? Nope. They are all great! I also recommend the box sets of Palace, My Girl, Full House, and My Lovely Sam-Soon. This drama obsession is becoming an expensive, but awesome addiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best KDramas ever!","review":"Definitely believe the hype!!! This is one of the best Korean Dramas to watch out there. One of the main reasons why everyone seems to love the drama (besides the cute guys in here of course) is that from the first minute of the first episode until the last minute of the last episode in Season 2, it's literally entertaining. Usually most dramas drag and are redundant in their story lines but from beginning to end it was so much fun to watch! Just one episode is full of laughs, romance, cuteness, and angry emotions that make you emotional and each of the guys, especially Lee Min Ho is so adorable to watch. Everyone seems to have a favorite guy in the show and talking among this drama with my friends is always fun. Definitely watch Lee Min Ho in City Hunter as well. You can see how different his role is to Boys Over Flowers and that he's not just a 'cutesy' actor. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"item too small to fit on steering wheel","review":"tried to attach to steering wheel and it was too small. put a larger screw in and stilldid not work. meantime I had thrown out the packaging so I am stuck with the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't fit","review":"THis thing looks pretty cool but I have tried it on several makes and models without it fitting.

While the music (or I should more accurately say arrangements or accompaniment) is, for the most part, as described by the other reviewers - cool, jangly, jazz-tinged continental pop - I couldn't stomach the vocalist. Her weak, thin, nasally, overly mannered vocals remind me of some 19 yr. old who thinks she should be a singer (or the next American Idol!) because she can hold a tune.

Upon examining the catch bag, I found that the trap had caught dozens of small moths and other non-biting insects, but only one or two mosquitoes.I tried the trap again in the summer of 2007. I moved it to different locations, and used octenol and lurex attractants in the trap as well. In all cases the results were the same--lots of moths, but essentially no mosquitoes.It's possible that this trap may work for some other mosquito species, but if your problem is the Asian tiger mosquito, the Mega-Catch Alpha doesn't do any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"It simply did not catch any mosquitos all summer long.

I particularly like the Bobby and Angelo song from Tahiti, which is sung in Tahitian and has a very exotic sound.

Instead, SQL in a Nutshell is woefully shallow.

Additionally, and mercifully, the series is not reproduced in its entirety which totalled 89 plates.Save your money for wiser purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Watch","review":"The Timex Expedition is everything you'd want from a watch - except for being a babe magnet.

Jack Larson displayed better acting in this series that the latter, very much the innocent clean cut teenager. George Reeves acting improved in the 3rd season. Excellent historic 1950's American genre. The theme of \\"Fighting for truth justice and the American Way\\" is proclaimed, however there are elements in the \\"American Way\\" that are dark, voilent and lawless.

This is really not coby's fault, but a zoom option would've been nice* Remember to cable before you install.

We basically leave it tilted somewhat upwards and this works.Audio is somewhat tinny, but expected in this kind of product. If you wanted full bass and surround sound, go watch TV or movies on your home theater. This package is perfect for the kitchen while making dinner or having breakfast.There are only a handful of makers for a 10\\" screen, and surprisingly it's the off-brand Coby that has the higher reviews and higher quality than all the others, from what I've read and experienced.If you're looking for a 10\\" model, this is the one to go with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't even last a day!","review":"I should have known better than to buy a Coby product again - I have replaced my handheld DVD player twice within a year.I plugged this unit in, and it seemed to run fine.

But the main storyline had common errors.The graphic descriptions were violent, and the mild cursing might offend some Christian readers.The principle message of the book was good \\"Keep the Faith\\".

I can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds. Professor Zinn is a far left author. He uses the usual lines: America generally bad, communism generally good. Obviously Mr. Zinn has the right to write whatever he wants, and his writing style is very convincing. However, if the reader investigates the facts, many holes become visible in his theories. Those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints. A good example is \\"Intellectual Morons : How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas by Daniel J. Flynn\\" which gives the reader a good profile of Mr. Zinn."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, and moving","review":"I first checked out \\"The Zinn Reader\\" this past summer because my senior high-school history teacher had us read some Zinn for a final paper.

My vote for worst product of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly useless","review":"This has to be the worst pet grooming product ever. You will be better off with a pine cone on a stick. The brush is bulky, and its falsely advertised as silent - it emits a high pitched squeel that frightened both of my cats at first. It didn't work on my short haired cat because the bristles are spread too far apart. Then I tried my luck on a long haired cat, and at first the battery cover on the handle kept falling off, and 7 bristles broke off within minutes of using the brush!!!

It couldn't pick up much hair at all. And my dogs are scared of it, since it emits a noise that is barely audible because it's so high pitched. The bristles are like, 2/3 of an inch apart so it can barely even brush a dog or a cat.In conclusion, don't buy it, seriously.

I bought the hoya 0uv version of this, the hoya's packaging was cheap as hell. A testament to the product inside? The thing slides around in it's packaging? wtf!? The sigma was packaged very well and had an expensive feel to it, though I wouldn't say it's expensive at all. I think it's woth every cent. Get this 0uv filter lens if you want the best.

Readers were given a summarized account of what occured on the night of Elyse Pahler's murder. The rest of the book was devoted to the deceased's friends and their thoughts; the teenager murderers legal wranglings; and in depth information about the occult. I found the latter two accounts to be extremely repeatitive and boring.Lastly, why was this book written before Royce Casey's sentenced was issued? The one defendant who stood to be punished the harshest despite that he solved an unsolvable crime for police.

There is no explanation of what happened to the girl, just that she was killed and four boys were accused of killing her for Satan.That's it. No background information is given on anyone in the book and the quotes from the dead girl's two best friends are contrived and cliché. We learn nothing about the murdered girl or those accused.Worse is the extremely poor writing of the author who at one point uses the word \\"precluded\\" instead of \\"preceded.\\"There are literally chunks and chunks of text that are repeated verbatim throughout the book.

I was left wondering what was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most poorly written books I have ever read.","review":"Wow. Never before have I been so angry after finishing a book. It has as its subject an intersting case but seems to have been written by someone in grade school.

Reston must, of course, mention this great thinker's discoveries, but that is as far as it goes. There is little about the influence of his discoveries on the scientific community or how it shaped the world afterwards. I would have expected this to be one of the central themes considering the subject of this biography. The book deals almost exclusively with Galileo's struggles with the church. It is obvious that Reston has no scientific background. He should have picked someone else to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to Galileo library","review":"If you already know something about Galileo, this book will be a wonderful addition to your knowledge base. If you are a newcomer, this book is a good introduction, but it will leave you wishing you knew more about his experimental method, his scientific writing, and his inventions.

A must read for those looking for a rational and not bombastic examination of the scandal. The book also reveals that Posner has no interest in becoming a member of the Supreme Court; this book will piss off everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book degenerates into Posner taking political potshots at Democrats while portraying Republicans and Starr as the saviors of the free world. Posner makes me wonder whether he could be an unbiased judge. I'd hate to be a Democrat before his court. How he got the reputation as a fine jurist is beyond this reader. I think Posner's goal with this book is to generate interest in getting him nominated for the Supreme Court should a Republican get elected President. But by suggesting that Nixon should not have faced impeachment, I think he goes off the deep end. For anyone interested in an unbiased look at impeachment (written prior to the Clinton affair), read Gerhardt's The Federal Impeachment Process. Posner relies on it himself and is strongest when he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you read this book....","review":"When I read this book, something about it made me uncomfortable. While it is easy to become numb to yet another diatribe against Clinton (which is what this book mostly is), Posner's harshly negative tome, dressed up in pedantic legalese, seemed a bit over the top. Still, I couldn't put my finger on what was so disturbing about the book. Then I read the March 9 issue of the New York Review of Books (nybooks.com), which includes an incredibly insighful review of Posner's book by Ronald Dworkin, a legal scholar on par with Posner. All I can say is: read Dworkin's absolute destruction of this book. Posner may be one of great legal minds of our day, but, as Dowrkin makes clear, this book cannot be taken seriously. It is nothing more than far-right, anti-Clinton nonsense dressed up in legal language. Thank you, Ronald Dworkin, for exposing Posner's book for the sham and joke that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Posner exposed as judge of questionable ethics","review":"The New York Times of Feb. 19, 2000, carries a story about a dispute between Posner and the eminent legal scholar, Ronald Dworkin, who reviewed \\"An Affair of State\\" in the New York Review of Books issue dated March 9, 2000.In my earlier review of Posner's book here I raised the question of the ethics of a highly placed United States judge making an explicit finding of guilt in what could be a pending criminal prosecution -- of Clinton for perjury after he leaves office.Dworkin agrees with this belief and documents the canons of judicial ethics which he believes, and I believe, that Posner violated.Posner should be hauled before a disciplinary committee to explain this outrage.mailto:RayJ@Juno.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"More trash from a hate-monger in judge's robes.","review":"Don't think for a moment that this book is neutral--the judge, like most of his Republican cronies, is a Clinton-Hater.

He was not convicted. I have not seen anything that said lying in a civil trial is a high crime. Posner should admit he hates Clinton. I do not like some of the things he has done. But there was no impeachable offense. The last impeachable offense was can the Iran-Contra Scandal. Why do you not focus your energy on that obvious breaking of the law. There is a lot of opinions presented as facts in this case. There is a lot of ignorance on political strategy in this book. It does not even make a good read on the toilet.

They were GI Joe before the GI Joe cartoons showed up. My biggest issue was the DVD transfer. The biggest issue was the dialogue was really hard to hear in many places. There was the occasional graphical glitch that flashed on the screen ever so briefly in about 2 or 3 instances. Finally this may be the result of a faulty memory of the movie, but the sound and video felt 'sped up' slightly. People's voices were higher pitched than I remember. Comparing to a another clip online I can hear a slight difference. Bottom line a bad but fun movie marred by a bad transfer"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is to cheesy movies as the beatles are to rock and roll","review":"if you want to laugh constantly at terrible acting and the worst movie in history this is your movie. tre parker and matt stone( the creators of south park) stated in an interview they watch this once a week just to keep things in perspective. Knowing their reputation and what they bring to the table i had to check it out. after watching it about 5 times i still don't know whats going on. there are too many things to name that are beyond ridiculous. you can tell alot of money was dumped into this but it is still horrible in every way. you simply cant believe the people are trying to act and that there could have been more than 2 takes for each scene. quite a bit of team America world police was made in the likes of this movie you will know what i am talking about when you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate in 80's Cheese Action","review":"This film, to put it quite simply, is a classic. An action/Adventure film set in the 1980's stars Barry Bostwick as the dashing(Now extremely laughable) Hunter, who leads a group of ethnically diverse freedom fighters known as the Megaforce. Neet-O looking vehicles, combined with some hilarious moments make this movie a cult hit waiting to happen.

I've had an old VHS copy for many years and would catch it every once and a while when it was broadcast on cable back in the day. As soon as the opening narration started I could tell there was an issue. Hopefully Henstooth video is looking into this and will offer a disc swap.

His vocals are more menacing and troll-like, which raises the greatness of this cd.This album seems to have a more metal feel than previous efforts, but it never loses the sense of outrageous fun of the others.

It turned out to be very smart and funny. Joss Whedon is at his best. The cast including the end camero is just awesome. I laughed and enjoyed myself with this movie.

No brainer. But then you notice this to be some sort of setup by something bigger. Possibly a reality tv series maybe. Then things happen which makes you wonder, there's something else going on at the sametime. As a fan of the horror genre, I loved the curves this movie took you on.

I think some people start this movie expecting traditional, terrifying horror that scares you enough that you won't go to sleep for the night. What people need to understand is to start this movie with a \\"Whedon\\" mentality. This was co-written by Joss Whedon. Don't expect it to be traditional. Expect it to be Whedon. And then, you will give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a good movie","review":"I turned it off after about 15 minutes.

The cabin is monitored by some sort of organized business like cult whose job is to monitor and partially control how the students are to die. They have all sorts of monsters to unleash at the students, including zombies, dragons, ghosts, a huge cobra, and a werewolf. There was even a guy with a puzzle box like from the movie, Hellraiser.The movie gets out of control so quickly it almost feels like a horror/comedy. The film does have an interesting premise and if re-done without the monsters, could have potential as a decent horror movie.Would not recommend this one however"},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"This movie had to be the worst movie I seen in 2012....Actually it easily was the worst.

Not much to say but here is the break down.Pros+good idea for a film+My Favorite alien killer is in it.Cons-Bad acting-Tries to be a comedy (not funny)-Tries to be many different type films at once but fails at each-Boring kills-Bad writtingIn a nutshell, this film tries so hard to be evil dead-ish that its really sad because it was so bad. There are films out there that do good \\"homeage\\" and then there are bad ones that shame the film which is cabin in the woods. Save your money on this one, wasnt worth the dollar I spent at the red box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give 0 stars if possible","review":"My husband and I unfortunately wasted our money seeing this in theaters.

We even planned to see it in the theater. I am SO THANKFUL that I didnt spend the money to see it in the theater. I would have probably walked out.

Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been a big Joss Wheddon fan, admire everything he's done-from Buffy and Firefly to the Avengers. However, this movie is a complete disappointment. Besides a ridiculous premise, gore is piled on for absolutely no reason. Worse, the dialog is throwaway and the plot line, such as it is, is undecided what it wants to be-is this a horror movie, a send-up of horror movies or a homage to them? You won't be able to tell by the time this bloody mess is over and worse, you'll wish you hadn't wasted the time on it. If you want the proper send-up of horror movies try most of the Scream series. If you want decent horror in this vein, try Friday the 13th series or the Halloween series. But this movie is a complete waste of time. I suspect even Joss wishes this had been a better movie than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want 90 minutes of my life back","review":"Let me say first off that I love Joss Whedon- and I mean anything and everything he does. He is a modern day TV and movie genius. But he missed the mark with this one. No wonder it sat on the shelf for so many years. It was terrible, boring, and just plain stupid. I have no idea how anyone could give this a good review. It was an insult to one's intellegence. It was not funny, scary, or clever. Just dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"Save yourself the bother of watching this movie. This movie sucks. I kept waiting for it to not be comical.

Well, I would agree, but instead of leaving the plot there, the film makers decided to be creative and throw in a twist that ruins the entire film. \\"The Cabin In The Woods\\" suffers from the plot twists and the end result is a mess of a movie that doesn't make much sense. As if the alternating shifts in plot were not bad enough so much of the film is shot so dark some scenes are barely visible. As a huge fan of horror films I can't recommend \\"The Cabin In The Woods.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Me and my husband were looking for a good scary movie to watch and saw this. We did not pay attention to the ratings at first, just thought it looked good because we really enjoy the woods so we thought that it would be interesting. At first it was...a little. It had our attention at first, and then it just turned stupid all of a sudden. We both thought it was sooo dumb toward the end we ended up turning it off before it was over. We were VERY dissapointed that we waisted our $ on it. I guess the concept of the movie was ok but the ending was just too much to bear. Do not rent this movie, it is a waist of time! I cannot believe people rated this movie so high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time!","review":"I wish I could give this no stars! This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe they got these actors to play the roles in this movie. There isn't enough of a story line to keep you guessing and entertained. You are trying to figure out what is going on and this is confusing. We watched this as a group and even the people who never talk through movies couldn't stop questioning this movie. I understand fictional movies but this is just stupid. I wish I could get back the 2 hours I spend watching and debating this movie....what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to horror fans","review":"Stupid, boring, not even the slightest bit scary...Whats worst is that I feel insulted as a horror fan after watching this movie. The writers did not write a horror movie, they wrote a movie to make fun of horror movies and the horror-smug critics are loving it; that's the only thing keeping the ratings so high (that and other non-horror fans)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good about this movie","review":"Cabin in the Woods lacked imagination - the first turn off was the similarities from \\"Hunger Games\\" that it was a computer generated virtual world. BIG turn off. Parts of it was like themes from \\"Evil Dead\\". And the other themes including monsters came straight out of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" like the giant serpent, and assortment of ghouls kept in cages. The acting was pretty bad too. Josh may have been awesome with \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and my friend bought this movie because of his name, but it surely disappointed. Bad acting, lack of imagination - I'm so glad I didn't buy this piece of trash. Although my friend is out $15. It's definitely something you will NOT want to watch twice.

After watching it, I was thankful that I didn't pay a dime to see this movie. The movie was awesome, until the ending, then the movie lost all credibility. What a freakin disappointment.

I missed this movie when it was in theaters, so I've been patiently waiting for the DVD release and didn't mind shucking out $15 to buy it.Um, can I have my money back now? This was like watching a \\"very special episode\\" of Buffy -- except with far less wit, charm and suspense. Something was just...off.

It also manages to be quite frightening at times, but don't expect a real jumper like The Descent. The Cabin in the Woods plays it straight, but never takes itself too seriously. If you're the type of person who takes his horror movies (and maybe even yourself) very seriously, this film may not be for you. However, you still ought to watch it so that you can write a snarky review here on Amazon.

The movie was good until the last 25 min or so. Once you find out what's going on it gets really messy and just loses it for me. If you like maybe the Evil Dead movies than you will like this but if you are a die hard horror fan thinking this movie is a horror movie than you will be pissed especially at the end of this mess.

This simply is not the case. It is predictable and flimsy at best. Anyone who has seen a trailer knows most of it, and it doesn't take long to figure out the rest.

But ALL of the good scenes were IN the previews! They never really had it all together in the first place, but it REALLY fell apart at the last 30 minutes. It's almost like they forgot what they were making a movie about. There's holes in the story, and you at first ask yourself \\"What's happening?\\" Then you realize, you don't care because you're just disengaged at that point. I'm a huge horror fan, and this fell flat. ONE of the \\"creatures\\" was made up well and had the creepy factor, and that's the ONLY reason it gets 2 stars instead of one.

I do not know what to make of it. It was not funny enough to be a comedy it did not scare me so no it was not a horror. It was not a T and A movie only got 1 topless shot. The action was dull so no not an action movie and believe me there was not drama.I can not believe the hype over this movie it was predictable and just boring and made no kind of sense at all.

Is the Cabin really a big Rubik's Cube from the Dark City? Well, no. We can't tell you what the Cabin really is, or even where it is. What we can tell is this: They are watching. Japan couldn't cut it, so now we watch the Cabin in the Woods. We observe the five stereotypical lambs approaching their fates. There is but one clue to be known: \\"The fool will bind them with his Ancient Logic\\".You, the viewer, might not find much of the film to be scary...but the real horror is mostly on the other side of the mirror (or window?). There are clues abound, but just as much underground as within the Cabin. The fool will prove to be wiser than most, but is Ancient Logic able to solve the Rubik's Cube? Will the Cabin in the Woods determine their fates?!2.342"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn Ball Movie","review":"Thumbs down. Such a corn ball movie.

It was very original, well made, and had a humorous self-mocking awareness to it. It had some great actors in it. But they took the cheap way out - instead of creating suspense, they just substituted gore. They were obviously going for over-the-top how much blood and disturbing imagery can we throw in? Also be warned that if planning to watch this with young, tasteful, or sensitive folks, the f-word is the most commonly used word in the movie - no less than 100 times. So, while I applaud its originality, it is definitely a movie born of the horror video game era, and not of the masters of suspense that came before. It does not make a good date movie, family movie, or suspense move - it's just a creative, but disturbing, slasher pic. I expected more from Joss."},{"rating":"1","title":"seen one? you've seen them all","review":"This was painfully cliche and horribly predictable. If you've seen one of these films about friends going out into the woods to 'get off the grid' then you've seen them all. Nothing to see here folks, move along.Disgusted and disappoined.

Not your average scary movie and definitely worth the watch. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CABIN IN THE WOODS","review":"very violent and scary. Thought it was going to be more of a semi romantic camping trip .Not recommended for young children, spooky enough to give you nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"I didn't find this to be nearly as clever or entertaining as the buzz would have one believe. One sort-of-clever idea doesn't make a whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie!","review":"This is a fun movie! They take many classic greats like Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw and old HP Lovecraft horror and twist it into a modern plot. You get your stereotypical victims with solid acting and plenty of blood.

This really isnt your typical horror movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"joss is king","review":"this is the story it's not really a horror as another ep of buffy. very good kinda scary but just an all round good movie.this is a horror just not scary in you're typical way but still very good.Get it. Done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cabin in the Woods","review":"Loved this fun horror flick. Think Evil Dead with a new angle. Great concept, pure horror, good humor. There is an actual plot, and a clever, modern angle on human sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"IQ test","review":"This movie is basically an IQ test and you can tell who failed miserably by the one and two stars. They just don't get it. Dumbing down of society in full effect. Joss lives up to his usual high standards and superb quality. Highly recommended flick that is well worth your time and money. I would also suggest going into it cold (don't watch the trailers or read these reviews where the idiots spoil the whole film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rented through ROKU The Cabin In The Woods","review":"Was excellent quality to watch with no issue's and was a great thriller in my eye's and well worth the watch. I chose to rent it for entertainment on Halloween.

I would concider buying it when I get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing new take on the Horror genre","review":"Awesome horror film. Great concept and spin on the classic horror motifs. Well worth watching if you are a fan of horror films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I found the movie interesting with a very clever plot twist. It isn't your stereotypical horror movie with the stale slasher/zombie flick. It's got a quite clever storyline and the acting, though predictable, was quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"That was fun","review":"In the beginning you could almost see what was going to happen next, but the other three quarters of the movie had me guessing.

There's nothing left to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Truth be told it's Truman Show meets Evil Dead. It tries to be funny scary and clever all at once and succeeds at none of them. Tucker and Dale vs Evil or Cabin Fever are both more successful spoofs of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I've read a few reviews that conveyed a disappointment in a lack of character development and \\"smartness.\\" With this, I do sympathize. As a horror junkie I long for more truly well done and frightening horror films. They are so rare that it is easy for one to get one's hopes up and then be bitterly disappointed. True, this is not one of those films. But, it is brilliant in its own right. The plot is...insane. At first, I thought I was watching a Twilight Zone rip-off but, luckily, I kept watching. It goes much further. It's gory, funny, confusing, and ultimately is one of those movies that you want to re-watch immediately. You know the kind! At the end we finally figure out what's going on and, when viewed again, you start seeing things for what they really are. In my humble opinion, that is pretty damn smart.P.S. You may never want to see an elevator again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVED THIS MOVIE...but $35.99/?!?!?!","review":"Let me just say first off, that this was a fantastic movie. I definitely think there were parts that could have been done better (especially the ending), BUT the story as a whole is totally original and just crazy. I definitely want to buy this...but $35.99? For just a regular blu-ray and digital copy? O.O SERIOUSLY?! A brand new 3D Blu-ray, with a regular Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy costs AT MOST $34.99. What the heck is in this case, because at this price, there better be some gold flakes or something, I don't even know, but that's crazy.The Avengers even has more. Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy + Digital Music Download. $29.96 The Avengers was a lot better than this movie too...I'm totally confused with this pricing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if you haven't seen it","review":"I'm going to keep this short. I guess there is an audience for this movie but I guess I'm not part of it. I generally like movies that don't take themselves completely serious like Machete or Rubber, but this movie was just plain old not good. I went to this movie with 5 other people and not a single one of us had anything good to say about it. I guess the bottom line is some people like this movie but others hate it so don't buy it unless you've already seen it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cabin in the Woods is the worst film ever made","review":"I am writing this review to help those who fall into the trap of seeing a rating of 7.9 and thinking this film must have some redeeming qualities. Believe me it doesn't. It is ridiculous and abysmal. The scary thing is the sort of individual that enjoys this film is the same individual that states scream is original. Some may find this deeply disturbing but I would be quite happy to live in a world without films such as scream, there i said it. There was only one scene that I found funny and it was when Mr athlete decided to ride his bike into a force field of some sort. I began thinking something worth while was going to happen but this moment never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie of all time","review":"this movie is a waste of film. the plot was clear in the first reel. there where nothing to build up to u knew what was going on from the jump. i don\`t know about u but i felt like i had wasted two hours of my life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, a movie without a happy ending???","review":"I loved the ending and of course Sigourney Weaver. Wish she had a bigger part honestly. Hot guys and pretty girls and a funny man who knows what he's talking about. Bought the digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed emotions and mixed directions","review":"The acting was sub-par from decent actors. The script was ridiculous, but well conceived, and then poorly executed. This movie had lots of potential, but just fizzled out. It may be worth seeing if you like the lighter side of Joss Whedon, but it is so over the top in some points it comes off as trying too hard, and then lacking so much at other points that it doesn't seem it's trying hard enough,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, funny, and twisted","review":"I haven't had so much fun seeing a horror movie in years. If you are a horror fan, this movie is definitely made for you, given all the references to other horror flicks in it. Honestly, it is really hard to write any sort of review here without spoiling a lot of the movie, given it's many twists and turns... so I'll just say this. The movie is hysterical, well-acted, and a completely mind@#*!. The Blu-ray is great quality, the commentary track funny and highly entertaining, and the special features are pretty darn interesting as well. Also, if you are a fan of Whedon's other works, you'll find a lot of your favorite actors from his other projects are here too. Obviously Chris Hemsworth (Avengers) and Fran Kranz (Dollhouse) are here as main characters, but you'll also get some Amy Acker (Angel) and Tom Lenk (Buffy). That guy knows how to put a cast together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss Whedon does it again","review":"Okay, this is admittedly a little out of the norm for Joss, at least if you look at it from the slasher movie view point. But then this is so much more than a slasher movie. There is a twist to all the killings and really there aren't that many of them at least not until the last 30 minutes of the movie and that is when it gets interesting. This Evil Dead meets Saw meets the mad scientist. To explain it more will give too much away and this is one movie you should see simply because it is directed by Joss Whedon and no one does campy horror better than him. Get your popcorn, turn out the lights and sit down for a wild ride, Joss Whedon style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"I kept hearing such good things about this movie that I just had to rent it. Now seeing that its Joss Weadon geek god who did it, I had pretty high hopes for it, & was awesomely right. The storyline which is usually the weak sauce of a title like this is the shining star. Everybody did their thing as far as the acting went. Watch it, it's just badass. Awesome surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending itself is worth it","review":"Although I wish this was 2 disc, for the price of $7.99, I had to jump on it Black Friday. I love this movie, it's one of my favorite horror movies to release in years. Worth buying and watching again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"just get it","review":"At this point if you have managed to not have this film spoiled for you and you have any interest in seeing it you should just go ahead and see it. It will either be the most fun you have had watching a horror movie in years or you will have to deal with the realization that you have really bad taste in film and a tragically low capacity for joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable - for a horror flick!","review":"I'm not a fan of horror movies, but my husband is. I try to accommodate his tastes in October at least, and he had been wanting to see this film for a while. I was pleasantly surprised (and only a little scared) by this film. He kept telling me it was a satire on horror films, but I didn't believe him until about halfway through. A very clever little twist, and no terribly unpredictable \\"Gotcha\\" moments. Recommended both for horror film buffs and their girlfriends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is spectacular","review":"So, be sheer coincidence I went with my adult daughter to see this movie. I knew very little about it going in (which turned out to awesome). The director of this movie is likely the most creative and clever person making movies today - get this you will not regret it (everyone I have recommended this movie too has loved it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romp for horror movie fans","review":"If you like horror movies, and you like things that are a little 'spoofy' on horror movies you will probably enjoy this. It isn't quite going for the laughs like Scary Movie but it is in some ways similar. Perhaps a little more like Scream in its commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Funny, clever, great movie. A good genre film even for folks who might not usually like horror but know about its conventions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. Not what you expect. Really.","review":"yes, it's a horror movie, and yes, there's a cabin in the woods. There's even a band of young, attractive 20-somethings involved. But still... this is not the trope you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabin in the Woods - good fun!","review":"Cabin in the Woods is a great twist on the standard horror movie formula. It is a fun, innovative take on scary movies. It is a perfect mixture of good old horror movie cliche and modern conspiracy theory innovation. I would highly recommend it to those who really love the horror genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT what you expect-new genre of horror movies","review":"I have seen every single horror movie ever created period. I am an avid movie watcher and take movies seriously. What this movie has done is something i thought was nearly impossible or not going to happen for a long time. it created a new genre of horror movie and was simply put, one of the most creative, funny yet scary movies ive ever seen. I loved it. Its not what u expect at all. the advertising for this movie when it was being released was not great and should not reflect the movies whatsoever. i think they were trying to not reveal much about the movie but the trailer kind of gave the movie a different vibe than what it is. i would classify it as a comedy. its a comedy and a horror movie wrapped up into one. Its just amazing and you will find yourself rewatching it many times. I found myself in the theater wishing i could pause and rewind certain scenes. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Ass","review":"Cabin in the Woods is an amazing movie. I am not going to give you the plot breakdown because you can read that in every other review, (thank you my fellow reviewers). This movie is a cut above the rest, pun intended.

The primary focus is to uncover \\"Satanic Ritual Abuse\\" or other abuse that a person is trying to ignore. My aunts swore by this book for all of a month in 1991 until the next big pop psychology book came out. The idea that your foot hurts as an adult because of some past childhood traumatic experience that you buried as a child is probably true if you actually did sprain, break a bone, or just had wrong fitting shoes.

The Zeikos is junk, a complete waste of money, no point putting one of these on a good lens as it will just ruin the shot with glare and reflections. The B+W was much more expensive than the Sigma and I found it was a dust magnet, incredibly difficult to clean and dust just seemed to stick to it.The Sigma filter however cleans well, hasn't scratched and provides great protection for my lens. It does exhibit some reflection in difficult conditions but much less than other filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears to be a quality product","review":"Filter appears to be as advertised.

My 7 year old son has teeny weeny slim wrists and the elastic strap is fully adjustable so it fits him perfectly. He absolutely loves it - it looks fab and the functions are all easy to use. One thing to note regarding replacement batteries, though... I bought my daughter a girls' Timex watch a couple of years ago, similar to a girls' version of this watch (she has tiny wrists, too), and I had to buy a replacement battery this week. The battery cost more than the watch did in the first place.

The band is really comfortable for him. He has a skinny wrist and the soft band adjusted easily to fit him. I have even tried it on and it is comfortable. He can't operate the side buttons yet but I was able to figure them out even without using the instructions. We have used the alarm and the countdown timer as well. Haven't used chronograph (count-up timer) but I'm sure he will eventually. He does love the indiglo button and uses it often. He's still getting used to wearing a watch and takes it off at least once a day, but he loves that he has it and is proud to wear it. It also came with a certificate that says if you lose it within the first year they will replace it for only $10, which is a nice extra because that's a real possibility for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD WATCH","review":"I bought this watch for my grandson for his 8th b-day.

The first time his grandparents bought it for him. He loved the watch and wore it daily. The description says it is water proof, so I let him wear it while swimming. It stopped working the minute he got it wet in the pool. I felt bad since I had let him wear it (even though it stated it was waterproof) so I purchased another one for him so his grandparents wouldn't know it had gotten broken. He only wore the second one for a few weeks, and it also stopped working. This time it wasn't because of swimming, I don't know what caused it to quit working, but after that I called it quits with this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Watch","review":"My son has had this watch for almost a year now. He is extremely tough on it. Several times he has forgotten to take it off when he got in the shower and it still works fine.

Did that in The Office and in Extras.I'm sure some people will find this series riveting. I find it dry and dull. Perhaps if I didn't already know all of Gervais's tricks, I would enjoy this show more.I ordered HBO to watch this when it first began airing.

Expand on that, to what the unconditional love of a pet can do when one's life is at a major low point-- it is a special kind of magic-- and you will know how touching this book is. I warmly recommend it to ANY person who loves, or has loved, a special pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole same ole","review":"To be fair, Ive heard a couple other songs from My December and I was more impressed with those.

Now we get another angry break up song. Are we going to be subjected to this torture all over again every time Kelly has another break up? The chorus to Never Again comes across as whiney and screechy, and I swear, even after hearing the song several times, I cannot remember the melody to the verses. \\"Never Again\\" does not show any growth as a songwriter and its no wonder the single fell out of the top 10 so fast. Obviously Im not the only one with a bad opinion of this song. But to her credit, the song \\"Sober\\" which radio is now occasionally playing, though Im not sure if it has been officially released as a single, is a much better song. Lets hope that \\"Never Again\\" is just a minor blip on the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the biggest pop-rock headscratchers of 2007...","review":"First three times I heard this, I was like, \\"It's OK.

The book is a collection of stupid things written by college students, and you will be amazed at what an \\"educated\\" person can believe.The only downside to the book is the way the errors flow into one another.

For instance you might be instructed to ask your inner child a question by writing it with your dominant hand. Then you answer the question with your nondominant hand (e.g. for many of us our left hand that we don't usually write with). There are also exercises that involve your internalized Parent (nuruturing, protective, critical, etc.)The exercises seem to be a blend of Art Therapy, Transactional Analysis and Gestault Experiments. As such the exercises can be somewhat risky since they bring up intense feelings.

She's the kind of person you read about and wish for as a friend -- especially if you like big mountains, bold adventures and brave dogs. This is a great book for those knarla river guides out there, or just about any woman with a love of the outdoors who wants a little inspiration and insight into their own journeys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very honest book, but Pam can do better","review":"I read this book, and felt the same as some of the other reviewers- this book feels very self conscious. Then as I got towards the end, my opinon changed- this book is incredibly honest. I can relate to her feelings during some of her adventures, and her expressed concerns would be similar to mine. My problem with this book is the 'believability' factor. Who has the time and money to do all the things she's done. I find it hard to believe that this is one person adventuring out on her own. I got the distinct impression that she was sponsored by her publisher who arranged all these trips for her so that she would have something to write about. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it takes something away from the feel of the book Also, what happen to her marriage? She alludes that it broke up, but gives no more details. Based on the last story, I can see why she is no longer with her husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about a little less of Ms Houston?","review":"I should have sat in the book store and read a couple of these before I wasted my money. She finally writes a non-fiction book (although I think all her stuff is \\"non-fiction\\") and it comes off at best like bragging, at worst like outright lying. The feeling of neediness I get from this woman makes me cringe. We're supposed to believe she's tough, strong, independent, gutsy. I sense that she is the exact opposite. I just wish she'd really, finally come clean about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"self absorbed and narcissistic","review":"The good writing in this book -- there is some -- is lost in the author's self deception that she is some kind of major literary figure. In fact she is nothing more than one of the many young people who came out of the Iowa MFA program with an inflated sense of self importance and a few good stories. This book shows her stretching hard for something that just isn't there. A pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Missing","review":"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book from the libray. I LOVED \\"Cowboys....\\" it had really touched me inside; I felt like the author really understood the types of experiences I have had in my life as an outdoors woman, and the men I have known. \\"A little bit about me\\" was a huge disapointment. It felt to me more like writing as therapy, or journal entries, than stories that I could connect to as I have in the past. She does mention doing some therapy, ( which is always a good thing) but I found something lacking in this book, perhaps a sense of something deeper than \\" I did this, I have done that...\\" Only in two places did I find the \\"Pam houston \\" I was looking for: There is a fabulaous paragrash in the introduction where she talks about NOT climbing the Grand Teton, and the dog stories. The dog stories are absolutely marvelous; it's worh checking this book out just for those bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorption is her weakness","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I love Pam Houston and found the stories in \\"Cowboys Are My Weakness\\" to be among the best I've ever read. This book, however, needed a good edit. While I want to admire Houston's directness, I find her obsessions with such things as her weight and her boyfriends (or lack thereof) very off-putting. It was like reading an endless \\"Cathy\\" comic strip."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enlightening--if Disjointed--Collection of Essays","review":"As a journalist and as an author of fiction, Pam Houston has never been afraid to be an explorer. This collection of essays covers topics as far-flung as the topography and culture of Bhutan and as close to home as American women's obsession with weight. In every case, Houston's writing exemplifies the virtues of honesty and clarity.Some might find the collection a bit disjointed (especially those who know Houston's work best from her story collections, \\"Cowboys Are My Weakness\\" and \\"Waltzing the Cat,\\" which share tremendous thematic unity). The fact is that the pieces in this book were written at different times, for different audiences (diverse magazines) and those differences show.The central thread of this collection, though, is Houston's efforts to understand more about herself. Many readers will sympathize and identify with her, as they are ravished by her brilliant, lucid prose. Pam Houston is definitely my weakness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disturbing memoir.","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be a good one to begin my winter hybernation with. Instead, it was a fast ride to nowhere. After a while I wanted to stop the author and say, \\"slow down, take a moment to feel your life deeply,\\" for the author is always moving. Husbands, lovers, pets and friends come and go throughout these essays. Her closest friend lives thousands of miles away in Boston, so there is little intimacy there. The marriage that fell apart is mentioned once, never again. In the Bhutan essay, when she experienced a moment of intimacy with her guide she discarded it with the admonishment to move forward; always move forward. All this running around, or running away, wore me out and left me empty. It made me sad that, at the end, the only serious, long-term connection was with her dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out-of date, canned viewpoint and not very realistic","review":"Don't let the title fool you, this writer's tale is so insecure and sheltered ME is the biggest topic in her life.

Then, in typical Atkins fashion, many of the recipes are so high in fat also, even when it didn't seem necessary. I know it's the holidays and all, but perhaps we might want to at least maintain our weight at this time of year, not gain it! The book chapters were also different--not your typical meats, desserts, salads, etc., but highly specialized. I didn't need a whole chapter on Mexican foods or sauces.Obviously, I was very disappointed.

The costume was this exact one, but in a size too small for him. We could not find one locally anywhere so I went online and found this one at Amazon.

I've read Neal Stephenson's books and he is a very, very good author. This book is bad. The story is extemely disjointed. It jumps all over the place from character to character with no sense that things are coming together. And things don't come together. It's a very disappointing book. Rather reread Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, Zodiac or the Baroque Cycle. Even The Big U is better than Cobweb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read.","review":"This book, despite its newer publication date, is a re-issue but is entertaining to read. Neal Stephenson and his uncle, George Jewsbury, under the name J. Frederick George, created a tale of intrigue set during the first Gulf War which is relatively fast-paced. Stephenson's talent for characters and entertaining narrative are evident. Like some of Stephenson's other books, especially Snow Crash, this book is easy to read and enjoyable.

The book itself was a huge disappointment. The characters spoke in \\"clever\\" cliches and were described with unoriginal, flat sentences; the narration was painfully clumsy; and the characters themselves were impersonal and impossible to empathize with.

It said at the top \\"half human, half vampire\\"and it sounded interesting. This a lot diffreernt from other books because this book is not about some guy killing vampires for money. It's about a woman trying to find her past.It was boring for about the first couple of chapters then it got interesting and I became addicted to it. It was boring at the start because I thought the book was about something stupid. I became addicted to it when the real story started. It gave me mysteries that I wanted to find out.

Pleeeease! This book fell down flat on it's face. The action ...doesn't keep you interested. The main characters are severely lacking in, well, character. The best thing about this book is the artwork on the cover. If you want better vampire reading, pick up Linda K. Hamilton (Guilty Pleasures, etc) or Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (A Candle for D'Artagnan, A Flame in Byzantium, etc.). This book just dissapointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dhampir (Noble Dead Saga)","review":"This is a really good read. It had me hooked with some action in the begining before they started telling a story about everybody.

As soon as I finished I started the next book Thief of Lives if that tells you how much I liked it.

I am though a vampire book junkie. I can't help it. The book has an interesting concept. I love Dhampir but none really can write them well. I liked Magiere and Leesil a great deal that is one part of the book that I did like. I liked their prior relationship and how they have worked together.What I didn't like was the story, if was weak at best. It felt jumbled together as if the authors had these wonderful character to introduce but didn't know how to do it. The Plot of the story was confusing and sometimes dragged out and not truly believable.I do however like the latest installment Sister of the Dead-which I highly recommended and it maybe the true starting point of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it...","review":"While the review on the cover states its like Buffy meets LotR, its not lol.

For the most part, this third installment is action packed and extremely well-written. After having read the first three installments of the series, I must admit that Turtledove is at times a little repetitious, yet this does not detract from the compelling storyline. It would also have been nice if Turtledove centered part of his plot in the southern hemisphere (Latin America, Australia, Africa), since most of the story transpires in Europe, North America, and China. Overall, I would say this novel was highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marathon series continues","review":"Turtledove keeps up the pace in this third installment of the WORLDWAR SERIES. He is able to maintain the same level of quality that was seen in the first two books from the series (IN THE BALANCE and TILTING THE BALANCE), and able to invent enough new scenarios and produce enough excitement to keep the reader turning the pages - as well as create a fireworks spectacular-like ending, to keep readers moving on to the next book in the series.While the interwoven storylines basically follow the plight of the characters introduced in the first two books, a few new characters are introduced in this volume, and a number of the main characters do end up getting killed off, as the war escalates (I won't spoil things by mentioning exactly who does bite the dust)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a useless book","review":"This book is completey useless to anyone who is programming J2ME.

This is a great bag. The full-length zipper makes it easy to get your mat in and out. It's large enough to hold my extra-long, extra-thick yoga mat, and long enough to keep a strap coiled on top of that inside the main compartment. It has a block compartment and two other pockets, one with a velcro flap made for a phone or mp3 player (roughly the size of an iPhone) that has an audio jack opening, and a zipper pocket that I keep my wallet and change in. The fabric is a thick canvas that feels really durable.Two things: the block compartment is made to fit a 3x6x9 block, not the standard 4x6x9, and the strap isn't adjustable as advertised. I've actually never owned a bag with an adjustable strap so that wasn't a big deal for me.Bottom line, I can use this bag to carry everything I need for a yoga class, and that's exactly what I want a yoga bag to do.

I really enjoyed this read. The characters were very life-like which enabled a person to relate to everything so easily. This book detailed both past and present relationships between women and how they change over time. Changes made because of experiences, the men in their lives etc, but the key is you cannot forget where you come from.

It has proven the most useful book in my library. Navigating the maze of commentaries through the whole theological spectrum can be daunting and a guide is absolutely necessary. Dr. Bauer highlights the best commentaries/dictionaries/whatever ese you want and highlights their strengths so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. I have found the books purchased on the recommendation of Dr. Bauer to be the best resources in my library and invaluable in my own study,teaching, and preaching.

I think that Kraggerud polished and fluent style, not \\"showing\\" the virtuosity of the score, is one of the best ever heard in recent decades and by far more interesting that the Kavakos, Stern and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organ donations","review":"Another exercise in repetition transcends the highly methodical approach, as pipe organ fluctuations weave an intricate path formed from the simplest of transitions. There is something to be lost, but gained as well with these different translations. Whether you prefer one aesthetic over another will largely depend upon personal taste, but this is certainly a valid entry in the Glass discography, one that paints the organ in a rare light, and one that should be played tremendously loud upon a meditative state like so much of his work, and all good work for that matter.

I had to read part one and chapter nine of this for a class on the parables. I appreciated his way of bringing forth the issues surrounding proper handling of the parables. However, I'm not sure that this is the best reference for understanding the issues surrounding form and redaction criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"I read the first two chapters, poked through the third and fourth, and read the commentaries on a few parables. I found this book very frustrating and nearly useless. Blomberg spends the first couple chapters tediously presenting sides to an argument that is largely irrelevant to any one other than long dead german theologians. If you are concerned with whether parables are parables or actually allegories or metaphors and whether they must contain one point or more, than you might be interested in this book. Reading this book after familiarizing oneself with the studies of Ken Bailey and Tom Wright is sort of like reading an alchemy book after digesting the discoveries of Newton and Einstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got this book quick and wanted to sent it back quick.....","review":"I have been a nurse for 18 years, I have many certification review books CPAN,CCRN and CEN.

I avoid eating it, of course, but mistakes still happen, especially at restaurants. I carry this with me everywhere I go, and if I take it right away it mediates some of the effects, especially the stomach pain I experience when I eat gluten, as well as the immune system response (puffiness, swollen lymph nodes) that I get.

What makes this a REALLY BAD idea is the fact that they are shipped flat with the glue covered inside surface laying on top of the pad that is stacked below it. As a result you need to spend alot of time cleaning the outside of the pads it get the glue off to make them usuable. I should have just returned them.

My copy of this book is literally falling apart from re-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile reading that takes you along on an adventure","review":"Huntford has acheived his purpose of writing an engaging tale of adventure, while placing the reader in the prevailing historical mindset of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening analysis of events","review":"Until I read this book, I used to believe that Scott was one of the bravest of Polar explorers. Now, I know what a complete idiot he was. The book clearly and in my opinion, unbiasedly, explains his shortcomings and clearly demonstrates that he was the wrong person to lead an undertaking of such immensity. This book also made me realize what a great explorer and leader Amundsen was. All in all, a refreshing analysis of the two expeditions. This book gives you two great stories for the price of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the finest books i have ever read on any subject","review":"huntford holds no punches as he describes the backrounds of both scott and amundsen. leading up to their actual treks to the south pole is both gripping and agonizing, as the outcome becomes all too apparent. these men are polar opposites. amundsen is a man of education, able to find learning in every situation be it a success or failure. scott was a man of appearances, all surface. never was a man so poorly placed as he, a bungler led up through the ranks for everything but his competance.the story is written so well, with a perfect balance between their history and the actual trek to the poles. it is an exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentially a biography of Roald Amundsen","review":"This is an updated and revised version of the book originally published in 1979. Thrilling. Amazing. Wonderful. It made me interested in polar expeditions of that time. The book is not concentrated on the race itself - it is essentially a biography of Roald Amundsen, the greatest polar explorer of all times. The book should draw your attention, because it is so much different from the Anglo-Saxon polar literature, which glorifies their own heroes, whether or not they deserve that. In particular, Robert Falcon Scott is notoriously pictured as hero, a fallen angel, a victim of circumstances and/or others' unfairness. Oh yes, this is very British. The story is fascinating. In summary, a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging story marred by pedestrian writing","review":"The intertwined stories of Scott and Amundsen are dramatic reading for fans of exploration and the polar regions, but Huntford's plodding, judgemental style diminishes his book. I would have expected tighter writing and more judicious use of sources from a professional journalist, but I guess he needs a firmer editorial hand. I was particularly irritated by Huntford's unsupported psychological judgements, and his strong tendency to cast every act of Amundsen's in the most favorable possible light, and every act of Scott's in the worst. Nonetheless, it is useful to have the stories told in parallel, and this is certainly this account is a useful corrective to the myth of the heroic Scott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with extreme bias","review":"This account of the race between Scott and Amundsen has an amazing amount of factual material and could be riveting if it hadn't been so full of prejudice and blatant dislike for Scott.There is no queston Scott was not as prepared as he should have been and is to be held in some degree acountable for the deaths of his men, but the author's undisguised reviling of the man and near heroic worship of Amundsen (who was no doubt better prepared than Scott) makes the reading annoying to the point of exasperation at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huntford lunges for the jugular","review":"Although this book was well-written and exhaustively researched, I am wondering why Roland Huntford wrote it with such hatred. He tears Scott apart, sometimes jumping to unwarranted conclusions. Even if he does think that Scott sat in his tent, staring at a companion and willing him to die, he should not put such an idea into a book as a fact. Huntford paid little or no attention to the fact that Scott did have supporters and friends such as Edward Wilson and Apsley Cherry-Garrard. He was *not* unswervingly pigheaded, panicky and stupid as the book makes him out to be. Although this book was informative and made a much-needed point, I think that Huntford would have been better off presenting facts, and turning his point away from Scott's throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last book on earth...twisted facts, and damn lies","review":"The central theme of this book, (i.e that Captain Scott was a blundering idiot) has been exposed as nonsense by a series of recent and well balanced books written by expolorers such as Ranulph Fiennes and Antarctic researchers such as Susan Solomon, rather than amateur critics. Read \\"The Worst journey in the World\\" if you want a proper account of the Terra Nova expedition. But if you really must buy \\"The Last Place on Earth\\" then also read Antarctic explorer Ranulph Fiennes \\"Captain Scott\\" which exposes it as a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A parasite!a disgraceful ability to use limited facts with a biased fairy-tale!in order to simply sell.","review":"If you have enjoyed this story,and it is a story!!of this man who with commendable conduct,achievement and courage,you owe all of the featured oates evans wilson and scott to read ranulph fiennes\\"CAPTAIN SCOTT\\" clarifying and extremely detailed FACTUAL account of evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful study in leadership","review":"If I were still a military commander, I would require every one of my subordinate officers to read this book. The story is so compelling and fascinating that it reads better than the best mystery novel. By the time you are done reading it, you will \\"know\\" these historical figures like old friends. But, aside from that, this book is a powerful study of leaderhip, character, relationships, and even culture. The book evoked in me a strong period of self-examination...in whose footsteps was I treading?Certainly, there are controversies surrounding Huntley's conclusions, and his treatment of Scott. I suspect these issues will be debated and disagreed over for years to come. Huntley's attacks on Scott may be, at times, overly biased. I won't pass judgment here, but rather I would encourage the reader to judge on his or her own. I suspect anyone who reads this book will want to read more about the men of antarctic exploration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewritng history","review":"This fascinating, compelling and very convincing book is unfortunately a completely inaccurate picture of Scott. By reading the diaries of the original expedition members and 'Captain Scott' by R.Fiennes you will recieve a much more balanced account of what really happened on Scott's last expedition. Fiennes rips to shreds all of the spurious claims in this book with hard, concrete facts supported by written evidence from all concerned. The myth of Scott ignoring dogs as a mode of transport, endangering his men, being an incompetent naval officer, foolishly choosing five not four team members for the pole push etc. etc. are all shown to be figments of Huntford's imagination. This book is a great read but also a great wrong. Indeed, Peter Scott took Huntford to court for misuse and misrepresentation of original material. Scott won the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation","review":"Sad to see so many glowing reviews of this book.

I reall;y like the searing setting. the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the cleanup! Cleaning the top grill is clumbersome. Don't buy the Grill Power book that you can bundle with this unless you are chef and have one huge pantry! the recipes are anything but easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after first use","review":"As the other review mentioned, mine was broken after first use of searing. I followed the instruction, but after first time use, it kept giving me error message and would not work. In addition, it is really bulky/heavy and takes up quiet some space. I returned mine, and will not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well, PITA to clean","review":"I very much like this grill. I don't use it for steaks anymore but for chicken it does WONDERS. You have to use a meat thermometer to ensure you don't overcook. But with that slight bit of effort this makes the moistest chicken breast I've ever had. People scoff saying.. ugh. you make chicken breast on there? but quite frankly there isn't any better. I tend to make whatever pasta or curry or whatever on the stove but will make the chicken in here. Turns out wayyyy better.Biggest downside, and I mean HUGE downside is the cleaning. the top especially is very difficult to clean. You end up with charred crumbs falling inbetween hinges, and onto the counter. Inevitably ending up on the shelf where you store it. yuck. Easily 10+min to clean it after each use. The white plastic feet also fall out of the bottom repeatedly.. and after awhile you just lose them??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in principle, Poor in fact","review":"I agree completely with the other reviewer who notes that this is a very delicate head. Be warned. It is great for fine positioning of the camera. Great for studio work. BUT I travel with my gear, have to hike to remote locations, work in poor conditions (sand, dirt, wind) and the head has two problems -- very delicate, as mentioned; and prone to drift. I do a lot of timelapse work, and over time, the head can tend to move (along the tilt or pitch axis). Very slightly and quite smoothly, but still noticeably.The main issue is that this head cannot standup to abuse. Mine failed within three months -- I suspect after manhandling by airport personnel.Finally, the gearing mechanism is not -- as far as I can tell -- thoroughly sealed against the elements. If sand or salt (as in salt water) gets in, you're doomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping, courageous tale, steeped in realism","review":"Written by Master Sergeant Raymond F. Flaherty, a Special Forces member and veteran of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, He Didn't Say Good-bye is an action-packed novel following the stark challenges facing Special Forces members and their families. When two Special Forces Master Sergeants volunteer for an assignment in Laos to search for downed USAF pilot Jake Barton, their mission quickly takes one shocking turn after another. A gripping, courageous tale, steeped in realism, He Didn't Say Good-bye is highly recommended for military fiction connoisseurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else, nothing worthwhile here...","review":"Not well written.

Enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, love this book","review":"Very very enjoyable and I really learned something. Fascinating women, all. I knock off one star because I wished there were more pictures or images of the people and places- I ended up googling images on my own. The writer refers to several images that are not in the book and it was kind of frustrating. Also in the Kindle version you have no idea which page to go to for photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"Henry VIII has always been in my mind. I recently went to London and actually bought this book in the Westminster Abbey gift shop. I watched the showtime series \\"The Tudors\\" and fell in love with the story. This book was so good I didn't want to stop reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about Henry VIII and his six wives. I cannot stop telling people about Henry and the six wives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining History","review":"I really enjoyed this history of Henry VIII's wives. It was well written, interesting, and well researched. It's facinating to realize how much history has been saved through letters written during that time. If I had any quibble with the book it would be to agree with another one of the reviewers who said that the timeline was sometimes confusing. The author would jump forward and backward in time when talking about each wife. For example, she might discuss banquets that were thrown over a period of ten years and then hop back to talk about clothing from the beginning of those ten years. I wish she had used more examples of \\"three years into their marriage\\" rather than actual dates, because I sometimes had a hard time grasping how much time had passed between wives and events.Other than that it was a very informative and well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Royal Novel!","review":"The Six Wives of Henry the Vll is a good read. I read this book not to long ago and it gives all the information on all six of his wives. Reading this book gave me things I never would of known if I hadn't read it.

The author does an absolutely brilliant job of pulling the reader in and making one feel as though they personally know each character and are right there as the past unfolds. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb overall. Some strange opinions, but highly readable","review":"Well-written account of Tudor King Henry and his bevy of females. MS Weir proposes some highly questionable interpretations -- such as her conclusion that Henry did not sire Anne Bolyn's sister's \\"bastard\\" -- but, in the main, this is a dynamic book and well worth the cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating ....","review":"I found the level of detail in this book simply fascinating. I am not a history buff but found it really interesting to compare my own life with the life of a royal woman in the 1500's. Certainly know which one I would choose! I have also read David Starkey's book on the same subject and found Alison Weir's book to be so much better researched and not at all prejudiced towards her subjects (as flawed as they might have been). I also recommend Alison Weir's \\"Eleanor of Aquitaine\\" - different time period but equally fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book","review":"I loved Katherine of Aragon, hated Anne and couldnt take my nose out of the book. All his wifes are different and exciting to read about. Im looking forward to the kids of Henry VIII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb Work","review":"When I purchased this book, I was skeptical because I thought it might be another dull book about English history. I was absolutely wrong - this is a great book! Weir does a great job of telling this story. It is not six separate biographies. Instead, Weir weaves the story of each wife around the life of Henry VIII. Ann of Cleves is a particulary sad story, and she comes across as the most likable of Henry's wives. On the other hand, Ann Boleyn is portrayed as a scheming, ill-tempered snob who constantly meddles in the affairs of state, which ultimately leads to her unfortunate death. Henry is accurately portrayed as a controlling and sometimes distant husband and father. You won't be disappointed in this book - it's one of Weir's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a guy!","review":"This is a very unbelievable true story of how a self centered, egotistical man uses women like he would use toilet paper. It gave me a whole new perspective on how women were valued solely on the proformance of they reproductive systems. Henry's wives were used as royal breeding machines to produce a male heir for him. When they could not accomplish that task they were conveniently gotten rid of. It is a sad yet startling book. Weir gives the reader a real feeling of being there experiencing all the events. Sometimes a little to real for my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing detail","review":"This was a great and fluid read, Alison really did the history justice by bringing the characters alive. I recommend this to anyone looking to add depth of knowledge after watching Showtime 's Tudors."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, I enjoyed a lot. love my Kindle too.","review":"Glad I purchased this book on my Kindle as well, I enjoyed reading this story very much. Glad to have supported a good author with my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even if history's not your thing","review":"I love this book and I hated history all through school--even in college. It reads almost like a novel. I can't put it down! It's giving me a new perspective on history and it makes me want to learn even more about other times as well. Now I want to plan a trip to England. I'd recommend this book to any history teacher or a parent who needs to instill an appreciation for history in their students."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Six Wives of Henry the VIII","review":"This is a great book and very interesting. After seeing The Other Boleyn Sister I was anxious to read what really happened. A little drawn out between his marrage to Katherine and Anne but considering it took almost 7 years I can see why. He was a tyrant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compeling, Lively and Easy to Read","review":"Alison Weir writes well, tells a the story superbly and weaves what is an intricate tale beautifully. Having read Antonia Fraser's books on Tudor England and Scotland, I thought I had read everything. This book proved me wrong and offered me insight into these compeling characters as never before. I recommend this book to everyone - students, adults etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating insight","review":"Having initially read the autobiography by Margaret George, I decided to read this to gain another perspective. The styles are very different but the story remains compelling. Alison Wier takes a very different approach to Margaret George, but the result is no less worthy. It is interesting to contrast where the two accounts differ, but in the vast majority of cases, they back each other up but seen from a different angle. The story slowly unfolds and even though you know what is going to happen, you want to read on to find out why or how. Because of this I often found it hard to actually put the book down and get some sleep! I feel I have now read two very good accounts of Henry, one giving his version, the other more from the side of the wives. This book provides the intrigue and illustrates the politics of the time and how in many cases people had little choice in their actions. Fascinating reading and highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"English history for the not so dumb","review":"I can honestly say, sadly, I was never taught this in school. But could the teachers have taught as well as Ms.Weir did? I don't think so. She makes these people who only show as words on a page, stand up and take shape and become real, living, breathing,and some headless, human beings. It's like watching a movie that you've seen before, you know the outcome,but you hope the characters will win in the end. Read it and be enriched! Thank you Ms.Weir"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple, straightforward and complete","review":"Alison Weir does a fantastic job of bringing each of Henry VIII's wives back to life. By tracing the lives of these women through childhoods to their deaths, this story truly centers on them, rather than the fact that they married a king. Weir also does a nice job in remaining fair to each, although at times her biases come in to play, the information given in each case is balanced, or at least attempts to be. Furthermore, Wier is complete. In one easily read volume, a wonderful framework is given which one not familiar with the content can be comfortable with. But then she goes further, giving detail upon detail, making this book not simply an overview, but a complete study. While Weir often repeats herself from one chapter to the next, the overall product is still excellent. For anyone interested in knowing about Henry VIII and his unfortunate wives, I suggest you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soap set in the 1500's","review":"This book made history very interesting. The author's information came from archived letters, so it is not just the opinion of the author. The book follows Henry VIII childhood and covers all six marriages. The book describes each of the wives history and what happens after the marriages. The book is better than a modern day TV Soap, arranged marriages, affairs,executions, power struggles, religious conflicts and politics from the time period. The book also showed different sides of the characters, for example Henry VIII seems at times like a tyrant, and then a pawn in a political game, with his court trying to deceive him for their own benefits(a deadly game). I also enjoyed the when the author included the cultural and geographical history as well as information on the residences of the King, Queen and Court."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal History","review":"I love reading history about the Royals. Of course, everyone thinks of Henry VIII and his wives. It was interesting learning about the wives instead of the man. I don't know if I would have married him given his track record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical treatise","review":"I read this book after watching the series \\"The Tudors\\" on Netflix and loved the author's effort to report historical accuracy.

I think Alison Weir keeps a even balance of the personal and political lives of the monarchy interesting, especially when the political aspect can be dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put it down","review":"For a nonfiction historical account, this book is amazingly captivating. I bought it to take on vacation and found myself picking it up every time I had 5 minutes to read. I've read about this period from a variety of nonfiction and fictional accounts, and found it interesting where they don't line up. Weir does an excellent job of pointing out these discrepancies, giving different viewpoints, supporting documentation, and rationale for her choice. I felt her treatment of Katherine Howard was a bit judgemental, but on the whole, her characterizations derived from the facts served to make the book emotionally involving and significantly added to its readability. This is the best account I've read of the period, both from a factual and readability perspective, and one of Weir's best as well. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging from First to Last Page","review":"Another testament to Weir's hard work and writing style, this book is chock full of relevant research to support the tale woven about each of Henry VIII's six wives. I'm not one to read non-fiction but my interest in British history has led me to Weir's books and I was not disappointed. A large portion of the book is dedicated to the stories of Henry's first wives (Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn) but that is not to say that the other four were skimmed over. On the contrary, I was given a good look at each of these women and what attracted them to the King and to the people. The book flowed well and was not difficult to read at all.

If you're expecting a film along the lines of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, you're going to be disappointed. Lots and lots of scenes showing characters running through the jungle, plus some cheesy gore effects and a naked \\"monster man\\" with inept makeup are about all you get here. DEVIL HUNTER is for completists only, and even most of them will feel cheated.

As with most Franco films, there is little or no tension, poor f/x and a lot of female skin. Not one of those \\"video nasties\\" like Cannibal Ferox or Cannibal Holocaust: just tame and meandering. Being a Jess Franco film, it looks like it was shot in a day and a half; he's Europe's William \\"One Shot\\" Beaudine. So if you're hungry for a \\"good\\" cannibal film, look elsewhere; this one can wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches Easily","review":"One main reason to use a filter such as this is for protection of an expensive lens. Obviously one wants excellent optical quality, so multi-coating is necessary. I have used filters such as this on all my lenses with great success, but I am disappointed with this filter. It scratches very easily when compared with other brands that I have used. I would recommend a high end Hoya or Tiffen. If you are a high end user, then go with a very expensive brand such as B+W. (If you want to be a perfectionist, don't use a filter at all! Just be prepared to buy replacement lenses more often. Truthfully, I've never had any issues with image quality when using a good filter, but I'm just an amateur who has a day job to support my habit.) Bottom line, I would suggest another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain to clean, loose construction.","review":"It looks fine and doesn't hurt image quality much but it is a pain to clean.

Though satyrizing the televangelist movement was a worthy target, Salvation comes off as a cross between the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Marjoe.

The scene at the end, when Keenan Wynn's character is castrated, is painful. There was no apparent reason for the heroine to go stark-raving mad at the end, and it made no sense that she showed absolutely no emotion when the Indian (Henry Silva) was shot at the movie's end, and tried to reach out to her as he was dying.

It was extremely difficult to start the filter on the Nikon 18 -200 mm VR zoom lens. It wanted to cross thread and after finally getting to start threading it would bind at and then loosen with each turn. I thought it could be the threads on the lens but after trying another filter I was apparent the Sigma was the problem. For the price I would expect much better quality control in manufacturer. Essentially junk in my opinion. Be extremely careful installing on your lens, if you purchase this Sigma, as you can easily cross thread ruining the lens in the process.

However, the major disappointment occurred when the series concluded!I was hooked the moment actor Richard Armitage introduced himself as Claude Monet. The acting was impressive, the music was perfection, and the cinematography was absolutely stunning. The icing on the cake was the placement of the actors in \\"actual\\" settings where many legendary paintings were created followed by images of the actual artwork.I plan on ordering two more copies as gifts in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Good","review":"I had initially bought this based solely on the fact that Richard Armitage is in it. I was not disappointed. It is an incredibly engaging piece dedicated to the life of Claude Monet and his circle of artist friends of the time. I did not know much about TI before this so it was a wonderful lesson in art. The most enjoyable parts were when the paintings we all know so well had been brought to life right in front of my eyes. The subject, the surroundings, the story behind the paintings were revealed. We know them so well today as the greats but here we get to see the struggles they went thru at the time and how they were treated by their contemporaries. It's one that I've happily added to my DVD library and would watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"As breathtaking as their paintings","review":"What an absolute joy! I've read a great deal about the Impressionist movement but the artists never came alive for me they way they did in this film. Everything -- the acting, the cinematography, the music, the editing -- combined for one of the most beautiful, enjoyable and informative films I've ever seen.

BRAVO!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Disappointing","review":"If you enjoy watching paint dry, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, save your money.

With autobiographical regard, the pianist tells how she met Faure's music, then Faure himself, who nurtured her indefatigable performances of his highly charged scores. Marguerite Long clearly did the rest of us a huge favor by her passionate promotion of Faure's music, seemingly advancing its worth nearly singlehandedly into notice and esteem. She is a constant witness in speaking of the absolute importance of his music, and Faure's oft-spoken personal kindness and deeply set spiritual mastery leap off the page memorably in Marguerite Long's more than able prose. I came away from this slim book of reminiscence with a firm fix on Faure the man, and certainly his music. The story of Long's and Faure's artistic friendship is an attractive one for what it reveals of both the making of art and the forging of memory.

Kelly Minter gives the reader the feeling that we are looking at Jesus as the everyday man like us and also seeing him bring life and hope to a very normal everyday situation the way God does. You get the feeling that Jesus is concerned even about the small things in our lives. You will never read the story of Jesus's first miracle in the same way.

Tivo wouldn't offer me a refund after advanced technical support promised to extend my warranty until their engineering dept could provided an upcoming patch. When the patch failed to fix anything, they told me to change my Internet provider(like I could if I wanted to) or that I was simply out of luck. They offered to cancel my tivo service, but no refund. Amazing ineptitude.When DVRs work they are really cool. But buyer beware. There must be better DVRs out there.

But after the first year I questioned it's worth before renewing the subscription. What did it do? It copied programs, provided a program schedule, provided speed control Slowmo etc. and would record shows following what you choose. If you have cable or satellite you already have a program guild and after a few months of use I turned off the selective recording, ask it to record football and any program with foot and ball gets recorded and in less than a week your 80gig is clogged. So I let the service lapse figuring that I could record the programs manually, if there was ever any over time it always cut it off. Well no, if you do not subscribe that function is turned off and your TiVo unit becomes a boat anchor.

Tivo is still unable to give a delivery date for my replacement unit.They claim this \\"warehouse problem\\" has no impact on shipping of new units. But I wonder whether buyers considering Tivo for holiday gifts should beware.The technical problem that caused my unit to fail is instructive. It seems that if a drive has a bad sector that does not contain data when the machine is shipped, the unit will be unable to fix that sector in the future.

After installing TiVo I had no problems with missing any of my shows again. I record on average about 10+ hrs of TV a week and now with TiVo I only watch about 8 because its so easy to skip the commercials and have control of what I am watching.I have this TiVo box working perfectly with my DirectTV box using the IR device. It is so easy to use that a child could pick up the remote and be working TiVo flawlessly in minutes.I would give TiVo 5 stars, but sometimes TiVo just seems a little slow for me.

Stagger your watching of a show - join it like 20 minutes later and zoom through commercials. Watch what you want, when you want. A quick setup and you don't have to rush home to see Project Runway. It will be waiting for you. Tell Tivo you love Elizabeth Taylor - got it. It'll find Cleopatra showing at four am. I have never had mine die or reboot or anything of the nature.Once you get it, you'll never go back to the way it was - especially since the prices keep falling.

I turned on the TV and Tivo was stuck at the restart screen. I unplugged Tivo, waited and plugged it back and it got stuck again at the same screen. Checked the support pages on Tivo.com and basically it tells you to do same steps I did and if that doesn't work, you need to call the Customer Support, which I did. The gentleman on the phone told me that it sounded like hard drive problem and I needed to return. And guess what, there is no warranty by Tivo for my Tivo product I purchased on Amazon.com. I'm returning this item today because I don't want to deal with getting this box fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device !","review":"We bought an identical device for personal use over two years ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it. While the broadcasters would prefer we sit through endless commercials and watch programing at their convenience rather than ours, we prefer to be in control of our evening leisure hours; and the Tivo allows just that. The current purchase was a gift for our son whose work hours preclude much live evening viewing and whose leisure time is valuable, but who does like to keep up with some television programming. And, he loves the device as much as we do. We recognize that with digital and HD programming moving forward rapidly the analogue capability of this device may soon be obsolete for many technophiles -- but who cares. We're not interested in magnificent on screen presentation, just a decent picture at a time that better suits our needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I absolutely love my TiVo!

Very easy to use after a little practice, much easier than most VCR's. It's wonderful to set up some \\"Season Passes\\" and come home at night to find that Tivo has programs recorded waiting for you! My only complaint, and the Tivo Customer Service says they haven't heard this much, is that when the Tivo calls in on my phone line to update, it knocks me off the Internet. Yes, I have the filter on the phone line. I have DSL Internet and this is not supposed to happen. I've had to unplug the Tivo when I'm on the Internet and I know that it's going to call in to update. Other than that, no problems. With the rebate, it was literally free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, but customer support sucks","review":"We are a multi-tivo house, but I'm not sure if we will buy another tivo in the future. Tivo has this new Tivo ToGo feature that should be great, but the rollout of the software is taking forever (multiple months). If you call customer service they cannot even tell you when the new software version will be downloaded to your Tivo, or where you are on the list.Tivo's software is great and I've never had any problems with their hardware, but if someone can come along with better customer service, I'd switch in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with multiple 80-hour TiVos","review":"I have owned a PHILIPS TiVo for over five years....love it and have never had a problem with it. I decided to give two brand new 80-hour TiVo's as gifts this past Christmas (manufactured by TiVo, not Philips). I ordered them through Amazon.com. BOTH TiVo's developed technical problems within hours of their first use and had to be sent back to TiVo for exchange, and one of the replacement TiVo's developed problems as well. That's THREE bad TiVo's out of four. I'm still waiting for one of the replacements. I am quite concerned because I purchased very expensive lifetime TiVo services for both of these gifts. Of course, the \\"lifetime\\" service lasts only as long as the life of the TiVo box itself...and at this rate, that life won't be very long. I'm VERY disappointed with these new TiVo's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every home should have TiVo!!!","review":"Excellent product that will truly revolutionize TV viewing for the masses. Great price point and \\"bang for the buck\\" compared to other options, expecially for those who have analog cable.

Loyalists stuck with them, and Apple is still around and doing better than ever. TiVo will be do the same thing - it will be around for quite some time. 4+ million subscribers can't be wrong...So don't wait.

I don't have a land line in my apartment, and, although I ran guided set-up elsewhere, it wouldn't work when I plugged it in at my apartment, and would not work with the wireless card I bought from TiVO. Now I have to run guided set-up with a land line AGAIN. I have called TiVO customer services multiple times and each time had the customer service representative treat me like a total idiot.

After 31 days the audio on my unit began buzzing. After over 1.5 hours on the phone with customer service (much of which was on hold) they finally agreed to exchange my unit for a factory renewed. I'll have to pay my own shipping and insurance to get it to them and I'll still have a used unit. This is a marvelous idea that will probably go far, but not in the hands of a company like TIVO.To learn how they DON'T stand behind their product see their website at http://www.tivo.com/exchange/tivodirect/index.asp.Thankfully I did not subscribe to the service under the lifetime deal - the lifetime is the lifetime of the machine.

For example, the first poem (Three Sunsets) should have 19 stanzas and cover 8 pages in the book according to the Table of Contents. On my Kindle Touch I can only get 5 stanzas if I make the text as small as possible. That is what fits on a single page on the Kindle.

It is by far the most in-depth book I have read on water needs and dehydration concerns as well as covering an often overlooked malady of hyponatremia or sodium deficiency. The author, when not speaking from his own vast experience, draws upon prominent researchers in heat-related studies, toxicology of venomous creatures, and search and rescue personnel. I especially liked the section on Desert Survival Myths which debunks useless methods like the solar still and explains what really works in a survival situation which other books over the years have failed to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Need This Book!","review":"Tony Nester offers a no-nonsense survival guide to folks heading into the desert regions of the world.

Not a very sturdy bulb so you might never get the 10,000 hours. They do give a nice white-sterile light, but I prefer this type of lighting because I read a lot in my room. They start off a bit dim like most CFLs eventually peaking about 4-5 minutes.

But some of the graphics are pretty cheesy becuase when you destroy a painting or flag, it usually just disappears and you don't see anything on the ground!

I forgot how truly awful Trident gum is.I bought a box of Trident, a box of Wrigley's and a box of Orbit all at the same time so I could really try them all out. The worst was Trident.Each piece of this gum is tougher, harder to chew and lasts a fraction of the time the other two gums last. After a short time the Trident gum starts to make the inside of your mouth feel like it's being burned. It's intolerable. It has to be spit out. Whereas, the Orbit and Wrigley's keep their flavor for much longer, don't burn the inside of your mouth and are soft to chew.I wouldn't purchase Trident gum again, any flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 Acre Unit works better","review":"I bought two of the 1/2 acre size and they worked just fine.

That's not the kind of image we should be wanting promoted about us. Don't we get enough badgering from these terrible music videos and how we are portrayed in motion pictures?

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Priscilla Bashing!!!","review":"This book made me angry...as both an Elvis AND Priscilla fan, I expected to learn more about Priscilla than I had learned from Elvis and Me, instead all Suzanne Finstad seems to be interested in is Priscilla bashing. Throughout the book, Elvis is seen as a saint, while Priscilla is described as a \\"sexpot\\" (that is even the title of a chapter) It is ok for Elvis to have slept around, but Priscilla \\"should have known better\\". Supposedly, Priscilla at 14, even slept with a man just to be introduced to Elvis. This of course came from a man who probably would say anything to make himself look cool for sleeping with the King's future wife. Suzanne Finstad basically accepts every negative comment ANYBODY says about Priscilla as the truth while rarely ever quoting anything positive that was said about her. Elvis, although he was the King, was human, and so is Priscilla. Priscilla should be treated that way, rather than exploited because of her beauty and other peoples jealousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Trash","review":"I'm ashamed to admit that I helped Ms. Finstad make money off this trash by buying it. Her jealousy and contempt for Priscilla Presley is obvious. I'm sure there were many many women heartbroken when Elvis married Priscilla and this book reads as if Suzanne Finstad was one of them. Why don't people just accept Priscilla's account of her life with Elvis. After all, she was his one and only wife.I think Priscilla should be commended for the way she protected her daughter's interests instead of being bashed and accused of cashing in on Elvis. She is nothing but a mother who did an outstanding job to secure her daughter's inheritance. I praise her and would have done the same thing if I had been in her shoes.If you are an Elvis & Priscilla fan, pass on this one. This book is nothing but an attack on Priscilla. It's awful and poorly written. Read Elvis and Me instead.Shame on those people who believe this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book bothered me. The descriptive stories of a twenty-four year-old man entertaining and seducing fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls are really quite sickening (WHERE are their parents!). Another reviewer wrote that one couldn't blame Priscilla for the choices she made. Yeah, one could. If Priscilla is as smart as she seems to be, and as perceptive as described, she had to have known, even in her teens, that none of this was ever going to work out. There were just too many signals that should have made that apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing","review":"I watched the TV series \\"Elvis and Me\\" about twenty years ago, and I confess that that was all the knowledge I had about Elvis and Priscilla Presley.

As with everything related to Elvis, there are so many versions of everything relating to him and his life, that I wasn't surpised this account of Priscilla was no different. People either seem to love her or hate her based on what they've read. Until this book, I never gave much thought about her or the circumstances leading up to how/when she met Elvis. I was shocked by some allegations that Priscilla was sexually active at such a young age and how it seems her parents pushed for this \\"romance\\" to develope. I didn't have an opinion one way or the other about Priscilla before I read this, and I still don't, other than to say I think the whole story of both of them is very sad.

I feel for a young girl who is expected to be a virgin while her man does whatever he pleases. Mrs. Finstad does not use an impartial veiw in this book, she spews chapter after chapter of venom towards Priscilla and interviews more of Priscilla's enemies rather than friends.

This is one woman who is NOT as innocent as she has portrayed herself all these years . This book was well researched by the author and gave me a look at a woman who basically took one of the greatest talents of all time, Elvis Presley, used him for his fame and wealth, turned her back on him, and profited after his death. In the book her brother-in-law considers it \\"totally unfair\\" that she is characterized as a \\"bad person\\".

In truth I learned nothing more than what I already knew other than a bunch of \\"facts\\" involving her sex life that I could have cared less about. The book continues on for several chapters with details of whom Priscilla slept with or fooled around with. The author also paints Elvis as this love sick man (in his 20's), and Priscilla as this conniving, scheming, sexually aggressive 14 year old. Yea, I can see how a 20 something year old man can be completely manipulated by a child. Seriously who cares if she was a virgin or not when they got married? I know i don't and never did. In short this book is garbage, it paints Priscilla in a very unflattering light, is made up of speculation and the author also steps in as a psychologist and over-analyzed Priscilla's every move from 11 years old on. I feel guilty even reading this trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"After reading mostly rave reviews about this book I decided to purchase it.I was greatly let down.The author rambles on and on about \\"he said she said\\" and spends pages and pages debating on how exactly they met, was Priscilla indeed a virgin, etc.It was not at all what I thought it would be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Presley is \\"a piece of cake\\"!

I wish, for her sake, she would stop trying to be \\"someone else\\" and just be \\"herself\\"; people would then have more respect for her a a person..I can now certainly understand Lisa Marie a little better (who I respect tremendously because she is \\"honest\\" about who she is)......A must read book for any Elvis fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Source of comedy","review":"Some other students and I had fun laughing over the absurb things in the book.

I have a previous edition, and love it because the English is so natural and the explanations are so clear. But the examples in this one, while perfectly natural in the UK, require a lot of explanation on my part. FOr example, \\"He's having a shower.\\" That's an example of present continuous tense. Sorry , but American's don't speak that way. Also stuff like, \\"It's the shop in Davis Street.\\" I have spent so much time teaching that we say ON a street, not IN it and the British English contradicts me. It's very subtle stuff, most of it, but it's more common than you'd think. Almost every page has examples. Unfortunately, my student has already written her name in it by the time I noticed. It should clearly say that it's for speakers and learners of British English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This is a book well suited to both beginners and intermediate English students. The grammatical topics are well discussed but the exercises do not pose any challenge for the learners, in fact, this is the reason behind my four stars rating. Despite of being sometimes boring, the exhausting exercises of this book will help you to learn the main topics of the English language as regular workouts can help you to be in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then the first...","review":"Well, after reading Born In Fire I didn't have much hope for Born In Ice but it was so much better then the first. These are the first Nora Roberts books that I've ever read. This is the 2nd book of 3 in the \\"Born In...\\" series & I really enjoyed it. In the first book you were introduced to Brianna & this book is her story. She is running her bed & breakfast in Ireland when a writer from America comes to stay at her inn. He is there for several months while writing a book. During his stay him & Brianna begin a romance that neither of them expect to continue once his book is completed. This was a very peaceful & enjoyable read. I recommend this book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trilogy to be read by anyone that enjoys good literature.","review":"Nora Roberts has an amazing talent in that she can makeher characters come alive. So much so that if oneof them were to walk into your home you would mostcertainly recognize them. Your only regret will probablybe that they are only fictional and that you willnot be able to meet them.This series of books are by far the best that she haswritten so far and even those who would never becaught reading a romance novel will find them mostenjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Book in this Trilogy","review":"Out of all the books I've ever read, Grayson Thane is the first leading man that I found most annoying and very unlikeable. He was moody, selfish, immature and spoiled-brat selfish. Brie certainly deserved better than that. At the very end he seemed to be a lot nicer to her and hopefully when they marry he will change for the better. I read Born in Fire and didn't think Maggie was likeable at all in that book, but I did like her in this book. Rogan was always a likeable character. The reason why I kept reading this book was because I wanted to find out the punchline and to know the history/background to be prepared for the 3rd book in this series, Born in Shame. Otherwise I would have quit reading the book because of annoying Grayson. It does make me want to go visit Ireland though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So dull, I couldn't finish it...zzzzz","review":"I have read rave reviews about the Born In... trilogy, so I grabbed the first one I could get a hold of, Born in Ice. I slogged through the first six chapters, then skimmed the rest. I found both lead characters just incredibly dull. They were so repressed, every emotion seemed buried under a thick woolen sweater. The heroine spent most of her time cooking and hanging out laundry. The hero wrote things he didn't want anyone else to look at. Even their lovemaking was subdued and furtive, a struggle under the blankets and then quick smooth things down so no one else will notice. I would say they weren't only born in ice, but they stayed that way, too. I ended up skimming the book because these characters, and their tenuous story, just could not interest me; I found it a very realistic portrayal of some very uninteresting people. Rabid Roberts fans will of course not agree, but I didn't care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"From an Irish point of view...","review":"I generally love all of Nora Roberts' books, but this series is painful. Admittedly, Born in Ice is better than Born in Fire, but it's still bad. My main problem is that it's set in Ireland and unfortunately, the author is completely unable to write Irish dialogue authentically. It's full of stereotypical Irish sayings which no-one in Ireland says (except to tourists) and for some reason the heroine starts to speak in Gaelic when she's all passionate.. I can't really see that happening.. BUT I still gave it 2 stars as opposed to none because I recognise that it may not be as irritating for other people.. but it definitely irritated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born in Ice","review":"I love all of Nora Robert's books, and this one was not a disappointment. Her descriptions of Ireland have the reader drawn there - dying to visit, entwined with the characters, and enraptured by their love.This is one of my favorite Robert's trilogies - they're more enjoyable to read than isolated novels, and by the time you've completed the set, you feel as though you know the characters very well.Another well done Robert's novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort...","review":"I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get \\"Born in Ice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i have come to expect from roberts","review":"i hated the heroine. i thought she was insipid and boring and i had not idea why the hero fell in love with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessed event retold 'kid' style.","review":"The Bible tells this story several times - the meaning all the same.

Here is why I think it's not worth the money:It is literally pieces of plasticy paper on sewing thread.It is large a size to attach to a crib - baby can reach and pull these down.It does not come with any sort of holder, so the only option is to attach to ceiling (how?) or to another mobile holder, although that would be just tying the thread to a holder, so not very sturdy.Would have been better to have all black sheep and 1 white, as the all white sheep with one black look very bland and white, especially if you have white walls and ceilings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best","review":"Out the hundreds of motivational/self help authors in the marketpalce today, Michael York is one of the best.

I was amazed at the intricacies of the stories about the different birds on the island.I found myself being upset with Emma for having wanted to give up her life with Jack and Nell to live a totally different kind of life. Stevie was a character that I could totally understand her ways after having three failed marriages; it would be easy especially for a writer/artist to become reclusive. Yet, I would have to agree that Stevie was NOT the type of person to place a sign in her yard \\"Please Go Away\\". That part of the book was not believable. Too bad that Stevie and Jack hadn't gotten together in the beginning instead of Emma, but, then we wouldn't have had the adorable Nell.

I was happy with it right out of the box, but as soon as I threw it in the pool, I knew something wasn't right.

He seems to think highly of the Orthodox and even the Oriental Orthodox but goes after the Papacy and such repeatedly. I noticed he never mentions the Orthodox killing a bunch of Latins (Catholics) before the 4th crusade when the Catholics had their bit of revenge with the sacking of Constantinople.There was a lot left out...and when you get to the 6th disc you find out why he hates Rome so much since they are one of the few that have kept the \\"homosexuality is a sin\\" view.

The videos seem rather low-budget and poorly edited. They are filled with meaningless contemporary scenes depicting people merely sitting or standing on the street with voiceover that has nothing to do with what is being shown. It seems like half of the episodes are taken up with this \\"filler\\" material. In the end, these videos are excellent narcotics. Staying awake until the end of any of them is a challenge.

I had read wonderful reviews regarding this book, and as time travels are my favorite, couldn't wait to read it. While I think Robin Schone is a gifted writer, this story just didn't happen for me. Elaine, the heroine is weak, allowing others to bully her; Charles, the hero did absolutely nothing for me, and the old hag is simply annoying. The author doesn't show us what's happening to Morrigan in the twenty-first century, we're briefly told about it later in the book, which I found disappointing. And I must add, one plot line in particular left me disgusted. I knew I was done when I began skimming through large sections of the book just to finish it. Obviously many others enjoyed Awaken, My Love. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. For a really good time-travel read, pick up a copy of Lynn Kurland's A Dance Through Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers who stated that the book did not live up to expectations. The story was 'darker' and more 'realistic' than I expected - not necessarily good things in a romance. Although Elaine's reactions and fears concerning her travel back in time were realistic, they also made for a very boring heroine. Elaine rarely spoke - which was very annoying. And with two small exceptions, she never stood up for herself. Everyone, including Charles, seemed to bully her. And I found it very hard to believe that she was supposed to be thirty nine years old. Her emotional reactions were more those of an inexperienced teenager than a grown woman. And since she never spoke or displayed any kind of personality, the only reason Charles 'loved' her was because she enjoyed sex - no personal relationship at all. I enjoy travel romances very much, but I would not recommend this one - especially at this price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awaken, My Love","review":"I was dissappointed in this story. I had expected romance with erotic scenes, maybe even something fun. There were too many scene evoking gritty reality that took away from the sensual romance I expected.

She is surrounded by an incredibly cruel nurse, abusive family and was sexually molested for several years by an uncle.

Well, I loved Elaine..and I found Charles to be fantastically sexy..I liked him even when I hated him. However, I wanted to get into his head a little more..I wanted him to soften up a bit sometimes. I will say though that I can understand his hesitancy to let his guard down due to some of his previous experiences with his wife.

Just don't use this video much at all.This particular video seems difficult, without offering much in the way of results. I prefer Richard Simmons \\"Sweating to the Oldies\\" series for a good exercise vid. If I am going to walk, I just go outside in the fresh air. This isn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"70 Year Old MIL Lost 7 Pounds","review":"My mother-in-law has been using this video for about a month now. The first two weeks she was able to lose 7 pounds by exercising every morning and making sure she didn't eat after seven. She belongs to a senior citizen center and raves about this video to everyone she sees--whom she hasn't already told about it.Update: My MIL is still using this DVD, and has lost seven pounds. She recently had knee surgery and had to stop for about 2 weeks; she was eager to get back to using it as she said she feels a difference in her days and her sleep when she does the exercises in the video on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful walking and strength training DVD","review":"I enjoy this DVD. I have an old walking exercise VHS by Leslie Sansone that I really liked. This DVD is updated and is one on one, which is easy to follow. I love that it uses weights, which is great for strength training. The areobic walking is easy on the knees. I think Leslie is funny and the 30 minutes of exercise goes by quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for seniors","review":"I use this video with a small group of young adults with developmental disabilities. We love that it is easy to follow, requires no skill or ability to execute fancy moves, and doesn't take much room or any special equipment beyond and light set of handweights. The exercise is basically walking in place with a few simple added movements to break up the time. It includes some mild toning movements built right into the walking and ends with some gentle stretching. All exercises are done standing, so we don't even need exercise mats! I am moderately in shape, and I even get a slight sweat going during the middle of the tape. I think that in addition to seniors, this is also excellent for folks with disabilities or those who have not exercised in a very long time and need something to get them started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"I bought this for my mother in law thinking it would ease her into exercise by customising for the older adult and perhaps even feature some elderly people. It did not. Though she did say \\"just do what you can\\" as long as your moving. I really didn't feel the title of the dvd was fitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older adults Walk & firm","review":"The quality and colour of the DVD is poor. It is very hard to see.

It is a good program, works well for an over 65 person. Easy to follow; she may talk more than you'd like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed fan of walk workouts","review":"I am afraid I am very disappointed in this video. I do not feel it is really a good workout for older adults as I do not feel some of the moves are suitable for this age group. There are too many squats and lunges during which I immediately feel the stress on my knees. I do not have knee problems and do not want to acquire them. I do other general age group dvd's by Leslie with no problem. Not a good workout match for the target audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"I can't believe the great reviews this book has received. It's absolutely awful! When I first flipped through it, I thought it was such a cute idea for a book; after sitting for a thorough read-through with my preschooler, I realize it just doesn't work. \\"A wave-tossed boat and buoy?, A pirate's eye patch?\\" Great concept, poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn... pass on this one","review":"I struggled through 106 pages before I gave up on it altogether. The book held every potential of a great adventure but sorely lacked in its characters - the whining and vain Stiller coupled with a boorish Tony made for a literary flop. Their trip was doomed from the beginning, the two seemed to be in a state of constant bickering - where was the camaderie? The whole thing begged for credibility and substance. Sorry - just couldn't take it. Save your money and buy Chris Duff's 'Southern Exposure'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One Over","review":"I picked up this book because it sounded interesting and exciting and also in hopes of learning a bit more on Australian culture. I found neither in this book. In fact I didn't even finish (which is very rare).First, this book is incredibly dull. The author goes into tedious details about the trip that are totally unnecessary and slow the pace down. There is absolutely no humor to be found and in fact all the author does is complain.Second, I thought the book sounded exciting and dangerous. Although I'm sure the trip was very exciting, the author somehow managed to make it sound like a visit to your grandmothers house. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZLastly, I was hoping for a little insight on Australian culture. The only insight I got was how the author didn't fit in (probably due to lack of any sense of humor). If your looking to learn a little more about Australia, read In a Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson and skip this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discovering Onomatopeoia","review":"No, that's not another name for Australia. It's the use of words whose sound suggests the sense. Mr. Stiller employs the technique ad nauseum. Never have I read a paragraph that consists entirely of the letters B (1 time), O (6 times), M (9 times), S (22 times), and H (5 times). You can imagine my suspense, which was only heightened by a paragraph on the next page, as follows: \\"Whoooowhhooooouuuuuouuuwhouuuuuuu.\\" This goes on and on.There is a fascinating story underlying the poor writing style. The technique is bad, as is the failure to provide more insight into the effect of the journey on character development. Ultimately, these issues render the book nearly unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"low grade and not all that fantastic.. keyboard cover is model specific. should have went with Mavis.

Prior to getting this program, I constantly looked at the keys which slowed me down but now, WOW!!!! I am more confident about knowing where the keys are and as a result my typing speed has improved. Another plus about this program is that it shows and reminds you how to properly work in your space.... ex:Check your Posture:-sit up straight, back supported by chair and feet firmly on the floor.-center your body to the keyboard and monitor, etc, etc.....-etc, etc.....The program breaks it down that not only does your typing speed improve but that you do it in such a way that your whole experience is positive...That said, the only thing I would improve on are the games..Not very fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No cheating allowed!","review":"This program ensures that anyone can learn to type WITHOUT sneaking a peak at the keys! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed Skin Cover","review":"I purchased the package ($29.95) because the keyboard cover ($10 alone) is required on all of the computer class keyboards at my college campus, where I have to go to take my tests for an advanced online computer class. The cover moves when typing and should be used only as a memorization tool for students, not for speed or accuracy (which many instructors misuse the product for). The program is very elementary and should be used only for the earliest learners. You can only log one user for the program, so it cannot be used for multiple learners at home. Painting the keys (free) and using Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing ($10) is what I would recommend for anyone learning the keyboard, which is how I taught my three homeschooled teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumps up !","review":"Much better than Mavis Beacon. with the latter, I reached a point where I realized I could not improve any more.

Money well spent !"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good software","review":"I bought it for my kids 9 and 11.

No wonder HP is in financial trouble. The drivers provided by HP are totally useless. Called up their \\"help\\" line and got the old \\"you gotta pay cause your warranty expired\\" runaround. ALL I wanted was the info on where to get some useable drivers. The CD containing those supposed drivers is uninstallable. In XP, the OS keeps looking for a file called\\" hpf600.inf. Guess what. No such file exists anywhere. The drivers for the thing are not in the XP driver library either. This thing is far more of a pain in the butt than it's worth. It doesn't even make a good paper weight.Avoid it and HP like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last Bad Support","review":"I bought this copier/printer new a few years ago and used it a few times only as a copier. I recently tried to use it as a printer with a computer. Since it was out of warranty there should be online help, right? No driver downloads, no chat support, no forums. Only a CD driver to purchase and wait a week for delivery. The CD driver took two weeks and wouldn't install, and HP refused to help with that. When I got the CD/driver to work myself, the copier window first said cartridges were empty even though they were new. The machine then said bad printheads, even though they had hardly been used. I wasted a good deal of money on this, and worse, HP's technical support, customer service and escalation team were as arrogant as they could be in refusing any help at all, even though I offered to pay for it. The only courteous person was reassigned off of my case. HP's products, support and attitude are simply horrific. No more HP products for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorter life span than expected","review":"We bought this item new for our office a little over 1 1/2 years ago for $550 (the cheapest price we could find it for at the time) and it served us well, up until it quit working.

The print is mediocre and does not compare to laser. The cost of the cartridges is prohibitive. The shelf life of the cartridges is very short, mine last about 60 days. You cannot use 3rd party cartridges, you cannot refill existing cartridges. I estimate it costs about $7 per color copy. I stopped using because it makes no sense to continue using it.

I learned more about the evolution of the Vietnamese language from this book like I learn about the morphing of a character's personality throughout a novel.DeFrancis does a good job in covering the different cultural influences that have helped mold the Vietnamese language but don't dare consider the langage hybrid!

Since the source of the cricket infestation was directly overhead, I believe that no device would be 100% effective but this did deliver a significant improvement.Ultimately, the Department of Health and a number of stiff fines caused our neighbor to cease importing live crickets into our condominium ... and I have since unplugged this device.

After using this for a few days (less than a week) it wouldn't print because the ink cartridge had dried out. After replacing the cartridge ($27.00) I got a few more days of use before that cartridge dried out too. I actually replaced the cartridge on this maching 5 times in 6 months and I only use this maybe twice a week (printing directions, etc.). The printer is very noisy, almost sounds as if it's broken when scanning and printing. Stay away from this garbage, I've had better print jobs with those $19.00 printers that only print!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, good machine for the price and for the home user","review":"For the price, this all-in-one is fairly decent. If you have more than an average amount of printing to do then I would recommend a more sturdy machine. However, if you are just printing some minor things at home this printer will do the job.

I don't feel good enough about this thing to give it away to anyone I know or try to sell in on eBay. That's how bad it is at printing anything. If you want to pay this much for a scanner, go right ahead and buy it. With the terrible print problem, you can't copy anything without it looking jacked up when it comes out.

The pictures are from the 70's, and not good ones at that.

Just prior to his retirement, in 1983, he recorded the Telemann F minor sonata and a suite in G minor for oboe, bassoon and continuo. On the RC model Buffet-Crampon French system bassoon, Maurice Allard produces a wonderful tone, more broad than the tone he produced in the 50s and 60s. The technique is staggering, and the musicality is sublime. I used to listen to this disc every day.Also included are the Oboe Sonata in A minor and a cello sonata. The other performers pale in comparison to Allard. Even at the mere 35 minutes play time, this is worth every penny of your purchase.

This story was odd that everyone, even the men, wore bright red lipstick. Oh what fun we had with that! Plus, in every new scene, something was a brilliant red.

Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"We ordered this DVD because we saw it described in a PBS catalog as having ghost stores with intricate, twisted plots. We're not into the blood and gore, slasher movies, so this seemed like a great alternative. On the positive side, some of the stories did build up the suspense. It was very hard to follow the plots to the stories,though, and there was always a huge letdown at the end. We suffered through all six stories simply because we had paid for the DVD, and we kept hoping the stories would get better. They didn't. Ghost stories don't need to be bloody, but they do need to be spooky. These stories definitely were not.Two ghost stories that do have twisted, intricate plots and are genuinely spooky are The Innocents, starring Deborah Kerr, made in 1961, and The Others, starring Nicole Kidman, made in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is an awesome product no complaints over here shipping was fast and the product worked great cant wait to buy agian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive spitting","review":"I tried this solder for the first time tonight.

However, after previewing it, I was very disappointed to find that the information listed as fact is inaccurate. Greyhounds are born to run. The \\"dialogue\\" between racers leads the reader to believe that they hate their lives and are treated unfairly, being kept in locked \\"cages\\", not fed enough and forced to choke on exhaust when transported. The vocabulary in this book is also inaccurate. For example, the lead-outs which lead the dogs at the tracks are called \\"walkers\\" by this author. While I believe that the author cares for dogs, I also believe that she doesn't understand the industry and the greyhound breed. This book should not be used as a resource, nor should it be used in a classroom as some of the scenes misrepresent the life of a greyhound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Needed this for college and it was sold at a good price!

Don't ask me to compare them to any band in particular; they have a sound of their own that is somehow reminiscent of a day when everything on the radio wasn't made by kids not yet old enough to have experienced life outside of high school or their parents' house.

The other 1/2 was filled with fairly modern prayers some of which are heretical. For example, on p 176 there is a prayer by Kikanza Nuri Robins addressed to \\"Mother God.\\" On page 180 there is a prayer written by Patricia Baxter pleading with God to bring liberation to women, \\"Why do so many use your name in vain, holding women in poverty and men in bondage to male authority?\\" Whoa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good research, but too much fluff and \\"chicken-little\\"","review":"Take out the fluff and chicken-little-the-sky-is-falling nonsense, and the meat of this book would make up a small pamphlet.

The mints are in my opinion horrible compared to the old style. I will probably give them away or just toss them they are so bad. The flavor is now so heavy and toothpaste / Winterfresh like it is unbearable. Don't get me wrong, I like Colgate toothpaste and Winterfresh gum just fine, but it's like they decided it was a good idea to cram half a pack of Winterfresh flavor into a single mint. Grose.

Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly!

The pianist is known for his warm melodic phrasing and intelligent use of rubato in these pieces.

The left hand obviously has to be softer, but how much softer? We still need to hear it - Rubinstein has the answer to this.

Unless you are a Grand Master, the chess microchip should be able to give you a hard time. As far as variety of options, views, chess sets, etc., this game has very few. I paid [$] for it and I felt it was about comparable to a late 1980s PC Chess game. This seems to have been a game that was put together quickly to make some money, and Kasparov did not care about the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little grammar.","review":"Not all-inclusive like some of the bigger grammars, but the handy size more than makes up for it. Once you learn the basic syntax and morphology, it's time for you to grab a lexicon and find the principle parts yourself anyway... while reading or translating a piece. Ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable resource","review":"I'm very impressed with this grammar. Morwood makes no claims that he is replacing Smyth's grammar for breadth. Instead, the Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek sets out in a very consise and clear manner various paradigms and rules. I particularly appreciate the VERY good verb section - not only providing paradigms for the regular conjugations and types of verbs, but also giving the principle parts of the 100 most common irregular verbs. For someone (like myself) who can never seem to remember all of the irregular verbs that seem to pop up in translations FAR too often, this grammar will become a favorite resource. My only complaint -- I'm sure that my grammar skills have declined as a result of relying upon this book rather than my memory during translations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginners/intermediate guide to greek grammar","review":"A well set out book of ancient greek grammar. Contains most necessary paradigms, and also a lot about various grammatical constructions. Because of its limited size, it does not go into much detail with the grammar points but for someone starting or continuing on with Ancient Greek (inc NT Greek) this is a very handy reference to have. Also contains some useful appendices and an extremely limited Greek-English, English-Greek dictionary. This book is a lot easier to understand than a lot of the old books, eg. Goodwin, Smyth. Also a lot cheaper here than what I paid for it (although shipping to Oz would have cost a bit)."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent book","review":"I am a student in Classics at the University of Bucharest (Romania), this being my last year of studies. This book has fulfilled my expectations. Being a small book, I can take it with me everywhere, and repeat the Greek grammar. Whenever I translate something from Greek and I have problems with a grammatical form, I look into this easy to search book and I usually find a solution to my problem. Of course, this happens when I don't have time to look into bigger and more profound grammars like the ones written by Smith, Goodwin etc. But, as the author says, this Oxford grammar is based on Smith. I recommend this book especially to those who want to repeat the essentials of the accidence and syntax of Ancient Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Can Be Funny","review":"This was the third in Cockey's Hitchock Sewell series and again a very enjoyable book. There were times that I didn't find it as amusing as the other two, but still very much enjoyed the book and will continue to read the series.The main character is by far my favorite.

It was a very entertaining novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cockey Scores Again","review":"Hearse Case Scenario is as good-humored and amusing as its predecessors. It does, however, drag a bit; hence the four stars instead of five. Otherwise, Hitchcock Sewell's latest outing is entertaining and filled, as always, with well-drawn, viable characters. Particularly good are Pete Munger, the former lawyer turned private eye; weary and bewildered and angry; and Lee Cromwell, the Ida Lupino lookalike who sings like a noir dream and (kudos to author Cockey) is sexy and appealing at the age of forty-seven. The book has the usual generous serving of gentle humor and a plot that is so complex that it's all but impossible to forecast the ending. Points also to the author for not feeling compelled to subject the reader to endless graphic sexual scenes. This is a worthy addition to what is turning out to be a delightful series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This set was very difficult for my second grader to string on her own.

It wasn't sharp enough out of the box but after sharpening was very useful. It works well for its intended use of slicing fish and meat. It also can be used with vegetables, especially the softer ones. The knife did a good job in making plaintain chips where some other knives made mush. On the negative side, the finish on the knife is not too attractive, especially once it has been sharpened. Also, a longer blade would be more useful.

In her book she tells you where, when and how to look for candidates for a profitable short sale. With emphasis on the perils of short selling Mrs. Staley clearly points out that this is not a field for the faint of heart. You need to have a knack for raw fear to qualify for the ecclectic world of profitable and very wealthy short sellers.This book clearly is more than a starting point - it encourages you and sets you on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and uninformative","review":"This book will not be useful to most readers. Staley touts shorting-hedge-fund managers and similar folk who can hire investigators and who can delegate maniacally-intensive accounting & financials research.

The book is marketed as \\"a timely and comprehensive reference that arms you with the necessary tools to make a prepared and confident entrance onto the short selling playing field\\".For a book marketed as a \\"comprehensive reference\\" and priced as a reference tool, this book contains very few helpful techniques for sophisticated investors.After initially reading this book, I have not once returned to a single page for reference or advice, unlike high quality finacial reference books like Martin Pring's Technical Analysis Explained or Scott Fullman's Options A Personal Seminar.If you are interested in a general, non-technical review of short selling this book is fine. If you are looking for a in-depth reference source to be used for years to come, this will be disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book says nothing at all","review":"This book, I believe, was written by the author to cash in on the fact that there are no books on short selling. Read about 15 investment books in the last few months. Some good, some not worth the money -- but this was the book that made me feel like being totally suckered. Gives some examples of companies that went bust, and about crashes. But does not even come close to suggesting any strategies or things to look for when deciding whether to short. Instead just says things like: high valuation alone is not enough to short, don't forget to read the SEC filings etc. Duh! No ideas at all. What a scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or Fiction?","review":"The only drawback about this book is that it purports to place history in a realistic framework. Some of the material is factual, while other material is heresay or complete rumor.

Also, after living in the area (San Antonio) for 2 years now, we have found 2 \\"hikes\\" that aren't even in the book! Please don't be expecting any real hikes to be found in the area around San Antonio. They are more just little jaunts and winding paths...some of the hikes in this book are actually major streets in downtown San Antonio!!

You wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"This book was overall disappointing. Some really interesting story ideas and plots were rendered almost unreadable by a wordy telling that came off as immature. The overuse of foul language and sex didn't fit the storyline and seemed to have been written by a fifteen-year-old. Descriptive sections were far overdone in a way that almost made this a skim read for me. My overall rating is 'disappointing' as I would have liked a more concise, mature treatment of the storylines of the virtual rock stars and the underground conspiracy. It even could have included a bit more exposition as to how the national situation occurred. Bottom line, not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"NES SP RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was thinkin about getting an onyx until i saw it an sp that looked like that musty old(but still awsome ) nes i baught this i dont regret it a bit so if you are buying an sp get the nes version!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nintendoh is neetoh","review":"i luv this nuw gayme boy advance SP, it towtelly rools!!! it is just lyke tha old nintendoh cuhntroller with tha cool red buttens and tha graye lynes on the senter!! wyle i dont particulerlie own won i luv it enniewaye!!! it playes sum sweet gaymes and stuff and it is backcumpatable-like with the uther gaymes and stuff!! allsow it is backlit so i can playe in tha dark!! however it is a little uncumfortuble cumpared to tha gayme boy advanse and ya...!!! tha graffix are towtullie sweet fore such a small little thing!!! enniewaye thats it sow by! peece owt!! kryste this thing is cool!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Game Boy Advance SP Classic NES sold by Nintendo","review":"Dope!

I miss Lovecraft style horror and this was right on the mark. I hope Tim Curran writes more books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bermuda Triangle Story from Hell","review":"Tim Curran knows how to scare you and get under your skin. Dead Sea is a great example of his work. Like many of his novels he spends a great deal of time describing things like the fog and the sea. I believe this is one of his strengths because you truly feel the horror of the details. However it can become excessive at times. He comes up with some very original nasty creatures out of your worst nightmare. I particulary enjoyed the spider/ghost woman haunting one of the ships. Overall a very enjoyable novel about a group of hapless sailors trapped in the Curran version of the Bermuda Triangle. They struggle against the many natural and supernatural horrors of \\"Dead Sea\\" as well as themselves. He is not afraid to kill off main characters which may be upsetting to some. A good read on a dark/rainy night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic mix of horror and sci-fi in another dimension","review":"I have to agree with every other reviewer here. This is truly an amazing story. A real page turner that's hard to put down. Only problem was getting past the first 80 pages or so. It seemed like repetitive dialog emphasizing that \\"something just wasn't right with the fog\\", \\"it's not right\\", \\"something seems off..it's not right\\". Once the crew realized that things were definitely not normal, the story takes off. From the giant jellyfish-like creature to the fog devil and the mysterious spider lady, the horrors the survivors face will keep you turning the pages. And once they reach the Devil's Graveyard, you'll be sucked in and glued to the pages. Well rounded characters, strong descriptive writing and just the right mix of horror and science fiction make this epic novel unforgettable. I'm sure glad I found this one and so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's a keeper","review":"I agree with the previous reviews. Yes Curran did go on and on about the mist, but I think it served the purpose of reinforcing the alien threatening atmosphere of Dimension X. This book I could not put down. The monsters were so well described. The desperate situation was palatable. Everyone was expendable and some of the deaths were suprising. All I want to know is who did Curran piss off? This book should have gotten more notice. Curran is a keeper, I'm a fan. One more thing I noticed is that the pages were small font and small margined. I felt that I got more bang for my buck, none of that large font double space one-half inch margin cheat books. I like that, lets me know he's not trying to push less and get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for wheat free","review":"Luckily I read the reviews here first and checked out this book at my library before buying it. If your child has multiple allergens, I suggest you do the same. If you have relied on processed foods until now, this book may be helpful and her tone is certainly enthusiastic. However, if you're experienced in the kitchen, this book is a big waste of time and money. Just get out your Joy of Cooking and omit whatever your child is allergic too and you'll have this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really for Gluten Free diet","review":"This book was really written for people with gluten allergies and for other allergies that are common in children such as eggs, soy and dairy, there was a little note at the bottom of the recipe for substitutions for these ingredients (or a not to omit them completely). What parents of allergic children really need are fresh ideas about what to feed their kids, not some afterthought note about omitting cheese from a dish built around it. A better book is the Whole Foods Allergy cookbook, which has great recipes for people with multiple food allergies. I am sure this book is helpful for people suffering from wheat and gluten allergies, but the title should reflect that limitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for dairy or eggs.","review":"I am thankful that I borrowed this book from the library first. Almost EVERY recipe calls for butter, sour cream, milk, or egg. It is so bad it is almost funny. Example Buttermilk Pancakes - egg free variation: omit eggs. Dairy free variation - Replace milk with rice milk, and replace butter with margarine. All this book has is a collection of recipes that are not good for dairy allergic people with substitutions at the bottom of almost every recipe. I can do this with any recipe I don't need a special cookbook to tell me to replace milk with rice milk. When I read the cover of the book - More than 150 recipes that are: Wheat Free, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Nut Free, Egg Free, and Low in sugar - I have to laugh. O and if you are allergic to nuts this book gives you some truly profound advice: Omit Nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title; not GF/CF","review":"This book claims to have more than 150 recipes that are wheat-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, egg-free, low in sugar. NOT! The recipes are not free of all of these allergens. Some are free of gluten, some are free of nuts, etc. Most of the recipes have egg & many have dairy. This is NOT a book for kids on a gluten-free/casein-free (GF/CF) diet. Good thing we just borrowed a copy from the library to preview it & didn't actually buy a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not allergy free","review":"Just reading the samples from the pop up for this cookbook reveals that there are allergens in almost all reciepes. Butter is dairy!! You can't make an allergy free cookbook and say just leave out the eggs or use egg free mayonaise. The mayonaise is soy based. More allergens. You will be better off creating your own less complicated reciepes with your own substitutes at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid-Friendly Food Allergy Cookbook","review":"I was a little disappointed that the recipes in this book are not already allergy-free, but one must do the suggested steps to make them so, in most of the recipes. However, I still think it's got some tasty looking recipes, and not all of the recipes are ones that have to be adjusted, so I am okay with it. It's actually for a gift to a mom of a child with many allergies, so I'm hoping she'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people just learning how to cook round allergies!","review":"I like this book for when I have friends over with food allergies. I am GF and am always looking for quick recipes. I like that they have options for replacements in case I have friends with kids over that have allergies. This was not made to be a 5 star cookbook, just a basic no picture grouping of quick easy recipes. Yes a couple suck, but won't all cookbooks have a couple of them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dairy free","review":"Probably a good cookbook if you need to be wheat or gluten free, but otherwise, forget it. The cover is very misleading as almost all recipes include dairy or eggs or both, and the suggested substitute for any cheese is a soy imitation. I think if they just removed the list of the supposedly allergy-free items from the cover, then one wouldn't be so surprised and disappointed, as many allergy cookbooks are not for all allergies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really only for wheat allergies","review":"I was pleased to see at least two other people mentioned this, but thought I'd throw in my two cents.With a non-allergic 4 year old and a 2 year old allergic to wheat,dairy, eggs, fish and nuts, I was hoping to find some recipes that would please both kids. Almost all the recipes have dairy or eggs in them. The dairy-free and egg-free options are just to omit them. Great! Pick up any cookbook for that.I made one recipe from this book and it was awful. (A cake recipe that I had to use 3 substitutions for). There are much better cake recipes out there.This book is on its way to the used bookstore . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only useful if you have a wheat allergy","review":"I bought this book looking for recipes for my very picky son who is allergic to dairy, eggs, and nuts. I was very disappointed, because most of the recipes contained some or all of these ingredients (in spite of the misleading title), then included a note at the bottom to omit or substitute these ingredients. The author would have been better off making it clear upfront that this is a book for individuals with wheat allergies, rather than misleadingly trying to market it to such a broad group of people. One other thing...the book offers no pictures of the dishes it contains. Altogether it was a huge disappointment, and I returned it. I have found that, for my son's allergies, \\"What's to Eat the Milk-free, Egg-free, Nut-free Food Allergy Cookbook\\" by Linda marienhoff Coss, was a much better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I thought this book was going to be full of great recipes for parents who have kids with food allergies.

It has a recipe for Easy Mac that has noodles, butter and a cheese packet. That is the recipe on the macaroni box. Sorry! I feel like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresented","review":"After reading thru this book, I wished I had saved my money. This IS a recipe book with kid favorites in it. At the end of each recipe is a note how to make it dairy free, egg-free, nut free, etc. Let me save YOU some money. In the book, if a recipe calls for milk, cheese, or butter - soy milk, soy cheeses or vegetable margarine is the substitute. If it calls for eggs - use egg replacer. If it calls for a nut oil - use olive oil. If it calls for pasta - use gluten free pasta. If it calls for wheat flour - use rice flour instead. You now have the basis for this books food allergy cooking. (we also have soy allergy so all the replacements of soy and margarine are of no use to me.) The only saving grace for this book is the shopping hints in the front of the book, about 10 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"The subtitle of the book implies that all the recipes are free of the allergens listed, but that is erroneous.

My 22 month old is alergic to wheat, dairy, and eggs, so I have the freedom to use multiple other flours that contain more protein - and I prefer to. It's hard enough to get veggies in him and meat protein is next to impossible.

My son is allergic to dairy, beef, soy and possibly wheat and I thought this book would be my answer to finding foods that my entire family would enjoy. The recipes are not very allergy friendly and simply stating to 'omit cheese' or 'substitute soy' is not helpful. Also it says in the front that Nestle chips are dairy free and they clearly state on the package that it contains milk. What if your child was severely allergic to milk, as mine is, and you did not check for yourself? Truly irresponsible of the author. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had bought a different book","review":"Really disappointed with this cookbook, and I don't even know if I will use it. Really wish I had bought a different one, there are just so many to choose from. The thing about this one is, these recipes are not dairy free and egg free, etc., like it claims, but almost all of them have this stuff in them but with suggested substitutions to the side on some of them. And then on some the author says you can't substitute eggs in this one...well then why is it even in there?? It is deceptive and I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading - not allergen-free","review":"I checked this book out from the library before purchasing and was very glad that I did not waste my money. For a similar value, just pick up any standard cookbook and omit your allergens when cooking. (Allergic to gluten? Simply use GF flour. Allergic to eggs? Leave them out. Allergic to dairy? Use soy.

Hmmm... maybe just... leave that out too?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"While this book would be very helpful to a family suffering from Celiac Disease, there are very little recipes for a truly allergic child. I was expecting a cookbook full of pages with kid-friendly meal ideas that were free of all allergens listed on the cover. Many, many of these recipes call for more than one of the allergens listed on the cover as a key ingredient. I was very dissapointed with it.I have found \\"Balancing the Bowl\\" and \\"The Whole Foods Allergy Free Cookbook\\" to be very helpful when trying new meals for my family, that includes an increasingly picky two-year-old happening to be allergic to milk (dairy), eggs, peanuts, wheat, rye and soy.Don't waste your money on this book unless you are Celiac, and then it would be good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This cook book was awful!

But I couldn't finish it, and I certainly won't be bothering with the next two.While there are some intriguing parts, overall this book was deadly boring and extremely hard to follow. It reminded me of someone giving a speech after accepting a lifetime achievement award: \\"And I'd like to thank Fred and George and Jim and Bob and a whole bunch of other people you don't care about...\\"I managed to plod through about two-thirds of it before I stopped punishing myself and put it aside.

If you love Marquez, do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful introduction to a literary master","review":"I must confess that I have not read any Garcia Marquez and thought I'd use his memoir as an introduction. I'm glad I did. I look forward to adding his novels to my reading list. Where this book was most successful for me was in its ability to re-create an era in a country that to most of the world is best known for its bloody revolutionary past (and current state). While Marquez gives a bird's-eye view of Colombia's troubled political history, he also paints a vivid account of Colombia's thriving artistic community - its salons, sidewalk cafes, and colorful literary personages. His narrative voice is sharply observant, yet warmly inviting, filled with personality and a healthy dose of wry humor.My only criticism is that at times the narrative seems to get a little repetitive and the lineage of Colombian politicians can be a bit dense if you don't have a previous famliarity with it.Now, on to the novels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan Of Memoirs","review":"Lillian Hunter,Fan Of MemoirsWhat a beautifully poignant memoir this is.

Unfortunately, this only describes about 25% of the book. The rest of the book is little more than a list of names. It's almost as if \\"Gabo\\" felt he had to mention every person he ever met during the first 30 years of his life.As an American reader, I found the lack of elaboration on his relationship with Fidel Castro frustrating, though I can understand why he may have felt it was inappropriate for this book.Overall, I came away with a better understanding of how one of my favorite authors was shaped during his youth. It's just surprising how such a skilled writer could put out a book including so many pages of tedious irrelevance.I recommend the book for avid fans of Garcia Marquez, but I doubt anyone else will be interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I guess Gabriel Garcia Marquez is enough of a legend that book reviewers will fawn all over him even when he writes a mess like this. There is just very little in this book that is interesting. It seems to be random memories in no particular order of people and places that aren't particularly interesting at all described in an endless string of cliches. I'm sure these random anecdotes are fun for the author's family and friends (who actually have some idea who all these people are who get mentioned for a paragraph then dropped) to read, but for the rest of us, who cares? I gave up after struggling about half way through when I started dry heaving after I read this amazingly bad line: \\"I had to take the trip back and forth several times during the four years of the baccalaureate and another two at the university, and each time I learned more about life than I ever did in school.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A most disappointing ramble through time.","review":"This is a hard core, cult book. I never could get into this book. I gave up after days of reading flat and dull stories about people who were hard to follow and weren't really worth the effort . This book is very slow paced and rambles on and on. I kept asking myself, is there a point to this story? Did I miss something?Gabriel García Máquez, in this book, reminds me of listening to an elderly person drone on in a monotone for hours of people, places and events from their obcure , distant pass. You tell them that you have no idea what they are talking about but they just keep on until you have courage to excuse your self.

After drifting off to Maconda, or agonizing over the long love affair in Love in the Time of Cholera, or being spirited off to so many of the places in his stories, Marquez gives his readers the oft-denied chance to peek into the true-life origins of his characters, locations and story-lines. Absolutely fascinating and wonderful. I'd be hard-pressed to suggest reading this first, only because the magic of his previous works are so wild and fabulous - reading that reality had some part of those stories might detract from the magic. Nevertheless, this is a stand alone work."},{"rating":"2","title":"gabriel garcia marquez, at its best","review":"These book is what it wraps it all. His life is so important, because it has a direct effect on his other novels and short tales. I have read some of his other books and is amazing how his life experiences relate so much to the way he writes. What I like the best of these and all his other books, is the way he can describe situations and things, and makes you be part of it because of these vivid descriptions. For example in his autobiography (Living to tell the Tale) says a lot about stories that make such an impact in his live, and memory, that later he writes them and that is how extrodinary books come to life: \\"Del amor y otros Demonios\\", \\"One hundred years of SOlitude\\", \\"El otono del patriarca\\", and of course his fist novel \\"la hojarasca\\".Worth reading it, but more worth it if you know his previous novels and short stories.

I believe most devices of the smart media era will be the limiting factor in the link.The plastic at the thick end of the card, where the xD card plugs in, can come apart in 2 halves with little effort (but did not fall apart). The electronics remain intact. This is the only reason I did not give the product a 5 rating.I doubt Gorilla or electrical tape would be out of line to ensure the device stays together, if a person is that worried about it.

Every picture is either too bright or dark and they are very grainy. In addition, sometimes when I check my pictures the phone just turns off by itself for no reason. I believe this is another software glitch.I would go ahead and spend the extra money on a better model if looking for a phone that you would like to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prepaid camera phone","review":"I just traded up to the Wildcard messaging phone and have owned the Cyclops for 3 months and highly recommend it for a basic prepaid phone. Texting is easy on this phone and the red-lit keypad is different from all other phones out there. The bright LED missed call/message indicator is very easy to see and the loud ringer really gets your attention. Battery life is excellent and the external caller id/message alert is nice also. This phone has many of the same features as the more expensive Wildcard,however the same 1.3mp rated camera works like a cheap vga camera compared to the one in the Wildcard. The only real complaints I have with this phone is the case is real smooth and it can slip away in a heartbeat, the camera quality,the installed graphics/icons are simple-minded and I could never get IM to work properly. This phone also has picture messaging capability and a basic internet WAP2 browser. Overall, it's an excellent BASIC phone and I miss using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"$125.00!!!

I checked these reviews and bought the Cyclops since it had some features I liked. After activation and waiting more than the time suggested, I tried to get a signal and make a call, but the signal kept fading out and I was lucky to get one bar every now and then. Since it wasn't usable from my home, I returned the phone. My previous Virgin Mobile phone was no great shakes, but at least I could get a decent signal and make a call. I also have a Sprint phone which is so old it's laughable which gets a decent signal from my home. I really don't know if it was the Cyclops per se or if I just got a dud.

The content is clearly geared toward the beginner in biology, and the text could even be well-recieved and understood by nonscientists. That said, I think the book functions best (oddly) as material for upperclassmen in biology. The scarcity of detail - intended to make the book easier for the lay reader - actually serves the advanced student nicely by avoiding repitition of concepts already thoroughly covered in other courses. This is a physiology text which covers exactly that: physiology. It gets tiring after several years of schooling in biology to deal with all the overlap between classes (I cannot count the number of times I have had to memorize the reactions of the glycolytic pathway, for example), and this book avoids that. Overall, its a great rundown of the important concepts in human physiology, and would probably make a nice refresher for someone who took physiology in the distant past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamentals of Physiology","review":"The book was in a very nice condition.

Along with many previously unseen photographs, Vance has assembled a thoughtful and revealing text, with memorable insights provided by Chaplin's family and noted filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Chuck Jones. Though Chaplin rarely discussed his cinematic technique, the book's unedited 1966 interview with Richard Meryman sheds new light on his working methods. From a critical perspective, the author provides a detailed reassessment of Chaplin's Mutual period (1916-17), with a particularly keen eye toward his later work - notably \\"Monsieur Verdoux\\" (1947), \\"Limelight\\" (1952) and \\"A King in New York\\" (1957). Thanks to the diligent research of cinema historians such as Vance, Kevin Brownlow and David Robinson, future generations will have a better understanding of Charles Spencer Chaplin and his enduring artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema","review":"I thought the photographs of Charlie Chaplin captured his hilarious personality.

I was happy he had a true love in his life and she felt the same way.

As a collector I find it, a very exciting book! It not only list the items but it gives an illustration of the collectibles making it easier to identify when you are looking for them. Zorro hit the TV airwaves in 1957 and with it was a whole avalanche of merchandise. Till now, the only way to do research on the Zorro collectibles was to look at tons of different materials. In this new book, the research has been done for you and you have it all in one place! I find myself looking over and over the book for reference and highlighting the things I have.

Perhaps I'm a bad player, but after I reached each of the last levels I couldn't get the game to end. Or perhaps that's supposed to be symbolic of something.

For this you can open the trunk, remove part of the carpet and hold the antenna base with the other hand) The antenna base should slip inside the grommet.

The base should be bigger so you can rest at least some of your hands in front of the buttons and next to the joystickOther than that, for 45bucks...this is pretty hard to beat, the quality is very good, inputs are accurate, the buttons are not flimsy...cant beat this stick at its price...its just a less expensive alternative to the 100+ ones -- drawback is its size...great stick on a budgetNOT WIRELESS"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Fight Stick","review":"Purchased this item directly thru [...] Although I read reviews that this item does not work with a PC, I had no issues playing Street Figher IV on a PC running Vista 64-bit Ultimate.

The triangle button on my stick started acting up early on and stopped working after 2 months or so. If one button is messed up then this stick is rendered useless, unless you know how to replace buttons. A $40 investment is simply not worth it for a couple of months.

Once you start to play games that require very quick and frequent button presses its time to graduate because soon your stick buttons will fail on you.

Although this book doesn't directly attempt to explain what is going on in the world today, particularly in the Middle East, and in the halls of power in Washington, London, and Riyadh, among other places, it provides so much historical insight into all those places, and all the problems we have there, that it did help me see the world and its problems in an all new light. Finally I understand not only the problems we have in dealing with those parts of the world, but also the problems our so-very-maligned intelligence services have in operating effectively in those places.

I can simply release the tripod and move the camera to the exact angle that I need. It works excellent.

He keeps up the beat through the next few songs, adding vocal snippets or snatches of lyrics here and there, providing quality tracks up until the only disappointment, the final track \\"Nightshift\\".This is an excellent disc to be sure, and the track quality is so consistent and high you'd swear it's a DJ mix.

In the photo, the entire feeder looks red, but actually the container is clear glass filled with red liquid.

That being said, as a long-time fan of the group I was mesmerized by the more recent ballad videos. They look and sound excellent (Marie Fredrickson is as beautiful as ever, which may be one reason I loved the group as a teenager); also interesting to see the evolution of Marie Fredrickson's hair from the mid-80s to the present day. It is too bad that Roxette's music isn't sold or played in the USA much anymore. Largely because of that fact, as a US fan of the group I consider this DVD a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown","review":"The \\"Roxette: Ballad & Pop Hits\\" dvd suffers from what I suppose is poor manufacturing.

These V-Moda's are the best for the price, for ~$[...]..They are a straight fit and stay in your ear for the most part. It's hard to keep them in without falling out while walking fast up and down the stairs, but that's expected. If you're looking to get high quality earphones and plan on going to the gym, I would recommend these...usually with higher quality headphones, any vibration distorts the frequency (E5's or E4c). Also, a much cleaner sound and great surround sound...sometimes for the live songs, the applause sound like it's around you. The Bose isn't as clean and almost a muffled sound (not in a bad way), but this is totally up to you. I would recommend both of them. The design of these is very sleek though. Cord is short, not really sure why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me a while to decide...","review":"Wow! is the only thing I have to say about these earbuds. It took me a while to make up my mind about spending this kind of money on some headphones, but I'm glad I did. The only complaint I have is that the range of the bass is a little lacking.

I was happy with the same day shipment, but not the overall product. I had purchased the pair based up rave reviews, but was sincerely disappointed. The V-Moda Vibe earbuds were purchased to replace a pair of Shure 2c earphones.The Vibe earbuds took about two weeks to completely break in the bass. Once it was broken in, the pair sounded very good, well worth the $80.00. However, after using for three weeks, the left earbud died. No reason. One morning I just put them on as usual and they did not work properly. I attempted to use the pair of my ipod and sandisk sansa as well as a friend's ipod - no luck.I contacted V-Moda by e-mail and they gave me a return address to send the pair for an exchange. To this day two weeks later, no earplugs. I have contacted the company three times, but not a response.Next I purchase some Westones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid sounds, best customer service!","review":"I bought these earbuds back in March 2007, and although they did sound terrible at first, after a 14 hour (I ran them on my ipod until the battery went flat) break in they sounded amazing.What really made the purchase outstanding is when they died in September 2007. The left earbud started losing volume then finally lost sound all together. I wrote to v-moda about it and two weeks later, a brand new pair of Vibe turned up at my doorsteps. The entire warranty process (Australia => Hollywood USA => Australia) was quick and painless.These guys make great earphones, and provide even better customer service. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these cans, but....","review":"The bass response is unmatched. Period. I have noise canceling, open air, and closed air high-end phones and the bass response from the Vibes is exquisite compared to these. I love the way they sound... when they sound.I returned my Amazon pair because of a faulty jack making one channel cut in and out randomly.I just got my RMA pair with the promise that they have refined their manufacturing process, but out of the box, one of the bass channels is dead. This makes the sound space sound lopsided and empty on one side. I'm returning those now. One good thing is that the RMA has been a simple process and without hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down within a year!","review":"I bought these earbuds in April 2007, and less than a year later, the cable got so damaged that the sound only came from the left side! This happened because I wrapped the cable around my ipod whenever I stored it, so the plastic wrap around the cable got damaged, and that was the beginning of the end. Granted, the sound was very good, but still, it's a whole lot of money to pay for a product that will last less than a year, and I don't see why they couldn't produce a more time- and use-resistant design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good, but the cord is now broken","review":"Think twice before getting these earbuds. Like the people reviewing before me. My cord just recently broke at the plug end.I like to wrap my cord around my mp3 player and stuff it in my pocket, backpack, bag, etc. but after a year or so of doing this. The cord starts to weaken and then it finally breaks at the plug end. So if you are one to do this, you might want to stop.I'm disappointed that I know have to buy a new pair. Looking at the newer v-moda models. It looks like they learned their lesson and now use a big plastic cap on the end.Here is a pic from another person's v-moda which is exactly what happened to mine.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B000V5L5MG/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_3?ie=UTF8&index;=3"},{"rating":"1","title":"cord breaks and earphone came apart","review":"i have to admit that the sound quality on these earbuds is absolutly great but thats only if your willing to put up with the disappiontment when they go wrong (which they will)the first thing to happen was the metal part of the earbud came apart at the black band you could put them back together but this kept happening until finaly the internal wire separated and there was no sound, luckily my friend was able to reattach the wire and sealed it up with some electronics silicone.then just as i was getting back into the swing of things i noticed that the chord was splitting near the jack, left and right cable separator and at the earbuds themselves. within a few weeks of noticing this the cable became worse and then the sound cut off completely.these are not worth the money when you could buy a pair of skullcandy inkd earbuds for just 12.99 and they are far more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in-ear phone you can buy at this price range","review":"Very powerful bass response yet still keep the detail of the treble part.Better than Sony Ex90LP.

Great sound for the price, easy fit, stylish appearance. But they are not a good purchase for an active user.After less than two months of use the base of the chord started to pull apart causing as short in one ear. I assumed it was a defective pair and had V-moda exchange them.I've now had the replacement pair for 6 weeks and the same thing has occurred. I presume this is due to the strain caused by regular use when running/exercising.V-Moda has agreed to replace again, but I have not reason to believe the next pair will fare any better - and the hassle associated with the exchange is certainly not worth it. Find a different brand if you like to use your headphones when exercising (as a point of reference, I never had any issues using standard iPod headphones)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work-horse earbuds","review":"These are the earbuds I've been using the most over the past year. While I would not consider them audiophile grade (as they artificially emphasize bass), they provide a pleasant warm sound to most recordings. One thing that I've grown to truly appreciate in a set of earbuds is the durability and build-quality. These wires/wire-casings are virtually indestructible and the connection between the wires and the earbud module are very sturdy so I don't have to be concerned about abusing them or how I stow them in my pocket. This is more than I can say for many of the high-end Sony earbuds which have wire casings that seem to disintegrate within a year. This is a great all-around set of earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Great, Feel Great, But..... DO NOT BUY THESE!","review":"I bought a pair of these about a year ago. They fit nicely into the ear and stay there whether you are on the subway or at the gym. They sound great. About three months after buying these, one ear started to cut out and then stopped working altogether. I liked these so much that I bought another pair and at the same time, bought my girlfriend a pair. Within 3-4 months, we both had one ear begin to cut our and then stop working. I love the look, feel and sound of these but they are clearly flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last long!","review":"Not a lasting set of ear buds. Mine did work longer than most but finally failed in the same manner as all others I've read about. One earpiece is barely audible now. Don't bother asking V-Moda if they offer any repair as they don't. I lasted out the one year warranty though...lucky me. They sound great while they last but I'd recommend buying something else as these aren't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound lacking durability","review":"These headphones are great sounding. I bought them as my first pair of headphones over $40, because i needed something that was strong enough to block out the subway train rattling on my commute to school. I loved them when i first began listening, the bass was warm, the vocals were crisp and clear. But then a week later one earphone gradually faded, and stopped working. I returned them to the store for a second pair, which did the same thing after a week of use. As did the third.I am now on my 4th pair, and i dreadfully wish i could just get my 100 bucks back. I'm stuck with these stupid things and it's been over 30 days, so now i must mail them into v-moda to get them replaced. What a pain!If you are interested in these headphones, i would only recommend them if you are not going to be walking, jogging, or running with them. They are not durable enough to wear while active. not at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best i've had.","review":"I love these earbuds.

I am normally an \\"over the ear\\" headphone guy, but these have changed my attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely sound, horrible build quality","review":"I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care.At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ear bud sets I've ever tried","review":"And I've tried a lot! These fit well (and if they don't, they come with two other size adapters). The sound is rich both high and low. They block out noise very well too, not as well as those with active noise cancellation, but certaintly well enough for walking through a city without hearing all the random noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy Punter","review":"I've had these since Xmas now for use with my iPod & I'm very happy with them. I trawled around various forums looking for the right pair & decided on these & I haven't regretted it. Initially though there is some 'burn-in' to get the best sound, for me a sound that has rich bass. It is also imperative to get a good fit in the ear - they have to go all the way in! I pinch & lift the top of my ear when I insert them so that the seal is snug & the bass is further optimised, because without that snugness I found that the bass can be reduced. Also try the different size earbuds that come in the pack as this will aid the fit.Build quality is good, the cable feels solid & once slotted in I can comfortably wear them all day & enjoy their fantastic sound. When I occasionally go back to other headphones, even ones I previously thought were good, I can really notice the difference in poor build & sound quality.Highly recommended for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"V-Moda Vibe Earbud Review","review":"I have tried a few different pairs of earbuds, and overall, I really like the V-Moda Vibe. These earbuds feature pretty good bass, better than the Shure E2c. High tones are pretty clear, but I have noticed some muddiness with mid-tones. In general, the quality of sound from these earbuds is very good. I have no problem hearing my iPod at low volumes while walking in city streets, although the E2cs have better sound isolation. Even though I have small ear canals, the earbuds are pretty comfortable for long periods of time.The V-Moda Vibe is a good buy for the price. I definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good for Cyclists & Gym Rats","review":"Everything I was expecting in a headphone. I have never been able to find a set of earbuds to stay in my ears while I lifted or cycled due to the shape of my inner ear. I have had no problem with these at all, and the sound is incredible. I listen mostly to rock & metal, and everything sounds clear & deep. Very good bass as well. The only problem is I have to de-earwax the plastic buds (which fit fine b the way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than $40 IEMs.","review":"Pros: They fit inside my ear, block incoming noise, are built tougher than others (both the cord and , look nice, aren't extremely expensive, the sound is excellent (crisp highs and mids paired with very good bass).Cons: The cord is short (no extender included), no clip to wear them without having them in your ears, would have preferred a hardshell case instead of a soft one.Overall: The only way to get better sound is to use over-ear-monitors or a premium stereo system. Regular open style headphones and earphones don't even come close. Considering the price, sound, size, and quality, I am very happy with these and would find it difficult to find something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat Mids Otherwise very nice","review":"My Sansa E280 has a manual EQ so I am able to adjust for the flat mid range on these earbuds.

But I don't see the point in shelling out $100 for quality that doesn't last. That sounds conflicting in itself, but that's exactly what I experienced. The plug-in is very delicate. I read somewhere that you shouldn't curl the earphones on ur ipod, like we all do, because it creates tension in the plug-in area. My v moda died just because of this. I was so dissapointed!! because I was careful about my earphones for that very reason. I mean, the cloth protection and all gives it a sturdy look, but it all makes no sense when the earphone breaks down from the inside when everything else looks picture perfect on the outside...now how is that sturdy??

For any who has trained with Suzuki Sensei, or in Japanese karate would know that the terms that the commentators use are incorrect. The most frustrating thing is that even when the DVD was sent back for a better copy it came back with the same errors in playability. I am surprised that Amazon would sell such an untested product.

The micro ball head bore (screw top) is too large for any camera I own. It appears this ball head may be for another type of camera (video) although I cannot find anything in the listing that indicates what it is used for. I've had to order another head to work with the Manfrotto tripod. It is too bad because this is a solid head otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"requires a Milwaukee 48-20-5077 for use with an SDS hammer drill","review":"Part of Milwaukee's Large Hole System, I did not know such things existed until I searched for a way to avoid star-drilling tankless water heater vent holes in a cinder block wall.In 10 minutes or so with an appropriate rotary hammer, this makes nice round holes in cinder blocks with less effort than imaginable.It is rated for drilling in poured concrete, and debris removal for such jobs is reputedly a challenge which I intend to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap. dont buy","review":"it says os provides drivers--WRONG. it crashed my computer and i spent 3 hours looking for the drivers. 25$ down the crapper. very poorly designed. shop elsewhere. i cannot say more what a waste of time and money this was. pci card didnt really fit in the standard pci slot. for god's sake stay away!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Title - Poor CD","review":"This CD is billed to be a collection of number 1 hits of the 80's. Only a few titles are even recognizeable. Most are unknown songs by unknown artists (and for good reason - they are terrible!) The CD itself is very poor quality. Sound is badly muffled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent cd","review":"I have many 80s cds, but this one is not one of my favorites. I essentially purchased it for the one song by Rocky Burnette, \\"Tired of Toein' the line.\\" The other songs on the cd I skip right over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Serious Kiss","review":"I really liked The Serious Kiss by Mary Hogan. For her first book, she did a great job making her characters believable and easy to relate to. Although I haven't had to experience all of the awful things that Libby, the main character, had to go through, I can sympathize with her. I feel very lucky not to have an alcoholic father who loses everything and forces our family to move to a retirement trailer park with a grandma that i've never met in the middle of no where. But most of all, I am extremely happy not to be Libby and have to leave my house, school, best friend and almost boyfriend. This book makes you really think about your own life and hopefully realize like I did, that life isn't always as bad as it seems. Things could always be worse ot could even get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Zappa","review":"It is usually a treat to view Frank Zappa in his prime. His premature demise has left a hole in modern music. He was a humorist and a serious composer at the same time. The live music is still fresh and engaging even though it is twenty years old. The only disappointment is that there wasn't more of the concert to view. It is highly edited and interspersed with interview segments that highlight his views on life in general and humor in particular. The void that remains behind after his death will never be filled appropriately. The world lost a visionary when it lost Zappa who even in death remained cynical as he was buried in an unmarked grave in Golden Gate Park. Who will tweak the uptight and bloated souls of society now that he is gone? At least we can see this video and remember clearly how perceptive and biting his humor was. There will never be another one like him. Does humor belong in music? I think everyone knows the answer to that question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zappa in Shorts?","review":"Yes, Zappa in shorts. I am no prude, but to see him on stage wearing a pair of shorts doesn't seem to personify professional musicianship. It is almost as if he has a defiant attitude that he could care less about it. Overall the artistry of the DVD appears that the musicians aren't on stage to perform music, but to simply act outrageous and odd for the camera. Rather immature, not entertaining. I would rather see a concert toned down a little. I saw Zappa at the Palladium 1988 and I was amazed at how low key the show was, I felt very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Zappa DVD","review":"I'm a little disappointed that there weren't more full songs, but as with most Zappa products I am happy with what I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like ZAPPA...","review":"If your a Frank Zappa fan this is a great DVD to add to your collection! Great price and great audio quality make this a winner! Very funny as well. Awesome performances from Frank and his band!

If you owned a legit copy already, hey you could have it on DVD now.The high points are definately the concret footage, I wasn't so fond of the FBI warnings and all of the corporate logo stuff, but I'm sure some people dig that kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it Humor if Nobody Laughs?","review":"Does Humor Belong in Music? Well, that depends. A more relevant question to help you decide whether this DVD is for you is, Do you think Frank Zappa is funny? I myself don't really think he is, and I am hardly alone in thinking that. If you are one of those people who disagree with me, you may like this, as most of what you get in this DVD is FZ 'humor'. There is very little Zappa guitar soloing here.To me, this document underlines the reasons Zappa more or less lost his credibility with so many people. His arrogance and attempts at humor really undermined his real abilities as a guitarist and frequently interesting compositions, and for the most part the problem only got worse over time. Here we see him in 1984-85, so the problem is fairly advanced.Summary, using only FZ titles:Q: Does Humor Belong in Music?A: Shut Up & Play Your Guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I received FUJIFILM recharger. and no batteries.","review":"shipping was really quick butI received FUJIFILM recharger.and no batteries.feel like I got cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of funniest animation series EVER!","review":"Any of the Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes will no doubt have you rolling on the floor laughing.

Originally intended as a Karloff-Lugosi vehicle, \\"Werewolf of London\\" is worth a look for Jack Pierce's influential makeup. Character actor Henry Hull delivers a strangely unsympathetic performance in the title role - little helped by Stuart Walker's flat direction. The lack of atmospheric set-pieces make the 75-minute running time seem like an eternity. \\"Werewolf of London\\" truly needed Boris and Bela's potent star power."},{"rating":"2","title":"achieve sick score and over on all levals","review":"if you use my codes that i put you can beat the game in no time. perfect balance flight mode and moon phisics is all u need to finish the game. first you need to fly perform a bunch of flip tricks in the air without touching the grond till x19.5 apears then do a bunch of grab tricks wile in the air you can skate 0 on the game clock but be carefull if you take to long the game will end you can also use fly to sect tapes,hard to get money and items. you can also make your guy fly around without a skateboard by making him hit something and flying up before he get back up"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was impressed!","review":"I received GBA as a gift and I considered taking it back because I wasn't into the hype and already had a GBC.

I own tony hawk 1 and 2 on dreamcast already so i decided to buy it. but what i found out when i played it was that it was extremely hard to see even in direct light and that it was also extremly hard to figure out the controls. I couldn't get used to the top down camera view and i found it very difficult to complete the tasks asked on each level. everything seemed like a hassle in the game( even grinding on a ledge) and not much fun. the only thing i like about this game is the graffics but other than that i find the whole thing too small to see, too dark, to hard to get used to the controls and overall bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tony Hawk version","review":"I am sickened that the average score for this game based on everyone's reviews is 5 stars. Are you KIDDING ME? First off, this stupid isometric psuedo-3d view is INFURIATING. Good luck lining up those big rails and jumps, or any half-pipe for that matter. You'll have a great time flying off the edge of the ramp because you can't line up your skater straight to the jump. All those objectives that took a week to complete on the console versions will take you a month on this terrible platform. Get used to doing the Start-Retry thing cause you'll be doing it a lot. There's not nearly as many tricks in this abbreviated version, the boards are sometimes truncated as well. Skaters pretty much all look the same (since they're all 1 centimeter tall on the screen anyway). Part of the allure of Tony Hawk was GREAT control and the ability to see the board. All that is gone for Game Boy Advance. Avoid this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CURRENT TITLE!","review":"the graphics beat out the PS, the game controls are great, the levels are awesome (love the old skool warehouse), and simple to figure out, i have both the PS and the GBA version, I like GBA much better!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is the first game I got for GBA and all I have to say is wow!

Get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better ones...","review":"I've had a Gameboy Advance for the past few months, and I would have to say, this game stands out as one of the best. The animation is fluid and the action is exciting. Yes, it does have a steep learning curve...it takes a while to get a feel for turning and doing tricks at first, but once you get past that hurdle, everything clicks and it becomes fun trying to find all the items necessary to complete each level, while also learning how to perform various flying skate tricks. This one gets my stamp of approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for GBA","review":"This is one of the best games yet for the GBA. The graphics and animation are some of the smoothest and just plain best (especially compared to games like Dexter's Deesaster Strikes).Although the game has been toned down from the PLay Station and N64 versions, it still retains some really great playability."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"THPS 2 ROLLS OVER IT'S COMPETITION\\"","review":"This GBA title has been seemingly swept off every store shelf in America. With a huge line of skaters including Kareem Campbell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, and of course Tony Hawk himself. In this sequel you get to skate new areas like School 2, New York City, and Skate Street. As well as enjoying a level from the original, the Warehouse in Troy. With an array of challening tasks to complete in each level, and secrets to unlock, it's no wonder everyone loves the sequel to ,in my opinion the greatest skating game of its time, THPS 1! However I strongly believe this one has outdone its original couterpart. Especially with the enhanced graphics and better play control on the Gameboy Advance! Activision has truly done a great job desinging this on folks. Pick it up as soon as you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game!","review":"THPS2 was my first GBA game and by far one of the best. The graphics and the reality blow most other games out of the water! The boarders have ther own riding styles, air time, and tricks that they have in real life. The tricks can be hard to do, though. Performing tricks can be a random affair; press as many buttons as you can before landing, and hope that the landing is smooth. My point is that the tricks are hard to remember and do more than once. Still, once you get used to it, it gets to be an AWESOME GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Blind Gamer","review":"I think this is a great game. I think althogh the graphics are dark for just a few areas of the game it didn't bother me. I think the gamers who think it is nearly impossible see are BLIND!

The angle that you watch your tiny skater is a little aqward though and it is hard to see object that you are aproaching at sometimes. They graphics (besides the small skater) are extremely good. I guess I can't rip them on the tiny skater part very much because, afterall, it is a very small screen. If you look carefully you can actually see your skater pulling off the tricks. This game is very cool and an essential buy for a fan of the series. If you are not a fan of the series I recommend that you don't buy this and go borrow your friends or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fustrating!!!","review":"I bought this game thinking it was going to be good like the other Tony Hawk game boy I was wrong!!I don't Know but it seems I'm the only one against the view. 3/4 view gets extremley frustrting!

The only downside is the lighting but you will have that problem with any game boy advance game. The graphics are incredible (3-D on a handheld game is brilliant).

Although the information contained within is crucial, the author's writing skills need work. The text is often confusing and occasionally misleading. Occasionally, statements in the main pragraphs are contradictory to the factoid windows peppered on the same page. Likewise, important information found in the factoids are often missing from the main text. Sentences are often repeated in the same paragraph. Grammar is poor - for example, 'You're' and 'Your' are often mis-used. Frustratingly, a large number of grammar errors seem to have been addressed too hastily by the editor, which just makes matters worse.While the book contains a wealth of useful information, it is a chore to read.

The scenery is described beautifully but the important part here is the story itself. I'm not giving away any of the plot but it is a book I couldn't put down. Oprah should pick this one up.

But Jana Cone has taken a true crime story and turned it into a riveting tale. Others can, and have, attest to the accuracy of her research. The pure volume of it is awesome; yet it rarely gets in the way.The Sheila Bryan murder/arson case had plenty of drama built in. Ms. Cone gets right to it in chapter one, where 82-year-old Freda Weeks dies in a burning car. Or does she? That's just one of many questions that may never be answered. Which of the two juries got it right? Or did they both err? The amateur sleuth will have a field day.The author has the unique ability to hold the readers' attention while sticking to the truth. Needless to say, I recommend it highly.Tom Elkins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While this is an entertaining series with interesting characters, a good motif running throughout, there is always something that is inappropriate.

It is so hard to aim because you have to use the D-pad and the joystick at the same time in order to aim while moving. They should of made it like Golden Eye (james bond) where you move with the joystick and you hold down a trigger to aim. The missions are just going around shooting people then collecting a coin after you kill them. And the arenas are tiny. If you like little Deathmatch games with the most annoying aimer I would suggest it.

To start with the good stuff the graphics r pretty good and the weapons are animated nicely. thats just bout it. The single player missions arent even real missions its like a huge boot-camp. all you have to do is shoot peeps and collect stupid coins. so basically the whole game is intended for multiplayer. but since the multiplayer has only two diffrent scenarios (compare to Perfect dark which has like 15). So even if you play 2 player it gets boring pretty fast. the controls are the weirdest i have ever seen in a game but luckily you can change them to a semi-okay setting. Personally i think that if your not going to go online you shouldn't buy this game. It just doesnt have enough stuff that you can do in single player (i beat all single player missions on every difficulty in one afternoon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game [stinks].","review":"Do not buy.

An example of a mission is you have 1:00 to kill ten bad-guys. You can only pick up one gun at a time. When you pick up a new gun you automatically drop your old one. Thier are only 5 kinds of guns in the game. The graphic look like a cartoon and when someone is shot they just flash and dissapear.The game is short and easy and will take about 45 minutes to beat.

Don't get me wrong - it works on the Wii - but why are we back to using the analog stick on the Nunchuck for character selection instead of using the pointing abilities of the Wii remote??As others have said here, it's a very slight improvement on Melee - if you own that and love it, just break it back out and keep playing. Save yourself $50. It reminds me a lot of the Madden franchise - slight changes every year, a little something new, but really not worth upgrading every single year.I'm thinking of trying to sell or trade my copy, too - total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like This Game AT ALL!","review":"About myself, I've never been a Nintendo owner until the Wii. So I've never played any previous versions of this. It seems to me that this game is only fun for people who grew up playing other versions of this. There was so much Buzz about this game when it was coming out, I wanted to get it, which I regret. For me, it got boring really fast. It just seems like more of the same over and over again. I'd rather play Wii Sports Boxing, or even Punch-Out. My young son doesn't seem to like it much, either.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl is easy enough to play and gets better as the player gets better. That makes it a game that my son enjoys a lot. He can play it without direction from an adult. And it's fun for me to play, too.The graphics are beautiful. The sound is great. But I don't think this is quite as much better than the Gamecube Melee as I had hoped it would be.

The amount of Nintendo history and information is really mind boggling.

The 3D graphics are insane. The thing I like most is the rumble effects so it makes the brawl or melee that you are in more lively. The Subspace Emissary is a great sector of the game with amazing clips that will leave you stunned. Nintendo and Sega Collided forces with the addition of Sonic the Hedgehog. My minor complaints are that Nintendo left out some great characters like Waluigi and Mega Man. Mega Man would make the game way more amazing.

Like I said, I lost interest in this game after only 2 days.+The characters on the screen are way too small. It is easy to lose sight of your character. Specially during a 3 or 4 player match.

Now when Brawl came out , i had high hopes. Mostly for the online. Thats where it fails, in a big way. No stats kept, you cant make friends, no records, no rooms to join or special rules to set. Lag is terrible. You have to know someone else with a nintendo to obtain their code and meet them online. Xbox 360 really does it right for online gaming. Im disappointed with this game and would gladly pay a monthly fee for the services Xbox provides. I also find alot of the new maps to be nothing more than frustrating.

It doesn't take advantage of the innovative controls of the Wii, and it really doesn't compete with the latest 3D fighting games.

It is a great improvement upon its predecessor, Super Smash Bros Melee. Brawl has much more fluid movements and gives the player much more detailed control over his or her character. One-player mode or online playing (via WiFi) gives the player the ability to enjoy Brawl whether he or she is with friends or alone. Super Smash Bros Brawl is worth its cost, and a very enjoyable game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Four-Player Funness!!!!!!!! (Really)","review":"This game is fun and you can be lots of Nintendo characters, but you have to earn them first. There are two types of playing modes: group and solo. You play one or two players in the story mode. Up to four players can play in the group mode where teams battle, which is a lot of fun. My Mom doesn't like this game as much as Lego Star Wars Saga because she can relate to the story line and charaters in Star Wars unlike those random characters in Super Smash Brothers Brawl which do not have a real story line (or any Star Wars characters). Face it, the coolest role playing on earth is to be a Jedi Knight wielding a light saber, but I really like Smash Bros. anyways. I give my Mom a break because she is much older than me.

It contains countless characters, stages, and unique items to spice up the multiplayer fights. Its by far more addicting than melee or the original. There is also a story mode where all the nintendo combatents have an insanely awsome crossover to defeat an evil dark army of primid led by new and familiar nintendo villains.

The game is very fast paced and the action is ridiculous. I would recomment this game to everybody.The only draw back is going on the wi-fi. I'm use to my 360 in that it seeks the best connection and goes with it. Many times while fighting the game will suddenly time out, or slow down to the point it isn't really enjoyable. Even when it isn't going slow there seems to be a lag between the different wi-fi's communicating with one another resulting in not only my character swinging (I use Link alot) into air, but everyone elses. Nice try on tryin out the wi-fi Nintendo, but there needs to be something better in place to earn that 5th golden star this game deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy and Fun!","review":"A very fun game.

However, I do feel the game does get old after awhile like all Fighting games. The game can also be annoying at times while your characters become small to compensate for something going on in the background. And god help you during some of the stages when there is so much chaos going on you lose track of your character let alone what the heck is going on. Maybe that's the whole point or maybe I'm just getting old."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Melee better","review":"I'm not sure why, but I like Melee better. Brawl may just try to do too much. For example, Link's spinning sword move can now be \\"charged up.\\" The battlegrounds are more interactive, which can be a pro or a con. The online play mode is a fun addition, though, and some of the new characters are fun, with their moves a little bit outside the expected Smash Bros repertoire. Story mode seems to go on forever, but the cinematic sequences are nicely rendered and add a continuity that was missing from Melee's story mode. As much as I enjoy Brawl, though, it does not make Melee obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game has issues","review":"Super Smash Bros has always been an amazing game for the Nintendo fan, but this version of the game \\"Brawl\\" has some serious issues. I believe that many Wii owners will experience Disc Read Error issues with the game, because it is one of the only Dual Layer disced game Nintendo has released. Nintendo says that it's a dvd lens cleaning issue, but it's beleived that's it's more then that. It's been suggested that if/when you send in your Nintendo Wii to be \\"cleaned\\", they're actually replacing the lens with a new one. If this was the case, I wish Nintendo would just be straight with the consumer, which I'm sure we would all very much appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER LET DOWN...","review":"well good things first:1) i loved the controllers which were the most feared aspect of the whole game cause i for my opinion hate the control for the wii.2) improved graphics not much thoughnow the bad things1) online is terrible, i knew this was not going to end good cause its nintendo, they dont know how to make good online games.2) online is going to start to be charged...this came from the president of nintendo. this is probably not going to be as much as xbox but still feels terrible3) single mode was badly planned out4) same as melee5) just a plain dissapointmentif anyone has different opinions, that might be cause the wii has no games. and i OWN ONE. it was the worse 250 dollars i ever spend. all i wanted was paper mario(disapointment as well), and this.i now use my ps3 all the time cause that has great and fun lasting games.sorry nintendo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I got my two kids (ages 10 and 13) each to come and try to figure out the Super Smash Bros. game with me this evening and the unanimous opinion is that this game seriously blows.I absolutely cannot figure out what's going on and there's certainly no strategy beyond mashing every button separately and in combinations to see if anything seems to actually work. Once someone wins, I don't know why or how, other than maybe that player fell off the platforms the least. Maybe it's me, but I don't get it.

I've never been a Nintendo guy... But then, I bought the wii to give it a chance. Since I'm not a gamer, I like the wii style, what disappointing was when I realized Super Smash Brawl don't even use the pointer option to select between games.So first of all, this is NOT a wii game... I think works better with a classic control, so... why is it Brawl Wii??? Then, game play is boring and you can't keep a good control of characters... Just push random bottoms and see what happens...Summarizing... the worst experience since I bough the console"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and overhyped.","review":"It's essentially more of the same we've come to expect from Melee. Brawl features more characters, more stages, and new modes, but the core gameplay hasn't evolved in the least bit.The new 1P highlight is an adventure mode called \\"Subspace Emissary,\\" which is essentially Melee's adventure mode extended by a factor of 20 with more of the same gameplay. Except Melee's Adventure Mode was never fun to begin with, and making it this long results in an even bigger chore. It's a sidescroller with monsters here and there, and there is a boss battle once every few stages. As a 2D platformer it's not great.The Wi-Fi can lag quite a bit and the Friend Code system is still as awful as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly Ridiculous","review":"This game is so bad. It's basically a 2-D walkthrough you play by repeatedly pressing A. I bought it thinking it was going to be as good as Super Mario Galaxy, but it's ridiculous. It's for seven year old boys. The game play is monotonous and confusing. Many of the actions and moves are counter-intuitive. What a huge disappointment. Everything moves too quickly to feel as if you have any real control over the game. It feels like you are playing on autopilot. Especially peeving is the constant onslaught of video interludes, which are supposed to trick you into thinking you are playing something actually engaging or exciting, but really just substitute for a real story or real challenges. It feels like some ridiculous arcade game from 1987. Skip this one, don't believe the hype. This game is among the worst Wii has ever produced. I would never purchase this for a child. Boring. Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I bought this game the day it came out. I heard plenty of buzz, looked at the box and it looked good. I get home and put it in to play. My first reaction was THAT'S IT?? It's a regular fighting game. I thought, oh maybe there are other types of gameplay, the box said there is a story-type mode. NOPE. It's the same except the story mode seems to just connect the fight scene over and over again.There is nothing special about this game. First of all, it does not use the motion sentative nature of the Wii controllers. Moreover, the controllers are useless. You randomly hit all your buttons and move your fighter in all directions hoping that somehow you win. And unless maybe you're playing against your friends, it is the same thing over and over again.They had all the hype, a great franchise, a innovative console but delivered a standard (at best) game.I sold my copy on Amazon the day after I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified gamecube version","review":"Doesn't use any of the wii's features.

This game does not use any of the Wii feature like Wii remote control motion and the pointer. The game-play is like the Cube version, you just have to press buttons on the Wii control. Waving Wii control or pointing it to the TV features are not used. Very limited use of the speaker on the Wii remote control. This might well have been a Cube game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I love the innovative controller for the Wii.

Before you take my negative review seriously, you should consider that I played the game twice and never against anyone else. I think playing against someone may have been more fun. However, playing the storyline by myself was just boring. It wasn't really a fighting game, and wasn't really an action game, just a crazy mixture of the two. I found myself trying to use the special moves I learned from reading the book and strategy guide not to be that useful. I got better results by just mindlessly punching and kicking, which takes a lot of the fun out of the game. Luckily, I sold this one to a friend and his kids love it. Overall, I was disappointed, but I may just be too picky."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS GAME","review":"I THINK THAT MARIO SUPER SMASH BROS. BRAWL WAS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.

But if you have been a fan of the series since the late 1990s, you're bound to regret the purchase.Short and sweet, it is an overrated, overly-hyped title. It reworked many of the great elements of the previous two games, and deleted a lot more. To compensate, it dresses itself in hours of unlockable content (most of which is not worth the time and energy), a horrible 1-P adventure mode, and a highly uninspired fighting roster (not to mention some characters were made stronger than others, such the director's own creations!).A terrible, terrible disappointment. The only highlights are some of the fighters being interesting, and probably the best music and textures you'll see on the Wii.Outside of that, if you are more a fan of gameplay over pretty colors, this is NOT your title."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's great fun","review":"This has been a great game for my daughter.Plus the service from Amazon has been great.."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 9 yo sons favorite","review":"My son was begging for this game for his birthday.

All the principal singers are in peak form. You will find it hard to surpass Leonard Warren as Macbeth. His voice is deep and powerful. His characterization appropriate. Rysanek is highly dramatic as Lady Macbeth. And she sings her high D flat full-throated. No screechy singing - just a full, glorious shimmering voice at a high D flat!! Jerome Hines is marvellous as Banquo. His voice is deep and powerful too, sounds a bit like Warren's voice. Conducting is excellent and sound is great. In wonderful stereo and no tape hiss. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Macbeth","review":"The illustrious dramatic soprano, Leonie Rysanek triumphed at the Met in 1959 in the role of Lady Macbeth, replacing Maria Callas, no less.

Second he turns to science and explains the results from various experiments, combines that with theories that are completely untested and in some cases completely out-there to try to explain the power of prayer. If it were just a scientific physical phenomena than miracles from the prayers should in most cases occur immediatly such as those that have to do with influencing another to improve.If you have read my other reviews than you know I know the power of prayer. I suggest people read about near death experiences, real life accounts of possessions, and give religion a honest go before deciding what you think the world is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"Love Mr. Braden's book. This book in particular, sheds some light on the art of prayer as used for thousands of years and teaches us how our emotions can lead the way and change our lives. I just read another book that is over thirty years old that talks about how Jesus prayed as if the prayer were already manifest, not as if it were to come. This is the same approach described by Mr. Braden, so I am not sure you can label it as a lost mode of prayer; I think of it more as an author reminding us about the origins of prayer as passed down through centuries, but some of us forgot or were never taught this valuable tradition. Still, I am glad I found this book, it helped me remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd purchase of this book","review":"This is the second copy of this book I have purchased.

Gays weren't simply sexual creatures, though that was done in a hot manner.They had lives, problems, complext storylines.Having bought the previous 1-3 seasons on dvd, I was very happy with the extras. However, the 4th season extras-wise is pretty lack luster. I was especially annoyed w/ the painfully obviously missing season 5 montage teaser for the upcoming season 5 , which the past dvd sets had.Frankly the films by the cast doing other projects were quite bad.

However, when I heard that this season offered very little in the way of extras about QAF and more about the actor's other projects and Showtime's other projects, I decided not to buy them. I already have the episodes on DVD so I don't need them to watch S4.What I buy DVDs for are the blooper reels and any extra interviews that they do with the cast about QAF. The S4 DVD release is a huge disappoinment in that respect.

If you're used to hearing Susan Graham sing Hahn and Janet Baker sing Faure, be prepared for a disconcerting experience. There's a reason this CD is not on a major label.

Just when you thought there could be nothing new to say about JFK, here's a really well-written & intelligent new take on JFK, which is somewhat different from the conventional. He emphasizes the role of Churchill as JFK's role model and mentor. (Interestingly, they never met.) Actually, like George W. Bush, JFK had a \\"father\\" problem. Just as George W. had to effectively \\"divorce\\" himself from his father's political legacy and become the political foster son of Ronald Reagan, so did JFK. Joe Sr.'s money was indispensable to Kennedy's political success, but it came with some seriously heavy baggage. (Appeaser, anti-Semite, etc.) So Kennedy had to \\"divorce\\" his actual father and \\"adopt\\" a \\"political\\" father: Winston S. Churchill. (For a decade after 1940, the navy blue pinstripe suit JFK had made in imitation of Churchill's was the only suit Kennedy owned.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"JFK ADOPTED WINSTON AS PATRICIAN???","review":"I hate reacting to another post but to say that the VERY Irish JFK turned to Winston Churchill as spiritual father is a tale from another planet. It's like saying Oliver Cromwell inspired James Joyce (well, actually the EFFECTS of Cromwell's genocide inspired Joyce's suppressed rancor). Read JFK's Why England Slept? to find how he forever incurred ultimately fatal British enmity. Read the speeches in Ireland a few months before his murder by British intelligence services.That poster daring to breathe W in the same sentence as JFK recalls what this book most clearly delineates and contrasts with current commanders: JFK's brilliant and sharp intelligence and leadership and how we may apply that today. Simply replay the JFK Inaugural and ANYTHING since. THe greatest speech you will never hear is the Second JFK Inaugural.

It is as adventurous as one could expect from Scherchen, but this works well with the \\"sense of drama\\" that this symphony requires in order to be really successful.Recording quality is acceptable as an early stereo take, but strings are quite weak (too few).This interpretation exist in many incarnations, most of them hard to find since they are deleted from the catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with US Phones","review":"The BLD-3 model has two different batteries: One for the Asian market and one for the US market.

He seems to pump new life into the \\"Military\\" and \\"Heroic\\" pieces, while his interpretation of the C sharp minor is very uplifting. This is the perfect CD for newcomers to either Chopin or Rubinstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on the info","review":"A little too light on information. I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but this is more like something your doctor would have for reading material in his office. Would have been worth a buck or two, but not ten!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I injured a nerve in my neck, causing tremendous arm and neck/shoulder pain and numbness in my fingers. The physical therapist I was seeing used the methods outlined in this book and recommended me buying the book and sharing with everyone. After 5 sessions my pain was gone, the numbness in my fingers gone and I have great range of motion in my neck. This is a must read for anyone with pain or just for maintaining your cervical health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Treat Your Own Neck was a great product for the price. There were some really good tips that helped with my neckpain. Definitely worth a try if you have neck pain that just won't seem to go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't help everyone.","review":"Maybe my neck pain is past the point that this book can be of any help to. It seems the author suggests the same few exercises for everyone's neck pain. Hard to believe this would help me. Maybe others. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neck Book","review":"It was a OK read but i was hoping to learn more then i did.A short & easy to read & easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin McKenzie Neck book","review":"Fantastic book, this book can get you back on your feet. For more than a year now I continue to see improvement in my range of motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only method that has worked","review":"i can't praise this simple, instructional booklet enough. If, like me, you let yourself reach a chronic level of neck stiffness and pain through stress retention, bad posture, and lack of neck support at night, buy the book, and do the five or so exercises. I now understand and recognize the habits that cause the stiffness in my neck--and the exercises are beginning to give me relief and mobility for the first time in years. I love clear, concise sharing of information that really helps. Grateful writer in Fort Lauderdale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Advice","review":"I have muscle spasms in my neck and often have neck pain which leads to migraine, so this book has been a godsend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative practical approach","review":"good information on stretching the neck to release tension and getting range of motion. I dont have any neck problems so I can't say the system works. Atleast it's good to know the protocols just in case for future problems or for clients I work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick, easy read and informative","review":"This is a short book full of valuable information about taking care of your own neck-- a true, self-help book that educates people about the physiology of the cervicle spine, as well as how to prevent problems and further degeneration from impinging on your physical well-being. Jam packed with good information and helpful exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been instrumental in relieving my neck pain!","review":"After several years of increasingly frequent bouts with neck and upper back pain, I finally went to a physical therapist to find some relief. During the few weeks she treated me, she loaned me a copy of this book and told me to practice the exercises in it. The exercises were *so* successful in relieving my pain that I bought my own copy of the book and have made them a regular part of my daily routine. They have proven themselves time and time again to be a preventative measure against recurring pain. I can't tell you how thankful I am to have found this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, simple exercises that work","review":"After being out a week from work due to lower back pain, a friend let me borrow this one andTreat Your Own Back. Also bought this one7 Steps to a Pain-Free Life: How to Rapidly Relieve Back and Neck Pain. All three were very helpful as was gettting in a pool & stretching. By combining these exercises Robin recommends with pool stretching, the pain was relieved within a few weeks.I have also been usingTargus AWE26US Ergonomic M-stand for Notebook Computersat work with my notebook which has eliminated most all of my upper neck pain. Also, walking for 20-30 minutes each day at lunch and getting a better chair really helps lower back pain. Steelcase's Leap chair has been the best one I've used so far.The other thing you hear a lot is not to sit more than 20 minutes without getting up for at least a minute or two. I use this program, \\"Take A Break\\", which blinks on my laptop to remind me to do that.

Was recommended by my dentist as he has neck and back problems also. Information in this book is not much different than I've been given by my physical therapist. All but one I have already been doing. Might help someone who has not had therapy and wants to know what to do for neck problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat your own pain in the neck","review":"I can not speak first hand on this as it was a gift for my Aunt, she said she has found the exercises very helpful in relieving her chronic pain.What I was impressed with, is that while searching for books for my Aunt, I emailed the author and asked if the book had illustrations. They responded the next day with some of the illustrations attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Very effective book, if followed strictly. I use for myself and for my patients, as a physical therapist. Better than anything any doctor will tell about treating neck pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advice","review":"Doctor recommended this book. Excellent exercises & practical information for taking care of arthritic neck. Great resource! Will keep this handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Exercise Was Helpful - The Others Made My Neck Worse","review":"I have had a sore neck on one side for several months now and go to physiotherapy, massage and acupuncture for the last three months to try and heal it. I bought this book hoping it would help.This book has a few simple exercises to treat your own neck. I found one of the exercises (The Lying Down Neck Flexion) to be helpful for me to relieve the pain, but the others (Neck Extension, Sideways & Twist) caused more pain and really hurt my neck. My physiotherapist said that the information in this book is generic and doesn't necessarily heal all neck pain...which was the case for me as I still have the neck pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I was given this book years ago when in therapy for a herniated disk and found it as useful the second time as the first. It is best to do the exercises in conjugation with approved physical therapy however. A couple of the exercises i did too extreme and aggravated the neck. The therapist helped show me where to stop the movement appropiately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me from surgery","review":"I dealt with the most severe pain in my life for several months with a herniated disk in my neck. I had had spinal epidurals, lots of pain medication and little relief. I finally made the decision that I was going to need surgery. This was Saturday and I had an appointment for Wednesday with my orthopedic. My sister-in-law sent this book to me and I started the exercises on that Saturday. By Wednesday I felt the best I had felt in over 6 months. I asked my orthopedic what he thought about these exercises. He said they probably would help, he knew about McKenzie, but in the 4 months I had been seeing him he never told me about this book or these exercises. 3 months later I have almost no problems. And I did not need surgery. I also now have a favorite sister-in-law."},{"rating":"2","title":"painful","review":"this book is a big help. i have suffered daily neck pain for 3 years. The pain is constant due to all the symptoms described in this book. The doctor said to 'live with it'. The book gives excellent examples how to get relief. It may not be permanent in my case but it does give some relief with the techniques the book describes. I've spent $500 for pillows and this book offered more help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a ton of experience with the book","review":"So far the book seems to be ok, but I haven't used the techniques long enough to really know whether they are working or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I've been using these exercises for a month and feel no difference in my pain level. I have 4 mm bulging disc and tightened muscles. My true relief comes from going for a massage. I prayed for a miracle. This book was NOT it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one..","review":"This book came from a recommendation from my orthopedic.. he informed me there was pretty much nothing I could do about my low back except for \\"Quit with the running and high impact exercises\\". This book basically tells you to sit up straight, but a back support under your lower back, and lie several times a day on your stomach, and push yourself up on your arms and hold that position to reinstate the arch in your lower back.. well, duh.. If you are in decent shape this one is not for you. I could see where it may help if you are old, overweight, out of shape, and don't know what else to do.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"There is about one sentence in this book that is new information to anyone. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rootabaga Pigeons","review":"After viewing a documentary about Carl Sandburg, his work and life I wanted to read stories he wrote for young people.

Great bargain....too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Musicals of the 50's","review":"Very disappointing. We didn't even watch all of it.......would return for a refund if I could. It's nothing but advertisements of the movies,lots of print (telling it's in what kind of color, extravaganza, etc.) Boring! It had VERY brief segments from different movies. I thought there would be some complete movies, not just segments. The cover even shows 6 specific movies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic introduction to liturgical action","review":"This is one of two studies on ritual action that I easily recommend to interested laity (as opposed to liturgists). In the 24 actions, Donghi covers all the common gestures. Donghi is firmed rooted in the post-Vatican II church - thinking to include being seated and listening in his actions. That it to say that the actions of the assembly are not considered as ancillary to the Eucharist but as a significant action in their own rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Circle of Life","review":"This book is an outstanding work of photo art for anyone interested in wild life in east-central Africa. The photographs capture the wild game, the fauna, and all aspects of lighting with amazing results. The authors are exceptionally talented and bring the reality of the savannahs of east-central Africa to life for readers of this work of art. When comparing this book with others in the same category, this book is at the head of the pack. Having recently returned from two weeks of safari in Tanzania, I can speak for the results of this book effectively capturing the impact of this wonderful part of this planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"the circle of life","review":"The book was received as agreed. There is a permanent crease on the outside of the book by the binding. I didn't feel it was worth the trouble of returning the book for a replacement. The content of the book is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"One DVD is the Tony Bennett's biography and the other one is his show on Monterey Jazz Festival in California. If you love Tony and his songs you must have to buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up!","review":"I saw the PBS Special, too, and it got me very interested in TB. Netflix has this same title in a one-disc set -- don't know what their DVD omits. Yes, TB probably shouldn't try to sustain very long notes anymore as his voice cracks, but he's a Master! One hilarious part is Alec Baldwin impersonating him on SNL. AB hosts the \\"TB Show\\", featuring guest Anthony Benedetto (TB). I'm going to place my order for this DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony & Clint","review":"Clint does it again! Eastwood's natural love for jazz combines with his film making/story-telling ability to produce a fascinating look at the career and life of crooner Tony Bennett.
