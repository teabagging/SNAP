What I did want was a book about Sarah McLachlan that didn't try to sensationalize the events in her life. If you expect that from this book, you'll be disappointed. Without an interview, I'd say that Fitzgerald had to scrape up whatever she could get, and just make do with it. Her writing style isn't much, it's not really suited to this type of book, but it's apparent she thought that this was a way to grab readers without having very interesting material. It's obvious that this is just another drop in the bucket for the music biography world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old dog, old tricks","review":"The thing that makes me sad about this book is that Judith Fitzgerald wants people to believe the regurgitated pap in this book, and never look beyond her half-truths. Many of the articles that she quotes in the book are only half quoted. She leaves out any part of them that doesn't go along with what she wants you to believe is the truth about Sarah McLachlan, Terry McBride, and Uwe Vandrei. There are so many \\"anonymous\\" sources credited, that I don't give credence to any of them.

Was this book up to standard?? Oh god no...not even CLOSE. THIS book barely has a plot, I refuse to believe it does...I was just shaking my head the whole time, because I had actually read reviews saying that this book was GOOD...imagine my surprise...the whole book??

To further confound things, the book is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad state of affairs...","review":"It is a sad state of affairs that Sarah McLachlan has to be written about this way. This book is a lifeless rehash of magazine and newspaper quotes, never breaking any new ground in any direction. The portrayal of the characters is basically weak and lacking, superficially covering Sarah's life. It is difficult for most biographies to show the real person under all hype, but even considering that fact, this book is a journey into the inane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insignificant","review":"In the midst and hue of music biographies, this book is yet another one to throw on the pile of hastily put out volumes trying to grab some of the success of a famous musician. The motto of this book is \\"quantity, not quality.\\" Lacking more than superficial credibility, the author traipses aroud Canada in search of any scurrilous chit-chat that she can dig up on Sarah McLachlan. Trying hard to be clever, the author throws in references to \\"libidinous legovers\\" and murder charges, claims that McLachlan craves and needs media attention, and that McLachlan is nothing more than a money hungry plagiarist. The unusual thing is that for all the allegations, there is no proof given, and where most books would offer evidence, there is none here. Worth your time if you want to say you've read it, but if you're looking for a real book, don't look here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was stoked to get this book when I found out that it existed,but I was sorry I read it when I was through. What was the big deal?It seemed like this book was lashing out at Sarah instead of being a biograhphy about her. There's snide little jabs everywhere. I'm sorry but there are to many coincidences in this book to be real. I don't believe any of the baloney about Sarah being at all involved in that stalker's death. What would she gain? For him to stop his BS lawsuit? For him to quit being all obsessed with her? I keep seeing this author talking about how there \\"was an agreement in principle\\" in a settlement of that lawsuit. What she always fails to mention is that this agreement was for Sarah to write the guy a letter telling him she didn't use his words, and that Sarah would NOT meet him by any means. Too much hype, and not enough reality in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get the joke","review":"Building A Mystery is easily the worst book that I have ever read.

My loss, I guess, or maybe my money lost, I should say."},{"rating":"1","title":"M.O. is the same, don't like this style","review":"After reading this book, and seeing the way that Judith Fitzgerald behaves, especially on Sarah newsgroups, I'd have to say that I hope I never have the displeasure of meeting her in person. Ms. Fitz is rude, obnoxious, and psychotic. This also comes across in her writing style, both in this book, and in her wild rantings on Usenet. Want to know the real mystery, folks? How the publisher thought it was a good idea to put this book out, for sure! Don't waste your money on a book written by a hanger on looking to make some dough from riding on Sarah's coattails. Support Sarah, and buy her music instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH","review":"This is utter crap about Canada's finest singer/songwriter Sarah McLachlan. Yeah, and \\"Fitz\\" wants us to believe that Sarah had a nosejob? Her nose hasn't changed, and for one, I cannot believe that for Fitz to say she's a fan of Sarah's would actually put this garbage out. I only give it one star for that nice picture of Sarah playing the electric guitar. Besides, there are only A FEW pictures! TRASH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Building a Mystery: The Story of Judith Fitzgerald","review":"When I heard about this book, I thought Great, a book about Sarah McLachlan! Wow! Was I wrong. Half of the book was about Judith Fitzgerald. When I heard the title I thought I would find some new exciting stuff about Sarah McLachlan. Instead, I found nothing new about Sarah McLachlan. I found everything out about Judith Fitzgerald. The title of the book was all wrong. Well, I guess half of it was right. It sure was a mystery as to what the book was about. But the part about the story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair is all wrong. If you want to learn about Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair,don't buy this book, buy From Lilith to Lilith Fair, the AUTHORIZED biography by Buffy Childerhose. If you want to learn about The story of Judith Fitzgerald, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make money at the expense of others...","review":"Building A Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair, Judith Fitzgerald's pathetic first foray into the world of the unauthorised biography, might easily have been titled: \\"How to Make Money at the Expense of Others\\". This is simply another trashy tell-all that abounds in sale bins at your local bookstore. Fitzgerald makes Sarah out to be some evil beast of a woman who kills anyone who gets in her way. It's pointless to read a book that was only written asa vehicle to strike back at Sarah and her management for whatever imagined slights Judith Fitzgerald feels they've perpetrated against her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I heard that Sarah personally asked her friends and fans and family not to have anything to do with this book. So why would any Sarah fans buy a book that is supposed to be about Sarah, yet ends up being about Fitzgerald, etc and this big tribute to dead stalker Uwe Vandrei? Beats me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep reading","review":"I really had a hard time reading the entire thing. The writing is hard to follow, and it's clear that Judith Fitzgerald isn't a true fan of Sarah McLachlan. She tries to fool the reader into thinking that she likes Sarah, and Sarah's music, yet the book is filled with little jabs like this one: \\"What, after all, would McLachlan be without ever-escalating sales and the kinds of lavish media attention she obviously, almost obsessively, needs?\\" It's clear that Fitzgerald's just in it for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"Regarding this biography by Judith Fitzgerald, I don't know about anyone else, but the book completely made me ill. I think Fitz has some kind of personal vendetta agianst sarah and Nettwerk. I mean, a whole chapter on Uwe Vandrei, and a memoriam credit to him in the beginning. What's up with that?? I totally agree with the other reviews. The book was so awful. Not only that, but it was BORING. I had a really hard time staying awake reading it. This book is completely annoying and is was not authorized by Sarah orNettwerk so keep that in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trifling","review":"No color pix, most look like they're from the internet...nothing but a boring writer discussing boring quotes and bits of strung together old interviews...what does that have to do with Lilith Fair and Sarah?

Buy that other book that's much more entertaining and much more real."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Read","review":"I have so rarely put down a book and been so thankful to do so. Content and subject matter aside, I found the writing to be very cumbersome. Based on writing style alone, this was a painful book to read. With regard to content, I am puzzled. The title specifically mentions both \\"Sarah\\" and \\"Lilith\\" but I did not get much of either from this book. It's mostly goes on about Uwe Vandrei, this overly ardent fan of Sarah's. If you're a Sarah fan, I wouldn't recommend reading this book as it has nothing positive to say about her. To say the title is misleading is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"freakin good book","review":"yes, kids, it's a freakin good book and if i had beleive all these revwiews i wouldnot have bought building a mystery. and, i wouldnot have come back here to tell fans of sarah who might not think this is a good book that is definately a good book and worth it to buy it because it is a freakin good book!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Waste of My Time and Money (Yes I did finish it)","review":"Is is possible to give this a smidgen of a star, if it deserves that?I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this piece of s**t. It is completely misleading and where does Fitzgerald get off saying that Sarah \\"doesn't smoke pot because it makes her paranoid\\"? Where did she get her info?Also I have to say it seems like she interviewed the family of Uwe Vandrei (the guy who stalked Sarah and then killed himself)and put the book in memorium to him out of revenge that Sarah's management would not grant Fitzgerald an interview with her for the book, as oppossed to hearing the other side of the story.How any editor let this go to press baffles me. Unfortunately, this is considered legitimate to most half-wits out there. This is one book I will definitely burn. Save your time and money and buy a Lawrence Welk Tape.

Building a Mystery reads like a schizophrenic patient's transcript strife with vague references, endless garble, and little substance. Having read the book front to back, I found little about 'Sarah McLachlan' and mostly what seemed to be an ongoing, unguided defamation. Not only does the author refuse to latch onto a journalistic perspective with direction and commentry from the people who matter most to the heart of the person and concept of 'Sarah McLachlan', she becomes attached to the alleged stalker which took his like soon after a legal battle with Mclachlan. I could not identify with her perspective or logic and found the book uncomfortable to read. It is no wonder Sarah McLachlan's family and record company wanted nothing to do with the author or this book. I strongly recommend against wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Crap","review":"This book is the biggest piece of crap I've ever read - and I read a lot!

She also gives what the critics wrote about Sarah throughout her career so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, really...","review":"It's sad, really, that someone capable of much finer work than this would choose to publish a half-hearted tell all such as this book. The character development is slow and shallow, merely re-contextured quotes that don't give any real sense of the true Sarah McLachlan.Little is mentioned, if at all, about the other half of the title, Lilith Fair. A small chapter, heavily burdened with the displeasure Fitzgerald felt at not being given free entry to the venue or backstage access the object of her prose.Don't mistake this book for what it isn't. It's not a biography. It's a specious retelling of the same old story through the eyes of its author. It also happens not to be very entertaining, or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I found this book to be very insulting to Sarah McLachlan and her fans. This author tries her hardest to be unkind to just about everyone in this book who doesn't agree with her. She disparages anyone who doesn't share her opinions. The author also tried too hard to play connect the dots with whatever incomplete information she could find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maniacal ravings","review":"I have often wanted to throw books at their authors (and, in my capacity as a professional reviewer, often do). This particular book, aprime piece of puff-slut pukery masquerading as a literary biography, set the genre back a decade. After I'd gagged my way through the galleys, Itossed its grievous errors and calumnious omissions -- in regard to the life of a Canadian diva who deserves a well-wrought shrine, not a hack's maniacal ravings riddled with speciocities too egregious to enumerate here -- into the burning barrel and prayed Milton Acorn would turn over *again* in his grave. This book is a travestatious piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"No listing...","review":"I see what Sarah thinks of this book, since there's no listing of it in the Amazon Sarah Store. Really, you should take that as a clue to how well you'll like this book. Were this more than a collection of speculations and rumors, reprints and rehashed banality, it'd be worth the lives of the trees that were killed to make it. That doesn't happen to be the case here, so don't waste your energy on this low quality offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made up?","review":"I feel like most of this book was made up as Fitzgerald went along. It's obvious that she didn't do any work while she was writing it. It was written in less than 5 months, so that she could get it out in time to catch the Lillith Fair wave and hang on. There's not much here to interest the long time fan, since you'll know most of what's here already, and new fans shouldn't be told lies like the ones that are in this book. Stay away unless you like throwing your money away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"FABRICATED!!","review":"The bottom line? Sarah Mclachlan is an incredably gifted singer and songwritter. I have been, to say the least, increadably entertained by the songs that this women sing's and writes.

I wish I had not -- for it was a waist of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a waste of time.","review":"I read this book from cover to cover and did not like it. I read it in one day. The only reason I finished it was to see if anything good was in the book. It is a waste of good paper. I consider my self a Sarah McLachlan fan and really did not like the book. I also found out very little on Sarah McLachlan. I think that the book should not have had the first chapter in the book because it had no place in the book. Also part of the last chapter did not have a place in the book. I hope the new Sarah McLachlan book is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this book and got ahold of the people on the mailing list that were passing it around.

It reads like a highschooler's attempt at fiction... if only the author had some sort of FACTUAL BASIS behind her conjecture... but no. In this book we have what appears to be Ms Fitzgerald's jealous ramblings. I will have to admit that this is the first bio I've read where the author treats her subject with such disdain... it's rather suprising because it took me off-guard. I expected to learn about Sarah, not about Ms Fitzgerald and her unrealistic, \\"gossipy\\" blather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Defines how bad a book can be","review":"How then could this book be so intolerably bad? To begin with, it seems the writer wrote it with no other thoughts than what will bring in the 20 somethings. Open the book at random and start reading whatever is on the page, because no matter how hard you try, it's not interesting in any way. Finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. He does have twenty years of cutting experience.This book now defines the basement for me. It is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"This is a candidate for the single most disappointing book experience of my lifetime. Cool title, and hey - it's supposed to be about Sarah McLachlan.How can you go wrong?

You have here one of those rare books that does not contain a single redeeming quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of outlandish conspiracy theories","review":"This book is filled with outlandish conspiracy theories which lack common sense. It's clear that the author is more interested in writing a work of fiction than a factual biography. Everyone who turned down an interview with Fitzgerald had good reason to. This book is ample proof that the author has no respect for truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitz has a grudge and won't give it up","review":"It's so incredibly sad when an author holds such a strong grudge against a person that they would spend the time to write an entire book. Fitzgerald's grudge is so obvious; if anyone wants to read up on Sarah and get a TRUTHFUL picture of her, this is NOT the book. Unlike Fitzgerald, I have personally met Sarah. She is very gracious and caring, and is not the selfish, evil person that the author makes her out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Book!","review":"I read it right from start to finish. Interesting. I liked it. Its funny. Its very nice to Sarah. Its not very nice to her manager. I dont like him. He sounds like a creep. I read this book over the weekend. I've been thinking about it ever since. I think Judith wrote the book to teach fans that Sarah is good. It sounds to me like she is on Sarah's side. She talks about Sarah really nice. I fell sorry for the victim. Its not a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book was very hard to read. I more or less had to force myself to get to the end. Now, I'm sorry that I did read it, in light of Judith Fitzgerald's true feelings about Sarah McLachlan. Apparently, she doesn't like Ms. McLachlan very much. She thinks that Sarah is a terrible person; one of her many delusions is that Sarah is really a lesbian, who married to hide her lesbian leanings, and so that she could get a green card. I'm not making this up - it's very much true. Why would someone who thinks That Sarah McLachlan is such a horrible person write a book about her? One reason, and one reason only - to make a quick buck. Try reading \\"From Lilith to Lilith Fair, THE AUTHORIZED STORY\\" instead. It's much more interesting, not to mention, factual."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Sarah McLachlan.....","review":"Skip this book!!! In fact, much of the content to this book pertains to the life and struggle of Sarah's *supposed* stalker. It is poorly written, andpoorly editted.

I liked it. I thought the author did a great job considering the way McLachlan's management keeps her on a really short leash. It's a good book and tells an amazing story, especially when Fitzgerald digs up the dirt on McLachlan's roots and later, when she tells the story about the so-called stalker who died from unrequited love for Sarah. Fitzgerald prooves he wasn't a stalker and actually, he was RIGHT and that scares me enough to tell you to buy this book and learn a few lessons about how the music industry really works and how having a good voice is just a bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't say I didn't warn ya!","review":"Actually, I bought the book last week.

Waste yer time if ya want, but don't say I didn't warn ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"One reason I didn't care for this book was the large amount of speculation that the author did. An author should never rely on speculation to pad out a book, but, unforunately, that's the case here. Where are the facts? What are the facts? All of the background biographical information about Sarah was easy enough to get. They can be found anywhere, in articles all over the place, which is the format that this author uses. She just repeats what other people have already written, but the trouble with that is, the author usually leaves out any part of the orignal articles that don't portray the Sarah McLachlan the author wants us to see. This author actually expects people to believe that Sarah McLachlan had an obsessed fan killed? I don't buy it, and neither should you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a great example of terrible writing","review":"Even if I ignore the shoddy and petty journalism of this book, which is hard to do, I'm appalled by how badly the book is written. Even a non-writer of her age would have enough command of the language to pen something more literate than this. And it's so obvious the fawning reviews are by JF herself, get a grip honey. As with many examples of biography this book says more about the author than the subject.

If I wanted to do research on stalking maybe, or on Judith herself then this book is perfect. Otherwise, its misleading for the majority of people who are buying it to learn about Sarah's life. My take on this: buy it only if you want to take a crash course in how NOT to write a good biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising...","review":"I almost died when I saw this so-called writer's name on a bunch of cruddish poems, gack! A somewhat misleading book pretending to be a serious biographical study of Sarah McLachlan's life and career (which is just a greedy grab for money, since, according to her website, the author is Uwe Vandrei's \\"official biographer\\", and obviously doesn't care about Sarah except for the cash she can bring in for the author). Like, what's the point of this book? Judging by the author's many problems making sense when she writes, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody but my worst enemy (and then, only if I'm really desperate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fished in...","review":"Your usual standard industry shinola, puffy and pretty meaningless for everyone but the most devoted of hip boot wearers.

Do not waist your money on this book !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written...","review":"What strikes me most is how poorly written this book is. It gives you the impression that the author knew Lilith Fair was going to be big news, so she decided to cash in on it by writing a book in a few weeks time. She interviews Uwe Vandrei's sister at length, and goes as far as hinting at a conspiracy (Nettwerk involved?) surrounding his suicide. And if you didn't like the cover picture, that's a good indication that the author is not going to paint the best picture of Sarah in the book. In many ways, she praises Sarah as a singer and musician; but it is pretty clear that she dislikes Terry McBride and some of the people at Nettwerk (maybe she has good reason to, maybe not). I think that Rolling Stone did more of a number on Sarah that this author does, simply because nobody of importance to Sarah (except her birth mother) would give her thetime of day - that's why the book is full of past soundbites from Sarah and why the book really doesn't bring out anything of new interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I just got the book at Borders, i've only read the first 10 or so pages and i've hated it so far (which doesn't happen with me and books very often) so think twice before you buy it, or at least look it over first. this judith fitzgerald character is kinda bitchy in some of her writing, and even criticizes BAM at one point in the first chapter. definitely think twice before you part with 15 bucks for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no.","review":"I flipped through the book the other day in the bookstore (so, yeah - I'm too cheap to actually buy it and since it IS unauthorized .... that gives me an excuse not to part with my $) Who is this author???

Are we going to see writing that an editor *HAS* touched instead of having half-witted banality foisted off on us? I doubt that will ever happen.

They should admid to the public that this is an obvious sham and let the real investigators do their job. Most Haunted opened the door for theatrics and fakery and Paranormal State blatently walked through. Jerry Springer would be proud as his audience now has even more bad acting and low budget directing to follow. Buy this and spit in the face of all that's scientific and genuine in the field of paranormal research. It's a shame that they set the field back 100 years for a paycheck.

They never come up with anything that could remotely be considered as plausible evidence, just a bunch of suggestions, and speculation that they don't even bother to dignify with additional research.I caught a couple recent shows and now they've added this other fraud, Chip Coffey, a \\"medium\\" who in BOTH shows I watched, happened to have something \\"move\\" unexpectedly near him. Both times it was obvious that it would have been easy for him to move the item himself, and his acting was so bad that it convinced me that was the case.The greatest achievement here is that these kids are getting paid to put this crap on the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ghost show ever","review":"I LOVE THIS PROGRAM.

If you're new to gardening or even an old pro, don't waste your $$$.I know that there are many ways to achieve the same results with gardening, and while some of his statements may hold truth; the general manner in which he dismisses so many proven techniques leads the reader to doubt most of his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth About Garden Remedies","review":"Finally, the book I've been waiting for!

In 'The Truth About Garden Remedies', Dr Gillman covers a wide range of problems that can be encountered by me and my fellow gardners. The difference in this book, unlike most of the books I've read on the subject is that the answers are supported by real science and conveyed in a way that is completely readable. What is even more exciting, is that Dr. Gillman isn't a stuffy reseacher that is unwilling to consider alternative remedies, there are plenty of them in this book.

Go to any farm store (Blains, Tractor Supply ect.) and you can get these for 40 bucks. I have a dozen cow stall mats in my basement.

The girl's a free spirit, to be sure, and will have you craving more of her with each song. Check it out!

I would have known this in advance if the actual drain size fittings had been included in the Product Description.However, the packaging includes this information, so please note before buying: \\"The two strainers fit drains from 1-3/8\\" dia. up to 1-7/8\\" dia. and from 1-5/8\\" dia. up to 2-1/4\\" dia.\\" If this sizing works for you, these are definitely worth the premium pricing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but not good enough.","review":"I thought I was going to love these - replacing my mesh rusty ones for thse pretty stainless steel ones.First, I thought I was getting 2 large strainers - no where does it say that there would be one large and one small... you have to look real close at the picture to see one is smaller.The other thing is, once they are in your sink, you can't get them out.

Small pages, big print, short sentences and paragraphs.

No new insights are presented by Strelecky. The questions he poses have been posed in numerous books before this one, with more flare and body. Though I like stories about cafes and old diners, I was disappointed with the Why Cafe.

May works to make Aiken Drum a likeable protagonist, as he has grown into that role over the course of the series, surviving longer than many other original characters who were present in the early chapters. The plot is entertaining, the reliance on the Pliocene novelty factor has been diminished appropriately as the third volume draws to a close, and the increasing introduction of the N. American element helps maintain suspense. There's just barely an indefinable element missing that elevates this work to a five star story in my opinion, but I can only wish I could write as well as Julian May."},{"rating":"2","title":"May is fantastic","review":"Julian May is fantastic (no pun intended).

This DVD reminded me that I have forgotten how to be in the present, how to stop looking at the end goal and enjoy the journey. As a person who has struggled with depression, fear of dying, and what Deepak refers to as \\"existential suffering\\" for many years, this DVD is definitely a huge step toward becoming free.

I searched on Youtube and found an unboxing video of armor lite case and I decided to get it. The case is in nice quality, not something cheap plastic that easily scratches. The installation is easy, just push the DS into the bottom and then close both DS and the case, push a little bit to fit everything together. You may want to clean your DS with Dust-off before you install. It fits well to the console. I have been playing, opening and closing for a day and did not observed any gaps or loosing parts between the case and the console.One thing is that when you close the case, your console has an ~1 mm gap in between. You can try to use sand paper to make it close more. This is the only small thing that I don't like about this product, but it doesn't hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a clear choice","review":"Okay, first off, I want you to excuse the pun title.Now, about the product itself. It does exactly what you'd think it would. It provides a hard shell around your DS to protect it. It doesn't disrupt gameplay at all, and doesn't add significant weight to the unit. It does, however, add enough thickness to prevent it from fitting in some cases intended for the DS Lite.My only complaint aside from the thickness is the fact that unless your DS is spotless before entering the case, any grease or dust will show even more clearly beneath the case.This is only a minor complaint, though. Really, all that matters is that it takes a hit in place of your DS, and since I've stopped using the case in favor of a larger case which holds my DS and games but leaves my DS unprotected during playtime, I've managed to somehow harm my DS, and there is a deep gash in its outer casing. If you're intent on preventing such a situation, this is the right case for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok but not nearly as good as the Nerf Armor","review":"I have both this one and the Nerf Armor.

John Trygve Solbakk has, on behalf of the copyright group Sámi kopiija, made a claim regarding two Sami yoiks which they maintain were stolen by Virgin Records and presented as American Indian songs and dances. According to Solbakk and the Sami people he represents, the well known Sami yoik \\"Normo Jovnna\\" has been listed on the CD as \\"The Counterclockwise Circle Dance.\\" So, while this piece is beautiful and is certainly comes from a very old tradition, it is very likely European, not Native American."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING; MISLEADING","review":"this is not strictly Native American chant and dance! the music is at least 90% techno instrumental and i cannot believe there are so many high rating reviews of pleasure with this CD. for me the reviews were really misleading; the album cover and title misled me too! when you see the antiqued pic of a native American with the words 'Sacred Spirit...Chants...Dances...Native Americans' you think the sound will be like being in the midst of the tribe circle within the realm of connection with nature, etc. i got nothing of such an experience from any one track on this CD. a few parts even sound like a little Latin guitar, but most are the arranged sounds one can compose from selecting the various background beats available on modern electronic keyboards. i'm so unhappy i wasted my time and money, and anticipation energy when looking forward to getting this CD.

I highly recommend this one and the follow-up \\"Sacred Spirit Vol 2: More Chants and Dances of the Native Americans.\\" Purists of tradition may be disappointed.

This music is to be honored and esteemed as a means of remembering the Native Americans, their love for life, and the \\"One God\\" whom they believed. The music in this CD is comforting. Blending of the chants with a constant melody and soothing rhythms encourages sadness, thoughtfulness, humbleness, and content. I recommend this CD to any individual with a need to indulge in a moment of thought and dwell in spiritual meditation. My complements to the ones who created such beauty in Sacred Spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Medition Cd","review":"A friend of mine played this when I was at her house.

She also says not to use decoding and letter sounds...then says in a later chapter to teach letter sounds.The only examples she gives are with predicting books.

The other speakers was also full but not filled to the brim with water, but still made sound.They might do better if mounted under the eves of the house or in an area that offers some protection from rain and snow.

One of the speakers gets pretty wet by the gutters overflowing when we have heavy rain, and they have both had snow on top of them, and they still work fine this Spring.I am considering buying another set for my screened porch area. The only reason they don't get a \\"five star\\" rating from me is that the ease of installation also equals ease of deinstallation.

I thought it was my receiver (as it was small, cheap and under-powered) so I changed it. Still distorted. Then I thought it was my speaker wire - so I changed that too - still distorted. So the the only answer is the speakers. So the sum of my experience is this: Paid over $300 - treated them with care - got 3 summers of OK sound - now I have to shop for new speakers.

The decline years of the WWF are also skimmed over.

It was a little annoying when the writers (Hogan and Michael Jan Friedman) would use the cartoonish \\"hey brother\\" style of dialog characteristic of Hulk Hogan the character, as opposed to Terry Bollea - the man behind the gimmicks.

He never once admits to having too big of an ego to cleanly lose to Sting/Steve Borden at all in this book.

However, I have since read the first 5 in the series and am very disappointed. They were just terrible. In fact, they are getting worse and worse by the book. I guess I don't find the books to reflect the world of Indiana Jones. There is too much mystical elements and the theme it too far-fetched. This book was the worst of the lot though.

After reading a few of Rob MacGregor's entries into this franchise (none of them bad, but never better than good) I have realized that he doesn't have much talent for anything other than taking a small idea and s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g it out to novel length with all the usual padding.In this one Indy is encouraged to go to Mount Ararat to looks for Noahs Ark. Sounds like it's going to be filled with adventure huh? Think again! The ark shows up 14 pages from the end of the book and when Indy is finally inside NOTHING is detailed.and the book pretty much comes to a stop right there.I won't say I was bored by this book, and I almost gave it 3/5, but the fact that there was no big revelation in the final chapter made the effort getting to the ark (for me and for Indy) utterly pointless.The weakest one so far. But I still have a good feeling about the rest of the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring the whole way through","review":"This Indiana Jones book is the first one that I bought, thinking that a book about Indiana Jones and Noah's Ark would be a great story, but to my disapointment it was boring! It took 252 pages to even get to Mount Ararat! It took a long time to get going, and when action got going it was gone just as soon as it had begun. Not the kind of story I would expect from Indiana jones. In all of his movies Indy is finding clues and making sense of them, but in this book there are none of it. Dont get this book if you like the movies, you will be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product of mass production","review":"This book aims low and achieves its mark. If you want action, this book has it. And MacGregor has done his homework regarding the details of Arkeology. But the book has little else. The plot is largely predictable. Difficulties are overcome by paranormalism and luck rather than by skill. The characters have some dimension but still come off as stereotyped. In short, the book has no depth. It is entertaining, but there are plenty of other books in the world that offer entertainment *and* high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good Indy novel.

The protagonist is sixteen and trying to ignore who and what he is, so much so that you really want to shake him very, very hard. I didnt find the writer character as self-obsessed as the other reviewer here, but let's face it: it's a testament to the 1970s that one could write about a sixteen year old and a twenty four year old and not worry that the reader would find it borderline \\"eww icky\\".It is what it is, written now almost forty years ago by someone with good intentions but little real insight into what coming out involves.

That muddle of yellow journalism and folklore that served as a basis for an even more muddled movie is far overshadowed by this well researched and documented look at the reality behind the infamous Five Points slum in old New York. Solid scholarship by Anbinder reveals the racial and ethnic bigotry behind much of the stories found in Ashbury's book- most surprisingly, that no such gang as the Dead Rabbits ever existed except in the minds and columns of New York newspapermen. Using census records Anbinder careful reveals the real lives of the working people of the Five Points through its times as an Irish, African, Chinese slum.

I've been recommended this product by my friends who recently had babies and didn't get any stretch marks (they were using Mustela on regular basis for more than 7 months).I cannot comment on its results on stretch marks as I haven't got any (yet).2 drawbacks of the cream that I find very disturbing:- smell- it's definitely too strong for me and makes me sick each time I apply the cream. The smell rests a long time on the skin and the clothes absorb it, too.- moisture- it stays the whole day on your body and makes the skin sticky (even if you apply a thin layer)!I've been desperately looking for another product to replace this one (I really tried hard using Mustela for 1,5 month every morning- impossible to use it twice a day as recommended!) and just bought Bio Oil that I'm going to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I used this product everyday, twice a day and even rubbed it in just like the directions said. 8 months in and no strech marks but... in the last couple of weeks my stomach was full of them.

Liked the fact that it was fragrance free. But I would not recommend this product to friends because 1) it is very sticky so not only does it get all over your clothes...it makes your clothes stick to your body 2) considering it is for a pregnant women, it scored very high (which is not good) on the level of toxicity on the safe cosmetics database site."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend it...","review":"I used this product for 6 months, started around 12 weeks.

You may have seen mixed reviews about it, but you should not pass it up. If you start using this product from the beginning it will condition your skin so you will not get stretch marks. I'm on baby number 2 and have ZERO stretch marks from my first child. You cannot use this product late in your pregnancy and expect it to work. You should try and use it by month 3 for it to be effective and use it all over your belly, sides, breasts and under your underarms (next to your breasts). I HIGHLY recommend this product as well as all Mustela products. The baby products are even more amazing. They are a bit expensive but at least they work, and you do get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I used this product religiously during my first pregnancy. I did not get a single stretch mark until the last couple of weeks. I am using it again for my second pregnancy, but it is not as tolerable this time around.

I know they say that stretch marks are genetic and there is little that you can do to prevent them, but my mother has large stretch marks from her pregnancies. I don't think that it hurts to try this!The only thing that I didn't like about this product was the scent. I was nauseous for all 9 months each time I was pregnant and I wish an unscented version were available. The scent isn't too bad, but when you're not feeling well to begin with it's just one more thing that flares the nausea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I began using this product at 8 weeks when I didn't have stretch marks yet. Then I developed red stretch marks around my belly throughout my pregnancy. Unfortunately, at 4 months along, we lost our baby. It's been almost 6 months and I still have stretch marks and they have gotten worse. However, the stretch marks didn't get worse because of the lotion. I read in an article that stretch marks are due to the hormones in your body and lotions typically do not work.I applied the lotion as directed and there are no changes at all. The lotion is sticky and does stick to your clothes. I've been using the product everyday for 8 months and there have been no changes!

Either way it wasted my money because the disc was ruined.Now it ruins discs that have been recorded but not finalized by overwriting automatic formating because it does not recognize recordings made by itself.

Sometimes it won't even read DVD+RWs. I suggest to people to go away from these DVD recorders that were pretty much set up to record through an NTSC tuner, and go with a DVD recorder that has a Digital tuner. Although, they aren't made any better than any other DVD recorder. But, at least they don't seem to have a problem reading what has been previuosly recorded on them.

There's no discoloration on my skin, so that's always a plus =) It isn't a super shiny polish, which is perfect for me. This isn't really for other people to see anyways, I wear it under my shirt.

It was a little bit wordy, yet it did contain a lot of information about each of the presidents and how they contributed to the American economy and society and why America started to beome more conservative.

The people that praised on the back cover either never read the book, or were paid to say something nice about it.The basic thesis of the book is that social engineering by the US Federal Government is good, no matter how many tax dollars must be spent, and that all white people who vote Republican are racists who hate poor people. No wonder colleges are getting such bad press these days as the breeding ground of liberals at the expense of the student body.

Most songs also seem to be missing the solo's. I don't know how this one slipped through the cracks at HL. My only guess is on the cover it says \\"Easy Guitar\\". Which in this case seems to mean leave out everything but the basics.

Every other brand that I tried broke or failed to measure up. These are the real deal. The plastic pocket protector is nerdy, but it keeps the tips in one spot when I am working on a wiring harness or a small component. The pocket clip was useless.

These just gripped and turned like there wasn't any problem. They turned easily with little force required in either attaching or removing screws.

As it has turned out, I do not leave this particular toy with him as sometimes the kibble goes shooting out and can land under furniture and my husband is concerned we'll miss some and end up with a pest problem. But, I do give it to him for his 'breakfast' on the days I'm home, and he LOVES it, he plays with it for ages, tail wagging. It takes longer for him to get the food out then for the Tug-A-Jug (even though it's not currently on the hardest setting). It is not noisy on my floor as we have carpet, but sometimes he does slam it into furniture (or my feet so I have to be careful!) which is noisy, but nothing obnoxious for us anyway. I would definitely recommend this. Taking it apart to clean is not a problem for us, but I can see it could be hard as it's a little stiff at times to turn it to get it open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"I have a 5 month old Pyrenees mix and she absolutely loves this toy! She figured out how to get the food out within about 10 minutes and I usually put at least half of her food in the cube every day.

I wouldn't recommend it for all dogs, but if your dog is food-motivated and gets bored easily it is a very good toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog loves his Buster Cube","review":"My dog Butters loves the Buster Cube, he learned how to use it very quickly and sometimes I use it to feed his evening meals out of instead of his food bowl. He loves to roll it around, the only downsides I can think of is that because it is made of very hard plastic it is quite loud and I haven't been able to figure out how to clean the thing. In any case, those are minor things compared to the enjoyment my dog gets out of it...it really stimulate him mentally. The large Buster Cube is large enough and the plastic material is very hard which makes it impossible for him to get a grip on it which will prevent him from chewing on it. It should last a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, indestructible, noisy","review":"I have had this Buster Cube for years. I first bought it for a dog, but my curious cat took it over and loved getting his treats out of it. Then it sat waiting until I got my heeler mix dog who needs indestructible toys that challenge him. I put half of his breakfast in the cube every morning. He rolls it, picks it up and drops it, noses it, pushes it with his feet - it keeps him busy so that I can eat my breakfast in peace. Well, relative peace. I have plush carpeting, and when it gets onto the vinyl it is indeed noisy. I don't care, however, because my buddy enjoys it so much. For this dog in my circumstances, it's a 5-star. I down-rate it a little because it isn't for every dog in every situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dog is annoyed","review":"My dog is pretty smart for a dog. But he does not get this toy. He seems put off by the loud sounds the hard plastic makes on the floor and from within. It's a great idea for a toy and maybe if we had started him with it when he was a much younger dog, or maybe if it had a softer, quieter outer casing he would have taken to it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LOUD!","review":"I purchased this product after reading so many great reviews for it. While it is a great concept, the hard plastic is incredibly LOUD- cacophonous ear splitting loud when the dogs play with it on the hardwood floor. We decided to make it a carpet only toy, but the plastic is also very slippery, so the dogs seem to just scoot it around for a few minutes before getting bored and moving on to better more rewarding things- like the kong ball! The kong ball is rubber so it doesn't clatter and bang as the dogs play with it, and even when its empty they still like to gnaw on it from time to time. I don't recommend the buster cube, unless its for using outside in the yard. Its just too loud for indoor use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I bought this for my large breed dog to use for entertainment. It is VERY difficult for him to get it to tip over. Be aware: it is HARD plastic, with rounded edges. It makes a racket (especially on hard floors) and it is very tough for the dog to tip it over to get the food out. Mostly it scrapes across the floor. In addition to this, there are terrible instructions on use, and it is almost impossible to open up and put food in it in. Even my husband had a really tough time.I seriously wonder if it is has had some major manufacturing change since many of these positive reviews were written.....Don't waste your money. I did not try to return it, as I wouldn't be able to get it clean enough to feel good about returning it.*I purchased the large size red cube"},{"rating":"2","title":"my dog loves it!!!!","review":"I got this toy because my golden Cody started chewing up books and other things when home alone and bored. He loves his \\"food cube\\" and knows to go get it when I ask for it. It took him about 5 minutes to figure this out, we put it on the easiest setting for that first time, after a week we had to put it on the \\"Max\\" setting, because he just emptied it too fast. It definately works better on carpeted floors, is super noisy, and gets stuck under or behind things and t hen he can't figure out how to get it out. I can't leave him alone with it because he seems to like to perform, if I leave the room he gets bored with it and won't play again until I come back to watch him. My only complaint with this is that I haven't been able to figure out how to get the thing open to clean it. Its supposed to be easy to do, but all I end up doing is hurting my fingers trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"Our only problem with it is because we have ceramic floors. The cube tends to slide instead of tipping over. When it's on carpet it's a great toy. One of my dogs figured out that the most food comes out when she throws it down the stairs. It's funny but VERY NOISY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buster Cube - Great for 5 Minutes","review":"Buster Cube - Large - 4 1/2 in.We were excited to get this for our German Shepherd Dog, because we wanted something that would keep him occupied while we were gone. Based on the reviews we'd read, we thought it would be a good idea. It was, at first. Our dog had a great time tossing it around, trying to get the treats out of it. However, not more than a few hours after we gave it to him, he was poking holes in it with his teeth. He'd completely destroyed in within two days.It would be perfect if the material was a bit stronger for those aggressive chewers and larger dogs like German Shepherds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to feed/engage dogs","review":"The Buster Cube works great for slowing down a dog's eating habits. Instead of gorging down a food serving in seconds, the dog has to work at it, so it's better for dog digestion as well as stimulating for the dog. There is actually some skill to learn since on different surfaces, the cube behaves differently. For eg, on grass, the dog has to move/roll the cube very slowly and carefully in order not to scatter the food all over the grass and not be able to find it.Only complaints are: On the setting with the smallest opening, the dog is still able to get the food out fairly quickly. We had no need for any other setting. Also, as mentioned by others, we could not take apart the cube at all (following the instructions). As long as you use dry food though, maybe you'll never have to take it apart to clean it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps puppy busy","review":"I bought this item for my 4 month old puppy. It only took him a few minutes to catch on and want it all to himself. The only problem was that he had trouble rolling it (with both his paws and nose). His paws would slide right off of the slick surface. I went to a local home improvement store and bought some non-skid tape (like you see on outdoor stairs...gritty like sandpaper, but a tape) and put some on all of the sides, except for the hole. Now he rolls it around without problems....that's the only issue with this toy. Otherwise, it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard & Clunky - Not so much Fun.","review":"This toy appeared to be fun from the description, but almost 2 years later, our dogs never played with it, let alone look at it. It's hard plastic and makes a loud noise when you toss it on hard floors - like dropping a melamine material bowl on the floor. If it would've been made out of firm rubber (like a kong), I think it would've interested them. But it's so hard, they can't bite into it to grip it. Might be good for a dog who just likes to push stuff around on the floor. I also bought the purple plastic bottle with the rope coming out of it, same material. Too hard and I have some rabid chewers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend","review":"I couldn't get the center cylander out.

It is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, not so great execution","review":"The Buster Food Cube is a great idea for slowing dogs down when eating. It is like a big puzzle to dispense kibbles as rewards. It has a clever settings system to make it easier or harder for your pet. I really wanted this to work, but I'm afraid the shape and slick plastic material used renders it almost unusable for our dog. There are not good gripping surfaces for the dog to get hold of. It is also hard to roll around a cube, especially a slick one. Of course the hard plastic shape is loud on wood or tile surfaces, again, making it difficult to roll over.I applaud the concept but our dog gave it two paws down. Maybe large dogs will have better luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept - needs improvement","review":"In concept it is a good idea but in practice there is some work needed. Neither my husbands nor I have been able to open it to clean and as such I stopped using it. I also believe that this is not a toy for big dogs inside the house. Dogs really enjoy it, yes; however the hard plastic is extremely loud, slides on hardwood floors and gets caught under furniture and dog just plows through it to get to it.Update: Took the cube to the pet store and they were unable to open it as well. As a matter of fact we did try 3 other cubes in stock and were able to open only 1 of them. A better option in my opinion is the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"From labs to Yorkies","review":"We originally got our buster cube for the labrador retrievers that crossed our threshold (my family used to raise guide dogs). Our family dog never caught on to how to use the toy, but we kept it around. We now have a Yorkie that's very insistant on what he wants, and one day, he wanted the buster cube. Now, keep in mind, this was a buster cube meant for a labrador retriever, not for our \\"teapot\\" (larger than average) Yorkie. But he loves it! He whimpers for it when he wants it, and we've recently had to remove it from his vicinity and wash it well so he can't smell it, or else he'll drive us nuts!

I mean, how could it go wrong? It spilled treats out intermittently when she pushed it around.I am the one who had problems with it. I found it very hard to adjust. You have to stick your thumb inside at an odd angle and move it about to get what you want clicked into place. I don't even have fat or large thumbs and found it hard and painful to do. I even managed to get my thumb stuck inside this stupid toy and had to literally cut it off my finger with a saw.

You have to throw away the ball otherwise I'm sure it's a wet dark haven for bacteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog destroyed it","review":"My 10 month old Great Dane puppy loved it for about 3 weeks, then figured out that she could stick her lower jaw in the hole and rip the core out by holding the rest of the cube with her paws. I don't know if a smaller dog could have pulled that off, but once she got the core out the whole thing was ruined within a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy toy","review":"We feed our dog exclusively from food puzzles and treat toys to keep him entertained. This toy has a good concept but could use a redesign. It was SO noisy with the kibble rolling around in there and due to it's shape, it didn't roll easily so our dog would just slide it around and bang it into the walls forcefully. He was probably having fun with the challenge but we just couldn't handle how loud it was. Plus it's really hard to open the middle. I was bummed out to return it to the store because it's a nice idea, especially with the ability to adjust the difficulty level.Perhaps our dog just wasn't clever enough to figure out how to get this cube to roll and make the treats fall out, but even if he did, the kibble rattling around in there would still be too noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, do not buy.","review":"Stainless steel is already rusting, suction cups can't hold on for a day.When this little basket actually stays put, the top is tilted out, just like another Reviewer already commented."},{"rating":"1","title":"look cheap!","review":"I don't like this because It's too small and look cheap.

I love that my sponge does not show when you look across my kitchen landscape. The holder also allows the sponge to dry on all sides so bacteria growth is slowed on the sponge. It also reduces the spread of bacteria to the sink/counter where it typically resides lying down flat. It does occasionally leap off but in general the suction cups are very strong and I am happy enough to put it back on once or twice a month. It is trivial. It is rare to find such a handy and satisfying device for a modest amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick to sink","review":"I had high hopes for this 'sink center', but we have a stainless sink and one of the suction cups doesn't stick.

The cups, despite being moistened, didn't hold against smooth and cleaned tiles or porcelain.

Ultimately I chose to have it sit inside my sink.The construction is wonwderful for holding sponges, and no grime/water accumulates.I currently have it holding 2 scrubbing sponges. It fits them nicely. It would not hold 3, but very comfortably holds 2 standard size kitchen scrub/sponges. If you got one of those super fat sponges it would probably only hold one. But you can rely on it holding 2 of any standard size sponges or scrubbers.I'm very pleased. This was an inexpensive purchase for something that has a lot of function and a nice form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sponge smells better","review":"The Interdesign 84702 Suction Sink Center works pretty well. It gets the sponge off of the sinktop and allows air to get to it on 3 sides so the sponge doesn't start to stink. The only drawback is sometimes the suction cups come loose and one has to really dry the side of the sink to get it to adhere again. But you can't beat the price so it was a real bargain compared to the other sponge holders I saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!

When I place my hand over the end of the attachment hose, there's very little suction there. It's dusty and dirty and -- to sum it up -- it just doesn't work.As others have said, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" In my opinion, this vacuum isn't worth the forty-some bucks I paid for it.Our small city has a citywide pickup of unwanted items that can't be placed in the trash, twice a year.

I got the replacement and tried to get the belt on with advice from the free help line and finally was successful--however the roller was broken and the girl suggested I but a new vacuum. I couldn't find the receipt so I bought my third and final Powerforce. It lasted 3 weeks and started to smoke immediately when something got caught up in the roller yesterday.

It has a three year warrantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible-waste of money!!!","review":"I was initially pleased with this vacuum cleaner, since it replaced a broken one and I was in desperate need of a vacuum cleaner. However, it almost immediately started to lose suction power, and its tiny dirt cup needed to be emptied incessantly. If you have pets, the fur gets caught up above the dirt cup, requiring you to remove the upper filter or twist your hands around awkwardly to remove it. The vacuum cleaner was filthy and smelled awful from the first use. It finally died after barely a year of use, and, to be honest, I was relieved. I replaced it with a bagged Hoover Tempo. I do not recommend bagless - filthy, disgusting cups to empty, and you can't use the vacuum cleaner to clean the vacuum cleaner...waste of money. And I HIGHLY discourage you from purchasing this model - it was immediately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"this vacuum sucks because it doesn't","review":"I bought this vacuum at Wal-Mart for my apartment a couple years ago and I can't even use it anymore.

The hose still works, but it's very cumbersome. It has difficulty picking up anything (light items like a strand of hair and heavier like dry cat food), you have to aim hose \\"just right\\" for it to even attempt to grab anything, and the hose is only reaches 4 feet!In short if you only need a vacuum for 3 months, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"bissell powerforce sucks","review":"Do not buy one.I purchased one of these and it lost its suction within 2-3 months.I purchased another one and it had the same exact issue.I should have read the reviews ahead of time but needed vacuum cleaner in a fast pinch and thought that this would be a good one.Do not buy this unless you are willing to waste your moneyIf I could give it ZERO STARS I WOULD."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEICE OF JUNK ROLLER KEEPS MELTING","review":"I GOT THIS VACUME FROM WALMART.

Once I used the PowerForce, I didn't even bother to get the WindTunnel serviced.I loved the price on the PowerForce and was astonished at how much suction such a lightweight and easily maneuverable machine achieves. I really like that I can take virtually the entire vacuum apart and clean it- which translates to NO SUCTION LOSS! The belt is reasonably priced and easy to replace and requires much less effort than I expected (the belt broke when I accidentally sucked up a t-shirt). The HEPA filter is also reasonably priced (vs. $30 for the WindTunnel) due to the compact size.I love this vacuum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this vacuum sucks!","review":"I have had it with this vacuum!!

The Kaplan Deluxe Edition is a good tool for reviewing for it in the information it provides, but it is also very frustrating to use. There are videos that play whenever one goes to do a lesson or review that cannot be skipped or turned off. So, something that would take 15 seconds to read takes 2 minutes for a silly video to play. Therefore, the program can be very time consuming to do a simple review. Also, some information is repeated over and over again, with one being unable to skip it. The first video that gives a tour of the program states that the GRE is more difficult than the SAT because the person taking it is now college-educated; however, the program is not designed with a college-educated person in mind. It seems to be designed for entering junior high, with \\"fun and exciting\\" graphics and clips.Overall, the information in it is useful, but I would recommend getting a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par","review":"I bought this and am quite frustrated with it.

You must sit through the entire lesson along with all of the annoying jokes, just to get to one point that you want to refresh. Also there is no way to stop during a lesson or test.

I had wanted to read the original novel before the new movie came out at the end of July. I was always a fan of the original movies. If you have seen the original movies you will notice small bits and pieces that were taken out from the book. Otherwise the novel and the original movies seemed to have quite different elements to me.

It is a clever little parable about dogmatism, anthropocentrism, racism and classism, the nature of \\"humanity,\\" and the difference between stagnation and creativity. The book is also different enough from the movies that reading it will come as a fresh and surprising journey to an unknown land. The twists and double twists and the many ironies in the book also make it an enjoyable read. For those who have seen the movies, they might find it intriguing to see how three of the five movies had their basis in this small book - namely Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I had such high hopes when I began reading this book. The story itself is excellent. The idea of having a planet that's inhabited by apes where humans are the animals is indeed an interesting plot. The problem with the book is that while the plot is interesting, the way the story is told is not. I found myself thinking \\"when is this book going to end?\\" The only redeeming quality of the book is the last part. This was much less interesting than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"snooze","review":"I never liked the movie, except for the statue of liberty scene at the end, which isn't even in the book.

Wake me when it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Mirror!","review":"Sadly, this imaginative book has been overshadowed by the movies and TV series. Overall, this is a solidly written sci-fi novel. It starts with a couple finding Mr. Merou's manuscript in a bottle. Fine, a cliched begining. But, the pace soon picks up. In 2500 professor Antelle and doctor Levain set off on a spaceship journey. They reach their destination to an earthlike planet. They run into mute humans and than the sky figuratively falls. They are captured by talking Apes-military class, who rule the planet with Chimpanzees-middle class, Orangutans-ruling class who live as 20th century humans. This reverse world is riveting for it holds a mirror to the reader of how awful humans can be. Merou wins some simians over, but he is a threat to the established order. Finally, Merou flees and returns to earth, where he gets a jolting surprise. Despite, some oversimplifications the action and premise are very compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richblue2","review":"Expecting the dark tones of the movie, I was taken off-guard by the Jules-Verne type first person narrative. We see more of the apes reactions and hatred toward humans in the movie while the book focuses on the lone intelligent man, Ulysse. We only hear of the apes attitudes from Zira and Cornelius, and then only at the time when action must be taken. Ulysse almost blissfully accepts his position and attempts to blend in, while Taylor is in a constant struggle for survival among a hostile species. The ending of the book came as a pleasant surprise for me in that I was expecting one similar to the movie. I think the imagination of both Boulle and Wilson and Serling (screenplay writers) are exceptionally displayed in the two endings. All in all, a very enjoyable book. A very relaxing and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A capable analogy of modern Americas decline","review":"I read the book over 20 years ago as a young adult hooked on the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" movie series.

Hail Zaius!","review":"I could never have imagined how different the original book is from the movie. A few examples: 1.The hero is a french journalist not an American astronaut. His sensibilities are decidedly un-Heston-esque. 2.The gorillas are more a force to be reckoned with, not only becuase of their brute power but because they are the most organized. While the other apes,the scientists,scholars etc. are busy debating and postulating, the gorillas just go out and get things done. They are the most effective administrators. 3.The satire in the book hits the same targets as the movie,(Science,Religion,Gov't,Academia) it just hits harder. 4.The book is funnier than the movie, but the villains are just as menacing. 5.Zaius isn't the top dog! A shocking revelation to be sure, but there is an ape even more highly placed than Doc. Z!They're both very good. I was happy to find out that I could enjoy the movie and the book independantly of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, easy read","review":"I saw the movie first, and I prefer the story as presented in the movie, but the differences are interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time faves","review":"I first read this in French when I was at school, and I've have copies of the book in French and English. I have read it numerous times over the years and never tire of it.As everyone has said, the story and the setting are completely different from the movie. The themes of this book are satirical and ironic, but also deeply thought provoking. Civilisation dying because of intellectual idleness. Specious claims about why one species ended up on top of the evolutionary pile rather than another.The book is well written. It is almost bound to be, since Boulle would have been educated in the days when the French could really really write. On the other hand it lacks the drama of the first movie for large sections of the movie. In addition, though, Boulle was a fount of interesting ideas. He also inspired both Bridge over the River Kwai and The Fly. Classic Science Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless science fiction classic!","review":"The fantastic journey of French spaceman/journalist Ulysse Merou is a timeless classic of science fiction. It's a sad narrative, although the ending is quite positive (if one consider the harsh circumstances) to the spaceman.Every page in the book has significance to the narrative, to the developing of the story. This book walks hand in hand with the best works of Asimov and Clarke. I don't know if writer Pierre Boulle has other books of this quality (other than The Bridge Over River Kwai) that eventually were not translated to Enlgish.It's simple one of the best science fiction books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astonishing body of work.","review":"Each of the novellas in CITY OF SAINTS AND MADMEN independently is an utter gem...but to have them contained under one cover is to truly appreciate the idiosyncratic genius of VanderMeer. In this presentation, his darkly fantastical city of Ambergris is allowed to fully crystallize in our imaginations, and take on a truly persuasive sense of reality, however surreal the occurences within its borders. VanderMeer's Ambergris novellas are thrillingly original, literate and funny, frightening and moving. THE TRANSFORMATION OF MARTIN LAKE might be my favorite of these offerings, but one would be hard pressed to choose. This reader gives CITY OF SAINTS AND MADMEN his highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting little story with a quirky twist.","review":"I think Jeff Vandermeer is more popular in Europe than the United States. I have to admit he is a very good writer who can sure turn a phrase. He has a wry sense of humor and a quirky style. That said, City of Saints and Madmen was a hard book for me to get into, mostly because I prefer a more action oriented style in my fantasy. Still a good work, and its popularity shows its worth. The characters were interesting in a quirky way, and I would recommend the book to anyone who likes their fantasy to be a strange vision in a world of dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borgesian madness","review":"A satisfyingly bewildering read, a good head-scratching adventure for lovers of Borges, Calvino, and Lovecraft. Includes tentacles, bookstores, subterranean races, self-referential labyrinths, secret codes,and alternate realities. Sometimes the prose is a little overworked, like a deep-fried Mars bar, but perhaps \\"Vandermeer\\" is just trying to write in the style of his pretentious ostensible author-characters. Of course, if you live in Edinburgh, this book will just seem like stark realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea/poor execution","review":"Not only that but it was written inexpertly and with much emphasis on a sort of phoniness which made me cringe as i read. This book is intentionally aimed towards a subculture obsessed with Victorian era curios, thinly-veiled Lovecraftian reference, and fresh water squid. If any of that sounds like your cup of tea then by all means buy this book. Personally the writing style made me feel like I was reading a history of a place too far removed from my world. The hints were vague and the glossary complex. 4/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare and wonderful","review":"If you like E.A.Poe, Lord Dunsany, Mervyn Peake, the Jack Vance of Dying Earth, the Michael Moorcock of Gloriana and Dancers at the End of Time, the M.John Harrison of In Viriconium, the J.G.Ballard of Vermilion Sands -- you'll be able to add this to your shelf of favorites for reading and re-reading. Atmospheric, dreamlike, intelligent. This is one of the very best of the literary fantasy writers. VanderMeer's rep. has been growing apace and this is a great introduction to his strange world of Ambergris. A fine, original work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly fantastic","review":"It has been a long time since I've been this excited about being introduced to an author. Indeed, VanderMeer reminds me of the last author to get me this excited, Gene Wolfe. VanderMeer displays the same fine mastery and appreciation for the language as Wolfe, delights in weaving atypical plots as Wolfe does, and for making unexceptional people the focus of a story -- again, as Wolfe does.Now, if you haven't read any Gene Wolfe (you should do that as soon as you get done with this book), let me explain what that means: pure and absolute delight. Every piece (and it is hard to determine how many there actually are) is stunning in its complexity and richness. Prose like this comes along about once a decade, and I'm glad to be participating in it.Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK","review":"I dont' want to be harsh on this book because it is quality fantasy. In other words, it's not of the epic fantasy genre. The biggest problem was that I never fully grasped Ambergris. Its like Ambergris was a giant painting and I only saw small slices of it. It feels more like a hastilly published companion piece to a successful novel that takes place in Ambergris. The stories themselves didn't stand out to me. Martin Lake was my favorite story but I found it predictable in some ways and thus a let down. Drabin, in Love was OK but not exceptional. And Mr X was poor. The early history was good but it needed something more to go with it than the 3 other stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repuslive and elegant","review":"It is hard to avoid acknowledging the intelligence behind this work but it is equally hard to understand the point. The author dislikes his characters and his city, focusing on ugliness, squalor, stench, and scat. There is a lot of shocking and unpleasant material often told in a highly imaginative and creative fashion. The writing is erudite, complex, and sophisticated but also full of hatred for the characters. I could not find any psychological realism or meaningful plots but did find vivid, pungent, toilet imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing, creepy and amusing world!","review":"I first heard about this book from [...], which made it the number 1 Best SF and Fantasy Books of 2002: Editors' Choice.

They are well built, clean looking, and easy to use.The universal mount is no exception. It's a little flimsier than the custom mounts. While the custom projector mounts (drilled specially for each projector model) is basically just a flat piece of steel with the appropriate attachment points, the universal mount is a bit like a spider, which allows adjustments for basically any projector. This is great as it will fit anything, but the downside is that you have these arms that attach and cause weak points. Nothing drastic mind you, but enough for a bit of a wobble when adjusting the alignment.If you can get a custom plate for your projector, do it! If you're unlucky and bought one that doesn't match, the universal mount fits the bill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is This?","review":"I'm no Calloway officianado but I'd say this is easily the worst album in my entire collection. In fact, it is so disappointing I'm heading immediately to a record store to trade for something else. I thought Cab Calloway was a singer. The first 5 tracks I've listened to don't have any singing-- most notably Viper's Drag and Happy Feet. What's the point? I expect that most newcomers to Cab Calloway will be sorely disappointed with this one. Oh yeah, and the sound quality of the last third of the album is terrible. Unless you're trying to impress someone, save your money, 'cause you're never going to listen to this album again."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ!","review":"I love this book!!! It's loaded with great information yet entertaining and easy to read. I've read similar books and articles but found them pretty dull. I'm not that interested in reading a lot of studies and surveys.

It should say to put file in the gumbos if it was any good because much better than thyme. The ingredients in their combinations look disappointing or maybe I expect too much of a French influence. Oh well plain cooking has its merits if it was what Ma used to make but if I go to the bother of doing it from a cook-book I expect more.I have the Southern Living annuals that are much better and have more recipes and variety.The binding is a serrated plastic spine so it was easy to tear out pages I did not want and ended up with 1/6 of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Some of the most important ARIAS for a trained Baritone.

Seems to be more oriented towards racing or endurance than just the average person who likes to paddle around. It doesn't have enough information for somebody just starting out, and it has no useful information for an advanced kayaker. Example: He says he's never tried a dry suit, but then goes on to tell you to use a two piece, but that they are probably too hot anyway... As for roll recoveries - he more or less says nobody really does that and it's too hard to explain anyway, so he didn't bother.

I've been paddling a plastic 16-foot kayak for two years and felt I was ready to advance in the sport. Reading Glickman's book was the next best thing to knowing a really experienced paddler who is happy to answer all your questions - including those you don't know enough to ask. When he listed the common mistakes paddlers make in the forward stroke, he could have been talking about me. I followed his advice and saw immediate improvement. The chapter on choosing a kayak was invaluable, and will save me a lot of money and time when I'm ready to upgrade.

I only read about fifteen pages and gave up because the book was so childish! I know that the Twilight books are young adult books also, but the story was so good I finished the entire series in a week. This book is nothing in comparison. It is only about 200 pages and has huge type. It reminded me of the books I read in sixth grade! The Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire Series are short books also, but at least they deal with adult topics and the type is of normal size. I really wanted a new vampire series to read after I finished Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse since I enjoyed the books so much and wasn't ready to leave the world of vampires yet, but the Vampire Diaries just doesn't cut it. The characters aren't developed and the writing is very immature. I think I'll try the Anne Rice vampire books instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"So-so book. It's the first time I've ever wished the heroine would 'get hers'. Elena is a shallow, petty girl who only wants Stefan because she thinks he doesn't want her. She's the typical narcissistic prom queen who usually ends up the first victim. What was the author thinking? I honestly don't find how this book fits in with the others since it says that Damon and Stefan were made vampires in 15th century Italy. In follow-up books, they're supposedly from Mystic Falls and only 170 years old. Very confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a fan of the TV show, don't read this book","review":"If you love the well-rounded characters, complicated plot lines and sharp wit of The Vampire Diaries television series, be warned that you won't find ANY of that in the book. This book is meant for preteens, so don't read it if you are over 12. Very little actually happens in the book -- the writing lacks plot and character development. The book and the TV show have little in common other than you see some of the same names, Elena and Stefan love each other, and there are vampires. Surprisingly, Elena is actually rather unlikeable in the book . . . shallow and vain, the type of high school queen bee who enjoys bossing around her \\"underlings\\" and can't imagine that any boy wouldn't instantly fall at her feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This book, THE AWAKENING, seems like the beginning of a really dull and droned out series by L.J.

I bought it because I've gotten hooked on the tv series. What a disappointment! Elena is not at all likeable, and she and all the other characters are as flat as dishwater. She falls in love with Stefan over about three pages.Speaking of pages, this book is short - not as in \\"short and sweet\\", but as in \\"it's only the first third of a decent book\\". It says it is 300+ pages, but the typeface is HUGE. It is only the first part of a decent book in terms of substance as well. Absolutely nothing happens. Elena meets Stefan and Damon (briefly) and finds out they're vampires. That's it. (Must be the reason the first 2 books are now sold together in some listings.)Having read this book, I have SO much more respect for the tv show.

I also found the romance to be so cliche. How many times do they have to say \\"oh, stefan!\\" and \\"Oh, Elena...\\" really now...All in all, if you are about 12-15 you might like it because it is very childish.

Elena and Stefan eventually become a couple and fall in love. But Stefan has a secret past and a very big secret which Elena soon finds out. Elena does not let the secret keep her away from Stefan though. Soon she finds out that he has an evil brother named Damon who has something very in common with Stefan.

I've been watching the show on the CW from the start and couldn't believe that it was aired -- it's too good. I heard a lot about the book and gave it a try. It was so disappointing, I couldn't believe it. The show makes each character a real person. The book doesn't care to. On the plus side, I finished it, which is unusual for poorly written novels on my end.Word of warning, do not expect the CW characters... this is an entirely different thing altogether.

On the Stefan's Diaries she comes to live with them because she's an orphan and they've never met before and on this one her father still alive when they meet. Another thing that i've noticed was that she used to wear the lapis stone as a necklace and on this one is a ring? And to top it off, she never mention her creator Klaus to Stefan or Damon or even her story about how she became a vampire and on this one she does with details and everything. What happened? Shouldnt those facts be the same? But overall the series are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Awakening","review":"First in the series.

ALWAYS... Until I read this pile of pathetic.The show is actually 100 times better than the movie. This book offers no substance, a rushed love story with no rhyme or reason as to why Elena loves Stefan and vice verse.Anyhow in the show Elena is sweet, reserved and likeable. In the book, she's a self entitled prom queen, a girl hard to relate to, who is mean to her friends and feels entitled to her men just because she is pretty. Barf.Then you have Stefan, who falls for her and yearns for her... why?I only liked Damon in the book, who is witty, fun, but Elena does not even deserve him as her character in this book.Sadly this one is a joke, and does not stick to the shows plot, thank God for that, or it would have been an awful show."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the Show","review":"I bought at first Stephan's Diaries #1 (whatis awesome,because you can read more what happend,more details) and ordered already #2!

So I started reading the books. They are great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still hooked.","review":"I am twenty three years old now, and have loved these books since I stole them from my older sister years ago. They're dark, romantic, and creepy. Now that I'm older I recently reread them, I admit that they sometimes feel like a cheap Anne Rice rip off, but they're still fun. Elena is everything every girl wants to be, brave, beautiful, and smart all rolled into one, she rolls with even the most outlandish punches, and still manages to feel real. Even in the midst of a vampire brother love triangle, you can still relate. She's not always sweet and pure, and the vamp brothers have their issues too but that adds to their charm. This trilogy is totally worth reading, especially if you still find Anne Rice a little tough going. They'll give you the creeps, and make you cry eventually, but always in the best way possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most achingly beautiful series ever written.","review":"I was introduced to LJ Smith through The Vampire Diaries seven years ago, and I have been an avid fan ever since. I am 20 years old now, and these books are still a major part of my universe -- I can't imagine a time I never knew Stefan, Elena, Damon, Bonnie, Meredith, or Matt -- hell, even Tyler and Caroline and Katherine. Rereading these books as many times as I have...the magic never dies. It is still there.I was heartbroken when I learned the series was out of print, and that a whole new generation of LJ's fan would never know how incredible this series is. When I heard they wree being reprinted this year, I couldn't help myself. I sincerely hope The Secret Circle trilogy will be next.Please, please read these books. They'll change your life. Okay, maybe not, but I promise, you will NOT be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not L. J.'s best","review":"I would have liked this book a lot better if the main character was a more interestingperson than Elena, who seems to be the personification of the stereotypical boy-crazy mallrat teenagegirl. I LOVE vampires, but this is ridiculous. Like when Stefan starts going to high school - oh please. He's hundreds of years old; as if he needs to learn about algebra. School is bad enough when you HAVE to go. Books like this are why I prefer Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite, even if Anne *is* getting too religious, and Poppy too violent - at least they don't show the entire world from a teenage perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Thrilling, and Exciting","review":"The Awakening is a fabulous book if you are into vampires.

How can a girl famous for golden hair, have an actress that's a brunette! I love Damon and Bonnie (who isn't a black bad girl), but I think they got Damon dead on, except I pictured him a little shorter.

Elena's character is so annoying, she's so stuck up and judging from the reviews apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so. I've already ordered a used version of the first two (thank God I didn't order new versions) so I'll at least give the first one a chance. If I don't like it, which seems to me to be very likely, then at least I can give it to my sister. I really don't want another stupid vampire story like Twilight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I liked this book. But I have only seen the show before I started reading. So for me it was so confusing since Elaina had blond hair and a little sister. Then Bonnie' s last name is different. I would recommend just to pick one. The show or the books.

Just couldn't get into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters are shallow","review":"I really like the show on CW and I enjoyed reading the Twilight Saga so I figured I'd check this book out. The first 100 pages was so bad I flipped forward a 100 pages to try to finish off the book. It is just seriously lacking. The characters are shallow and hard to care about. Elena is a little twit, what 500 year old vampire could seriously love her? Katherine is weak? How can that be? She's a vampire! The end of the first book didn't even make me want to read on. I felt the dialogue was forced and very unnatural. I was imagining some of the dialogue as if it was used in the show (an actual conversation) and it was horrible. Twilight is better written and the characters are better developed. I've seen better stories written by middle school kids and Smith is supposed to be a professional. Please. Don't bother wasting your money. I'm glad I picked this up at the library. I'll be returning it promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I bought the book on my kindle after watching the first two seasons of the tv-show, I thought it would be the same stories, but it's not.

LJ's just got this way of telling you in just the right perspective that makes you feel it is you that all this has happened to.

The usual fun to read action of swords and men can't be found, not even the wail of a woman.

I think the show is great, the best new show I have seen in awhile. After reading the first book, I would say that the show is loosely based off of the books. The show writers have taken a lot of liberties, and I would say, improved upon the original.Take Elena, the main character in both the book and the show. In the book, she is quite mean and self-involved, while in the show she is down to earth and unassuming. I far prefer the show version of Elena. Needless to say, the main character being a polar opposite in the show versus the book can tell you how different the two stories are.When all was said and done with this book, I was unimpressed. I think that it was a rough version of what it could have been. This book needs work, the story is hardly fleshed out at all, making the emotions the characters feel quite unbelievable.Watch the show, skip the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mills and Boon with blood","review":"I read both the positive and negative Amazon reviews regarding this book before I started on my own. I am a female, who loves romance and a good vampire story, but I found it quite average. I know, personally, I couldn't relate to Elena, her being the most popular girl in the school and all of that. Im more likely to barrack for the underdog. I think the romantic tension between her and Stefan is a little forced. It doesn't flow too nicely, because its trying so hard to be intense. And you think, well this girl has beauty and popularity - why cant someone else get the drama? I think I better just stick to watching Buffy on TV - and barrack for willow and xander!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TVD","review":"I love watching TVD but man is the book bad. I am so glad the writers took a different approach to the show. The writing in the book was horrible and the character's personalities weren't very good. I hate Elena in the book. No one wants to read a book where the main character is a b****. Plus I hate stories were the main characters fall in love right away. In the book, Elena is instantly in love with Stefan even though they don't spend any time together. That is not how it happens in real life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If you are a fan of the twilight series I highly recommend that you read this!

The books and show are so different that after I read to the 3rd book, I could still watch the show without getting confused as to why it was produced the way it is.

Our dishwasher has a stainless steel finish, so a magnet will not work. I thought this suction-cup thingie would work perfectly! Afterall, the surface of the washer is as smooth as humanly possible and perfectly clean. Wrong. The suction cup would never stay on for more than 30 minutes before falling away. After it fell for the second time, from a height of approximately 2 feet off a linoleum surface, the plastic disk (that has the words 'clean' and 'dirty' and that you rotate on the spindle) broke completely in two. I glued it back together, but of course now it looks awful and in any event it still won't stick to anything without falling off within a few minutes.

It's black background and clear text vs clear background and black text. That's a problem because the only place on the dishwasher that I could get the suction cup to stick is on the black area near the buttons rendering it unreadable. I can (and probably will) glue some white paper behind it so that I can read it, but it also has a problem of turning too easily so that I often see it sideways and revert to my old trick to see if the dishes are clean or not by checking to see if the machine is locked. None of my front is metal meaning magnetic signs were out, so I so wanted the suction idea to work, but this one just doesn't quite pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I haven't had ay problems with the suction cup, as mentioned above.

The book outlines a process which will help get you organized and keep your priorities in line. I think that Harris sets the standard to give us an example of someone who religiously follows Discipline. Karen really adds a nice bit of perspective that makes the message so simple and well layed out that it's going to be a lot harder for me to put things off.

This book gives me good insight also on how to organize my daily tasks in life to be more productive.

The authors do a great job of discussing the things that cause indifference.

The book is stuffed with quotations from famous dead people and the authors of other self-help books, making you wonder if the authors of this book have ever read anything other than self-help books and Bartlett's Familar Quotations. The one useful idea that I got from the book is that most people can get by on less sleep than they think. The authors don't tell you how to do it, but they're probably right. The authors are rather boastful about their own self-discipline but are unable to share that success with their readers in any useful way. You could tear out every other page and, aside from transition problems, never notice their absence.I bought another book on self-discipline at the same time as this one. The second, Self-Discipline in 10 Days, was excellent. It included practical, step-by-step, how-to-do-it information. There were almost no quotes or success stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst-written book I've ever read","review":"Not only do the authors rant on and on about the demise of discipline in our society, they write as if they were still in junior high! There were lots of little suggestions about what the authors do to be disciplined but they apparently grew up this way and have no idea how to explain this to others who've been less than disciplined most of their lives. I also didn't like the bashing of the undisciplined; I thought the authors' mission was to teach discipline - they sure don't think much of people who don't have it. Overall, a poorly written, negative, repetitive, uninformative book. Just goes to show that anyone can start their own publishing company in order to publish their own propaganda! And a tree was killed for this! After reading the titles of the positive reviews, it is pretty evident they are marketing ploys - they sound like the ones you find inside front covers (written by people who are requested to come up with something to say)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, lots of filler with little substance","review":"From the reviews, I was expecting more. The word \\"discipline\\" was used so often without giving a clear definition or clear steps of how to obtain it. A lot of the meaning of this book was lost in ramblings about their authors own lives, families, and innate discipline.Mostly the emphasis was on maintaining a strict schedule and talking to yourself in your head to trick yourself into doing something. Yes, positive affirmation can go a long way to training the mind to achieve your goals, but this approach was unscientific and childish.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this book.","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews and was very disappointed.

For me, this is the main idea in the book. To forge a new relationship with time.The book is not well written in terms of sentence structure and grammar, and is loaded with typos such as \\"you're happiness\\" etc. Such errors often got in the way of my ability to appreciate the material. The whole book reads like a first draft that was thrown together in a few weeks. With these qualifiers, I'd still say that I enjoyed reading this book. It's a raw, loosely edited outpouring of enthusiasm for a life lived with motivation and discipline. If you don't get caught up in the poorly written aspects, it's possible to get swept up in this enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This is the first book that I have ever returned to Amazon, because of the content not meeting my expectations.

There's a lot of things that bothered me about this book, many of which were already mentioned, so I will try not to repeat them. See the 1 star rating reviews! I should have paid closer attention to them. First of all, stylistically it is so poorly written! It's like a high school student wrote this book; no offense to the honor English kids. Despite the title, it offered no help for the undisciplined. The only thing good about it is that it is nice and short and requires very little reading comprehension. So, even if you are so undisciplined, you can still finish it:) What exactly is this book about? It is a poorly written autobiography. Mr Kern said that it is ok to have an ego, as long as you don't let anyone know about it. THEN HE WRITES A BOOK LIKE THIS!

I can say that I read and loved the first chapter and was motivated, but it quickly tanked from there. The author's in my opinion are not really \\"experts\\" and remind me of just some average people out there that are trying to make it big.

It is written by two self-righteous, self-important people whose qualifications are questionable. It is written in the first and second person; either the author is patting himself on the back, or patting his co-author. It's great that they apply a discipline in their lives, but preaching it is different from giving those of us without self discipline the knowledge and \\"how-to's\\" to break the laziness habit. \\"Just do it\\" doesn't cut it.

A lengthy 'introduction' dwells on how great the lead author is in the eyes of the co-author, and vice-versa (seemingly an effort to lend a kind of co-credibility). The advice that is eventually given consists mainly of antedoctal and single-minded paragraphs extolling us to get up early and stop wasting time.Addressing the causes behind a lack of self-discipline would appear to be in order, but no discernible effort is made toward that end.Keep looking - I'm sure there are better ways to attain self-discipline than combining a treadmill workout with reading a magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah-blah-book","review":"This has got to be the biggest blah-blah book I've read in several years.

It was just a guessing game with her. These stories are just full of mixed up people's sex lives. The things they give Francesca credit for solving are a bit much and only 20 years of age. It's a good thing she lives at home on her family's money with people to dress and feed her cause it's obvious she couldn't do it on her own. And if Evan marries Bartolla, he needs his head examined!

As in the previous Deadly books, Francesca commits herself to solving the latest murder, and meanwhile is torn in her romantic life and involved in family and friend relationships. This book brings to a climax her choice between the two handsome brothers Rick and Calder. As in the other books, Brenda Joyce continues previous storylines that run through these books and adds a few new ones which she leaves to complete in the next book....as always you are left waiting for the next book to come out so you can continue being involved in these people's lives. Will they make the right choices? What happens next? I'm beginning to believe I live in New York city in 1902 along with this cast of characters.

The problem is the power usage of the digital screen on the back of the camera. Once that's turned off, the battery life extends to 1-2 weeks sometimes under the same usage as my time in Italy.- A little bit too blocky for users that want something slim.Overall, it's an ok starter camera, but for someone that expects to use a camera quite often, I suggest trying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"802","review":"A small simple mixer !

I use it primarily to record commercial copy on my computer at home and then email the mp3 files to my radio station.

What \\"imprints\\" onto the cakewalk tracks shows no discernible sign of distortion or coloration. All jacks and knobs work well and appear solidly built. There are no effects, but I wouldn't use them anyway so that is a non-issue for me. Note that there is no on/off switch (again, not a problem for me personally as I turn on my equipment with line plug switches). Also, the light is VERY bright, but that is easily solved by covering it with a small piece of electrical or duct tape.

When I inserted the connector into the unit, one of the pins bent over and contacted the plug shield, shorting the connection and blowing the power supply.I've been plugging things in for a while now, this is the first time this has happened to me. For a unit without an on-off switch I'd think the power connector would be an important thing to get right.The problem is the electrical pins are as long as or longer than the alignment stud so when I spun the connector around in the socket it scraped the electrical pins off alignment and when I matched the alignment stud and pushed the connector in, it didn't socket the electrical pins, it bent 'em off.It's arguably my fault, but it's also arguably a design defect.

The EQ's are decent, but I wouldn't really count on them for a main EQ or anything - it's just nice to have them there.My only complain with this mixer is that there is no power switch! You have to unplug the board for it to turn off which is more of a pain that you I imagined. Also, the light on this board is extremely bright.

Once you connect the power supply and plug it in, it is on forever, unless you have it connected through some type of switched outlet. 2) If the power supply goes out, you will not be able to find another like it, unless Behringer sells them...the power adapter plug is not like any I have ever seen. 3) The small blue LED \\"power on\\" indicator is bright enough to use for a searchlight.

I'd bought the 502 first, but inputs turned out to be too limited, and I missed having the EQ. This one's significantly more flexible, and for only slightly more money and travel bulk. It's biggest annoyance for me is, as others have mentioned, the lack of an on/off switch, coupled with the delicate/fiddly connector on the power supply, which makes you not want to unplug it very often. I recommend plugging the unit into some sort of switched power outlet: I plug mine into a power cable with a foot switch (typically sold for use with Christmas tree lights.) And for travel, I plug in the power supply verrrry carefully - and bring along a spare (power supply) just in case!

What touched me the most is his suggestion of a free-thinking continent with symbolic borders and no passports, and his definition of peace.

My children instantly lose interest and we have NEVER made it all the way through the DVD other than through fast forward just to see if it actually got any better. I would not recommend this for young children and actually mom and dad don't like it either!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected this to be a modern Disney program, with recognizable characters singing Christmas songs, (based on the release date and cover art). Instead, this DVD is a compilation of clips from very old Disney movies/shows, each about 3 or 4 seconds long, thrown together while Christmas music plays and corresponding words bounce across the screen. True, the song choices are great, but the visual consists of fast-moving, disjointed, ancient animation. There is no flow, no storyline. After a few songs, I felt dizzy from watching. It was agitating and obnoxious. Further, my son kept asking where Mickey Mouse was, because the Mickey on the DVD is from about 50 years ago and unrecognizable to him. Nope, not my favorite, would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for children!!","review":"My daughter loves this sing a long DVD and it takes me back to my own childhood!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This product did not turn out as expected. I was hoping for something that could be used as a Christmas sing-a-long. Before you even get to that part, the beginning is filled with promos of Disney movies and other paraphanalia. This takes up much time and then when you get to the sing-a-long, the songs are interrupted by characters speaking. I was looking strictly for a sing-a-long and this is more like cartoons for children to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's all time favorite.","review":"This DVD is my 19 months old's all time favorite, even myself enjoy it a lot. My son has no patience with TV or whatsoever but with this DVD, he's absolutely hook on to it.

Lynn Gibson must have imagined \\"From all of us to all of you\\" being on this DVD, or she didn't actually watch it before reviewing, because that song is not on the DVD. The description also makes it sound like it has the classic Disney Christmas cartoons on here, but in reality there are only short clips of the cartoons from Jiminy Cricket's Christmas special (apparently not available on DVD) set to newly-sung Christmas songs.

They added several new songs to the beginning and end of the original footage and a narrator in between every song. It absolutely detracts from the original experience by nature, and it doesn't help that the new content isn't really of the same quality as the original stuff.I suppose I wouldn't tell fans of the VHS not to buy this, but be aware that it is not the same. It would have been really nice if they added an option to play just the original video, uncut.For anyone just looking for a decent holiday sing-along, this would probably be a great choice, and in that context I give it 4 stars. The 11 original songs are classic, and I'm guessing from a newbie perspective the new songs and narrator wouldn't be offensive (like they are to me, haha). The load of commercials at the beginning are annoying to skip through though, since it won't allow the menu button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what i thought it was","review":"Wanted to buy the original Disney very merry Christmas and this wasn't it.

I'm giving it 4 stars for the simple fact that it's so refreshing to actually hear traditional Christmas songs. I thinks most kids nowadays are really missing out on what we took for granted growing up.

In the first part of the book, we see and learn about regional menu items that North American children might eat for lunch, such as clam chowder or gumbo. In the remainder of the book, we visit other continents, and see lunches in countries such as Ghana, Israel, Italy, and China. There is a map at the end of the book, and recipes for fruit salad, hummus, and soup. There is a also a glossary of some of the new words used in the book. The text rhymes, and there are about 270 words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super exploration of lunch beyond peanut butter & jelly","review":"Edith Baer's rhyming text explores lunch the world over, going far beyond the typical American lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She uses simple couplets to cover everything from veggie burgers to tacos to fish chowder (in the United States) and then goes well beyond American borders to look at Colombia, Italy, Puerto Rico, Japan, England, Australia, China, India, and more.Not only do the lunches sound delicious (and teach children reading the book of the astonishing diversity of culinary habits the world over), but Steve Bjorkman's cheerful, colorful illustrations go a long way towards making the unusual seem utterly appetizing. This talented artist's work has appeared in national publications (he used to illustrate regularly for BETTER HOMES & GARDENS magazine, and I miss seeing his work there!). The simple lines and happy look of his pictures perfectly suit Edith Baer's text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for diversity lessons","review":"I used this book (in conjunction with 3 others) to make a lesson plan about the history of immigration in the United States and diversity.

And yet it's all handled with such cold, distant narration that it's impossible, as a reader, to care.Little surprise, then, that in a collection of twelve dramatic, explosion-filled issues, the most striking and memorable moment is a quiet scene halfway through in which a normally unreadable character collapses to his knees at the side of his giant dog and hugs him.It's among the few moments of real weakness, conflict or feeling in the entire ponderous volume.The artwork usually manages to be delicate and intimate, but even the powerful illustrations can't compensate for a lifeless script.The Inhumans ultimately serves as a long, rich, vivid description of nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-fi Story and Stunning Artwork will Convert Anyone to a Comics Lover","review":"This is a great first read for anyone who just doesn't understand what the big deal is about graphic storytelling.

The only reason I didn't return this \\"book\\" for a refund was the charity angle -- otherwise I was personally disappointed from start to finish (which fortunately lasted less than 20 minutes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your father's Bill Bryson","review":"Imagine summarizing the most emotional trip of you life in a few pages and you have what Bill Bryson did in this book. Only 50 pages long, the book tells of Bryson's experiences while visiting C.A.R.E. facilities in some of the most destitute and dangerous parts of Africa. He does manage to inject some of his trademark wit into a very serious topic, but in large part he paints a literal picture of a world that most Westerners will never see - or care about. That's a pity, because in these few pages he tell truths that everyone should hear and take to heart. This is a book well worth the short time it takes to read it, and by purchasing it, you're making a contribution to C.A.R.E.'s vital work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin but worthy","review":"This is such a thin book, but Bryson is the best non-fiction writer out there today.

It is great that all profits go to help the CARE cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Up to Bryson Standards","review":"I love Bill Bryson and find his writing entertaining, informative, and sincere. While the intentions behind this book are worthy it is clearly neither a true diary nor comparable to the rest of his catalogue. It is surprisingly short -- only about 49 pages and appears to be merely an afterthought or hastily written magazine article turned into a book. I consider a \\"Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" among my favorite books of all time. So on a recent flight in Africa I thought this book would make great reading to pass the time. It was way too short and left me unsatisfied. There are hints of Bryson's normal eloquence and wit along with his keen powers of observation. But mostly this reads like a pamphlet. Download it cheaply on a Kindle but I don't recommend buying the hardcover version at this price regardless of the charity to which the money goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this, just give your money directly to CARE...","review":"This \\"slender volume\\" takes less than a half hour to read and does not even scratch the surface of life in Kenya. Traveling with CARE, Bryson briefly describes impressions with lack of detail or understanding, with only slight descriptions of what life is like in the country. For anyone that has been to Africa: Pass on this book and just donate your money to CARE directly. Perhaps this book is well suited for someone who has not read anything on traveling/development/culture/people of Africa, or for someone who looks to get a \\"freebie\\" with their donation to a charitable cause. If you are looking to read non-fiction about Africa or have visited Africa and want to expand your knowledge and understanding for the continent, there are much better options available (Africa Solo, Shadow of the Sun, Facing the Congo, We Regret to Inform You...). A very disappointing read, but glad the money went to CARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing; a sell-out?","review":"It is, of course, my own fault that I didn't read the details concerning Bill Bryson's African Diary. Had I realized it was only 49 pages long - in total, roughly the length of two chapters in a typical Bryson book - I never would have made the purchase.Instead of getting the usual engaging and charming detailed minutiae of a Bryson book, we get what is largely long captions for photos taken by his co-author and sweeping generalizations about one of the world's most unknown, misunderstood and important continents.

There was no story, no character building, and very little to relate to the culture and people of Kenya.

As a Kenyan reading this book, he had nothing but negative things to say. It felt like the only positive experience he had was seeing all the fossils of early man that he was \\"honoured\\" to see, since these exhibits are not open to the general public. I found my blood boiling as I kept reading, and to be honest, I had to keep willing myself to finish reading it. I kept looking for hope, but there seemed to be none. This book portrayed Kenya as a bleak place-- like it is a death sentence to be there. Yes, I acknowledge that Kenya has many, many problems, just like every other country does, but there are lots of things that are wonderful about it. Honestly, whoever would like this book can contact me, and I will gladly mail it to you FREE.

I particularly liked the three-D glasses that came with the book (I'm not kidding--they are helpful to view site photographs) and the definition of a Texas sharpshooter (draws the bulls-eye after shooting the gun).This book (and its appendices) is crammed with useful information.

There isn't a single scarey moment in it. It is gross and it is intense. It is also brutally realistic pointless gore with a very lame plot. The actors all do a decent job considering the lame material they have to work with. The Bulgarian actors are especially good.The story of all this torture being for medical purposes is extremely thin and makes no sense when you think about it. Do people de penile transplants? Do people recover from eye transplants in a matter of hours? Do you really harvest organs with a circular saw in a filthy non-sterile environment? Heck, do you perform any sophisticated medical procedure on a moving train? Don't think so. So, once you come to that conclusion, the story is just idiotic with some great make up.

Gives good sci-fi a bad name. Characters are not just 2 dimensional, they are 1 dimensional, like stick figures. The main characters are ALL noble, super-successful geniuses, with selfless ambitions to save the world. (The also are great looking, popular and have great complexions). Plot dimensions are few and far between.

How anyone could forsee a truth machine as being liberating and self-actualizing is beyond me. It's ironic that Mr. Halperin mentions Orwell's, 1984 but doesn't recognize that his conceit is nothing more than a technological Big Bother.In addition to the paternalistic liberal propaganda, the story itself suffers from poor characterization and a hackneyed plot. As others have mentioned, treatment of ethical issues are dealt with shallowly and the protagonists are insipid. The contrived resolution of Armstrong's fate is laughable and the sole character in the book with any personality is the A.I.

Is it nevertheless a great novel? Beyond question.This is an absolutely riveting story. It does what speculative fiction is supposed to do: it stipulates a watershed event of some kind (technological or otherwise), and then explores its possible effects on human existence. Some of the changes Halperin imagines are extremely plausible. Others are more far-fetched. But all are profound, and whether you agree or disagree with the ideas set forth in this book, you'll find it engaging, stimulating, and relentlessly thought-provoking.

They are well worth long discussion. But Spider Robinson wrote a much more human and emotionally touching story about the same subject a number of years ago (using a drug rather than a machine to compel the truth).

He is an extremely accomplished amateur futurist.This novel, like The First Immortal, has very interesting concepts. Concepts that could have been explained in a very compelling 150-page novel. Instead Halperin takes us on a journey of self indulgent \\"gee, this is how smart I am\\", which would be ok if he could write without using endless clich&#65533;s, unbelievably shallow characters and excruciatingly boring story lines.

I think that it is an excellent concept for a novel, and one that someday might play out in reality. But I wanted to claw my eyes out from reading all the tedium.

After that, I threw it into the garbage. The ideas in the story may be excellent, I am not sure, and I really don't care.

Everyone in the book is \\"the richest man in the world\\" or \\"seven standard deviations to the left of the median in intelligence.\\" The man who wrote it may have some ability as a storyteller, but he has no ability whatsoever as a writer.

What I found was a novel that never developed much past the inital theme. In many ways, it is more annoying to find a great idea executed poorly than a overall bad book, because you can see what a better author could have done. Instead of a interesting comentary on a true society, the book myoptically contentrates on it's main charecters, the Good Scientist, the Bad Scienist and all the other cardboard cutout people Sci-Fi is known for. If the actions of these people seemed at all likely or logical it might still be fun, but they make desicions only because that is how the author wants the plot to go.

However, while the author presents his ideas and storyline competently and cohesively, he really neglects his characters. The characters are so one-dimensional, perfect and boring -- all smart, pretty, nice, ethical, etc. -- that by the end you're practically forced to root for the villain... but he's pretty boring, too. Worse, the author chooses to view truth itself in a one-dimensional light.

I am a network veteran and went looking for a book for my nephew who needs a basic introduction to networks and the typical Cisco gear used for them. I was pleasantly surprised that it hits the essentials (with exceptions noted below,) does it admirably briefly, and even covers some often missed items about Cisco routers and networks in general. It's a rare combination. I'd have given it five stars had it included configuring DHCP and NAT (the latter it only mentions) and how to configure them. These should be essential topics that the target audience (or any) needs to know, and a glaring omission in my view, but what it gets rights still merits it four stars. If a future version adds characteristically brief entries on these topics it would be outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cisco Routers for the Desperate: Router Management, The Easy Way","review":"I found this book to be very easy to understand, and right on track for a net admin to use, to fill in information on Cisco routers and switches.

Anyone with a little knowledge of the spiritual practice should probably pass on this one. It's too condensed to really discuss the topic in anything more than a superficial way. It has some pretty pictures, but they do little to illustrate anything being discussed.I also felt it suffered from being written by someone who was clearly from the West and seemed to be struggling to interpret it too much through the viewpoint of our own value systems and philosophy, rather than on it's own terms. If he'd used the terms \\"ambiguity tolerance\\" or \\"contradictory\\" as a shorthand way of describing Shinto one more time, I think I'd have chucked the book in the waste bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty LITTLE book","review":"This is a pretty little book which might be suitable if you know nothing whatsoever about shinto, and wish to learn a little about Japan's indigenous religion.

After a miserable experience with it tonight, I tossed it in the sink so I could wash it. Once I got over the the sink a few minutes later I discovered the needle broke - not just a little bent, it actually snapped off. Keep in mind, I tossed this into the sink - I didn't throw it across the room, I just kinda dropped it in.

I thought I'd never be able to lose weight again, but as tough as this diet is, it got results right away and--although I was totally skeptical--it does stop your cravings for sugar and salty snacks. I don't claim to understand how, even after reading the book twice. I'm guessing it has something to do with flax seed oil. And the food sensitivies the book refers to really do show up. You learn by experience which foods will give you bloat, gas and make you sleepy. Best for me besides the 5 pounds lost in 5 weeks (I had 20 exremely stubborn pounds to lose)was I have stopped retaining water which you can see in my ankles and hands.

This is something raw foodists have known for a century. Unfortunately, she doesn't go into cooked food as a source of additional toxins. Nonetheless she has done her homework in finding all kinds of tips for detox, such as herbs and lemon juice.I got lots of weight loss nuggets from this book, and various insights that helped me shed 20 pounds. (This is one of a dozen or so books I used for research.) I was astounded to discover that flaxseeds can be toxic if you eat over 4 T a day (not true for flax oils)!

The premise is to detoxify your liver and the diet itself is basically a low-carb diet (lean protein) with a restriction on salt and dairy. Quite a few supplements are recommended. I liked the emphasis on organic foods and the clorox bath alternative. She also wants you to increase your water and fiber intake which are both important anyway.

I use to eat tons of junk food, pre-packaged conveniencefoods and processed foods like deli meats. In the first two weeks on the plan, I had lost 11 pounds. Now this plan is not for the faint of heart, it requires a change to your way of eating and living; BUT, it is worth it! You are taking supplements to improve your overall health and help out your liver. You're getting the poisons and toxins out of your system by following this plan; and, your body will thank you for it...

And there are folks out there who dispute what ALG promotes. Just do some research yourself on the net about \\"high lignan flaxseed oil\\", for one example.

That is the only really sad part about this diet is that once you start eating bread and normal foods again, you gain the weight back. Also, from not drinking milk and then drinking it again, I would get the worst stomach aches. It's hard to go out to dinner and get something exciting to eat on this diet, but it realy is worth it to loose the weight. I am about to go back on it again for the second time, and I hope that it works. I tried during my school year (in college), but I was too stressed and too busy to keep up with the cooking and make things that weren't boring night after night, and fast.

If the Rolling Stones had their \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and Clapton had his \\"Layla\\", this two CD set is easily their equal in its scope and just sheer brilliance, and clocking in at over two hours, twice as long as those other masterful works. It truly is THAT GOOD. The most impressive thing here though is that it was released in December of 2002, before Bush had started this new Vietnam in Iraq, and the CD is riddled with songs pleading with people not to believe Bush and Company and their lies. He tried to warn us, didn't he? It's a shame he isn't as popular as some of the rubbish acts out there that don't have a fraction of his talent.

If you already own the CD \\"Drunk in Public\\" then you may not need to buy this DVD since it has most of the same jokes with about 15% new/different material. If you're a die-hard fan though you may as well pick it up. Just to warn you he's definately not a \\"Clean\\" comedian, so if explicit language offends you then you won't enjoy this DVD.

Hey, most of the material, was stuff I and many can relate to. Marrying rich girls, having a dog poo on the rug, cheating, bad car repairs, whiskey, being tossed out of a bar and so on....

And although he got less screen time than the other 3 comedians, he stole that show. As a result of that success, he got to have his own show on Comedy Central, which is the show on this DVD.I have to say that almost all of the jokes he told in \\"BCCT\\" are repeated in this special, so the impact wasn't as strong on me. But there are a few new bits that will make you laugh, including some hilarious stories dealing with his wife and bulldog. He's much more profane in this performance (BCCT was fairly clean), but I don't think to an over-the-top degree.Ron \\"Tater Salad\\" White has become an overnight success in the past year or so and I hope to see new bits in the not too distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lugnut Day","review":"Not a bad release, but much of the material was done on the Blue Collar Tour movies (and with better results).

Not Worth Buying!","review":"My kids and I have really enjoyed the PC versions of StarCraft and especially enjoyed the Multi-Player Modes. Many Console Games say they are Multi-Player and they are actually Death Match Modes, which are really Lame. It's sad to see many really cool Games only support Single Player Missions which is another saddening Trait and reduces the effectiveness of the actual GamePlay and loses it's worthiness as a fun Game and eventually decreases the Company's credibility in providing WorthWhile Games to the Consumer. We don't play On-Line Games and will not start now. We have more fun playing on the same Console with or against one another. StarCraft Ghost appears to be an excellently produced Game but is not worth purchasing if it's not Multi-Player Mission Capable.

Unlike the Retroactive: Rare and Mixed series by the same publisher, these remixes are not 1980s remixes of 1980s songs, but are rather modern remixes of these old songs. Thus, you are not really getting a collection of 80s tunes but a collection of trance/house music loosely based on these great old numbers. Just not my cup of tea.If you love 80s music and are looking for some rare tracks that bring you to back to the old days, this disc is probably not for you.

It is not only amaturish, but painfully disappointing, more so since I had to pay to find that out. It is in short a total and utter waste of money and the people who produced it should be forced to appologise for delivering this rubbish to an unsuspecting public. Tracks are not remixed as much as butchered, cut, sliced, stired and stappled back together by someone who is undoubtably hearing impared. Avoid this like the plague, and if you do decide to ignore this advice then let me be the first to say .... I told you so.

It was really gently worded and was not anti hospital or obstetricians but said they have their place in an emergency circumstance only. Midwives were highly praised in this film as the most appropriate health professional to be with a woman through labour. There were about 4 actual births shown but with music or talking over them so it was not intense, two births has children present.

There is a basic premise that Homosexuality has been codified since time inmemorial, but this does little to give the book any sort of through-line. Individual chapters, particularly that on the renaissance, which alone could fill a small library with books on male-male love in the period, seem to almost pass their subjects by.

The graphics however are good and the control easy to use but the game lacks any serious tone or theme, does not have that many functions (3 guns, 5 types of grenades, some updates for guns earned by tokens after you complete a level and 4 or 5 orders you can give to your team mates [max of two only team mates!]). It plays more like some Arcade game as you move about the levels. It is a serious step back in the wrong direction for the SWAT series. I would recommend renting this before you choose to buy it.

First, the plugs at the bottom are so large that they actually cut our feet (Yes, we have the correct side up!)Two months later, they work only intermittently. The lights on the controls light up, but the pad only heats up about 50% of the time. Tried to call Biddeford; they say to leave a message, but no one calls back.

You have to buy it before you get it home, open the package and see the dreaded Biddeford name on the instructions inside. This is not a plesant surprise for consumers who have already had negative experiences with Biddeford. As in my case, two junky Biddeford products in one week.The highest setting on this piece of garbage would still leave you chilly. There's no way this thing could compensate for a cool night in California, let alone a frigid night in the Midwest.Biddeford is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"Poorly designed product!! The pad does not stay in one place as the flimsy skirt does not hold it in place. The worst design flaw is that the plug-in portion does not hang over the end of the bed, but lays flat on the top surface of the bed where your feet hit it. This connection is a very thick piece of plastic and is very uncomfortable even when covered by an additional mattress pad in a vain attempt to cover it up!!! Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! Watch out for the connector.","review":"This product is great in that it does what it says it will do. It provides excellent warmth and allows you to cut back on night-time heating costs. Any product in this class will do that. What they don't tell you on the packaging is that where the wires connect to the mattress pad is a bulky box at the foot of the bed with pointy edges. By foot of the bed, I do not mean the side of the mattress, I mean literally where your feet are. I have scraped my ankles on them several times in the middle of the night and it does not feel good! My husband and I have compensated by curling up a bit more or placing our legs in awkward positions to avoid the connector.I had a similar product in the past (no idea who the manufacturer was) and the connectors were in a much better location. Unless you sleep in the fetal position or completely still, I would go with a different brand.

We now have four of the Baby Einstein videos and she consistently asks for this one over the others. I'm not all that impressed with it (I don't think it's as much fun as, say, Baby MacDonald), but she's head-over-heels for it. When we watch it she loves to say \\"look Mommy, a kangaroo,\\" or \\"look Mommy, a zebra,\\" or whatever happens to be on the screen.If your child is crazy about animals like mine is, then I would say you should definitely buy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing because.....","review":"It's too bad when a small company with a good idea becomes a large commercial machine with little content. I'm so sick of seeing Baby Einstein advertising itself everywhere - even within their own videos once you've already purchased them. It's the same old stuff you see recycled in almost all of their baby videos - once you have one, you pretty much own the entire set. I do think there is some value in infant videos and they can do more than just babysit your children. But there doesn't seem to be a good bridge between Baby Einstein and videos like Blue's Clues or Sesame Street. Juno Baby is a very nice and cute transition with some characters and pretty music and offers a bit more stimulation. Another nice idea might be the Sesame Street for babies videos which are supposed to come out pretty soon. The bottom line is that I think Baby Einstein sells babies a little short and underestimates what they're capable of hearing and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the series","review":"This is the one that keeps my daughters attention. It's fast paced and full of animals and puppet shows. I'd recommend this one if you can get only one. There are some previews attached as another review mentions.

We had Mozart, Beethoven and Santa (DO NOT buy) already. This one is a lot different because there is actually moving footage of the animals with great music. He is too young to get into the animal naming parts, so he gets bored then, but whenever the puppets or the music come on he is mesmerized. The DVD says its for older children, so maybe naming the animals won't be as boring for him in a few months. I like watching it with him. I'd give the DVD 5 stars, but Disney is completely shameless in placing ads at the beginning and end of the DVD during the first play. I vow not to buy another with this sort of advertising no matter how good they say it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"love Baby Einstein, but won't show my kid ads","review":"I used to happily buy every one of the Baby Einstein videos for my daughter and always enjoyed watching them with her. But this one is the newest one we own and we refuse to buy any others. There is some really long advertising for other Disney stuff at both the beginning and the end of the DVD which we can't seem to skip through. I was really disappointed given I paid good money and don't think I should have to sit through commercials, espeically as it is a video for babies and toddlers. I think The Disney Corporation only thought about how else to make some money off of us and forgot to consider our family values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Trash","review":"I own thirteen (early) Baby Einsteins.

Forget the DVD, and buy the soundtrack. Seriously, save your money. This was no doubt a killer role for Emilio Estevez, in that it killed any chance of reviving his failing career.

It lasted my 3 year old about a year before it totally fell apart, and about half of that time it was stored for the winter, so it got maybe six months of intermittent use. They sure are fun while they last, but just not made like they used to be. We'd also bought the red/blue/yellow one for my son, and it got about the same amount of play time before it cracked and fell apart.

This book, which is told through the eyes of Alisa, is basically about Alisa trying to find out her heritage and about her powers, just like Morgan. However, while she is there, she discovers that it might not have been such a good idea. First of all, her grandmother is hostile, she almost gets killed...well hurt, and she finds that her heritage may not be as good as expected. The only good thing about her visit is Charlie...but you'll have to read the book to see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of the best in the series","review":"well first of all this is a sorry book because the book description has nothing 2 do with the plot of this book. this book centers around alisa who just discovered that she's a half blood witch and founded that her mom was one also. so she travels to where her mom used to live bcuz of the problems she is having at home with her stepmom and dad. this book centers around how alisa meets her mom's family and stays with her uncle while visiting her mom's family. she is having a hard time controlling her telekinesis and was told she was born with it. well i thought this was one of the worst books in the sweep series cuz its starts out REALLY SLOW AND BORING. there's barely any interesting plots and i thought the plots were boring. this book is a snoozer and i recommend that u should wait til full circle comes out i hope it be better than this book. this is not a good book at all. i give it just 3 stars for lack of good plots and the book startin really slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweep #13","review":"This was my first read in the Sweep series; I was pleasantly surprised that despite being #13 in the series, I was easily able to pick up the story.

Her dad's girlfriend is pregnant and getting ready to turn Alisa's room into a nursery.

This book made me like her more, plus I like how the story develops. I feel as if you could probably skip this book though and be able to read through the rest of the series and not be terribly confused. However I haven't read this series in a while, so I don't remember it as well.

Ruled by a high-tech savvy regime propped up by Mestizo racialism and a breakaway Church that has its own pope, the Holy Republic of Mexico extends from Venezuela to its recent reconquests of Arizona, New Mexico and half of Texas. The United States is beaten, fractured, and barely able to maintain much further resistance to Mexican desires for whatever remains of her western states. Into this scenario comes a plague that quickly kills those who are predominately of Indian background--in another words, the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population.Too bad that such an intriguing backdrop like this one was ruined by flat characters in a confusing and quite boring mess of a plot from an author pathetically aping Crichton, Ludlum and (of course!)

Jabanoski's tunes have the amazing power of stopping a party dead in its tracks and leave you wondering \\"What the hell is that noise?\\"The sound quality (intentionally recorded on low end equipment to provide a \\"garage band\\" effect) is absolutely annoying. Jabanoski cannot carry a tune, and his lyrics are awkward. Jabanoski's guitar playing reminded me of a high school rocker wannabe that only knows a few chords.

It?s that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst interpretations I have ever heard","review":"I have never heard anyone butcher Rachmaninoff's compositions as terribly as Idil Biret. After listening to her rendition of the Variations on a Theme of Corelli, (which was a colossal failure to say the least) I decided to give her another chance. What a mistake I made. Her phrasing on the first Nocturne absolutely destroys the music, as you can tell she has no ability whatsoever to phrase Romantic style music. The extremely choppy and staccato style is NOT how you play Rachmaninoff. Someone needs to take this woman's piano away from her. If you would like to listen to Rachmaninoff without getting a headache, I highly recommend Santiago Rodriguez, his interpretations are incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"I ordered this VHS tape and when it arrived the cover was correct but there was a completely different VHS tape inside. The seller should have checked the product before shipping out the item no matter how much it cost! The item was returned and as usual AMAZON did not waste anytime issuing me a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"info science student in Art History class","review":"This was the 2nd of 7 books assigned as reading in an Art History course on artifacts and images. This book is difficult to read at first as the author seems to be randomly meandering through Silicon Valley with no purpose and no method. However, after reviewing her journey at the end of the book, I appreciate the way that the author doesn't do the work for the reader -- she spells nothing out and let's the reader draw his or her own connections. It is an interesting snapshot of life in 1999-2001 in SiVa. Her writing style is unique and clever, though it requires attention and thought from the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"get English-Lueck's Cultures@SiliconValley instead","review":"This is not the best book for insights about the Valley. As the other reviewers suggest, this book has a bit of a split personality. On the one hand, one has a stream of observational anecdotes about the Valley. All of the usual cliches are here: Fry's, Buck's Diner, the cherry stands, the 101 traffic jams. These read like someone is trying their hand at writing a confessional ethnographic tale, but without a theoretical argument to provide a central structure. On the other hand, one has a stream of stories about computer-as-artifact -- tales about the collectors, like Nathan Myhrvold, and the people who recycle computers, and so on. One gets the feeling that the author set out to write a book about the latter, found it a bit thin, and the editor suggested fleshing it out with some bubble-era backdrop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high expectations for this book, however I was severely disappointed. The book makes claims at being some sort of archaeologist's study, but it reads like a badly written vacation journal written by an easily impressed child. Finn locks onto the most trivial aspects of Silicon Valley and Internet culture and romanticizes them in a way that only someone who doesn't understand them would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelfish !","review":"This book helped so much, we have mostly Angelfish & it helped us understand their needs better, very informative & worth the time to read !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty & Function Combined","review":"Purchased this beautiful, well made clock thermometer for my recently renovated screened porch --- I couldn't be happier!

It even WORKS pretty good for a few months. Then the thing shows it's 'true colors'. As noted by other reviewers, the grometts and rubber bar sheath are entirely under designed. They simply don't hold up to regular use. I called the mfg (RSVP) and their customer no-svc people basically gave me an 'oh well, we sell the whole bar as a replacement unit' answer. So, if I wanted to spend $6 for $0.25 worth of tubing, I could go that route, but I won't be doing that. I won't be buying any products from RSVP in the future either if that is how they intend to stand behind them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"This knock box leaks around the metal seam, creating a nice brown spray every time the knock is used. The rubber tube covering the rod has split in two places. We have had it for less than 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"i really tried to make this work. first problem was the ball ends coming unscrewed every other time i used it, which i had to do VERY CAREFULLY, because if you miss the very thin rubber knock bar, your expensive portafilter tries to cut it's head off on the SHARP edges of the stainless box. Seriously, who designs something you are going to smash something against with sharp edges? i didn't put the rubber parts in the dishwasher, but the grommets on the side disintegrated in a couple of weeks. Even when everything sort of worked the way it was supposed to, frequently the knock bar would just bounce out of the holes on the box, repeating one of the above scenarios. Silly piece of junk. get a real knock box, not this decorative stainless steel sculpture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber bar too thin and grommets split","review":"Ok - I reviewed this knock box as part of a combo a couple months ago and gave it 4 stars since it looks decent and works well when you first get it. However, after using it for a couple months, my portafilter basket has many dents in it since the rubber along the bar is just too thin for a real knock box. Also, both the rubber grommets have split.I would recommend choosing another knock box because this one will fall part and actually damage your equipment after repeated use (2 months of 6-8 espressos/day)."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrated with product support","review":"I offer this assessment with a certain amount of sorrow and I offer it on behalf of myself and the friend who I gave this item for Christmas last year. I actually liked the knock box in terms of function. But I'm unhappy with the company response when I attempted to purchase replacement rubber grommets that split after a short time. I was told to buy the entire knock box bar and that was my only recourse. I found this to be very poor customer support. You can't tell me they don't have the rubber grommets they could sell at a fraction of the cost. Plus I don't like scrapping a perfectly good piece of metal. Very not green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber deteriorated","review":"The rubber coating on the bar deteriorated and turned mushy. Other than that love the product.

An alright conspiracy movie with some connections which may notbe well known. It does nothing to shed light on what is not generally known. The actual length is about an hour, then there are credits and about 17 minutes of music with scenic shots.Might as well watch the Davinci Code. Even though it has more fiction incorporated, at least you will be entertained and still get the basic lowdown on how conspiracy's operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely calender","review":"I love this calender in fact this is my second time buying a Mary Engelberit wall calender.

I supposed I could have lived with that but...They both died in LESS THAN A WEEK. The filament on one of them is OK, but the glass underneath it cracked. I can't say what happened to the filament on the other because the glass is cracked and the interior is filled with a smokey residue that obscures the filament. My guess is that the temperature was hotter than the glass could handle. I'm 100% positive that they are the same voltage and wattage as required by my vehicle.They're under \\"warranty\\" but you have to spend $7 plus shipping just to have them replaced, so you'll probably spend $12 to get a new set of $20 bulbs that won't last more than a few weeks.The moral of the story... stay far far away from anything made by Eurodezigns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"i bought these from [...] a few days ago and its amazing, bright white with a hint of blue, not enough to be distracting but just enough to get noticed and look styling. goes great with my black srt-4 with blue interior mods. easy to install and 100% legal and safe for your car. overall 5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undesirable","review":"Haven't had much luck with wireless temperature units.

Let's just hope an expanded release surfaces some day. It's doubtful, but one can still hope.I would suggest not picking this up unless you are a die hard fan of these scores.

Not enough.","review":"When I first picked up this CD to see which tracks were on there, I was shocked to find none of the best songs from the movies weren't on there, like when Sidney gets attacked the first time in Scream 2, or when CiCi gets attacked in Scream 2. Many others from both films also. And none of the songs were long enough. (some didn't need to be on there at all) I was utterly shocked at how sorry this score soundtrack was. Hardly any of the best songs from either film were on this soundtrack.

Also has many local drink recipes. There is a glossary of cooking terms, description of foods and many can be bought in markets everywhere. Some substitutions are given, but it won't taste like being on the islands....and a beach would help too. Many of the recipes are braised and/or stew affairs. Very common in the islands. Expect some heat, but can tone it down without losing the essence. Highly recommend trying it out, as the Caribbean recipes are as different as the diversity of it's people.

Every year before we go to Mexico I review the Level I program and I am retaining it. I have also purchased the DLC and the verb program. The first program is wonderful with easy to learn and understand programming. I have recommended it to several friends and they saw how easy it was to learn. This is a reasonably priced introductory course and it is better than any other more expensive courses that I have looked at that have big advertising budgets.

However, $80 is simply too much. To add insult to injury, most of the lessons that you pay for are available periodically for free on their website! AND, they send you a ton of junk mail, which I find incredibly annoying!I recommend that people check out what their local library has to offer, and check out the free lessons available on the Visual Link website, before purchasing this software. I also recommend the \\"Learning Spanish with Michael Thomas\\" software (don't buy it; try to borrow it or find it online); the format is really fun and he gives you a lot of useful tips that really increase your vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish","review":"Not worth the money.

I swear to God, more than half of the songs Against Me! play are about them being in a band... a band that's different (listen to Cliche Guevera, Reinventing Axle Rose, Turn Those Clapping... etc.)Against Me! were so incredible... but typically bands that good are done after a few years at best. I just see it fading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Punk Rock? Says Who?","review":"Rolling Stone mag highly recommended this album.So I bought it. I like punk (as in Minor Threat).What is this?Honestly, it sounds like Meat Loaf singing Christian rock.Seriously. What am I missing here?"},{"rating":"1","title":".....","review":"Keep it about the music? Alright lets do that. Well first off, the music itself, is boring. Ok against me were never the greatest musicians but their lyrics and emotion in their songs were amazing. Which leads to my next point, the lyrics, suck, and lead singer doesn't even seem to be into it like he was in other records.And against me is bringing their anarchist anthems up from the underground? Well thats fine but you cant be an anarchist band playing in a capatilist industry. And has anyone seen the video? It is MTV ready. Im sure it hasnt been on MTV but its just the beginning. Their next release's single could very well be on MTV. So to me - major label debut=sellout. Its that simple. I dont think there is anyone who could make me think differently about that. F*ck against me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Age - New Direction","review":"True, many long-time Against Me! fans will probably miss the bands folk-punk roots. This is not a folk-punk album. It is a great album none the less. As a long time fan, I can forgive Tom and Co. for not wanting to release the same record over and over again.Electric-guitar driven, three chord punk music at its best. I love the new sound and everything Butch Vig has done on this record.Against Me!, like others before them, have grown and moved forward with their music. If your own taste has not moved in the same directions as theirs, so be it. But is it fair to demand that the band remains at the same place with you?And please, people... Can we all put the move to Sire behind us already? What about just keeping it about the music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I've really attempted to like this album. Its just not that good. I have loved Against Me about 4 years now, but their last two CDs have just not been up to par with their earlier work. I am not the kind of person who says major labels because I still like several bands who have moved to major labels. Against Me use to be energetic, fun and edgy folk-punk. Now it is pretty much radio-friendly trash. Many of the songs just have weak, cheesy lyrics with annoying poppy choruses. This album gets 2 stars from me because it does have moments where it isn't all that bad. I don't mind bands changing style, I actually like it a lot of the time, but this has been a change for the worse. If you are a die-hard fan of the band's earlier works, you will probably hate this album. If you are just being introduced to them for the first time, you may enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a masterpiece","review":"I must say I was completely surprised by this album. I was not a big fan of Against Me!'s \\"Searching For a Former Clarity\\", so when I listening to \\"Thrash Unreal\\" on the radio, I was ready to hate it. However, this was not the case. The entire album shows that the song writer breaks free from the regular loop of standard rock music. Few people seem to understand that there are talented songwriters besides Mozart or The Beatles, and I believe that this CD is a prime example of one of these cases.Every song is ingeniously composed to be to be incredibly fun, entertaining, and thought provoking as physically possible. The CD isn't really dirty (in fact, I don't remember hearing a single swear), so you don't have parents saying it's corrupting youth, and I think it has some good messages about the effects of drugs and war.This is the best CD I have heard in a long time, and I highly recommend you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, they're still doing it their way...","review":"There's two ways you can view \\"New Wave\\". If you judge it against the band's previous work, it is unavoidably the weak link in Against Me!'s discography. If you judge it against any other rock album out there, it's head and shoulders better. \\"Thrash Unreal\\", \\"White People for Peace\\", \\"Piss and Vinegar\\" and \\"Americans Abroad\\" are all fantastic tunes in my mind that should be seen live for years.Bottom line: If you're an Against Me! fan that was complaining they sold out with As the Eternal Cowboy, you're going to hate this. If you're new to the band/have a bit of an open mind, give it a shot. The album is solid and deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Sound Everytime","review":"First off, this is not my favorite Against Me! album. Not their greatest release to date. However, I still like it. It is still worth the purchase. Don't listen to the reviews about how they have sold out. The band has never had a consistent sound. Hell when it first started it was just Tom and his guitar. Against Me! has had a different sound each studio album they have released. \\"As The Eternal Cowboy\\" sounded completely different from \\"Reinventing Axl Rose,\\" and \\"Searching for A Former Clarity\\" sounded different from the others as well. This album is no different. It isn't titled \\"New Wave\\" for nothing.If The Clash had kept their sound the same every album, no one would remember them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another triumphant statement from Against Me!","review":"Bottom line: if you like the band, I think you'll like this album. Follows in the line of SFAFC (which is to say not really a punk record) but the same victorious, fist-raising style reminiscent of all of AM!s works. 10 bucks well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I don't know what happened to these guys, their early work was fantastic, this is shockingly bad. I gave it one listen and was so utterly disappointed I threw it straight in the bin.

My favourite of them all is \\"Marooned\\", a whole episode of just Lister and Rimmer conversing after Starbug has crash landed. These three episodes are superbly written, wonderfully performed, imaginative, witty and even touching. This is not your average sitcom. This is a work of genius.

The cap cannot screw on very tight because the seal is bad meaning that you strip the threads on the cap with any torque at all. Also, the straw to draw the liquid up is flexable plastic which is curled up for shipment, meaning that it will not straighten and only goes halfway down the bottle.

I followed the other woman's review on number of pumps per amount of soda left which worked well. The only slight issue I have is how hard it is to screw the top off once it's in use.

I am thiking the previous post is correct. Air pressure does not keep CO2 in the liquid. Perhaps if it pumped pure CO2 into the bottle it would work, but it doesn't.

Sure, the bottle will hiss like a fresh bottle each time you open it...but if anything it will make the soda go flat even faster.

Here Cadmus' love for, and vigor, show through in more than seventy drawings, many of them of his life partner and lover, Jon Anderson. Techinically brilliant, they are also sensitive without being overtly erotic -- enough so that I wouldn't mind hanging any of the artist's prints in my own home.

When you play single player games just charge the controller with the lowest charge and use the freshest controller. The need for more than one USB cable is the exception, not the rule, so it would not make any sense for Sony to charge the extra money for a USB cable with every controller. You just use any USB to mini-USB cable and it works just fine. you can pick those up for about $4, so avoid Game Stop's $10 cables. The lack of vibration is an issue for some people but Sony recently made amends with the company that supplies that so they have already released the vibrating sixaxis controllers in Japan and will be released in the USA soon. My only personal complaint is the price, but that might be due to the fact that the last game console I owned was a Super Nintendo, and controllers only cost $20 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss the rumble feature...","review":"I get the impression that the controller was rushed into production. A lot has been said, so I'll try to be objective and here are my pros and cons:PROS:- Wireless!- Lightweight- The PS button on the middle was a good idea- It lasts long enough to enjoy your gamesCons:- Rumble pack feature has been removed.For those of us that had used the PS2 controller for years now, you really miss it. I would definitely trade the Six-Axis feature for my rumble pack. Most of the games out there don't really support the feature, and if they do, it's very basic. Plus, is not as precise for racing games as joystick pad, especially for a game like GT. Wii controllers are far superior and have the rumble feature included."},{"rating":"1","title":"controller dont work anymore.","review":"I tried the controller a couple months ago and realized I had to power up the controller longer.

After playing Xbox 36o since its release (and the PS3 since its), I also long for a more ergonomic design (like the 360 controller, which is amazing), rather than holding a brick with buttons and a few curves.

I just wish Sony felt would have been nice enough to give us two with a PS3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So light you don't even notice it is there","review":"My first major impression of the controller when I picked it up was, \\"Wow, this is really light.\\" For anyone who played on the older Dual-Shock controllers for the PS2 or the X-Box/X-Box 360 controllers, the PS3 controller is almost non-existent in weight by comparison.Secondly, being wireless is a huge boon. I currently have the PS3 hooked up to my projector, which is at the back of the room. Having the controller be wireless means that I don't have to be at the back of the room as well and can actually move the projector further for a larger screen if I want without actually having to move myself.And third, the PS button is a nice feature with being able to turn the console on and off, and also being able to access the XMB bar while in a movie or even a game now. Very nice bonus for the controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Controller","review":"It's the same design as the usual Playstation, but with the sixaxis and wireless by bluetooth, has a long reach, and the rechargeable batteries last almost 30 hours. with 1 hour charge.

It is very lightweight but don't be fooled because they can take a beating and keep working. This controller is streamlined and slimmer that previous versions. It is rechargeable via USB cord that plugs into your PS3. It holds a charge for a very long time. I only have to charge it once every 3-4 days and you can even play while it's charging. It does come with a USB cord but it is fairly short. It also has tilt sensors built into it and many games are starting to use this feature more and more. I consider it a big improvement to the previous controller on PS2.

The controller last along time before having to be attached again for a charge. The only thing i wish is that you didn't have to have the unit on to have the contoller charge. Unless i am wrong on this but i don't think i am. I believe there is a company coming out with a wall unit that you can plug into your socket to plug the usb cable into the wall and charge the contoller but i don't know the name of the company and don't know when it will be coming out. It will be great when it does. Than you can charge the contollers over night and be ready for the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"ps3 advantage","review":"This controller is one of the biggest advantages I appreciate for ps3 vs. ps2 or Xbox.It works well, very sensitive.We tried wireless with ps2 but the buttons wouldn't always work.They seem to charge quickly, and hold the charge longer than Xbox controllers.We play on a high def big screen so sitting 15-20 ft away makes a wireless controller a necessity.Expensive, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst software ever","review":"What an incredible piece of junk Nothing but trouble installingit Came with 5.9 driver which didnt work After an ordeal with just about every other option explored and getting irreproducible results, finally tried the OLDER driver from the site and it worked.

Naschy was around from time to time but did little to improve this grade C attempt. If you want porn buy porn, if you want a vampire movie try something else.

He is the only individual who appears in this film who even deserves to be called an actor.I purchased this film expecting something impressive, since I am a huge Naschy fan. Unfortunately, even the presence of one of my all-time favorite horror actors/directors could not polish this turd enough to make it shine.I truly hope and pray that Tomb of the Werewolf, Naschy's second US film, lives up to the legend.

It basically doesn't work for a bunch of reasons:The software does not do a very good job of interpretting names; even when it does the voice is hard to understand; when a number comes in without a name (or as \\"wireless caller\\" or \\"out of area\\" for instance), it will say \\"out of area\\" instead of reverting to announcing the underlying number, which you'd see on a text caller ID; it takes a couple rings before it starts to announce; etc. Overall, it's been completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more power and clarity","review":"This product is useful, but the voice is not loud enough and the pronounciation in unclear.

I didn't feel like there was any dead zone, sometimes even a little too sensitive.

Finding it extremely frustrating and difficult to complete even the simple beginner's tutorial programs because the joystick does not respond to very light pressure to bank and make small direction corrections. Doesn't respond at all until joystick is leaned over 30 dgrees, and then reacts to over-correct direction.

The unfortunate thing is that it requires alot of desk space to use. The USB connection is on the throttle therefore it must be present. The Main stick then connects to the throttle via a DIN connector. The stick is pretty well built and has more buttons than you will ever need. The best feature is the programmable presets where you can save multiple configurations and access an entire new configuration on the fly simply by rotating a thumb wheel. Control is definite and there is no noticeable creep when the control is at rest. The Windows setup screen will scare you because the multitude of buttons on the control panel \\"game controller\\" configuration screen is enough to cause an neural blowout.

I tried silicone grease under the dish and on the shaft, I tried binding the centering spring with tiny ty-raps to decrease the tension to the degree that the stick wont center on it's own and, still, there's nothing smoothe about the action. If you have ever flown a real aircraft (and yes, I've handled F4-B's and J's through C172\\"s), this is nothing like the real thing. Think I'll go back to my sloppy old MS force feedback 2.

In the second game I felt the music was not as strong as the original, but number three is a return to form with much catchier tunes...If you've played the other two you may feel the first case holds your hand a little too much, but it never becomes genuinely annoying.No further objections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all!","review":"This is the best of the Phoenix Wrights, I did love the other 2 as well but this one is just superb.

So I had very high expectations regarding the 3 sequel.Overall I can say the following: each of the 5 cases is highly entertaining, there is always more to find out about the different characters.

It is full of important information on five crucial trials, and throws considerable light on the strenghts and weaknesses of the American administration of justice. One wishes the authors had included more cases. But, even as it is, it is a good book to assign to courses of criminal justice at the undergraduate level. For me, the strongest of the five articles is the one ons the Lindberghs' baby, in which the deleterious influence of unethical and sensationalistic media is well highlighted. And the weakest the O.J. Simpson case, perhaps because its proximity in time. The article on the Scottsboro Trials is very helpful in understanding how the Supreme Court has established precedents that are making justice for all more of a reality in America. In any case, excellent reading, both for people acquainted with the US criminal justice and for those who'd like to start getting to know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take a strong hand.","review":"I've gone thru 20 of these so far (Autistic child)The top of the bottle cracks and breaks off whenever the lid if tighten too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!","review":"Very disappointing product.

The company is wonderful about replacing defective products, but they've done this three times and what they sent wasn't much better than what I had - Hard to screw on caps- just don't fit perfectly, ice melts faster than the older bottles, the top turning device sticks badly on all the new bottles and that is a huge problem. One of the selling points is being able to close and tote around with you. When the top sticks that's not an option. Now, since I keep everything, I've got plenty of old parts that I've been able to substitute, but that will someday end.

It starts with a nasty figure in the orchestra that goes on relentlessly and annoyingly until the chorus comes in -- then it's downhill from there. Signor Rota may have written fine background music for films but that clearly is no qualification for opera.Why would Gala and Opera d'Oro give this performance (likely its first) distribution when so many other good things go unrecorded.

Yes, they may not last as long as an actual blue glass shaker would have, but they seem robust enough and the color doesn't seem to be scraping off left and right. The paint flakes are TINY pinpoints flaking off, not as bad as the previous reviewer made it sound. They are good quality, not real high quality stainless lids, but they work, and I like the plastic insert shakers. They are very, very attractive too, and are slightly larger than most other spice jars I've ordered so I like that as well. I love the square shape too, adds a bit of decorativeness to it along with it being more economical to store lots of them next to each other.

The songs are lightweight, but that is probably the exact marketing niche her producers were looking for.I will listen to this from time to time, and probably buy her next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love the cd !","review":"I recently got to see kari wuhrer at a tulsa,ok. scifi convention and she is very beutiful.

A wave that rises and falls to its own ocean, the music takes the listener along as a captive. If you're afraid to take a step beyond, don't swim in Kari's pond. But if you like chocolate and popcorn, Ketchup and chicken, toys and love making, then let Kari Wuhrer take you with her Great voice and Style. She will lead, and you just close your eyes and float along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tone Deaf?","review":"I think she should stick to taking off her clothes.

May be there exist better vocal artists with more power and variability, but I like this album very much. It has a nostalgic touch. Drums, guitars, vocals, it's pur but not poor, no senseless adds. The songs are funny psychadelic an melancholic. Possibly it helps, if the listener has grown up in the late 60s or early 70s, to understand, what the songs are about. There insn't one bad song on this CD.Albums from actors and actresses have often an great advantage. They can make the music, they like. They don't have to follow the current mainstream. And I think You can hear this.If you like this album, I recommend the CD Eroica by Wendy and Lisa, which also is underestimated. It has the same nostalgic 70s touch, but better voices and more diversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job Kari!","review":"As like many other fans, I first heard of Kari Wuhrer as \\"Maggie\\" on the Sci-Fi show, \\"Sliders\\". I bought her CD as a result of loving her acting, and being interested in whatever artistic endevours she had in mind. The songs on this CD are excellent, half of them composed by Kari! Some of the others, like Paul McCartney's \\"Come and Get It\\", Kari makes her own. It is the best rendition of the song I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benedictine Wisdom for the Home","review":"Wilkes offers us an invitation into monastic spirituality, not for monks this time, but for you and me, for our daily lives, right where we live, in the midst of day-timers, cell-phones and soccer practices.

Ms. Bennett's voice is like cool silk, i.e., it feels good, but gets you all heated up. When she says \\"I'll be your wife\\" on the title track, you want her to be saying it to you. Her best songs on this album are the ones she wrote herself, particularly \\"Drifting\\" (the first few chords of the song are electric) and the title track, but \\"Feels Like a Heartbreak\\" and \\"You Never Saw Me Dance\\" are great cuts as well. The lyrics of these songs seem simple but are never trivial, and are always original. E.g., \\"Walk through life, suffer fools, handed junk, but fought for the jewels...\\" Buy the CD already, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, lush vocals!

The other will not light up - out of box failure. I disagree with the reviewer who said the backing will not scratch your finish. There are two round, powerful magnets to hold the light to a metallic surface. But the magnets are housed in chrome-plated metal rings that are sure to scratch anything unless you are very, very careful. Also, the on/off button is nearly impossible to press with a normal sized finger. You'll need to use a pen point or something of similar size and hopefully you'll have something like that with you if needed on a dark night. Overall a very poor design and unreliable as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this thinking it would be extra cushion and also extend the view back from the camera.

I was excited before it came, but after it arrived I was even more pleased than I had expected. The design is very simple, but elegant, and can be dressed up or down. Despite the dark face, it is very easy to read quickly. The clasp is very secure, but the watch is easy to remove when necessary (though I rarely take it off!). I am in love with the classy style of the band and the chocolate brown color of the face. One warning though, if you have small wrists like I do, prepare to get some links removed. I took my watch to a jeweler and he removed 3 links easily within a few minutes. It fits perfectly now- no sliding all the way up my arm, or off for that matter, but it isn't so snug that it's plastered to my wrist either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romp in the Future","review":"OK, this is a romp.Aubry Knight is a null-fighter in, oh, 2020 or so, in a devastated America. He goes through various travails due to betrayals and fights and just because of who he is.I won't give a summary to spoil the book, but it really is a fun story to follow. There are the usual \\"space opera\\" type stuff, with futuristic technology and events, but the essence of the story is not what you'd expect from the opening chapters.Aubry goes through things and goes through changes. This is not just a wham-bam kapow story about futuristic fighting. This is about the essence of a man: what makes us human, and what joins us as humans. (This last part is significant.)I'm not sure if this is Mr. Barnes' first work; based on the acknowledgments it is. It has the feel of a first work, but it is an impressive one. While there are times when the characters just advance the plot, the protagonist and his side-kick come across as very real people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...must assemble many, many pieces","review":"I ordered two of these wine racks. I liked the simplistic design and looked forward to receiving them. When I did receive them, I first noticed that they came in pieces...about 50+ pieces. The \\"kit\\" contained the wooden pieces and glue. The glue was dried up and unusable. The holes in the wooden bars were not drilled deep enough for the dowels, and the odd angle that the dowels had to go in made it even more difficult. I worked for about an hour before finally giving up and sending both units back for a refund. I would recommend purchasing a \\"ready made\\" unit and skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"assembly required.","review":"I would just like to let everyone know that this rack comes in a box, in all its pieces. The assembly instructions are very simple to understand; however, it does not actually assemble very easily. It's a system of wooden blocks, drilled on the corners, and some wooden rods to connect each block to the others. Glue is also provided. It gets difficult to insert the rods, and to line them up properly.

How Amazon can allow shipment in such flimsy packaging is beyond me. Plastic screwheads were damaged.

As a result the first stand I received was damaged.It hsa two screws in the base to hold the umbrella pole. The screwheads are plastic.

The plastic heads are bound the break.The stand weighs 40 lbs which is really too light. I bought it with a 9ft umbrella. Any wind moves the umbrella pretty easily and the stand has tipped a few times. I augmented the stand with a 45lb, wide bore Olympic weight.

I'm almost as amazed at his ability to transcribe Vinnie's solos as I am in the solos themselves. With two CDs; one with the solos slowed down and various exercises, and the second with the Randy Waldman's recording of these songs you can both see and hear what Vinnie is playing. To digest all this this book will take many many hours (how many hours in a year?) but what I have found so far is while you learn the solos you will find one or two measure phrases that you may internalize and use immediately. So even if your unable to learn an entire solo you can still get ideas which you can incorporate as your own. You'll find stickings that you've never played before and get a real insight into what makes Vinnie's playing and phrasing of odd time signatures so unique. Highly recommended for the experienced drummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silky Terrier Guide","review":"Good book talking about facts, personalties, health issues, discipline, etc of the Silky Terrier.

But the sound is terrible, as if the recording had been made by a mini-tape recorder in the pocket of an audience member with a bad cold and a most annoying laugh. That the Sante Fe performance was lots of fun can be deduced from the gales of laughter, obviously greeting sight-gags since there is nothing aurally to justify them. The plot etc. is supposed to be given in English by a narrator in between parts of the operetta, but most of it is unintelligible in the poor recording. Almost all of the French cannot be made out also. The Gala booklet, of course, offers no libretto and the track index adds insult to injury by giving the first few words of the numbers with in addition their translatiion into English.

In this series, he seems to enjoy being smarter than the other characters, but he does it with more of a sense of humor, rather then being obnoxious about it. Like any TV series, some episodes are better than others, but I found them all enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising series, defective dvd, don't take the risk","review":"I managed to watch only one of the 39 shows presented on this series. The second episode began to fall apart into digital clutter and finally quit playing altogether.This is unfortunate -- the first episode was actually of interest and the series promised many hours of entertainment.As I have learned, to my chagrin -- if there is a quality problem with one dvd or cd, there is a strong likelihood that the others in the production run will have the same issue.In short, there is a reason for the low cost of this item, and one gets what one pays for. Don't count on being lucky like other reviewers -- my recommendation is you avoid this until the company announces that they have fixed the quality problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sherlock","review":"IMHO this is the best Holmes, bar none. Rathbone is awesome, but Howard is definitely my favorite. This is British television at it's very best and it's from the 1950's. Even imagining the limited budget they had is amazing because you really believe you are in the turn of the century London. I looked for this on dvd for years, having owned a similar (less complete) series on VHS and I was thrilled to find this! Especially at such a bargain price! With shipping and all it was only around $10/US and brand new at that (all five disks containing all the episodes!). If you love Holmes, you will likely find yourself very charmed and enamored with this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend without any hesitation","review":"My Husband & myself are avid Sherlock Holmes fans. We have always loved Basil Rathbone protraying Sherlock Holmes, therefore, I had some hesitation as to whether Ronald Howard as Sherlock would alter our views on the show. Nonetheless, I decided to go ahead with purchasing the DVD based on the reviews I read. I'm delighted to report that we haven't been disappointed in the least; It's a superb DVD! The 30 minute shows are entertaining and to be honest I can't even remember how Basil Rathbone portrayed Sherlock due to the excellent performance by Ronald Howard together with Howard Marion as Dr. Watson. This is truly a hidden gem and I would tell anybody to take a risk in buying this, it is well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD quality extremely poor","review":"The DVD quality of the set I got is very poor - the discs just wouldn't play on my Sony DVD player due to errors. Amazon was great about promptly replacing the first defective DVD set, but the second one was probably worse than the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The first five minutes played okay, and then the disc started skipping and not playing. This only happens on low-quality DVDs, which is the case with this package. The shows may be great, but you can't watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit","review":"I always loved Sherlock Holmes but wasn't aware that Ronaald Howard played Holmes. I didn't even know Ron Howard. I had previously purchased a DVD with a couple of episodes on it. When I saw this set, I had to buy it. Even though some episodes were repeated on this new set. I would recommend this set to any Holmes fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Case Of Inferiority","review":"Apparently most of the positive reviews for this set are based upon the previous 5 disc release by Mill Creek rather than the 3 disc release by Mill Creek as being reviewed here. Sherlock Holmes would likely call this \\"The Case Of Inferiority\\" relative to the overall quality of the video and audio. The video quality is ghastly as is the audio quality. A rating of 1 out of 5 is much too generous for this disappointing release of a wonderful series. Two of the three discs will not play at all while the third freezes and goes back to the root menu. Potential purchasers of the 3 disc set are advised to carefully consider the lower ratings by other reviewers prior to making the decision to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply wonderful","review":"I found two DVD's of series in the dollar bin at WalMart and fell in love with it. I'm only through about two of the DVD's in the full collection, but I haven't seen any problems with quality. Or at least no more than would be found with a TV series this old and far fewer than many I've seen. Ronald Howard plays a very funny and ironic Holmes and H. Crawford is great as a Watson who is both competent and amused by Holmes antics.It appears that the original series was shown live as there are several minor 'bloopers' but they add interest rather than detract. It's also rather fun to watch a show that had such a small cast that the actors were probably running the cameras and sewing costumes as well. (You'll soon get to recognize all the actors) This is a fun, fun series that I undeservedly recommend even if you had to pay twice what Amazon is charging."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Discs almost broke my DVD player","review":"Although I was a fan of the series, there are major glitches on Discs one and two. I don't know if its an error in the encoding of the discs themselves or what, but basically you get to a point on these discs during the first episode and the entire DVD player shuts down. And then it won't spit out the disc, causing the DVD player to almost break completely.You get what you pay for with this folks. Beware"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHERLOCK HOLMES THE COMPLETE SERIES","review":"A VERY NICE SET FROM MILL CREEK, AND WITH ALL 39 EPISODES. MOST DISTRIBUTORS ONLY OFFERED ABOUT 20 OR SO.

ALSO VERY QUICK SERVICE FROM AMAZON, WILL BE PURCHASING MORE FROM THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this guy","review":"We are old mystery movie buffs. This is right up our alley. Great collection of movies. We never get tired of Sherlock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't go home","review":"I thought this series was pretty neat when viewed through the eyes of an 11 year old in 1955. Unfortunately, when viewed as an adult, spoiled by more modern productions, it comes off as \\"Abbott&Costello; Meets Sherlock Holmes.\\" The stories are either very loosly adapted from Doyle or completely fabricated episodes made to fit a 30 minute time frame. The plots were pretty pathetic,the actors were wooden, and the theme music became irritating after the first episode. Ronald Howard&Marion; Crawford would have made a credable Holmes&Watson; if they had been given decent scripts.If nothing else, this series did plant the seed of a lifelong interest in Holmes. It also pointed out (painfully)how primitive early TV was, how little it took to entertain us, and how far we have come."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice gift","review":"i got this for my mother. it arrived VERY fast, but now we can't watch it until my mother unwraps it for christmas lol.. my father is a very big critic of everything, and he thought this was a great gift to get, so that reassured me that this would be a great dvd to buy for any sherlock holmes fan :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sherlock Holmes","review":"I was so happy to find this complete collection. Finally it is in good condition. I had purchased this over a year ago, but it was in very poor shape. Very fuzzy picture, etc. It is possible to enjoy this set. This is not supposed to be the quality of story line that you would find in a movie length film starring Basil Rathbone. But all in all it is very enjoyable.This was at such a bargain price. So I was very happily surprised that it was in such good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprised at what a great set","review":"my memories are of sherlock holmes being run every saturday night on the local UHF channel back in the \\"70's\\", and holmes being basil rathbone. as far as i was concern there was no holmes but rathbone.....however, due to the price of some of the rathbone disc, i decided to try this, what a surprise, the shows are excellent, the characters are believable and excellent, and for the cost of this set, its close to finding buried treasure....if you are thinking, \\"am i going to like this set if i buy it\\", try it i am certain you will like it.......UPDATE: having watched more of these episodes, i can truly state i do not regret buying this set, the stories are good, this dr. watson is not portrayed as a bubbling idiot, and actually adds to the capture of the criminals, very good set if you are on the fence thinking should i buy or not....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A factory defect on the two DVD sets I bought last year.","review":"Disk 1 \\"texas cowgirl\\" episode has a factory defect.

It gives a breif background on the Hellfire Club as well as letting you get some insider info on Jean Grey/Pheonix. This book is truly one of the best I've read.If I'm correct, then this is the first time a lot of characters are introduced, mainly some from the Hellfire Club. You also get a look at Kitty Pryde, who is later known as Sprite and then Shadowcat. You also see Dazzler, the dazzling disco diva/mutant. The Shi'Ar, Hellfire Club, and X-Men are only a few of the groups of individuals you see in this fantastic book.If you don't have this, then get it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's way over-rated!","review":"This was actually the first story that marked the begining of Chris Claremont's trend of trying to do four or five different little stories all in one over-blown crossover. The theme of Jean grey being transformed into a vastly powerful being that sets out to destroy the universe was repeated 16 years later with Charles Xavier becoming Onslaught (please). It also started the trend of dead characters later coming back to life, but that's another story in of itself. The X-Men animated series recently did an adaptation of this story for television, and it wasn't much better. You want to read a good Marvel story, try the Fantastic Four; Coming of Galactus saga, by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Claremont & Byrne","review":"Although Chris Claremont seems to have a symbiotic relationship with anything X-Men, John Byrne certainly didn't last too long in the whole scheme of things. That aside, this TPB collects this duo's best-ever X-Men work, chronicling the seduction of Jean Grey's human soul to the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix. The drama is first-rate and the art is excellent. The \\"Wolverine Alone\\" section is sort of a misnomer: we actually only witness a few panels of the diminutive Canadian X-Man against the Hellfire Club mercenaries. The climax double-size section is superb, where a semi-coerced team of mutants (morally uncertain of defending Jean b/c of her annihilation of an entire planet as Dark Phoenix) battle the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. The ending panels are some of the best ever printed in comics; it's just a shame that Jean was \\"brought back from the dead.\\" But who, after all, ever *stays* dead in comics?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST X-STORY EVER!","review":"I'm the major X-enthusiast, and I tell ya', you need to get or at least read this epic tale! The saga contains two of Wizard's best X-Stories of all time! Those two being the saga itself and Wolverine:Alone. Well, I really don't have anything else to say except that if you aren't in some way touched by the conclusion, you're either stupid or have no idea of the emotional impact of it. Well, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comic stories ever!","review":"I must admit this story is incredible. John Byrne's art work is wonderful. He is one of my favorite comic book artist. Chris Claremonts scripting is still imitated today. I have not grown tired of reading this story and it's just a comic book. This is a recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off company","review":"I thought I was getting a good deal. I then learned that they were going to over charge me for the shipping. The knives cost twice as much as they said when you add the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Disappointment","review":"This could have been an excellent study into the characteristics of manhood set by culture, society, environment, and nature. Instead it is a terribly limited view of a handful of men in one country. Sadly, it is void of enthusiasm for its topic, boring as dirt, and less interesting than reading a phone book.The author seems more intent on proving she has read a great deal on the topic by endlessly paraphrasing the work of other studies (always giving due credit), but displays little skill in using her knowledge to make her viewpoints or research remotely appealing. There is far more approachable, interesting, creative reference out there if any of these qualities are important to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet romance, leaves me feeling warm and happy.","review":"The first GLH I read, and still the best IMHO.

She takes us into strange and powerful alternative moralities that are yet plausible enough for us to connect to them with our own humanity. Like all the best writers, she forces us to look at ourselves and our own civilization through telling a terrific story with well developed characters. Though I think Snow Queen and Summer Queen are the best of her novels I've read, I thoroughly enjoy Cat's brooding and painful coming to terms with himself and hope fervently that Ms Vinge is preparing to send us another entry in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, with a dash of unusual spice!","review":"Dreamfall, the last one so far written of the \\"Cat\\" series, has left me desiring a quick fourth helping. Psion, the first book was good; Catspaw, the second, was intriguing. But - Dreamfall was so outstandingly entertaining yet so different... Being a telepath (who has somehow supressed his gift, without wanting to) and a halfbreed on his home planet was bad enough, but being on his non-human parents' planet and falling into \\"Murphy's Law\\" was excellent, add the uniqueness of the \\"cloudwhales\\" - now you have the spice!

I have read this first book three times since it has come out. Each time I am grateful for owning it. It is one of the best trilogies I have ever read, especially from an author that is not day-to-day mainstream.The plot is exciting and in my opinion fresh (making it her own), and I LOVE the characters. I related with Resil the most and fought every battle (emotional and physical) with her throughout the entire series. I am shocked that some of the reviewers found ANY of the characters stiff.Each book is different but it all ties together to form a wonderfully written trilogy.This is a true Science Fiction/Fantasy novel and a series that I will re-read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Good","review":"This book should be good, in theory I liked the premise for the story. But once I started to read it I found that the characters lacked depth and I just wanted to skip past everything to find out the end so I could be done with the book. The Bird was shallow and uninteresting.Ultimately the book was full of possibility but didn't even begin to live up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"suffers the flaws of a first novel","review":"Hopefully this author will improve with time. This outing, however, has somewhat flat, one-dimensional characters. The first few pages are top-heavy with backstory to get us up to speed, and in many places the same information is given repeatedly; as the character struggles to accept the goshawk companion, she goes through the same argument again and again. Much could be trimmed for clarity and speed. Also there are some convenient \\"as you know\\" moments, where the main character just *happened* to be in a place where she could overhear conversation that serves only to give information to the reader. And why ARE the healers called \\"tarks,\\" anyway? What's wrong with calling them healers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new author","review":"I normally am very hesitant to read books outside my favorite authors.

The main character is extremely one dimensional I find, something I noticed others said as well although they seem to be outnumbered by a whole bunch of people that probably just came off the high of just finishing a novel. I would suspect that if the people read the book again and thought about it, they'd most likely come to different conclusions and give different reviews. The book does have a fairly decent premise, not something too origional, but that's hard to come by. The characters as I said, are cookie cut-outs, while the problems they face seem more of an excuse than the actual plot.

He took what he thought was his and to hell with the consequences until he took Ailis and finally met his match.I thought the story showed the way relationships were probably handled back in those times.

To his credit, the author has tried to be impartial and objective (but not quite succeeding). There are a lot of facts and figures here but they are badly organized and the conclusions and arguments don't seem to take into account the increasing lawlessness of society today.The hard facts are that criminals will always be able to get firearms, being already in contempt of law by their very profession. This and other important aspects of the equation such as education (we are far more likely to encounter a firearm in daily life than ever) are left out.

What I didn't understand is that I was getting the best, too. I was the last of my closest friends to get a digital camera -- and now I have the envy of the pack. While they're busy replacing batteries -- I'm still shooting, thanks to the \\"video camera\\" style of battery. Just plug in the camera, with the supplied A/C cable, and shot until nightfall. I haven't run out of juice yet!I used a pretty high resolution my first time out... I could see the pores of my daughters arms, in focus, with perfect clarity. It might have TOO good of resolution. Get this camera, and skip the little point and shoots. This baby turns heads, and does amazing work to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best All Around High Quality Digital Camera","review":"My partner and I both purchased this camera. It actually produces better resolution (2,400 x 1,800 pixels) than 5.4 MB cameras that cost twice as much. In addition, it has an auto mode that enables my wife to take picutures without the complications of adjusting an SLR. Other features that I like: Electronic View Finder, Auto/Man Focus, Auto/Man/Custom White Balance, Continuous Shooting, 6x optical with 3.75 digital zoom. The resolution is so good, that you can zoom in on the individual pores of a persons face. As a result, it is excellent for medical imaging and I have used it in the operating room with outstanding results. The only thing is that you need either a photo printer or a color laser printer with high resolution to fully appreciate the high quality of these images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Camera!","review":"This camera is well worth the money.

Fuji probably discontinued this model though because the battery only lasts about 45 minutes to an hour if used with the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). If you use the EVF (Electronic View Finder) the battery will last longer, the LCD just looks cooler is all. The software that comes with this camera is also very user-friendly and appears to be compatible with all OS's. Overall an excellent digital camera!!!!

My 70 year old father, who'd not taken pictures in years, picked up the basics pretty quick.The camera is old and a bit clunky for today's streamlined standards, but for someone like me it makes it harder to drop and the photos are as good as newer models (if not better).The biggest grumble for me is the memory card. It takes SmartMedia cards which are smaller (memorywise) and more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho Killer Qu'est-ce que sais","review":"Firstly, I would like to note that I plan on revising this review later on.Now in regards to the play \\"Down the Road\\" it is neither a masterpiece or a work of atrocity, rather it is a play involving a unique character study. The character I speak of is Reach, a confined serial killer. The play revolves around two reporters/journalists, who happen to be married, as they make a case study on Reach through a series of interviews which lead to various problems and oddities in their relationship.The reason I give this play four stars is merely because of the interesting moments with Reach, which possess a keen insight into an obvious psychopath. While the actions that drive the play are perhaps lacking, and the development of the two other main characters are a bit flat, the play provides an interesting read, and a challenge for the actors who choose to perform it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not worth what they are asking","review":"These sunglasses are very comfortable to wear. In fact they are likely the most comfortable glasses I've ever owned. Having said that, I am otherwise extremely disappointed with these sunglasses. They do not cut glare or improve visability any better than a pair of 25 dollar shades. I also found my pair to be of extremely poor construction. The lens cracked after about a month. I've owned good sunglasses before such as Ray Bans so I know what to expect from a pair of high end sunglasses and these don't even come close. I would say that these sunglasses are on par with a pair of 20 dollar shades you find on the rack at a department store.

I was gradually pulled into this story. Hannah wasn't full of personality and a loner living on an isolated island. A nature lover, L.L. Bean kind of a girl, she liked the comfort of solitude. The reclusive artist, was very successful, but only one gallery seemed to be selling her work. Her friends, who were obviously much more talented, couldn't make a living selling art like Hannah did. Hmmmmm. This low key story will really grab your senses. The writer enables you to see, smell and feel the natural surroundings of the island and the peaceful feeling of solitude. Hannah's life becomes disrupted, beginning with Driftwood, the dog who found her island and makes himself at home. You can feel her disruption as people and events intrude upon her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book for those who like character development","review":"We read this book for my book club.

One day a dog (aptly named Driftwood) washes up on her island, and over the ensuing years a succession of characters invade the artist's solitary life. Driftwood is a fixture throughout these adventures, and helps Hannah to open her heart to new experiences and people.Some of my friends thought the book ended awkwardly, others were happy that no loose ends were left by the end. We enjoyed arguing about what may happen next, and did Hannah ever decide to do an exhibit of her work after she backed out of one in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The delight is in the details","review":"The plot requires some suspension of disbelief, but the details do not -- the author has done a terrific job of evoking the area around Deer Isle, a real, small, rural Maine island, one I know well, and as far as I can tell the details are spot on, other than the imaginary island on which the protagonist lives. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to live alone on a tiny coastal Maine island, year round, this book will tell you. If you have ever loved a dog, this book will charm you. And if you're in the mood for a pleasant, enjoyable, not-too-demanding read, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Pick","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

(The same problem others have described.) It simply never looked like it was sturdy, and within a couple of months one of the umbrella ribs was broken.Now, in a mild wind, the umbrella snapped into two pieces right around the area where they were screwed together.I expect items, even ones that are reasonably cheap like this umbrella, to go together well and be reasonably sturdy.

As advertised, the umbrella comes in two pieces which must screwed together. The top piece is really too heavy for the supporting bottom piece. The fittings are solid-looking brass, but appearances can be deceiving. When the two pieces are screwed together, the umbrella is not straight because of the weight of the top. I am using the umbrella with the companion Oxford umbrella base and a glass/aluminum table. It was very difficult for two people to set up the umbrella because of its large size and weight. It has proved impossible to align the umbrella so that it stands straight. The bottom shaft is straight, but the weight of the top causes it to lean no matter how it is positioned.

Despite changing the joystick's channels and using numerous alternate batteries, as well as removing most interfering devices away (really, only 3 nearby items transmitting on the 2.4 gHz range), the stick still proved to be too intermittent. Subsequent purchase of the Logitech equivalent proved to be more stable, without any interference.This is a shame, too, as the stick was built beautifully. It certainly has a superior throttle control to the Logitech, as well as a great layout and overall construction quality. The Saitek software works quite well, and the profiler was easy to use.

I may have gotten my $20 use out of it, but not more. It started off by being an hour off. Since I live on the west coast, I could not just select a different time zone to fix the problem. So I ended up opening the case and adjusting the hands manually for the initial install. After that, I had to select a different time zone when the time changed from daylight savings time to standard time.Now, the clock has started advancing continuously as though it is trying to reset itself to the correct time. So, I am going to throw it away and buy another clock -- probably NOT one made by La Crosse!Admittedly, I have not contacted the manufacturer about either of these problems -- for $20 it hardly seemed worth my time to even call.On the positive side, the clock looks good and maintained the correct time for two years, with the exception of having to manually change it twice a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these clocks","review":"We love these clocks!

It has a rugged design, but what I need is, it to be very bright. We don't use the flash light as hammer, do we? After buying this I changed my opinion about LED flash lights. But when I saw a different type of LED flash light in Walmart, I became curious. Thought I'll try my luck a little more. Surprise..!!! It turned out to be very bright... so bright that when I tried first time, it was pointed to my face and I couldn't see anything for sometime.

I never could understand Shakespeare, until now. This book revived my intrest and kept me busy for days. The only problem I found with this treasure of literary reference was it's lack of entries for Macmorris from \\"Henry V\\" and Jaques De Boys from \\"As You Like It\\".

Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prairie River","review":"I usually don't read these kinds of books, but once I started this one, I couldn't put it down. It is written for juveniles and thus it moves at a fast pace and doesn't really have a lot of low points. Some parts are rather difficult to believe, but the intent is to show young readers how their faith can be exemplified through fictional characters.There are really no villains in this book. Some people don't like Nessa Clemens, but the author doesn't really develop an evil antiheroine. None of the situations Nessa finds herself in are life-threatening and things always seem to work out. as I said, it is a book about faith more than the historical setting it takes place in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A kid probably couldn't get through the 1st chapter","review":"If your kids are looking for historical fiction, please try some of those spin-offs of the Laura Ingalls Wilder books. Although the events and time period devices seemed accurate, the characters weren't very believable or realistic. Example...it's an 18-year-old first experience teaching, her pupils asked if they can 'go play' and she happily dismisses each and every student until she had an empty classroom. I didn't get what the 'big, terrible' secret was with the sisters, Fannie Jo and Laura. And I'm sure most people back then didn't treat 'orphans' like absolute vermin just because their parents were dead! Also, what is up with the girl praying to Jesus every three paragraphs? You can be Christian and write Christian books without preaching whenever the chance arises. Like I said, try Laura Ingalls, the Rose series is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking work in women's history","review":"Cott argues that the market revolution in early America brought about the creation of a seperate women's \\"sphere\\" of domesticity. She further contends that the placement of women in a seperate \\"private sphere.\\" can be termed the \\"cult of domesticity\\" She concludes by making the claim that the cult of domesticity allowed women to forge bonds through churches and fellow homemakers which helped bring about the first femenist movements of the early nineteenth century. The work stands as the primer for the revisionists' view of new women's \\"anti-victimization\\" history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, and engrossing","review":"When I first began to read 'The Bonds of Womenhood' I found the concepts general and the progress slow. Despite this slow start, Nancy Cott's work soon pulls you in to her convincing arguments and compelling presentation. By the conclusion one can appreciate the structure of the argument as much as the message, history, and interpretation she conveys in the text. I recommend this book to those who wish to begin a modern and fair interpretation of Gender history and Women's issues. There are few scholarly books that are enjoyable to read and this one in particular is commendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very long term paper","review":"Unless your extremely into History and like reading term papers you better just skip this book.

But as soon as I heard these songs they quickly sounded familiar and gave me the shivers of nostalgia. \\"Tonight\\", and \\"Say You'll Never\\" are more known and If your looking in here, then most likely you know these two songs.

You don't have time to get scared, next thing you know, you are already doing the moves you thought were the domain of the pro dancers! And above all, this video gave me the inspiration I needed to work harder than ever, it triggered my ambition!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this DVD","review":"I thoroughly enjoy salsa, and enjoy learning from DVD's and tapes. The title and reviews of this product suggest one will learn great things about this lovely dance. Unfortunately, it is not clearly stated that this is for salsa rueda, not salon style or club salsa. Although the moves are nifty and presented in a reasonable fashion, rueda requires the expected step to be called out, somewhat in the latin version of square dancing. So if you are looking to turn your date around the floor in your own style, leading with non verbal ques, this is not your DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"not working at all. it looks the same.

I loved the book, loved the thorough explanation of the changing climate in our culture towards nursing & all the sources cited (which I have now tracked down several & read those too). I even read it twice cover to cover as I felt like I had to read it again to digest it all. I have also loaned this book out several times & everyone who reads it raves about how riveting & interesting it is. I've even gotten two men to read it - yay me.

The latter book is better organized and easier to read, although (like this book) it is a bit dense. As another reviewer noted, Kailath's style is a bit hard to follow, so unless you're already familiar with some concepts from theoretical linear algebra, systems, and/or control theory, I would not recommend using this book alone as an intro to Linear Systems Theory. Nevertheless, it is a very thoughtful and useful book and should be on your shelf if you have a real interest in systems and controls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"This book is exhausting to read. A far better source to learn linear systems is _Linear System Theory and Design_ by Chi-Tsong Chen.There are numerous other books that cover certain topics in Kailth's book much better, too.

It boasts an \\"eight page biography\\" that is not only in a font so large it can only accommodate 20 lines per page, it is actually only 6 pages long. The booklet fails to provide any information about the recordings - no recording dates, musicians, etc. (Only the songwriters are indicated on the back cover.)While the sound quality is decent and there are some lesser-known recordings included (a plus for those looking to add to their Holiday collection), the disc closes with one big disappointment: Strange Fruit. The version used here is a live version, not the/a studio recording. I recognized this 1945 live recording of the song not because of the arrangement or vocals, but because it begins with Billie Holiday struggling to clear her throat - it is unappealing to say the least.This may be a low-cost disc, but if looking for a recording of \\"Strange Fruit\\", it is still overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this item.

I feel it is appropriate for a child of 18 months or older.Be careful to order the \\"hearts\\" barney and not the \\"stars\\" barney if you want the \\"I Love You\\" song as they are two different toys.

I found it a great resource and easy to use. I also thought that it helped me as a English teacher in Korea by teaching a lot of useful classroom dialogue, as well as work related things, like how to great spouses etc. I worked through this book on my own and found it was extremely possible to learn from and the excercises at the end of each chapter really emphasize you learning the Korean.

Not the Best","review":"I have been self-studying Korean for several months because I have several Korean friends, and this is one of the books that I have tried using. Teach Yourself Korean uses to much romanization, even though it also teaches Hangul (''). I like the way that the book teaches Hangul, the writing system. It does not explain it as well as \\"Learn Korean the Easy Way for Beginners,\\" which one of my Korean friends bought me in Korea, and I have not been able to find in the United States. But it explains the sounds and shows words that use them well. The vocabulary is very specific the certain situations, but the situations are fairly common. It explains several grammar points per chapter, which are fairly useful, including different verb forms and particles that go after nouns.Overall, I like Teach Yourself Korean, but it will not do an amazing amount by itself without other knowledge of Korean probably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a Audio program that I could listen to in the car while commuting to wrok each day.

Thinking that perhaps the charge on the batteries was running out, I changed the batteries multiple times, but the problem persisted. I kept the timer in a cabinet behind my desk and brought it out only when it was in use, so I know that the issue was not middle school students experimenting with it and breaking it.

He loves timers, and traffic lights (odd as that sounds) so this seemed right up his alley. Here's the problem: it takes at least 20 non-intuitive button clicks just to *set* the timer. I counted. And then another 5 non-intuitive clicks to *start* the timer. They've made it way too difficult, and we just don't use it. The flexibility to adjust the lights & sounds is a nice touch, but they force you through that every time. Ugh.

I say this because you can set a default time which is relatively easy to reuse.The idea of 80% green, 15% yellow, and 5% red is great, but if you're hoping to enter 1-5-0-0-start and get a 15-minute 80/15/5 countdown, forget it. Every time I want to use the thing I have to go track down and re-read the documentation. Because of the difficulty in using it, we only use it for long tasks.As I'm trying to figure out how to use it each time, I do so with gladness that there is no one timing me as I set the timer. :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, horrible engineering, don't waste your money.","review":"Time management is an important skill to learn, both as an adult and a child. I bought Time Tracker to provide a visual and audible basis for my three kids to learn time management. Piano practicing, computer game time, and to control how much time my teen is on the phone. This seemed like a great product concept to help us with our parenting. The lights and sounds worked as described, but no normal human being is going to be able to figure out how to program it. AND, once you have set and started the clock, there is NO WAY to stop it or reset it!!! You have to wait the full 30 or 60 minutes to start over!! We got tired of taking the batteries out to reset it every time we needed to adjust the time or start over. This product drove my family nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"First of all -- I didn't find the programming to be any more difficult than programming a VCR or a digital clock. I only had to look at the instructions once and I've been able to change it plenty of times since then.I do wish that there was a way you could save more than two settings for time, because having to go in and change it every time you want to change the duration is a little annoying. It would be really nice if there were maybe four or five presets that you could use... like 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc. I also think it would be nice if you could start it off on red and then end on green instead of having to do it the other way around... so when we're \\"cooling down\\" or at bedtime/naptime -- I could use the red and then have it flip to green to signal that it's okay to get up/play.Other than that, it's working well. It made bedtime routine a breeze last night with my 2 1/2 year old son. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Tracker review","review":"Love it! This really helped me with my time-out's. My child watches the light to see when his time is up and doesn't try to talk to me the whole time asking when his time is up. It's also great for getting ready for bed. We just set the timer for 5 minutes and he hurries around cleaning up his toys. Another great use is if you've got a child reluctant to go to bed, the timer can give him a warning - just set the timer and tell them when the 5 minutes is up, it's bed time. Our days go a lot smoother with the Time Tracker! The only draw back is that it has just two timers. I'd like three or four."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Well, I was looking for something to let me two-year-old know when he could get out of bed in the morning. The Time Tracker is a great idea but poorly designed! First of all, like others before me have said, it's a hassle to program and it only holds one time setting. So you to reprogram it if you plan to use it more than once a day. Then, the biggest frustration is that it locked up on me after two days of use. My poor son waiting patiently for the light to turn red and it never did. A good idea! Poor design! Low quality! Overpriced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I had been looking at this timer for awhile, but because of the mixed reviews I wasn't sure!! However, we are very happy with it. Took me a few tries to figure out HOW to set the time/lights (and my kids 9 & 7 actually figured it out first!) It is a great visual timer and they get excited to set it (not so excited when thime is up- but follow the rules still) I would recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Poor Execution","review":"In spite of the reviews saying how difficult it is to program the timer, I bought one. The lights on the timer are great, but programming is impossible without the directions. You would think that once it's programmed you would just push a button to start it. No, that would be too simple. The first thing it goes to when programming it is the clock set! Really? I wanted a timer, not a clock. And once the clock is set, I don't want to have to tab over setting it every time I want to use the timer! Starting the timer takes pushing several buttons. I forget exactly how many because I misplaced the directions and had to throw the timer away. Please somebody re-invent this product! In the mean time, I found a kid friendly timer app on my iphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it WORKED","review":"I had high hopes for this item to help my son keep track of his time while doing his homework. I have ordered and returned this item twice. The first one arrived with one of the battery contacts missing. The second one arrived and I tested it once with no problems. A few minutes later, I tested it again and the sound didn't work. I reset it and tested it several more times with no luck. It never made a sound again. I returned the second one and will not be ordering a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it lasted longer","review":"Well, we loved it while it was working. Then BAM, it was dead.

Shoddy electronics. Great concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it..............","review":"I teach elementary kids and I thought this timer would work great during my reading groups. Unfortunately, it did not. It lost its programming on a daily basis. It is also difficult to set and takes too long to get to the simple timer mode.I returned the item.

I don't have time for that.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"I have ordered 2. Had to return one. Instructions were missing in one so product had been opened already.

When it WAS working, it was great. The screen slowly dimmed so I thought it was the batteries even though it had only been three weeks. After replacing the batteries it would set but then when it turned to the yellow color it would light up all colors and stop. It would not compete one cycle without getting \\"stuck\\" on the yellow. I returned it for a replacement and when I got the second timer and tried to set it, it would turn off and start blinking in the middle of setting it. This was on the first day right out of the packaging. It never would set without malfunctioning so I returned that too. I decided NOT to try for third times a charm because it seems that even if it would work at the beginning it would break anyways. I can say I really liked the timer when it worked, but it is not worth it with the poor construction of the device. My advice would be to not even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for timeouts with multiple children.","review":"I bought this to help with time outs. Since I have more then one child (four) I have different times for each time out. Completely useless for what I need it for. The manual timer takes for ever to program and is incredibly complicated. Not good for when you are trying to stay as calm as possible. I never use it so it was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pell's Best","review":"First of all, I bought this disc after buying two other discs by the Dave Pell Octet (I Had the Craziest Dream and Jazz Goes Dancing/Campus Hop). Those two are superb featuring some of the best west coast jazz of the 50's - I highly recommed them. My expectation for this disc was more of the same since it has essentially the same personnel (Pell, Fagerquist, Previn et. al.) but it was no where near as good. The arrangements just aren't as interesting and in fact there's really only 1 or 2 swinging tunes in the whole set. The rest plod along like a funeral march. Maybe because it was earlier, I'm not sure but the charts are very anemic and lack any kind of oomph! The second disc in this two-fer, the Katz LP reissue - is OK and features some nice stuff but not enough to make me want to play it again and again. It also suffers from some lifeless arranging which is a shame given that Jimmy Raney plays on a few of the tunes and he's such a hard swinging guitarist.

The filter being sold by Crawford's Superstore is NOT a HMC UV(C) filter. It is an HMC UV(N) filter. The N model filter is an asian market model and is made with inferior components. If you look on (insert name of popular auction site here) you will see that the UV(N) filters are about 25% cheaper than the UV(C) filters, so this is a bait and switch operation.I can't comment on the filter yet because I haven't opened the packaging. As soon as I saw what was going on I immediately contacted the seller and have yet to receive a response. It could be a good filter, but I wanted to warn people that what is advertised here is not what you will receive.

If you have a ton of metal records it might not be for you but in my case, I'm quite thrilled with it. What struck me as interesting is that I consider this Cd as world beat in the sense that like Gagaku or Zydeco, metal is part of our world and it deserves a place in any half decent collection. In my mind, the beats are evocative of satanism and faschism. Quite agressive! I like it! John Zorn's saxophone is at a minimum. The big star here is Mick Harris. Good one! But then, I like Derek Bailey so I might not be that reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Most Types of Fruit.","review":"The picker is great with most of the fruit on my property such as avocados, oranges, and mangos. However, I bought it specifically to pick papaya and I find that it is not sturdy enough to grip a large papaya when I twist the picker. If you know about papaya, the fruit is picked when it just starts to ripen. Fruit at this stage are well attached to the tree; it takes a lot of effort to twist the picker and remove the fruit. I find that when I grip the papaya and twist, the picker, being plastic, cannot hang on to the papaya and I lose my grip on the fruit.Like I said though, it's great with anything else. The summer avocado season is starting here in Hawaii and I pick avocados easily with the picker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the pole from a PAINT store.","review":"I spent a year with a 5 foot broomstick pole looking for a longer pole at all the local gardening and building supplies.

With any luck I won't break this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Based on the numerous positive reviews I expected a better product. I wanted it mainly for avocados but it is not strong enough for most of ours. When we twist it slips off. No way to pull them off with it either. We'll probably get some use out of it, mainly for smaller papayas. Buyers should be aware that this thing is meant for a fixed-length pole. I need to adjust the length of my pole frequently and it won't work very well that way. Secondly, a pole with screw threads on the end seems to be mandatory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this item as I have 20 apple trees in my orchard. After spending the money for this item I had to go back out and purchase a basket type picker because with the twisted picker I had to apply so much pressure to the apple to remove it from my tree it always left a bruise. With the basket picker I simply put the basket under the apple and with a gentle tug remove the apple along with the stem without any damage to the fruit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Upon Arrival","review":"I'm a bit reluctant to order this product for a third time, as I can't manage to get one delivered that isn't cracked. Twice I've ordered it, and twice one of the loops that picks the fruit is cracked. Seems to me that the plastic is pretty brittle and cracks very easily, which makes me wonder how long it would last after you start putting stress on it to pull fruit from the tree? Anyone else experience this problem? I see that this is the best rated fruit picker out there, but it still seems pretty cheap, and I'm considering just getting a more durable basket style. I appreciate any feedback you have. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and useless junk","review":"This fruit picker is a piece of cheap plastic that would not last a month, even if one could assemble it and get it to function. The assembly instructions are confusing, but after a while I understood what they were trying tell me. There is a piece of poor quality double sided tape that is supposed to hold the anchor (another cheap plastic piece)for the rope to the pole, but the tape would not stick to the pole. The rope itself came out of the picker end before I could even try to put the whole thing together. I couldn't even assemble this device to try it out.This seemed like a good idea if, like me, you are always poking holes in your fruit with the \\"claw\\" typepickers. But this thing is a gimmick and a piece of junk. Save your money and time; this thing is a waste of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"First off the thing arrives with directions that require additional work from you besides just unwrapping this thing and putting it on a pole. Measure stuff, cut pieces, then do this and that. The idea is great, but with limited time, I was looking for something easy and just stick it on a pole and go. Ideally a refund would be preferable, but I suspect this is just going to go in the rack of bad things to buy. I can't say whether it gets the fruit well, since I didn't master the directions (I am zero when it comes to handy things - that is why I buy items that can do it for me).

It is an out growth of Peter's \\"Intro to VHDL\\" paper that was published on the web and it sort of shows. I really like the depth that it goes into, I wish it had the standard libraries in the appendix. (it doesn't) However, until getting Ashendon's book, all other VHDL texts were pretty opaque.The only thing this book does not have is a treatment of logic 'inference.' Since all VHDL compilers today \\"infer\\" (a fancy way of saying \\"guess\\") what logic would be able to implement a behavior, not understanding how those compilers guess makes it possible to write syntactically clean VHDL that doesn't synthesize any logic.

It is also innacurate, as many people who have lost loved ones to suicide can attest to, for even if a person shows signs of being suicidal, you cannot force someone to get help if they won't accept it.

I would look in all types of office stores but never found it again. Because I still had the sticker on the bottom of the clipboard I went to Amazon to see if I could find it again. Voila.

The story is about two young humans, and a dinosaur, who go questing for something called the Hand of Dinotopia that supposedly points the way to a safe sea route in and out of Dinotopia, which is surrounded by deadly currents and reefs that can smash boats to pieces. The trio soon find something amazing in the middle of 'The Great Desert,' which is unexplored and unknown to all but a very few dinotopians. Before too long the group becomes larger as the humans and dinosaurs continue their quest in search of the Hand of Dinotopia, but the question is: do they find what they're looking for . . .? An entertaining book, good story line, and rather suspenseful, providing a mystery to curious and willing readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good overall book","review":"This book overall was a good book for any favorite Fanticy lover.this book is about a young man who is a mail diliver in the land of Dionotopia.

Along ther way he meets up with carnavorious dinasaurs, grumpy hermits, and some nomadic tribes of humans and dinosaurs.I recomend this book to those who can read well. their is some chalanging gramer and some going frome one person to another.For the most part the book really held my attention. i didn't want to put teh book down. i kept telling telling my self just one more chapter, but i ended up reading 3 more chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I learned how to kiss a long time ago-Mama.\\"","review":"Great Movie!

I've used for many projects already (roughly 12 or so), and I still have 7/8 of the can left.

However, good luck finding a compound that won't stain everything, as I have yet to find one that works this well and does not.

Couldn't get the soot off with soap and water and figured I would buy new tail pipes. Found out they were $130 a piece and went looking for a good cleaner instead. Found recommendations online for this product and bought it at an auto parts store. Rubbed it on with terry cloth until black was transferred to the cloth (throw terry cloth away after use). Then wiped it clean with a micro fiber towel (wash micro fiber towel after use) and viola! Saved $260 in new tail pipes expenditure. Now, because the tail pipes hadn't been cleaned in 4 years, there are some tiny specks of black soot that wouldn't come off but I do believe they will come off when I give it a second cleaning in a few months.

Not anymore, though, because this works so well that after I replace the cartridge I don't have to think about it until it's time to change it again.We have two cats, and the Scoop Free holds up just fine with all of their traffic.

I've tried all kinds of automatic litter boxes and this one is the absolute best. I have one cat and she has no problem using it. In fact, she likes to watch the rake go back and forth when it's cleaning. One litter tray lasts about 4 weeks then it starts to smell. Super easy clean up, take the old one out put the lid on it from the new one and into the trash, never even had to see the mess. I also have three dogs who like to get into the box and with the automatic cover they can't access the cats waste.

I have 1 cat and as far as not having to change the litter for 20-30 days seems to be hard to do. About 15 days after the litter has been being used the oder seems to over come you and I need to change the litter box. Changing the litter is definitly a snap. If you are like me, I was tired of cleaning the litter box everyday and this takes care of that everyday chore which I love. I just wish the litter box replacements were a little cheaper, other than that I am pretty well pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 10 months, messy and stinky","review":"We have multiple boxes in our home with two mature cats.

He is 8 years old, and has IBD, for the first couple of weeks he wouldn't voluntarily go into it, but if he was placed in it he would then use it...lolThe reasons that I'm not giving a 5 star review are more personal reasons than the actual performance of the litter box - Due to my cat's inflammatory bowel disease his feces is frequently softer than for most cats, so sometimes it gets stuck in the rake as it goes through the cleaning cycle. The other issue I have is that The hood that came with is too short / low for my cat - He is a very tall, long cat and he weighs 23 pounds.Overall: yes, I like it and would order it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure it works, but NOT as advertised!","review":"My wife and I have two cats (and a yellow lab :p)... we tried the scoopfree - deluxe for a few months before we gave up on it and gave it to goodwill.We have two typical not-fat cats who are fed a high quality dry cat food.

I was pleased with the machine for the 1st 5 months of ownership, however, the past month the rake stopped flipping over and began to leave bare \\"tracks\\" in the litter. When I contacted ScoopFree I was told to change litter trays because the ones sold at my local Petsmart were not made for this box. The problem with that argument is that they are the same litter trays I'd been using for 5 months! They did not offer anytime of refund or replacement. I was told that the litter triggered the rake to flip over. Problem here is that more litter = more mess. Do not waste your money on this product! I'm now stuck with a very expensive manual cat box.

The rave reviews I read here encouraged me to give it a try. The cardboard replacements really total up, so we purchased the plastic bottom box. It's pricey, too at $60. but cheaper than monthy cardboard price. The crystal litter is much more expensive than the scoopable litter. The manufacturer states you need to clean it 1X per month. If you hold off that long the stench is awful! So you end up changing it with expensive litter. And those darn crystal litter bits crunch underfoot and are a hassle. The system works. But I recommend the other automatic litter box company.

It was easy to set up, but I was surprised how loud the sound of motor was - I thought the cats might not take to it. I decided to switch cold turkey on them and hope for the best. Max (the male) took to it right away with no issues. Squeaker (the female) would use it but would run and hide when the rake motor kicked in. After a week, she was fine. She still can't figure out where the noise is coming from, but now she watches the rake instead of running from it.I get about 3 wks from each cartridge, but my cats are small. (My friend gets about the same life but with one large cat.) Absolutely no odor and no leakage problems. I slide out the old one and slide in the new. I don't dread changing the litter anymore. It's great! My only complaint is that the litter is sticky when wet and i find crystals on floor.

I have to change the litter tray once a week instead of once a month, as the ad indicates. The urine soaks through the paper trays and smells. The crystal litter doesn't get the opportunity to help extract the liquid (and thus the smell) from the feces as it is scooped under a paper hood where it is out of sight, but not out of mind (or smell). The trays are incredibly expensive compared to bag litter, even Fresh Step's crystal litter bags. The rake needs to be realigned on a regular basis. It is expensive, annoying and not worth its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will wind up costing you more than the most expensive brand!!!","review":"We have tried several different types of cat boxes, both auto and manual.

Cats usually don't mind them, but they can be expensive until you start using 4gal trash bags so you don't have to replace the expensive receptacles all the time. The Scoop machine here was the biggest, messiest, most expensive(to maintain) of any of the auto cat boxes we've ever used.

At any rate, it was smelly in my apartment, with 2 cats- this box really handled the biz-ness...terds, urine and all. One cat who is younger than a year old, still after 30 days goes to watch it do its cleaning thing everytime it comes on. Its a little louder than I expected, but I really can't complain, because of how much time and sanity it is saving me.

I would give it 100 stars if possible!I have two older cats, who I was concerned if they would take to it, but both started using the box right away without any problems. One of the cats has bowel problems, and tends to be pretty smelly when he uses a litter box. He is also very finicky about the litter box being clean, and will go elsewhere if it is not up to his liking. The Scoop Free Self-Cleaning Litter box has solved both of these problems. The bad smells are gone and so is the problem of cleaning the litter box, the box does that for you!Another problem that this litter box has resolved is the sneaking of \\"treats\\" from the litter box by my dog (Some people know what I'm talking about...really disgusting). Now the litter box rakes the cat \\"treats\\" away and deposits them out of doggie's reach!I simply cannot go on enough about this wonderful product!

We had to finally cut off access to the old litter box (which we weren't cleaning to encourage our cat to make the switch), because he didn't seem to be getting the hint. Now he uses it without a problem. The only reason I rate it a four is he was definitely not enthusiastic about the switch.What is funny is when the rake starts, he runs over to the litter box and watches it with great interest. After it stops, he paws at the rake tentatively, trying to figure out what the deal is. Doesn't seem to stop him from using it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"After reading through many, many of the over 500 reviews, I decided to try the ScoopFree litter box, since anything would be better than scooping cat litter every day and the smell.I really tried to have an open mind, some people are going to like it and some not so much.Well, the first problem is that the \\"tray\\" it pushes the poop to doesn't really seal. And the more poo in there, the worse the smell gets. As you can imagine, as a few days go by, I had to open that \\"tray\\" thing and get the poo out of there! The next insurmountable problem is that the rake started bringing the poo back out of the tray that it had just pushed in, and leaving it behind where the rake parked after sweeping the crystals.So my ScoopFree is sitting next to the box I bought in it from Petco, and will be returned today.I bought the Littermaid Elite 900 -- which didn't get near the good reviews ScoopFree has -- so it will be interesting to see how that one does.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitty Litter box","review":"I bought this after reading the review.

I was so dissapointed to find out that in just one week the tray had to be changed. It smelled so bad. So bad! I tried it out for 2 mths hoping something would change. I even mixed the litter once in a while like some recommended. The concept is great and it does scoop the poop to a separate compartment but the urine just stays on the bottom of the tray. I have two cats and one of them drops bombs sometimes but for this price I think it should last longer than a week. A friend recommended it and he has one cat and he loves it. Maybe its best for one cat that doesn't really go to the bathroom? Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it ... but please read","review":"Ok - this is one of those amazing products that actually does EXACTLY what it says it will do!! 5 stars from me - odorless, easy to use - a no brainer!

The motor makes a humming sound when the rake runs and the end lifts up to scoop poop into - this freaked out my cats! My advise to anyone buying this is to let the cats get used to it for a couple of weeks before plugging it in. We kept ours unplugged then plugged it in when they were out of the room and let it run the rake through. Also, order the Forever Tray (sold on amazon) and buy the Mimi Crystal Litter from Wal-Mart (recommended by the Forever Tray people) and it becomes much more affordable.

When the scooper cycles and moves the soiled litter to its box on the end, the odor that comes out as it lifts up, scoops litter in and then closes down, will about knock you over. So much for odor free, and I'm trying to keep clean because my house is for sale. I didn't have as much lingering smell from the scoopable clay litter I was using. I found a round litter pan at Petco, and have gone back to the regular litter I was using. And my cats are happier. They didn't like the noise this product made raking back and forth.

If the price of the replacement trays was half of what it is (and I really can't see why it couldn't be, it's just cardboard) then I would recommend it but as it is I'll have to go back to scooping manually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Avoid! More odor and work than traditional litter boxes.","review":"This is a very poor product. What you are buying is a cardboard box that holds the disposable litter tray cartridge that you must buy for the \\"Automated System\\" to work. Urine will soak through the bottom of the cardboard tray within 2 days and I have 1 cat! The company wants you to stir the litter around every day so the cat urine will soak up in the crystals. I bought this \\"Automated System\\" so I didnt have to tend to a litter box every day. I tried stiring the litter every day and urine still soaked through the bottom of the cardboard litter tray. How pathetic! Maybe the system might be a little better if the trays were made out of plastic rather than cardboard?? Avoid this system all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get the cats to use the box","review":"I had the highest hopes for this box & I have to say that the design is rather ingenious. I can't comment on the wet bottom issues that users descibe as I never got the kitties to even give the box a try. I think if I had it to do over again, I would *first* switch the cats to crystal litter *then* introduce the new box. I think both at once was just too much. On a very positive note, the company was remarkable about refunding all my money for the box and the unused cartridges. I was very impressed -- just sent them my Amazon invoices, they mailed me UPS return labels, and then sent a full refund check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Horrible Execution","review":"I purchased this product based on all the glowing reviews, thinking it would change my life, too...used it for 3 days and it went in the dumpster today...what a waste. It WAS easy to set up and my two kittens took to it right away, but the odor and tracking was just intolerable. The biggest problem was that solid waste invariably wound up behind the rake, which meant I had to clean that...a far more painful task than dealing with my old-fashioned litterbox. The door to the waste trap came down onto the waste without securing it inside. The whole thing was a disaster. Finally, there seems to me to be no reason not to manufacture this product with a plastic (i.e. permanent) tray and have the pet owner use their own litter/crystals. Their refill system is unecessarily expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with ScoopFree","review":"I have used the ScoopFree Litter Box for over one month now and I am very pleased with it. My cat did not have any problems with switching from her litter box to the ScoopFree. I was tired of constantly scooping the old litter box so the dog would not get in it and keeping it clean so the cat would use it. But this product has solved both of these problems for me. I did not want to spend the money to get a automatic litter box, but now I can say it was money well spent!! I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but pricey refills...","review":"I have a scoopfree litterbox. It works well but with 2 cats you are lucky if you can get more than a week out of the refill. Moving the crystals around manually once in a while helps to extend the life. I have even bought some extra crystals to add in to try and get 2 weeks out of the refill. At $16 a pop you are looking at $60 a month just to fill it. I thinking about going with a litter maid so I can just buy litter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love this product. My cats took to it right away. All I had to do was leave the nasty dirty box around for a few days. It took no time for my two cats to choose the clean, fresh box. I will say I was a little concerned when I saw one of my cats staring into the box while it was raking a mess away, but it has not deterred him. I love the easy clean up, and the cost of the cartridges is little more than what I spent before on bulk litter. A few more dollars a month for a fresh, non-smelly, easy to manage litter box is well worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps litter box cleaner than I can","review":"The first week I was so amazed with this item and how it neatly tucked away our cats' poop. The cats seemed to love it as well as they enjoyed a litter box that was cleaner than I could keep it. However, if you stick to the disposable trays it can be very costly. Maybe that's just the case for us as we have two cats and they go through it quicker. For us a tray lasts 7 to 10 days but no more than that because the grate doesn't scoop up the pee as well as it does the poop. So, we go through about 3 trays per month, which is a lot of cardboard and litter which keeps me from giving this item a fifth star. However, replacing the tray is very easy. I'm considering ordering a permanent tray in the meantime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works inconsistently!","review":"The motion detector on this system is not very good. Even if my cats spend a fairly long time in the tray doing their business, the motion detector only trips the scooper sometimes (the light blinks while they're in the tray, indicating that the motion sensor knows they are there, but once they've gone it's supposed to keep blinking until the poop has dried and it auto-scoops. Instead it stops blinking when the cats leave the tray and it never scoops). It has gone for days not detecting the cats, then might work once. In the meantime, the tray has gotten full of poop. When it does work, it's pretty good, but after 2 weeks (with 2 cats) it stinks! And I've had to scoop out the poop at least every 4th day to keep it from getting overly full (it has a very small 'reservoir' for the old poop).I'm not impressed. I don't have to scoop every day, but I do have to push the button myself to make it work, so it isn't useful for the long weekends away I'd hoped it would be great for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litter box not all its crapped up to be!","review":"Spent too much for this. Refills needed every 2 weeks- at least. Depends on number of cats! Refills are not cheap and only found at big pet store chains. But I'm not scooping the litter everyday anymore, that is the only good thing about this litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - for about a month","review":"We were happy with our ScoopFree litter box for about a month until the rake rusted. From there on out, everything stuck to the rusted rake. The box also trapped all the smell (both under the area where everything gets scooped into & on the back where the rake was), so no matter how many times you cleaned it, it still smelled dirty. Also, we ended up having to change the litter once every week and a half (we have 2 cats), so it became cost prohibitive. Pair that w/ the stench, and ours ended up in the garbage & we returned to traditional litter."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR DESIGN","review":"I bought this when the Forever litter tray was available. Just after that, the company that makes the litter box, went to court to keep the Forever tray from being produced and sold. As a result, all you can buy for this are their disposable boxes which are VERY expensive and LEAK. Who wants to have cat pee on their floors, that's the whole reason we have litter boxes, to keep it off our floors. SO, the product should either be updated to have a longer lasting leak proof tray available (the producers have NO PLANS to make the tray available themselves.) Or, the disposables should at the very least should not leak. VERY POOR PRODUCE - I would have given it no stars if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I have this litter box.","review":"I have two cats and been using this litter box for two years now. It does what it claims to do. To cut the cost down, I recently bought a permanent tray on e-bay and switched to those blue litter from Fresh Step. They are basically the same crystals provided in the more expensive refills from Scoop Free. Half a bag of this Fresh Step lasts almost a good two weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but still a few design flaws...","review":"This litter box is one of the better I have tried, but it could use improvement. The two key problems are the cartridges and the level of noise. The cartridges, even with the current changes, still leak badly. Fortunately, I was prepared for that and placed a bag underneath the unit. It is also not has quiet as advertised. It scared one of my cats, when she heard it from across the room, and now it has been a chore to get her to use it again. The smell is maintained well, but with two cats I need to buy a cartridge a week. Hopefully, the forever cartridges from the internet will reduce some of this cost. Overall it is still the best I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I purchased this litter box for my two average sized cats a few months ago. The product works fairly well but I have some major issues with it. First the claims for the lifespan of the cartridges are incorrect. I can use a cartridge for about 7-9 days. So I use about four a month which costs about $40 a month. I'd rather spend the money on something else. The litter box requires a specific amount of light to work which is very annoying as far as placement. I have to leave a light on most of the day and it's in front of a window! The litter is almost exclusively available on the internet and not cheap. I haven't had too many problems with function and am still using the box. I tried using a conventional box along with it and the cats quit using the automatic box. So I'm not sure I made a wise investment and I'm still paying every month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great product","review":"I was really impressed with this product the first week I had it and thought it was great that I would never have to scoop cat litter again. Then one of my cats had looser stools for a while and this product is not effective in that situation at all. I had to switch back to regualar scoopable cat litter for a while. At first I just changed the tray, but the problem wasn't over and I had to change it again the next day. At $15 for a new tray, that could get very costly. Now I always keep some regular litter for a backup. I still really like this litter box, I just wish it could handle looser stool better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I purchased this product during a black friday sale and my cats have been using the litter box for about a month now. Luckily they took right too it. And it is a lifesaver. With 2 cats, we were scooping every day and changing the litterbox every 4 or so days. Now, I change the tray every 13 or 13 days without trouble.The only downside is you need to make sure that you wipe down the sides and rake with every tray replacement because sometimes the mess can leave traces, but it is a small inconvenience compared to all of the time that was spend changing the old litter box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our house smells much better now..!","review":"There are so many good things about this device I don't know where to start so I'll just tell you the best.

Literally! After two days! First let me say that I have two cats and they aren't very stinky. So, I was surprised after day one of the transition (it took me a week to train them to this new box) to walk into my apt to smell poop and the next day to smell urine coming from the box... strong urine as if no odor control. I think the crystal litter is mainly to blame - I was using the premium blue crystals made for this box. Also, the compartment that the poop scoops into (when it worked) isn't completely airtight.. perhaps this causes odor to escape? I had the timer on 20 minutes so the litter should have had time to work it's magic (as I read in another review). I said \\"when it worked\\" because one day it fell short of scooping the poop into the compartment for some reason. After two weeks I had to return the box. The idea is great but not the smell!

I purchased the hood with it and have had it set up for 2 weeks. With two cats, there is absolutely no odor! My adult cats took very quickly to the new box. For the first few days I would sprinkle some of their regular litter to help them learn. I left the old box up until they were comfortable with this new one.There are a few drawbacks (that's why it's a 4):Size-this is very large, I had to place in the bathroom for plug in. But with the lid on, it's not not offending and once again, no smell!Noise-it is a bit loud when cycling. The first few nights it woke me up (bathroom not far from bedroom) but now I don't notice it anymore.Price-the refills are expensive, so I just ordered a Forever litter pan from e-bay.

I ended up going out and buying the litermaid box again. This box does not keep up enough with multiple cats, when a cat had a bowel movement I could smell it through out the house. The cost of upkeep was too high. I was buying a refill box every week, that was running me $80 a month to upkeep."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only they didn't break after a year","review":"I loved this product. I have two large cats and this worked beautifully. I changed the cartridge every two weeks, which took me less than 5 minutes, and that's it. It stopped odors very well and tracking was minimal. I am now having to throw away my second unit based on the fact that after a year the rake no longer works automatically. It only cycles when I press the button which completely eliminates the convenience of only having to think about it once every two weeks. For as much money as the cartridges cost, it's not worth it.After having the same problem, at roughly the same time for two units, I'm not willing to sink any more money into this product. I wish that the manufacturers would make this a heartier unit and I'd get another, but for now I'm going back to the old standards as none of the techno options seem to keep up their end of the \\"bargain\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the lot except for a few crucial mistakes","review":"I've been searching for an auto litter box for a month now.

They should have included a reusable tray- the poop collection area is too small and the gaps are too big, poop-jerky has a super potent odor!- unfortunately the litter would never last 30 days even in the best conditions and with daily mixingThings I loved:- excellent and ingenious design of the raking system, flawless- simplicity- for the ultra model: the counter for monitoring of cat activity during the day- the perfect fit of the solid hood- the long cord- the build quality, not fragile at all unlike every Littermaid product that exists- the very quiet operation"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"I have been using the ScoopFree Litterbox for over 8 months now, and it is the most disgusting pan I have every owned.

They soak up the urine but just stay drenched and smelly. It doesn't even get a chance to work on the poop, as it's pushed under the lid after 20 minutes. This things is going in the dumpster.

So good, in fact, there isn't any smell at all standing right next to the catbox.But occasionally there's a stinker, so you'll need to use the good ol' pooper scooper.

I would have taken it apart right away, but I wanted to give it a chance to work. The smell of the urine combined with the crystals is way worse than straight cat urine.

Just to clarify, I have one cat in good health standing. I do not want to imagine how the area was going to smell if I did not scoop the waste and even the wet crystals on a daily basis.Second, I used the box for 4 months only (and then gladly threw it away) but during that time I had 3 leak accidents.

They claim that one tray should last with a small cat for 20-30 days...not so true. Also, the rake just seems to break up solid waste and mix it in with the crystals so the cat tracks poop and litter out of the box constantly. Mechanically I haven't had any problems with it, but unless you want to spend the money to replace the trays every week at about $15/tray and be constanly bathing a cat to get the feces off of them I would definitely not recommend this product.

I followed the instructions and placed the Scoop Free Litterbox next to one of the regular litter boxes that my cats use. Within 2 days, my cats started using the Scoop Free litterbox and dissed the old one. They seem to really like the crystals, which efficiently absorbs odors. I have had to clean the rake about once a week, but I have 8 cats using two of these (along with several more conventional litterboxes), so that's not bad. Every time a cat steps in the box and does its thing, the timer resets giving enough time for the crystals to dry out any fecal matter so that it rakes into the container without sticking. I also purchased the mat which catches the crystal litter on my cats' feet. Although I liked it initially, I no longer use it. It is difficult to keep clean and also some of my cats, whom shall remain nameless, have urinated on it. Now I just sweep daily any loose litter that is tracked out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was trying to find something to make taking care of the cats easier! This isn't it. Doesn't control odor. Not everything gets pushed into the catch tray and gets pushed to the back. Messes stick to the the dragging mechanism. After three weeks and going through two trays I threw it all away. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scoop Free","review":"I purchased the Scoop Free about a month ago. I have two cats who took to it right away. The cartridges do not last as long as I would hope. I have the one with the counter and it lasts about 65 cycles or 7-8 days before it starts to smell. I got this to replace the litter maid which I was always cleaning because the feces was always getting stuck in the rake and then litter would all get pushed into a pile which would then cause it to stop working and plus the regular litter would track all over the house. The Scoop Free is definitely better, there is some tracking, but nothing compared to traditional litter and I have not had the rake get stuck even once. The refills do add up, but the time saved and not having litter tracked through the house is worth it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS!!!! don't buy it!!!","review":"is not fair that i have to give this product 1 star, it should get none!!we got this litter box because i got pregnant and my doctor told me not to clean my cats' litter box, so it sounded like a good idea... we tried it for a month and we're returning it because of the smell... the refill doesn't last a month like they say, we've been changing it every week, but before the end of the week all the nausea and throwing up from the pregnancy is being triggered by the stinky crystals, and as a bonus, the trace of the crystals is all over my carpet!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a good product!","review":"After purchasing three automatic litter boxes from another company - all of which broke down in a short time - I purchased a Scoop Free litter box. What a difference. There is virtually no odor. The motor is adequate for the job it has to do and is reasonably quiet. The cartridges are expensive but worth every penny. I am so grateful for this product and hope I have not jinxed myself by saying how great it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but you still need to scoop","review":"This is definitely the best litter box I've ever owned, but don't be fooled into thinking you can go weeks or even days without scooping. I still need to scoop the #2 either daily or every other day to keep it from smelling. It just collects in the back of the box under the flap, but that can't hold all the smell in. I would recommend this product, just don't think you can get away with only maintaining it weekly or monthly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, Great customer service!!!","review":"We have had many littermaids and such over the years. Never lasting more than a year. No smell and worked great until it died this week. We had incredible customer service when we called. Great warranty for this product. No accusations of poor maintenance or difficulty. When this new one goes out of warranty, we will be happy to buy another in our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under deliver","review":"This litter box is great at cleaning the box, that's about it. A cartridge with one cat only last you 2 weeks. After that things go haywire. After 2 weeks cat box made our house smell. On the 3rd week litter would pile up. Sometimes on the third week the litter would be too much and it would be pulled out of the reserve.Basically, unless you plan to spend $30 bucks a month on litter don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longer lasting litter cartridge would make it perfect","review":"I have had Littermaid & Purforma and with all the problems of clogged rakes, burned out motors, plastic parts breaking in less than 2 weeks use, I was ready to go back to a plain litterbox. I started using crystal litter and then found the Scoopfree Litterbox. I have been using it for about a month now with no problems and the rake evens out the \\"piles\\" made from the digging & covering. I have a large male who has no problem using it, in fact there is actually more room than the others. With 2 cats, the cartridge lasts about 10 days and so far, that is the only problem with this litterbox. It is always dry & fresh and is certainly making my life a lot easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"It realy smells Bad!","review":"I recently purchased a new scoop free litter box and the 3 pack of of litter refills. After only 6 days ( we have one cat) the odor is so bad it permeates the whole house. Even removing some of the poop litter, the crystals give off such an odor it is terrible. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recomend this to anyone. It is terrible!Yes,the rake works to remove the poops but the urine smell stays in the crystals. I never had this much odor using a regular maual litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse then a littermaid, buy a litter robot!","review":"I have 2 cats and this is by far the worse smelling cat box I have ever had. It also made one of my cats start pissing on the carpet. This is very expensive in the long run if you have more then 1 cat. Search for a litter robot instead. It is by far the best cat box I have ever owned and will save you a ton of money in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and is low maintenance!","review":"I've owned this litter box for several months and am very happy with it. The rake pushes the poop into the holding area and the crystals stay in the main section. I haven't seen any poop stuck to the rake, probably because the box doesn't run the rake until 20 minutes later. By that time most of the poop should be dry enough not to stick like I've heard the LitterMaid brands do. The box is located in our basement so if there is any noise I don't hear it. The cats are happy with it as well so I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others. If you decide to buy it, definitely look into purchasing the Forever Litter Tray to go with it (also available here on Amazon). This will save you money as the Forever Litter Tray is made of plastic instead of the expensive cardboard replacement ones. With the plastic tray you only need to empty it, wipe it out a bit, then pour more crystals in. It's much cheaper than buying the whole replacement cardboard set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend","review":"I like the design and the function of this product. It is extremely quiet. Unfortunately, I have to agree with other reviewers who said that the box smells long before a month is up. In my case, I noticed the smell within a few days, and I replaced the cartridge. My cat hates these crystals, and the fact that she can't cover up what she does. She actually appears to be depressed,crying constantly and showing no interest in her playtime. This also happened when I previously tried switching to a very high-end automatic litter box. In that case, the design was so totally different from any litter box (and so small), I think her unhappiness was with the design. Also, the crystals scatter more than the scoopable litter.I had no odor problems with the scooping litter, and I guess I will have to give up on automatic litter boxes. Dealing with the cleaning doesn't bother me so much, but it bothers the people who \\"cat sit\\" when I'm away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Expensive, but Works Pretty Well","review":"The system seems to work pretty well. The cartridges are INCREDIBLY expensive, and the estimates of how frequently you'll have to change them are generous. I've two cats, and the product recommends changing the cartridge every 10-15 days. 15 days is FAR too long to wait, which makes this even more expensive. For my cats, it costs about $45 a month just for litter cartridges. Worth it? Totally depends on you.But, that said, the cartridges are easy to change, though i spilled dirty litter everywhere when i tried to put one in a trash bag. And the cartridge refills did not come with disposal bags like they'd advertised. The cats love it. It's pretty quiet. So far, no jams. Waste does occasionally get stuck to the rake, which sucks. It mostly doesn't smell, but towards the end, the urine smell gets pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scoop Free Review","review":"This item works well usually, but sometimes when the cat re-enters the box it doesn't work. You have to start it manually which is easy as pushing the button. Much better than sccoping out a litter box everyday and no odors so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Cats, 2 Weeks, 1 Tray & NO SMELL!","review":"This box ROCKS! I am totally satisfied and highly recommend the Scoop Free system!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its ok","review":"well, i was so excited when i first bought this cuz i'm at work all freakin day and my poor kitty is all my himself in his room and i just dont have time or energy to clean the litter box at the end of a long day. so i plugged it in and after two weeks..the smell started coming...b/c the trays are so expensive i really wished it would have lasted longer but after 3 weeks it was unbearable! i had to buy a new tray (petsmart $15.99) is the cheapest i could find. so, it doesnt last a month, sorry guys...after two weeks it stinks, but you can cover it up by spreading the crystals over the space that the little hood leaves (the poops starts to lift up the little cardboard hood)so i mean its cool that its so clean, but the smell just kills you after 3 weeks.pricey..is it worth it? there's not better alternative so..a forced yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm very disappointed with this product. I've had the box for five months. Two cats. One of my cats will go on the carpet if the litter tray is more than five or six days old. In the 5 months I've had this, I have averaged one litter tray every 12 days. That's VERY expensive. The odor is worse than my previous automatic box (from another company).I tried using clumping sand litter but it doesn't keep clean because the rake only moves horizontally, so the clumps stick to the rake and don't drop in the receptacle area.The only thing good about this unit is that it's easy to change litter.I would not recommend this unit to anyone except if you are physically unable or unwilling to ocassionally clean the litter tray in other units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Love It, But Definitely Has Problems","review":"I bought one of these for my 2 cats and also purchased the plastic re-usable tray, also sold on Amazon.com. The rakes work fairly well, although matter can get stuck on it and also behind it, which is annoying. Also, the rakes grab a bunch of the crystals that are new and clean and drag them back, also behind the rakes. Then you have to lift up the whole unit and pull them back into the tray, repeatedly. Also, I didn't find it suitable for 2 cats - I had to change the litter very frequently, negating the savings in cost. It seems like the litter is not deep enough, so it doesn't last very long. All in all, it wasn't worth the cost/hassle/continuous odor and we're back to regular scoopable litter, which is deep enough to bury everything and not keep us out of the laundry room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Litter Box","review":"This litter box is so much better than my old one. If a person wouldn't want to buy this, I'd at least recommend changing over from regular litter to crystals. It is SO much cleaner/nicer. This litter box is not odorless- I have it in a semi-confined place. But, it is much much much less smelly than the regular litter box. The only thing I hate is when it's 3 am and I hear the thing's mechanical moan as it sweeps itself clean. Other than that, I really have no complaints. I got the LT1-3 refills which have an extra plastic lining inside to reduce soaking through (which hasn't happened to me yet). If it wasn't all so expensive, I'd be happier. Regardless, I am glad that I purchased this litter box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"This is the first auto scoop litter box we have owned. We searched the internet before we bought and found this one had the best reviews and they were so right. We have mutiple cats so we purchased three plus the hoods. Our cats, even the finicky ones, love them. It is funny watching them when the raking system goes on. We are so happy we bought them and urge anyone considering one to go ahead and get one because they will not be disappointed. There is absolutely no smell from the litter boxes now. Probably one of the best kitty purchases we have made. There is some noise when it rakes but it is not annoying at all. Five stars are not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest","review":"I've had my two Scoop Free litter boxes for three months. They're the best thing that's ever happened. They really work. I bought them after researching all the ones on the market. There is no odor and no mess. Since I have my apartment on the market, this is essential. I change the cartridges every two weeks (and have two boxes) because I have two large cats (18 and 14 pounds and a smaller 6-pounder). The cats adapted immediately. The little one (a very active 18-month-old) is fascinated. He hops in and out frequently to watch them work, so they also serve as an entertainment center for a rambunctious teen-ager. I wish they had been available years ago, after 30 years as an indoor-cat owner"},{"rating":"2","title":"how do I love thee, litterbox...","review":"Started using this box as the \\"downstairs\\" box for 2 cats on Christmas day. It was the preferred box by MLK day. By the end of Jan. the \\"upstairs\\" box is seldom used. I was a bit concerned when it took 3-5 days to get the kitties using it, but now its a hit. I haven't had the troubles with leakage, but I do keep plastic underneath just in case. I'm still getting the hang of the duration of time between box changes. It looks like every 16-18 days for my cats. I get the replacement litter from Amazon using Prime and have been 100% satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but has problems","review":"I have two cats and have to change the box at least once a week because the coated cardboard box the litter is in gets soaked through. I also have not found a mat to put in front of it that works effectively to stop the litter crystals from being spread ALL over the house. And they hurt when you step on them barefoot!I'm going to hold on to it in hopes they fix the box but am replacing it for now. It really does work great as far as the self cleaning part goes. It just costs to much to change it so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Litter box","review":"I love the fact that this setup makes a litter box clean and dust free.

We are a two cat household, ages 4 & 8 yrs, one of the cats was seeking out \\"alternate\\" sites, ie clothing on floor, laundry baskets left out, etc more and more frequently over the past year. Previously had another automatic litter device that they had used for several years without problem. Going into our 3rd month with this litter box and no accidents. We also get less litter scattered about, and it's much easier/cleaner to change than previous automatic litter box, overall just cleaner. We get about 2 to 3 weeks per tray with 2 cats. Very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my cats","review":"With two cats the litter tray lasted five days before the crystals were saturated and sticky and the whole box smelled like urine. This was very disappointing considering the advertised 10-15 days for two cats. The scooping mechanism was quiet and worked great (except some sticking/rust on the comb), however the poop tray was full and smelly in only about 3 days, so I had to scoop it out by hand. Finally after 3 months, one cat gave up on the crystal litter entirely and began urinating around the box. As soon as I went back to the clumping litter box this stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Great idea but it doesn't work very well.

I HATE scooping litter. It is my least favorite chore. It works well, my cat took to it very quickly, and I don't think it's too noisey. It's downstairs, so I'm usually not around when it does its job, but when I'm downstairs, it doesn't seem too loud. The price of the litter cartridges is totally worth it for me. $15 for not having to scoop is a bargain.OK, still works great! No problems with leaking. I have 2 cats, but just one uses it. I have never had a leaking problem. Maybe my cat likes to go in different spots though. I now get the cartriges online for cheaper than what I was paying at the local pet store ($18)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cats pleasure","review":"Only have used for about a month now,but seams to be doing a great job taking care of keeping the work down on changing the litter box.

They started using it right away, along with their other litter boxes in the house. The mechanics of the machine worked nicely, turning on around twenty-minutes after the cat had left the box.Unfortunately, I was sold on the line that this box was odor free. It is not odor free! After two days it stunk worse than their other litter boxes. Poop got stuck in the metal wire scappers, and it filled the small box at the bottom of the machine in less than a week. There is no odor control in the bottom box, poop just sits in there stinking until it drys completely. Needless to say, this box is heading out to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks","review":"I have one 3 lb. kitten.The box and hood are great and the kitten likes the litter.

I've purchased the forever tray from ebay and am buying the litter separately to try to cut down on the cost. It's still an expensive option. The crystal litter does work better than clay litters at controlling odor. If you have the time to scoop daily, crystal litter in a regular box would be the way to go.

It took some changing around in the house as to where it was going to get used. If the old kitties could they would use the old boxes the younger kitties adapted quicker. We have 6 cats now and the clay litter would get stinky fast. After about 3 moves I think I have figured out the good places for these boxes. I bought two and I have two old boxes, they are beginning to use the Scoop Free much more than in the beginning, they seem to use it more for urinating than pooing, but that's okay because sometimes the rake does get stuck with poo, but most of the time its fine.

I have 2 cats at home which use this litter box. One refill scoopfree box with crystals only lasts about 5 days before it is full and should be replaced. The manufacturers instructions say it should last 15 days with 2 cats. The refills are costly at $20 each, and even with mixing in scoopable cat litter it is not enough. I wish I could return it, it is very expensive and does nothing to help hide the smell like the old covered one would do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"On the front of the box, along with all the other great Scoop Free attributes, are the words \\"whisper quiet motor.\\" Well, the motor itself may be that quiet, but the rest of the moving parts make enough noise to wake the dead.When the rake moves back and forth in its track, it's quite noisy. But what's even worse, as the rake moves, it twice changes its angle by flipping in its track. As it does so, it makes a VERY loud clunk. Maybe if you live in a house and stick the litter box in the basement, that's fine. But if you're in a one bedroom apartment, there is no avoiding that sound in the middle of the night.Secondly, the instructions tell you to place the Scoop Free unit near the old litter box until your cat(s) become acclimated to it. Given its large footprint, however, that may not be practical. Also, many people keep their litter boxes in the bathroom; in its instructions, the Scoop Free recommends against that because of the humidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for me","review":"We have to have the litter box in the apartment, can't put it outside, and this one didn't work for us.

We have 2 cats and change the refills (so new litter) every two weeks. No matter what we do, our house smells like a litter box.

My 2 cats were absolutely terrified of the noise that the motor makes when it rakes so it took a little coaxing to even get them to use the thing. Once they were finally using it the litter tray lasted a little less than a week before it started leaking. There was cat pee everywhere. The cardboard poop tray was also damaged by urine and so was not so good at keeping the poop smell out. The litter is terrible and tracks everywhere! The system is such a let down. I am going to return it to the manufacturer ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a big help for me","review":"I ordered this because I have back problems due to a recent work injury, so bending over to scoop the litter box can be hard for me.

With this, the smell isn't horrible and it's not horribly loud (as other automatic cleaners are). I've heard of other people having issues with poop getting stuck on the cleaning forks. I've not had that problem, since I keep it on the 20 min cycle. The cats are happier with a clean box and my back gets a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money pit!","review":"Cardboard cartridge physically cannot hold liquid for more than a few days.

I have three indoor cats and need to replace the litter every 5 days. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel the disposable system for the trays is wasteful, expensive, and inconvenient in terms of storage. I ordered a 6 pack of the disposable trays, and they are large enough that they are sitting out on my guest bathroom counter right now because I can't find anywhere else convenient to put them. I plan to order the Forever Litter tray to try that out as an alternative. However, even with the disposable trays, if your priority is a clean, fresh, attractive litter box that works well and requires no daily scooping - and you don't mind paying extra for litter - this is well worth it.

The stink is just as bad (no improvement here from our previous basic cat litter box), the rake had poop stuck in it, there were broken up pieces of poop all over the top of the crystals (gross because the cats step on them then run around the house!), and there were already areas where the crystals had been raked away to nothing, so the box underneath was exposed...all after less than 12 hours! It is going back to the store today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It ruined my hardwood floor!","review":"I was loving Scoop Free and using it exactly as instructed to. I have two cats and was changing it twice a month as they recommend for normal healthy cats. The cardboard got some wetness on the bottom after the first two weeks so I cleaned everything up and put a big heavy absorbent bath towel underneath the box after I changed it the first time. Lo and behold I went to change it after another 2 weeks and there's a 1.5 foot long black stain on my hardwood floor! The pee soaked right through the cheap laminated cardboard flooring of the box. So much pee soaked through that it was enough to get through the bath towel and create that large stain on my floor. I am so upset!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"After reading the glowing reviews here, I purchased this product in January of this year through Amazon. At first the box seemed to be doing it's job. However after the first week the whole disgusting mess of crystal litter came to my attention. When the rake scoops it does not scoop the crystals with the pee, only the poop. So basically your cats are throwing around used pee saturated crystals. It gets stuck to their paws etc. My cats also have a tendency to back into a corner to pee, and this leaks from the back. Absolutely disgusting. It smells terrible after about 3 days.With two cats I had to change the box every 8-9 days (this was absolutely max). This is super expensive. I'd rather spend 10 minutes each day to clean the box myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Litter box perfect if traveling.","review":"We went on a 14-day cruise and needed something for our cats to use. We set it up several days before the trip to see how the cats would take to it. Our easy going cat LOVED the litter box. She would run into the bathroom to see it operate. Our pure bred Siamese would hiss at it when it turned on to clear the tray. I am sure if we \\"worked\\" with our Siamese she would eventually use it. We only plan to use it when go on long trips.The litter box was perfect. Worked wonderfully. Made no mess. Did not smell of perfumes. Cleaned up easily when it came time to change the litter tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Pit and Nasty","review":"I've never been inspired to write a review before this, but just had to speak up. I bought this because changing regular litter triggers asthma attacks for me. Seemed like the crystals would be a great idea. NOT.We have one cat. Granted, he's a bit large, and he's senior, so he probably \\"outputs\\" a little than the average feline. But he's normal and healthy.Each tray lasts about 5 days with our one cat. Then the crystals are saturated, the bottom of the tray is swimming, the house stinks and the cat starts to pee on the floor. Stirring the litter does not help. It is not stuck behind the rake. It is not getting scooped into the poop area.Removing the old tray is NASTY - smells like, well an old puddle of pee and the contents is just about sloshing. Ewwww. The smell is about enough to trigger an asthma attack just on pure yuck factor.5 days. $15 per tray. Nasty outcome. Recommend spending money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This litterbox works as advertised. Newer refill cartridges now have a liquid-resistant liner, so the bottoms never get soaked like the old ones used to.After owning ours for a while, the sensor started getting more and more dependent upon bright light in order to operate properly. It got to the point where the sensor light would always blink rapidly as if the sensor was obstructed unless the room was brightly lit. The problem was solved by using a can of compressed air to blow into the two holes on the interior side walls of the litterbox; that's where the sensors are. The compressed air blew away whatever the obstruction was, and the litterbox once again operates smoothly even in a pitch-black room."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disappointed","review":"I read the reviews and I thought it sounded like a great solution. My main reason for purchasing this product was the \\"odor control\\" that it would provide. It doesn't control any odor what-so-ever. It does push the poop to the end of the tray, but the cover doesn't close completely so the odor problem is just like it would be with traditional litter boxes. I'm going to return it.

I am not in advertisting, but rather the unconventional world of insurance. However, I found many interesting ways that someone like me can make a difference in corporate America. While, the author discusses wasteful meetings and strategy teams he suggests that each of us can make a difference by speaking up and trying to convince those around us that we should do a bit more work and a bit less strategizing and meeting. I have been working for about five years and my life has certainly started to resemble the classic film Office Space.

The worst bit is the part about NT. To make a long story short, here is an example of Ludemann's type of \\"reasoning\\": he just lines up a sample of antijewish polemic out of the NT (ignoring completely the context), puts it along with some nasty bits by Eusebius and Luther, and here we go.

The book is generously provided with maps. These maps help to provide clarity to the subject at hand and also greatly increase the reader's understanding of how and why the fur trade developed.I really don't have any quibbles with this book---except that I wished it was longer!

So this is a rare item -- a platform feeder that allows cardinals and grosbeaks, but not squirrels. This feeder is well constructed, but the two small downsides are that it's time-consuming to dismantle to refill the seeds, and it only holds about a pound of seed, so you need to refill fairly often. I use sunflower and safflower seeds in mine.

I wanted something with a roof. It is a very attractive feeder, it is sturdy since it is metal. The only thing difficult in using this feeder is when you fill it. The supports come out of the roof and floor and are not the easiest things to get back into place properly without spilling the seed, however, that difficulty does not deter from the high quality craftsmanship of the overall product.

Never has such a simple design turned into a nightmare to assemble for me. First, I had to drill out one of the roof rod supports in order for it to fit. Then when it came time to fit the four rods to the roof the rods weren't 90 degrees to the platform! Surely we could make these in the USA instead of China for a similar cost!

The Charlie's Angels films were light and fun but McG needed to introduce a bunch of peripheral characters that would have been fine in another film but who cares? I didn't and that was the problem. Bryce Howard gets to walk around with big eyes. Christian Bale gets to play in some over-the-top effects sequences. Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood(sp?) get to have a romance and why do we need this or care? All of these people are extremely talented and again, the effects? More or less spectacular.

Throughout the movie, you can almost see it in his eyes, that he knows how horrible the movie is. By the way he communicates with everyone in the movie, you can almost hear him saying, \\"Why the heck am I in this film? The plot is extremely linear and boring, the script is very poorly written and is even more poorly executed by the actors, and why is my character suppose to be such a wimp? I'm John Connor!

One being that Christian Bale was in this movie, as he is one of my favorite actors, however is performance here was lacking. The second would be the special effects which were very well done. The rest of the movie though basically sucks, as did T3. The rest of the cast sucks, even B.D. Howard, and they give a third rate performance. And the plot? Don't get me started. Where is the continuity here? Fox's \\"The Sarah Connors Chronicles\\" keeps continuity more in line, stemming from T2. T3 sucked so bad that it doesn't even count.

I thought it was pretty good, except for the ending, which I thought was incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"extension\\" with a moving Worthington performance","review":"\\"Terminator: Salvation\\" is a worthy addition to the franchise, featuring great state-of-the-arts special effects, an engaging storyline, and strong performances.Speaking of the latter, Sam Worthington has the more sympathetic part of a man, ripped from his criminal and murderous past to become a heroic figure of the future. Worthington balances \\"butt-kicking\\" with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale's \\"John Conner.\\"\\"Star Trek's\\" Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese, managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely \\"overplayed\\" in the Trek film.Welcome \\"appearances\\" are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the series","review":"I love this movie, It is intense and very action packed.

As long as the Terminator franchise keeps cranking out big adventure I'll keep plunking down my money to watch another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It was a great action film! The plot, actors, character development and directing were all fantastic. It's on the edge of your seat dram and I really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. There were only two things I would have done differently.Fist, there was no humor AT ALL in this film witch was unlike the other T movies and I think it really needed it to cut the tension a bit and that is something I liked about the other T movies, especially T2.The second problem I had was with the end. There was a heart transplant that seemed to come out of nowhere and was so dumb and unrealistic. It also took away one of the main characters that I would have liked to see in the next film.I liked Christian Bail as John but I think Sam Worthington would have made a better John (he played the role of Marcus). The two should have swapped roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE!","review":"I was a bit leery about this entry in The Terminator franchise, but I found this film to both entertaining, but also better than the last installment. I can understand why they wanted to make this film as when the first two were made they either didn't have the money or the FX just weren't up to speed for such a futuristic story. Bale is sort of waste here as this is a sci-fi action film and he really doesn't get to show his chops. That's not to say I don't appreciate an excellent actor to help make the film more convincing. Terminator Salvation is not the best in the series nor the worst, but if you're in the mood for so good sci-fi fun then this might do the trick. I know it did for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO DIGITAL COPY","review":"Don't get fooled by the digital copy claim that is on for this product. It expired in December 2010. Other than that I am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Nothing new happens in this movie. It has plenty of action, mostly in the form of explosions, but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward. The viewer goes out where he came in.Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy plot devices. For example, there are scenes involving the movement of massive, clanking machines, yet characters aren't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline, or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.The movie is riddled with such devices. They play out, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We learn nothing new.My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent film, terrible DVD","review":"I thought Salvation was decent, and I was definitely considering purchasing it when it arrives on DVD...well, not anymore. The DVD version is only coming with the theatrical cut while the Blu-ray is coming with that AND the director's cut. Why? DVD is far from being a dead format. I know the studios and such are trying to promote Blu-ray and whatnot, but there are plenty of other ways to do this. Until the director's cut is available on DVD, no purchase from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terminator Review:","review":"I liked it the shipping was fast the Lossless audio is the best and I am also in sales so I use demo scenes from this movie to sell home audio systems ...must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Connor or Batman","review":"Why do films that come out within 5 years of each other over use the in now hit actor?

Don't go in expecting it to make a lot of sense though. Just sit back, watch and enjoy. And as usual in this series, the Terminator is by far the best character and the one you root for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless Fun","review":"While this is no T2 (the best in the franchise, in my opinion), Salvation is at least better than T3 which was a ham-fest. This provides a different view on the Terminator series in the sense that it does take place in 2018. I went in to this movie with little or no expectations because of the bad reviews and came out pleasantly surprised. It's a decent film. I would (and have) watch it more than once. What this says for my intelligence is questionable (as it seems to be made with someone with a low IQ) but sometimes these mindless-fun popcorn movies end up being the best guilty pleasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-reboot, half-sequel, all-terrible","review":"The Bottom Line:Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.2/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointmentator","review":"I have really liked the the first three movies, even the goofy third. This one was difficult to follow. The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects. However, the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting. It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese, they weren't. Not really. Then, we have the end. I felt it was straining for some deep moral/ethical statement, but just struck me as empty, loose and amateurish. I think it's really time to Terminate this series :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terminator Salvation","review":"Love this movie. Christian Bale is awesome as always. I would have given 5 stars but the storyline btw Sam Worthington and the girl was kind of stupid. Still, this movie is worth owning and watching over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Struggling Series.","review":"T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it's layered with modern themes, awesome action, and inspired performances from Hamilton, Furlong, and Morton. Cameron is a jerk, but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore.Outside of that, Terminator: Salvation stacks yet another mediocre attempt against an otherwise compelling idea. The effects are first class, there are some decent action sequences (well choreographed) but they can't save the plot which is held together with sheep hairs. If you're a fan, you'll find yourself going, \\"what?\\" and \\"I knew it!\\" alternately through the film. But you'll also say \\"that was cool\\" a few times, too. Just don't expect another T2... it's hard to outshine such brilliance, and the Terminator series struggles to meet the bar of regular film offerings with every installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 3 movies great, the 4th an absolute disapointment","review":"Terminator 4 is a disgrace to the Terminator series. The movie does not focus on the war that fans were expected to see. They do explain how John Connor becomes a Leader and he does not show any qualifications as a leader. The whole story focuses on a stupid guy who is considered to be a decommissioned Terminator. Near the end they have this guy talking with a jumbo computer wich is so lame and reminds me of the computer system from \\"I-Robot\\". The Kyle Reese Character is also too young and is extremly wimpy!!! Come on, John Connor is going to send this little guy to go back in the past and do it with his mom? They don't even expain how they send him back through a portal or whatever. Man this movie is totally awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"action ad nauseum","review":"The movie was well made with action, action, and then more action.I couldn't really find a plot or figure out just exactly who the goodguys were until nearly the end of the movie.

The photography is dull. The final battle is too similar T1,T2 and Aliens and quite frankly expected more. I missed Arnold big time. The TV series is far superior.I only managed to watch the directors cut and often the scenes/editing comes off as dull. Bale lacks any form of Charisma and Worthington is actually not required. Moon Bloodgood/Bryce Dallas Howard are wasted here. T3 may have had it's faults but it was far more entertaining than this, and the leads actually had better things to do. This movie reminds me of Mummy 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need to discuss the plot; it's absent","review":"This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins.Confusing and disjointed, frequently frustratingly illogical, it comes out boring, even with allthe well-done CGI mayhem. Said mayhem is non-stop, becoming a mindless blur of disjointedhuman and robot body parts flying nowhere.After the first two in the series, this one is even more of a disappointment, fans should seethis as a continuation of T3; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name.At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $9.99. Small consolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD release is a disaster","review":"Agree with other reviewers. Warner pulled this same stunt with Trick r' Treat (only putting bonus features on the Blu disc). I decided not to buy this dvd because of this. There's no reason at all that the unrated version should not be available on DVD. I understand that DVD cannot match the picture quality or sound that Blu provides, however, DVDs have always been able to support audio commentaries and bonus featurettes and to not put them on the DVD and still charge the same prices is ridiculous. With all the firmware problems on Blu and the fact that my TV does not support HDMI (and I'm not replacing the TV until it breaks). The more that studio pull this garbage the less likely I will ever convert to Blu. In fact, I now hope the Blu format fails in favor of digital downloads for HD (with DVD still being available of course).

The last half of the film had to many things that were taken and repeated from the first two films, and it just seems overally tacky...such as when the terminatior used his dad's voice to find john in the steel stairway are and then we he John tried shooting the guy and loading the gun again, or with the steel and then trying to freze him all of these were taken from T2. The only thing that was orignial and creative about this film was the future termiator who was more human than ever and was the only real likable character in the whole film, which they should have just centered the movie around versus the route they ended up going. This film was alot better than the third film in the installment of films but not by much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's better on Blueray","review":"The blueray picture is always better than the DVD and the extra's are nice as well.

No effort at all was expended on anything beyong stealing your money and wasting your time.The unfathomable star power of Christian Bale, whose last credible performance was the lead in Empire of the Sun, was exploited to the hilt here.

It is so far from the 1984 original version in both spirit and style that it may well be a film totally separate from the Terminator.McG, besides having a ridiculous moniker, is a terrible director. He makes Michael Bay look like an artist.The director does not have respect for the moviegoer with adolescent kids shooting Remmington 870s one-handed, rock music inserted into various scenes, exotic chesty babes with hair cascading from their helmets, 20 story robots sneaking up behind victims, to a megalomaniac actor rehashing his Batman demeanor.

(Christian Bale as John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright) and suprisingly, it works. Thy manage to pull it off without eclipsing each other. Performances were good specially Worthington's even thou Bale did a terrific job as well and Anton Yelchin's performance as Kyle Reese was really believable (This guy also played the Russian genius kid in the new Star Trek). Effects were good, story was enjoyable and interesting. They even throw a couple of nods to the previous terminators that were really cool. All in all, not as era-defining as Terminator 2 but a worthy addition to the series nevertheless.

The storyline is dull and unimaginative, so much so that it's easy to stop paying attention and loose focus in the midst of one spectacular explosion after another. It would have been nice if there was a strong story and the action sequences served to further the story, but sadly this is simply a special effects movie without a good plot.

I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen. That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action. I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.The entire movie is all about the big \`Time Paradox' that brings the \`John Conner' guy into existence. How he sent his father back to his mom. And if he doesn't do this then he will not \`be'. Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing. I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion. Just don't expect any action.

Skip this at all costs if you are a Terminator fan. If you like cheap sci-fi flicks and/or Transformers then this is right up your alley. I only give it 1 star because I can't give it a Zero"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating the dead horse","review":"They should have stopped at T2, but the cash cow can always be milked to death. I loved the first 2, but they went downhill from there. From T1 Kyle Reese said the first terminators had rubber skin, and were easy to spot. In this one they have never even seen a terminator with skin on it, rubber or real.There were many plot holes and really bad cheesiness like\\" Oh his heart cant take it.\\" \\"Then please take mine.\\" So if you like your action dark and hard to see with some big explosions added in. Mix in no plot or characters that you give a rats ass about. Then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst terminator movie","review":"This is the worst terminator movie. How anyone can like it is beyond me 1-3 were good this one was utter crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it (unless it's cheaper to buy it \\"previously viewed\\")","review":"In Mad Max there was a guy named Max, and we got to see some stuff about him, his life, and the world he lives in, and at least some of us came to like him, respect him, and maybe even admire him, so that when his wife and kid get brutally murdered it's not just a random act of violence like we see on TV, or read about in papers every day.The people most responsible for Terminator Salvation do not appear to understand this, and maybe someone should tell them.It's less a film than an ad for action figures.Were there any action figures? I know 7-11 had cups. I doubt they sold very many. And I'm positive they didn't have any 5-story tall terminator machines that could sneak up on people in the middle of an arid wasteland."},{"rating":"1","title":"All action, no heart","review":"People who have grown up with the Terminator franchise go to see these movies not only for the action, but for storyline. In all Terminator movies (yes this includes number 3) except this one, the action is not the driving force in the story, rather a compliment. Perfect example of this is in T2, this movie is not about an awesome liquid metal robot (he is awesome). T2 is about how a machine at times can be more human than us, so this is a character study. That is my big criticism with T4, it is a good action movie but thats it, there is no story. I did not care if John connor lived, and if you don't care if the \\"saviior\\" of mankind lives, than there is something wrong here. I felt as if I was watching someone playing a video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Got this DVD some time ago from Amazon but wasn't able to review it until now.The director's cut is not much different then the regular version but the extras are very nice additions.

And I think Im also going to have to buy a new dvd for more than I paid for this \\"4 in 1 complete clean\\" which at least the laser dvd cleaner probably works, but I needed the disc to be cleaned...honestly, never place your discs on the case is what I learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish there had been measurements","review":"This bracelet is exactly as it appears in the picture and I love that is fair trade.

This album was so bad that I pulled into my driveway, hopped out of the car, opened the garage and dropped this CD right into the trash. It was a disappointment to the point of DISGUST.I LOVE \\"Emotional\\"; therefore, I expected more good material from Carl Thomas. \\"So Much Better\\" was SO MUCH WORSE. The production was bad, the lyrics were bad, and it appears that the worst thing that happened to Carl Thomas was his separation from Bad Boy.My suggestion is that he find some producers he can afford with true talent, STICK TO BALLADS...and never, eva, eva, eva do another record with Baby Cham. Baby Cham is meant for hip-hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"im feelin this....","review":"this is a hot album, wish it would've got a lil more promotion, at least a video....but yea, every song is hot especially \\"Somethin Bout You\\" and \\"Thought You Should Know\\"...PROPS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not by even if its free","review":"I am a huge carl Thomas fan but yet when i found that he had a new album and it wasnt advertised i thought it to be weird. Either way i bought the album because Carl always comes out wit a good album but this was just horrible.... All the songs sounded as if he was talking and the beats he used are not good at all. It should have been known that he is no longer with bad boy records. The label he is with now is just no good and made his album very bad....I wish that i would have not bought it even if it was 10 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl Thomas What About A Refund?","review":"My dad and I listened to the first 4 songs....I immediately thought, \\"Boring...let's throw it out the window!!\\" However, my dad urged me to keep it and when we got home, he pulled out the 12 gauge, shot it, and then burned it and spread it's ashes up and down H1 Highway!!! =o Opppss!!

So Much Better is well worth wait. I've listened to this cd every day since it was released and I still cant get enough. Carl definitely doesnt disappoint on this one. My favorite tracks are \\"If That Aint Love\\", \\"Home\\", \\"Say I Do\\", \\"So Much Better\\", \\"I Miss You\\",...I like the whole damn album and Im sure you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I did not know Carl Thomas was even coming out with a new cd until I heard him on a local radio station. Had no idea that he was not on Bad Boy anymore. When I first bought this cd, at first it was ok. But as I listened to it, it turned out to be very good. Of course it cannot top \\"Emotional and Let's talk about it\\" but overall it's a pretty good cd. Very much worth my ten dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"AweSome","review":"Carl Thomas is another artist who doesn't get the PROPS he deserve. Just like Glenn Lewis, Rashann Patterson, Kenny Lattimore, and others. he is a excellent singer with a real soulful voice. The man can really sing and easy on the eyes I must admit. I have and always will support carl thomas. His cd is one that i can listen to from beginning to end with the exception of the fast or should i say up tempo songs. But other then that, I love the cd. Music, i believe will soon get back to real singing and R&B will surely return and I can't wait til the late 80's and early 90's are back. I also must admit i see that he finally left Bad Boy records. Puffy will surely miss this artist. Maybe soon Puffy will realize to leave singing alone and stick with being a Business Man, father, and boy friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Emotional, but it's close...","review":"I heard the cd was coming out a few months ago, but I never heard any singles from it. I was a bit disappointed by Let's Talk About It, so I wasn't in a rush to get this one. Boy, am I kicking myself! This cd is awesome! I'm probably one of the biggest Brandy fans there is, so I was so excited that she was featured on Something Bout You, even if only minimally. I also love Oh No (You Can't Be Serious), as well as Can't Get Over with Dave Hollister. All in all, So Much Better is a great cd. Emotional was such a classic that it's hard to create something that great twice, but Carl came mighty close with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carl Thomas So Much Better","review":"Smooth and delicious like the first album.

Although the editor before me published the poem, I was the editor of a small poetry magazine which had printed a plagiarized version of one of Bowers' poems. Both in our brief correspondence and in this book, Bowers' impressed me as a brave soul. Plagiarists, on the other hand, are not the pranksters they imagine themselves to be; they are the cowards of the literary world. \\"Words for the Taking\\" is a tale of courage, both in the story it tells of the tracking of a criminal, and in the example it sets of one man believing in his writing. There are many lazy, slack-off writers out there. \\"Words for the Taking\\" shows us more than any writing course could that putting effort into and believing in your writing is one of the bravest acts possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every church doorkeeper","review":"The book is bible centered and down to earth.
