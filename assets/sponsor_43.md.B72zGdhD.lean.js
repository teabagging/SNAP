The same beat just keep repeating though out the entire CD without changing.As if that wasn't annoying enough, some of the songs aren't complete. The singer would start one song, apparently get tired of singing it and move on to another one. I have no idea why.(Something to keep in mind, this label is selling a lot of different Christmas music CDs. All of which sell for a similar amount.

There is, however, a double-edged sword. All the block patterns included are 9-inch, which is in some sense good -- it makes it easy to put them all together, but is from another perspective bad -- it makes for some weird measurements on certain blocks (i.e. anything on a 4- or 16-patch grid rather than a 9-patch grid).

Busted shaft lock button while trying to loosen the bit. Took tool apart and observed cheap plastic case material deformed under torque of loosening bit. Drilled out deformed plastic, used 2 part epoxy to mend broken hole. Tried the fix, works OK but I have to put a nail straight thru the new hole I made when removing the bits. This tool has maybe 10 to 15 weekend jobs under it's belt, not hardly used at all I defenately won't be buying another Rotozip. I own aprox 30-ish high quality shop tools and powwered hand tools and this one was/is one of my least favorites.

The distinguishing features of this film are the extremely disagreeable spinster and the outlandishly bad acting, particularly of the three female victims. (I am especially fond of their skillfully crafted foreign accents.)This one has it all: ornery old woman, evil genius, hokey pseudo-scientific sets and dialogue, wooden acting, and a cat brain transplanted into a nubile young girl. The one unifying theme of the film, however, is that of boredom. The film isn't one of the very worst ever made, but it ranks right up there on the all time boringness scale. I recommend that if you want to watch this film you buy the version featuring the MST3K guys and their trademark mockery: it relieves the boredom and makes the viewing experience infinitely more enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't protect worth a darn","review":"The clear case does a good job protecting the iPhone from scratches (except the exposed screen).

On the potential downside, the case doesn't give you a good grip like a silicone/rubber one. Also, the plastic clip is quite flimsy... feels like it's going to break off if use it as a belt clip.7/11/07 - Just dropped my iPhone at waste level this past weekend - the case popped open and the phone went flying out.

That song personafies the whole movie. Another great song is by Moenia (think Depeche Mode, by way of Mexico)called LADO ANIMAL.

I constantly hear of people criticizing his music, but I have always been attracted to Glass' music. I love how he takes small, BEAUTIFUL, melodic fragments and slowly develops them. I think minimalist music, particularly Glass, is the kind of music you just sit around and listen to.

People who abhor music without guitars like On. Deaf people like On. I've never met anyone who DOESN'T like On.I feel that Reload's remix is exactly what a remix should be - namely, not the same song with a different beat. Truth is, the two mixes have little in common, but you'll like them both anyway.Finally, from previous reviewers I sense a feeling that the middle two tracks are unworthy of being on the album. I can see where this resentment comes from with the painfully abrasive industrial grind of 73-yips, but I think Xepha is brilliant. Anyways, experimental dance is often hit or miss. Get this disc.

Yes, it improves on M@W in that it actually features coherently-written songs with actual, discernable melodies and hooks (including the devastating rumination on Canada's role in an age of teror, 'The Dark Canuck'). But Gordon Downie's lyrics---which are spectacularly revitalized on the subsequest disc, 'In Between Evolution'---remain too scholarly and abstract here, the vocals lack conviction, and the production values sap the band of all the energy and menace that define it.

It truly dampens the smell, and the smaller crystals have the extra advantage of showing color change if there's a PH shift. (This is not a diagnostic tool, but can be helpful of warning you that there's an issue.)It works fine in Scoop Free automatic litter box with that permanent plastic tray you can buy elsewhere on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Good morning. I bought this cat litter for my senior male cat to cut down on UTI infections and because of the added attractant. My cat did not like it. My guess is the litter was too grainy and it irritated his paws. His solution was to avoid it. He urinated on my carpet instead of the litter box. I am sure this product is a blessing to many other senior cat owners, but for me it was a big smelly mess. Once I switched back to his regular Arm and Hammer litter, he was fine. No more mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Mixing","review":"I mix this with Dr Elsey's Precious cat litter and it works well. The Precious by itself dries too hard and sticks horribly to the side and bottom of the boxes.

I find the crystals both soften up the Precious litter while still allowing it to clump well and control odors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturates quickly, then stinks","review":"This stuff was great for the first day, OK on the second day, and stank horribly on the third day. I did stir/rake the crystals several times a day as instructed. I have 3 cats and there are 2 boxes but they tend to use one for urine and one for feces. They are all on wet food only and urine volume is fairly high but none of them have kidney disease or diabetes so there are no \\"special needs\\". When I emptied the box today I could see all the crystals were saturated and there was pee all over the bottom of the box. Yuck! I'm going back to World's Best Cat Litter. I have this 2 starts instead of 1 because perhaps for 1 small cat it would be OK. But they are marketing it as \\"senior\\" cat litter for diabetics and kidney failure cats, who are going to be urinating 3-4 times as much as healthy cats like mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers some insight, but not a lot about writing","review":"Conservative author Thomas Sowell writes in this small volume a little about what it's like to be a writer. He talks about his many battles with editors and his long struggle before he made it in the writing field. However, he barely mentions the art of writing. Really, his only advice is to use simple language, and to keep to a minimum number of words. Those are just basics to writing.His philosophy towards writing is you need to be a bad writer for a while before you become a decent one, which is true, but there are ways to make one's writing better.However, Mr. Sowell's personal history, his humor, and his criteria for citing sources makes this worth the price of admission.

Clay litter allows clumps to form wherever the cat pees. The clumps are easy to remove. Crystals however do not clump. Thus, the pee-saturated areas are harder to scoop out of the box. Why is it a big deal if pee stays in the litter box? Because cats are very clean animals and prefer to void in pee-free, odor-free zones. If their boxes smells of pee, then, the cats are more likely to start peeing in places other than the box. Do NOT get rid of your cat, because it dislikes using the litter box!!! More often than not, a switch to odor-free, clay litter will cure any litter box avoidance. If you don't want to clean your litter box daily, then, don't get a cat.

Even with actors of the caliber of Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, and Kurt Jurgens, \\"Breakthrough\\" is undoubtly a mediocre war movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love overcomes all","review":"Carla Kelly writes of all the ordinary, everyday events and turns them into extraordinary emotions.

But it is a cheapie ... cheap optics, cheap construction. If you get a good price and go in knowing the limitations, probably an ok deal. Close-ups suck, must be apx 24\\" away or image is blurry. The flash takes forever to recharge & washes out images when used. If you want to take your SD memory card out to transfer images, you have to open your battery door & reset date/time each time. If you're taking a pic in a even pretty good lighting setting you need to hold the camera perfectly still for quite a while or image will be blurry. Don't try to review images on the nominally backlit display unless you are in a closet. It's a battery hog, buy recharge-ables .. flash charges a bit faster with rechargables too..

I liked it at first, as it was easy to use and operate. It became quickly apparent, though, that it sucks batteries dry at the speed of light. Whenever I changed the batteries--which was often, 99% of the time I also had to reprogram the camera--a huge pain if you want to catch a particular moment. The 3x digital zoom zooms to 3x, there is no in-between, no control at all over the zoom. Over the last month, the zoom has worked sporadically--not working when I wanted and needed it the most.

Unfortunately, while the movie has some intrigue and has visual appeal, it lacks the warm humor that made Nadesico the hit that it was. While there are some light-hearted moments, they seem to have been added almost as afterthoughts.

ChocolateSleuth.com recommends this as a great quick read that will have you turning pages until the end.It's the story of Evelyn, a young girl who grew up hard, making mistakes along the way until a life-changing experience--the murder of the father of the baby she carries, leads her to change her life. A colorful cast of well-fleshed characters and snappy dialogue keeps the story moving. I found it hard to put this book down.

I don't quite remember how I discovered his music but when I saw this album two years ago, I purchased it without thinking twice. This bachata is very traditional, true \\"bachata del pueblo\\" with excellent rhythm, authentic instruments and a very clear voice by the lead singer Jhony Rijo. The theme of songs is about women and broken romances sung from the heart with true sentiment. I especially like song #2 Mujeres calla' and #9 Dejaria de vivir. This is the kind of bachata that will never tire you because it's authentic, romantic, and not fly by night. I seriously recommend this one if you like classic bachata. \\"Una noche me invitaste a tu habitacion....ese dia me di cuenta que me estabas enganando\\".

Whatever we don't quite know for sure the author fills up with plausible explanations according to the way people would act in those times. The vividness is stupendously accomplished. Full of data without seeming tiresome.A talented historian and writer. Only in the last pages he seems to offer a slight moral assesment, as a lesson to modern political figures to heed.

Sure to bring hours and hours of discussion among his fans and detractors."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Alive","review":"An exhaustively thorough and clinically objective account of the Salamis battle in a prose that is rarely dry unlike many histories. The author successfully brings it to life, an oft-used cliche, I know, but applicable here.

The prose is direct and flows well, and the research is impeccable, with the recreations of the battle scenes and characters very believable and authentic without being stuffy.

This is a wonderful book to help a child see that there are stories older than the ones told in the Bible and to see the links between various cultures and mythologies, as this Babylonian myth explains the change of seasons in a manner similar to the Greek myth of Persephone and Hades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy tunes and lots of fun in the car!","review":"Until just recently, we only had one Veggie recording for the car, along with some Blues Clues. Mom and Dad needed a bit more variety. The music on this--as with all Veggie Tales--is SO clever! Lots of musical styles covered--my hubby loves the Salesmunz Rap (flannel shirts for going grungy!) as well as their Blue Danube version (Stuff stuff, mart mart) The Yodeling Vet is hilarious, and there are tunes with lessons to be learned, as well(I thank God...for my piece of apple pie; There once was a man...). It's SAFE entertainment for all ages, and, oh yeah, my 2 yr old loves it as much as her parents do! It's also great for putting a damper on a tantrum! Definitely a winner here--just as I expected from Big Idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sounds","review":"This is heavenly music: I loved the sounds from the first track and can hardly wait to see the DVD.

I hope this region and people will not be devastated in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack","review":"The music is superb. Should be a one of the best soundtrack of all times.

The Ritchie Family was one of the first and most important \\"disco\\" groups. Why is most of their music out of print or in condensed versions?

Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"why?","review":"if you can have the MP3's of all her albums, why would you want this? i don't rate it 1 star because i love ritchie family, but the collection is poor & in one disc you can't present the marvelous career of this group. get the MP3 of all their albums, thats a good greatest hits collection. maybe from all the 26 songs that you may find in their first 4 albums only 5 are not worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Wild!","review":"Taco Bell is an American institution. Do you know where the hardshell taco was invented and first sold? Yes, it was at Taco Bell. Every red-blooded American, male or female, owes a debt of gratitude to this fast food chaing. And flying this flag outside your home is probably the best way to show your support. The only reason for my reduction from 5 stars to 4 is that Taco Bell discontinued their \\"wild sauce\\" which was offered in the early-to-mid '90s. It was the tastiest concoction ever invented, far better than their \\"Mild,\\" \\"Hot,\\" and \\"Fire\\" varities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, but fairy tales?","review":"Ms. Byatt is an extraordinarily talented writer, and The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye is plenty of proof for any dissenters. Although I have not read Possession (which contains most of the fairy tales collected here), these stories, good as they are, seem like they are part of a missing whole, and seem to yearn for a destination to take the reader to. If the individual plots of each tale were stronger (as fairy tales need a strong plot), I would have been more satisfied with this book. As it is, however, Ms. Byatt shows a wonderful sense of language, which she uses sparingly but with great imagination and tenacity. She reminds me of that other great English novelist, Jane Austen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful fairty tales for adults!","review":"A.S Byatt is one of the most talented and brilliant writers today. The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye is an engaging collection of adult fairy tales that are a delight to read. Byatt has a wonderful way with the English language. Her writing is delicate and precise without being too precious. \\"The Story of the Eldest Princess,\\" \\"The Glass Coffin,\\" and \\"Dragon's Breath\\" are my favorites. Byatt has such incredible range and depth, and it shows in this fine short story collection. This is not a large volume, there are only five stories here, but it's a wonderful way to spend a few hours transported into other worlds by an extremely talented writer. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Spirits in an Exquisite Bottle","review":"Despite the narrator's confession in the title story that she is all brains and no body--completely at a loss in the sensuous--this beautiful collection of tales is an example of the intellect and the senses working together in the highest fashion. There is not only keen wit and delightful description at work in these stories, but also a kind of spiritual refreshment unavailable in most postmodern literature, whatever its other virtues. One can only hope that , like her protagonist Gillian Perholt, A.S. Byatt finds prolonged life in the creation and recreation of narratives for our continued delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Worship Collection","review":"Wow Worship Green is definetly one of the best worship collections ever!

Even There Is Nothin Like A Dame is wrong, it sounds like boys in a club in Chelsea rather than the rough and tough Seabees and Sailors they are meant to be. Forget it, the entire film is dreary and unmoving and just plain wrong! Get the Carnegie Hall concert version with Reba. THAT is a masterpiece of a performance, and does true justice to this Rodgers and Hammerstein classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some shows DO NOT need a revival or a TV version!","review":"Whoever cast Glenn Close as Nellie Forbush owes her a huge apology because it was nothing short of an act of cruelty. She was wrong, wrong, wrong for the part and she knew it--it shows in her wooden and totally unbelievable performance. This Rodgers and Hammerstein masterpiece did not need a shoddy made-for-TV version--the original movie was perfect and did not need anyone to try and duplicate the magic of it. Most of the soul was sucked out of it in this crappy TV production and equally yucky soundtrack. What an abomination. That whirring sound is Richard and Oscar spinning in their graves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thing Rogers And Hammerstein Are Dead","review":"South Pacific is such a lovely, classic score, only God knows why fiftysomething Glenn Close was cast as twentysomething Nellie, and of all things, how Bloody Mary went from the big tough broad we all loved to a tiny lady completely devoid of vocal and emotional spirit.

GLEN CLOSE AS NELLIE FORBUSH SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER AND RADE SHERBEDGIA AS EMILE DE BECQUE, MY GOODNESS RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEN AND ENZIO PINZA ARE TURNING OVER IN THEIR GRAVES. THE ONLY GOOD THING GOING FOR IT IS HARRY CONNICK JR WHOOSE INTERPRETATION OF YOUNGER THAN SPRING TIME AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE TAUGHT IS KNDA GOOD.

The cast recording of the made-for-TV musical---like the movie itself--- lifeless and lackluster, with stars Harry Connick Jr. and Close, especially, sounding very much wilted leis. Some enchanting evening? More like a fatal attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Genuine Article","review":"It would be very easy for me to completely blast this made-for-TV version soundtrack. However, I'm not (completely). True, Glenn Close is too old to play Nellie and Harry Connick Jr. seems oddly out of place in his role as Cable. However Rade Sherbedgia saves the day as Emile. Rade sings with heart, even though his voice is rather weak... kind of like a whisper actually. I was moved by his renditions of Some Enchanted Evening and This Nearly Was Mine. Glenn Close has a decent voice, kinda like Mary Martin's but with an edge. My biggest gripe though is the balance between the singing and accompaniment. The orchestra seems to at times drown out the singers. A better job of mixing was in order. Though this new recording can no way replace the Broadway and movie versions (by a long shot), it is a rather queer addition to have whenever you're in the mood for.... say something different?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but this must have line of sight to work...","review":"I used it with my 80gig video ipod.

It was as described and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine on the wide seat of my exercise bike","review":"I bought this seat cover to replace the one I had on my exercise bike, which has a wide seat, and it works great. It's a little longer than the seat is, but that really posed no problem. Like all gel seat covers the gel moves around to conform to the shape of your butt and your movement. I replaced the old one, a different brand, because it had became lumpy and misshapen after a long period of time. So to prevent that with this new one I remove the cover about once a month or so, depending on use, then realign it back on the seat, to prevent the lumping. So far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch a Call","review":"I've had two of these, and both were great at first and enabled me to not miss calls, but both stopped working after awhile.

There's 16 tracks, but only 8 different songs. And plus I thought there would be songs from the TV series, or may-be even by Hilary Duff (who plays Lizzie McGuire.) But they are all from the movie, so I think they should've called it the Lizzie McGuire MOVIE Karaoke CD. So get the sound track for the movie, or a different Lizzie CD if you are interested. There are some good tracks, I'll admit. And based on my review you'd probably figure I hated the CD, not true! I even listen to it sometimes, but totally not worth what I payed for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Hardware I've Ever Purchased!","review":"I've had this card for about a year now, I use it everyday, I never watch TV on a television anymore. This TV tuner has many features and great software. One feature I like a lot is that you can take snapshots, this is great if there is a number or address that is displayed too quick to write it down. The snapshot feature is real nice because it doesn't take bad quality interlaced pictures, it enhances them so you have a high quality image without any lines. Also, I like how you can resize the TV screen and have it at the bottom of your screen while you do other stuff.

The only thing of interest on most of the songs, is that there is Randall Bramlett on saxophone.This show came just after guitartist Mike Howser died. George McConnell has just joined the band, but is so new, he is listed as a guest musician. He sounds out of place on most of the songs on this CD. He fits much better on the songs that were not included on the CD.Get the DVD instead. It has many great moments. The only real good song included on the CD is Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"This new cd is very good.

They create a \\"myth\\" about national health sysems whcih nobody ever stated or believed and they used it to show the weakness of NHS.

Cool. Another time to impart more info. Okay. But before it was all over, I had a headache from being hit over the head again and again and again and again about the wretched dogs in the mills and the even more wretched people running them.

I usually don't read books, but Gary Paulsen was my kinda guy. He was really graphic about what stuff he wrote about. I liked the chapter called Eating Eyeballs. I think anyone who likes adventure stories would like this book. And the cool thing is that it is all true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guts-Want a good book? READ THIS ONE!!!","review":"A wonderful book I recommend to you is Guts, a book by Gary Paulsen, a book of his childhood and what inspired him to write his many other books. It is full of adventures Gary had throughout his life. One thing is how he survives growing up in rural areas. Guts tells stories of Gary hunting for food with his homemade bow that he wrote about in one of his best known books; Hatchet. He was only able to kill small game such as rabbits and squirrels but he and Brian are both alive. The book also tells about an elk attack Gary encountered while hunting that he wrote happened to Brian in Hatchet. The final reason is it gives you more information about who is writing you and your friends favorite books. Guts tells of his home life, childhood, and recent carriers. Did you know that Gary used to mush dogs in Alaska? I recommend this book to you because I know you will like it because he uses that special technique of writing that won't let you put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guts","review":"The book Guts, is a very good book. If I was you and you haven't read Hatchet then I would not read Guts. So let me tell you what this story is about. Gary Paulsen has been attacked by a moose. He doesn't die luckily. My favorite part in the story was When a boy feeds a baby deer mints.His mom tells him to hold out the mint. When he does that he ittitates the deer. The deer ran into the boy. Does he die or is he alive. You will have to read this book to find out what happens.If you are the readers who I hope you are you will give this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guts is the best book ever!","review":"This is the most amazing book in the world! if you haven't read this book, stop what you're doing and read this book immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The paulsen Experience","review":"The book Guts is an autobiography about Gary Paulsen. All of the adventures he has been on. How he survived as a kid when he ran away or like the first time he got a book when he walked into a library and an old lady gave him a library card. He has many stories about how he was attacked by moose and how he was saving peoples lives by driving them to the hospital in an ambulance. All of the great stories he has for you it just captures you and makes you want to read and read till you get tiered. The part of the story I liked the most was when he was hunting and got attacked by a moose. A simile that really fits this book is hatchet. This is a great book and I would recommend it to any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"true grit, high interest book","review":"There seems to be very little Gary Paulsen hasn't experienced first hand: crashing a bush plane, being pummeled half to death by an angry moose, attempting to drag a 200 pound deer out of a swamp, roasting squirrels over spits, eating bugs, eyeballs, and guts... This is a collection of real life adventures that inspired events in Paulsen's novels. A must-read for fans of these books and for anybody (esp. boys) who love disgusting, dangerous, modern-day survival stories. It's easy to read and gives an appreciation for true survival skills in a world that has largely lost touch with such values. ages 10+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood on the Hunt and life in the Woods","review":"In the autobiography Guts by Gary Paulsen, he explains what life life was like for him growing up in the wild. He explains some of the things that he had done when he was hunting for small game in the woods or something that happened when he he was in the Iditarod in Alaska or when he was being pummled by a moose in the middle of a river heading down stream to set the fall traps. This book is like a autobiograph of ten different people and their childhoods all packed into one person. He has seen things that only some people could think of, and then portrays them in a fairy tale manner. The book does not drag on like some, it is a very fun and exciting book to read and a non stop cliff hanger that will keep you reading until the book is done and then wishing that there was more to read. I suggest this book to anybody of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney has changed the songs invarious ways","review":"I bought both lion king and the Princess CDGs and the songs that are on these are not the right words nor are they a likable sorce of instrumentals for any vocalist to sing.

Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is, to this day, one of my favorite games of all time. Obviously it's a little dated now, but it has a really interesting story that I loved back in the mid-90's when this game was released. I'm really sad that they didn't continue the franchise. I would love to see some form of Gabriel Knight on my Xbox or PS3 console. I would buy this game again if there was a Mac version of it. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find one anywhere. But if you're a PC user and love classic adventure games, this is definitely worth playing. However, I don't know where they're getting the price from. This is an old game. $80?

It is somewhat disappointing. It was published in 1990, but looks like it was published much earlier, as the type font and layout look like 1970's or 1980's typed manuscript, and the illustrations are also old-fashioned. It is full of jokes, riddles, and games, but little academic review and practice. There are a few \\"nuggets\\" I can use, such as \\"Interesting Etymologies,\\" and \\"Common Roots & Affixes.\\" However, you have to wade through a lot of less useful material to find something truly useful. In my opinion, not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the respect?","review":"Here is a stylish and talented disco diva who left us with a couple of killer songs and a strong overall body of work, and I think that Barbara Pennington would be insulted (and rightfully so) if she discovered that this disc was being sold for only one penny.Anyway, Barbara Pennington first came to light with the big 1978 disco hit \\"24 Hours A Day\\" which remains one of her most classic works. Though she only made a couple of albums, it is clear from listening to these that she has some real disco blood in her. She came back strong in 1985 with the minor but uber-cool hit \\"On A Crowded Street\\" which has a timeless stylishness to it. Its obvious disco influence makes it sound like it could be from 1978, but it's well-crafted enough so that it doesn't have that \\"1978 called and wants its sound back\\" feeling about it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime...for sure","review":"Very disapointing. The loss of Chris De Garmo is one, that in my opinion, is just too much for this, one of my favorite 80's bands, can overcome. The recording was lack luster, and the mix left much to be desired.

I just never got into them before. But I got the great chance to direct the DVD and VHS version of this release, and through that process, I had no choice but to sink my teeth into this band's history. And that is what this CD set is all about. The most important songs from their entire 20 year career artistically woven together into a wonderful 2 CD set. And what a great catalog of songs! The Moore Theater crowd in Seattle was blown away by this rare performance of this concept, and if you are a fan, you will be as well. Geoff Tate's vocal's are so powerful, and Michael Wilton on guitar nails every lick. I now get it! These guys are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queensryche is back!","review":"While I was dissapointed in Q-Ryche's last 2 studio albums, I still held out for hope that one of my favorite bands would return to their glory days. I saw Q-Ryche live for the Empire tour and was blown away by the show. This album captures some of the exitement I felt back then. And I have to admit, as much as I dearly miss Chris DeGarmo, Kelly Gray has earned my respect, he did a wonderful job on this performance. Geoff's voice is as amazing as it ever was, and I'll argue to the death with anyone who tries to tell me his voice isn't the best in Rock. As ususal Scott Rockenfield delivers his steady, hard hitting drumming that just backs everything up beautifully. Michael Wilton still plays with the passion he had back in the early days, as does Eddie Jackson on bass. It's nice to hear these guys do the classics again, and I eagerly await the next studio release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing . . .","review":". . . and the most disappointing aspect - Geoff Tate's vocal performance. In many songs, he foregoes his characteristic high notes for a lower key (e.g., \\"Take Hold of the Flame\\") and in other songs, he just gives up singing the high portions altogether (e.g., \\"Queen of the Reich\\" and \\"Walk in the Shadows\\").Also disappointing were some of the arrangements (e.g., \\"Spreading the Disease\\") and the repoire (or lack thereof) with the audience (e.g., the middle section on \\"Empire\\").For live Queensryche, I highly recommend the reissue of 'Operation:LiveCrime', which has far more venom and is superior to the original studio recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant live performance!!","review":"Classic Queensryche performance.Geoff Tate sounds great as does the rest of the band the crowd was really into it not like some live concerts where the person on the soundboard doctors the crowd sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band Bad Replacement","review":"I have to say the new Guitarist is not doing them any justice!

But what makes this book so enjoyable is the author's irreverent tongue-in-cheek writing style.

I chose to research comparative governments and their political parties. I came across this book on Amazon.com and thought immediately that it would provide perfect information for my paper. As I began reading the book, (mind you, reading as well as politics are passions of mine), I found myself nauseatingly bored to tears. It took every bit of strength I had to finish the book, but I did. In the end, I never used the information in \\"Politics on the Fringe\\" in my final draft.

I think she wants to follow the trends with tried something new. But, her trademark-which is have an easy listening music-still there. That's good. So, her fans (like me) didn't loose what we ever heard a long long time ago, when she still teenager. Her colaboration with ex singer trio 'Wilson Phillips'-it's Chynna Phillips-really really cool. Nice meldoy with a romantic lyric. And at track 8 called \\"In Blue\\" have a very smooth melody. Nice song with a nice music. Even this song can make us remembering to Latin Diva-Gloria Estefan.

Particularly superb are the readings of 'Pop Life, Erotic City and the lesser known song 'An Honest Man' - which on this reading sounds strangely like a Neil Young song circa 'After The Gold Rush'(!) very unlike the gospel tinged ballad Prince fans have had on bootleg since 1986.

The games that run on it are very realistic and 3D. I have 9 games and are all great and work with the touch screen very well. Many people think that the Gameboy Advance is just as good, but it's not even close. Here are the things that make the DS much better: Pictochat, DS download play, nice 3D games that you can get into, a touch screen, WIFI, and a much brighter screen. If you have already bought the ds or are going to, I recommend Mario Kart DS for a game. I recommend the Nintendo DS to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great price, great system","review":"$129.99 for a brand new system is very reasonable, especially when you consider how good this system really is. I don't see too many people complaining about the PSP, and it is nearly twice what the DS costs. However, unlike the PSP, the DS is worth its price. The games are only about $25 bucks each, so you won't have to sell your blood to own a game. When you factor all the good reasons to own the DS, $129.99 is nothing. It is this price now in stores too, so stop complaining and get to buying!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes! The Next Big Hand-held is Here!","review":"This is awesome! I have already pre-ordered one at GameCrazy and I am so excited about getting it! It has countless special features and it comes with a demo of Metroid Prime: Hunters, entitled First Hunt! Any Nintendo freak (like me) must own this system! I don't know what the best feature is. It's hard to choose from the following list: Dual screens, touch screen compatibility, voice recognition, a special slot for Game Boy cartridges, a built-in chatroom and wireless multiplayer! This system is gonna rock! The graphics are the same as the popular N64's. The games look amazing. Being a huge Mario fan, I have my eyes on Super Mario 64-by-4. You can play with up to 3 other players! Sweet!! I simply can't wait to get my DS. Nintendo DS is gonna rule!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review","review":"What your eyes behold is the one and only Nintendo DS, with 2 screens (the bottom is a touchscreen)and a microphone port. While Metroid Prime Hunters can use a demo, you dont have to. There are over 3 control scemes you can use. Super Mario 64 DS is a remake of the classic platformer, with added multiplayer and a new focus on teamwork. The inside is compact so the system culd operate at the best frame rate, graphics, and control scheme. The carts are about 1/4 the size of a reglar Gameboy game, or half the size of GBA. With over 120 games already being made, this is one to beg for, or, for the 3 of you with money, preorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift......","review":"I bought this for my nephew's 5th birthday and he just loved it. He spends a lot of time playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nintendo DS","review":"I believe the nintendo ds is a great console. It has good graphics, and dual screens. The touch screen is controlled by a stylus. The wireless connection can usually hold up to 16 people although the game's multiplayer number varies from game to game. The picto-chat feature is also very interesting. It's like Instant Messaging but you get to write it yourself. If you have no friends with a DS, you can hook up a wi-fi connection in your home which takes it online to find thousands of people willing to play or talk. If you're still undecided between a PSP and a DS, try to find a friend who's had both for a while and see ow they like it, or buy both to maximize your gaming experience. Here are some prices:Nintendo DS: $130DS games: roughly $30-$40PSP: $250PSP games: roughly $40-$50The PSP is more expensive, but has many capabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I have been saving my babysitting money, my allowence, and doing extra chores around the house to earn extra money for more than 2 months so that i could buy a nintendo DS.

It is amazing. 3-D, 2 screens, touch action. it's just... wow. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm satisfied","review":"i didn't have the highest of hopes for the DS, due to the touch screen, but I think it is actually pretty good. I enjoy using it on games such as warioware touched and yoshi. The best thing about nintendo is their games, that is how it has always been. Their exclusive titles ensure that fans will keep coming back for more, which is why nintendo is still at the top of the game after 20 + years of being in the industry. I hope the revolution is as good as their previous systems, and as good as the DS. Buy the DS, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new Handheld System than Sony's PSP","review":"I think it is cool for Nintendo to make this new Handheld System great for Fans of Nintendo.

Keeping that aside, this handheld is the leading and best, the touchscreen feature is the best and the dual screen is awesome.

Take this to no offense but anyone who thinks this is better than psp they are too stupid to turn on the psp or are still in the nintendo phase. pay the freakin' 100 extra dollars and get a system that is sleek, serfs the web, plays dvd's, save images and has itunes!!!! i am going to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSP owns","review":"in response to the person who wrote PSP SUX I have something to say to you: you made a mistake trading your PSP in for a DS. And why is nintendo a trusted brand? OK maybe Sony isnt the MOST trusted brand but they certainly know what they are doing. Nintendo make games for 11 and under children. I rather have something (PSP) that they targeted for 13-30 year olds. Thats my biggest gripe against Nintendo is there lack of M rated games. And no, I am not some violent punk. But really the best games are usually M rated (halo 2, half-life 2, doom 3). By all means Sony did not copy nintendo's gba. Thats like saying that sony stole controllers from nintendo. Holding up the original GBA up to the PSP, the GBA looks like something you would find in a happy meal. And original games? Mario 79, Donkey Kong 32, and Metroid prime 24?

You cannot set up anything for any dates you want either, it has to take place at least the next day, or that day itself. And, i won't even get started on the MP3 player, because it does not even have one.As most of you know, the DS also has Pictochat, a cute, but useless system you can talk to person with. I thought you could \\"chat\\" with people anywhere, but when i tried to connect to my brother (who also has a DS) who was upstairs, aboyut only 5 feet away, i couldn't reach him.

I have only pros to give to this console.1. The touch screen enhances game play and makes gaming a whole lot easier.2. The 3-d rendered grapics are exceptional and live up to the hype that it has been made to be.3.

Basically during any game any time just flip down the screen to pause it and flip it back up to keep playing, no matter where you are or what you're doing. This is also great when you use it as a makeshift alarm clock (like i have had to bafore as it will help u conserve battery life). And the great 3D grphics (or polygons) make sure that you will not be dissapointed if you can only afford the DS vertion of some of your favorite games.

The DS is childish and lacks style. Im mean come on, why the hell does it have a touch screen? Thats not inovative, thats just stupid. I was accually an owner of the DS until I returned it. Now im a proud owner of a PSP and Im happy. Its sooooo awsome. I hear, its run on demons sent by lord satan. But seriously, if your a true gamer and luv the PS2...you will like the PSP. I've got the Japinese version and It rules with an iron fist. Eh, oh if you keep looking for reviews for the DS, you will run into a kids review that talks about cursing on the internet and it makes no sense. Its quite funny and will give one a laugh.

The two screens are a gimmic and most of the games fail to use the lower screen in any breakthrough ways. The graphics can be compared with PS1 games circa 1996-1997. When I first saw the DS i knew it wasnt going to be very good. Now I know that. All the games have been rushed and lack polish. Nintendo has not announced a must-buy game for the DS yet. If you are considering purchasing a portable console and you are over the age of 10 buy the PSP. This console has near PS2 quality graphics, anybody who says the DS has better graphics is just plain retarded. DS catridges hold 1/14 the storage of UMDs which the PSP uses, and the processor is no where near the quality of the PSPs. I have used the DS and it is awful. If you happen to recieve one of these consoles return it and wait for the PSP. The two screens are a gimmick and in fact the console is one of the worst inventions in the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!","review":"ok nintendo, can you release the next gen now. this thing gets old fast. also, whats the deal with the gameboy micro?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Nintendo freaks...","review":"Let me make a long story short, everything sucks on the DS.

REALLY EXCITING! For a 5 year old! Seriously PSP has SOCOM, BattleFront 2 (identical to console version), and BattleField 2 modern combat (all online). And all those other great plateformers. the 32 mb memory stick included is sufficient for games, and for 20-30 bucks you can upgrade to 128 mb which can even hold a few mp3s.I have 512 mb stick and I have 35 songs on it and it works just fine and still have 200 mb on it.

It allows games to be played in a way never before possible. I really love how Nintendo is STILL thinking up new ways of playing games 20 years after the NES was released. So, if you are currently on the fence between consoles, and are not quite sure about the NDS, my recommendation is to try it yourself and see how fun it is! You can't learn how great a system is by reading amazon reviews. Try it! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to trade it in for a Nintendo DS Lite","review":"Don't get me wrong, its a good gaming system, except I would rather have a Lite. The reason why? Well, the first day I got it, the screen was already scratched from the stylus. I only played it for an hour or so! Also, I've had it for two years and one of the hinges broke. They're really sensitive, especially the screen. But, overall, the DS is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey psp fanboy!!!","review":"that guy who said that we can't afford psp, maybe you bought it, but when you saw tha you can only buy racing, sport and puzzle games you said: \\"oh my! i wish i've never bougt this, so i'll use it to say cool kids buy psp. besides, coll games for ds are coming such as lost in blue, nintendogs, mario kart ds and i can say more and more, while you wait for the only game all of you say it's \\"cool\\" the psp, \\" OOHH, GRAND THEFT AUTO IS COMIN FOR THE PSP, OOHH AND I ONLY BOUGHT THE PSP BECAUSE FOR IT, OOHH OOHH, AND I DON'T CARE IT'S THE SAME GAME ON THE PS2, BECAUSE IT'S FOR PSP\\" you know, it's the same game for ps2, so if you're going to only say that, just buy it and don't mess with ds, (that sounds cool )."},{"rating":"2","title":"*******NINTENDO DS IS BETTER THAN PSP******","review":"*******this system can be summarized in one word ****awsome**** it is perfect(: (:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:*******it has hours on edge of battery life so you dont have to worry about not being able to save it because it gives you a warning about 10 minuts until it shuts off this is a grat xmas gift for all kids it ussaly goes for ($$) so u go buy one off of ebay right now ***********"},{"rating":"2","title":"This really works.

I have looked at the other games for it but they do not appeal to me due to there almost Nintendo 64 graphics. The touch screen feature is pointless if you ask me. Just one more thing to be worried about if a scratch appears on it. They should have let the PDAs just have that. In my opinion, Nintendo has always been behind with there systems. None can play DVDs or Cd's and there graphics have always kind of sucked. The only Nintendo systems that I will stick to is the NES, Super NES, and the Gamecube. In conclusion, the DS is one of the worst systems made by Nintendo and that they should just leave handheld gaming to Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're under 10, this might be cool","review":"If you are a young kid you might find this system ammuzing. For now, there is not a single game that I find intresting for my age group. All the games are mini games, puzzle games, or just really stupid full games. The graphics are not amazing at all (except for super mario world.) Also, the touch screen is pointless now.

I love my Gamecube and my Gameboy SP.Now, the DS looks like it could have a lot of potential with it's dual screens and touch pad. And, it just dropped down $20. It's got pretty good graphics, innovation, and will soon have Wi-fi. How can you go wrong?The PSP looks like it has a lot of potential, too. I would recommend the DS over the PSP if you like to play games on your handhelds and you have a PS2 or Xbox, or if you just don't want those games. I would recommend the PSP over the DS if you don't have a PS2, since most of it's games are on PS2. But, I would give the slight nudge to the DS. Did you that? SLIGHT nudge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's just a gimmick","review":"It's not so much a system as it is a gimmick. The fun will wear off in the first 10 hours. I'm sticking with my sp for now.

Ignore Nintendo and look at Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's see......","review":"K....first off, all of these reviews that place the DS over PSP are written BEFORE the PSP even came out! I bet most of these fanboys never even tried out the PSP! THe PSP is much better. The DS is rectangular, so it isnt contoured to the shape of your hand. Second, \\"game cards\\" (and the other cartridge-formats that nintendo decided to use) limits the graphics capabilities. Anyone remember the N64? fuzzy textures? its worse with DS; theyre jagged now. And they're all kiddy games. Who wants to spend 30 dollars on a game that consists of five types of minigames (cough.....warioware) that has barely any replayability! ALso, you cant even access the home menu of the DS without turning it off first! What the heck! In the long run, PSP is a better deal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok i guess but PSP owns.","review":"I have compared both of the two systems PSP and the Nintendo DS and there is no comptition. PSP can connect to the internet and other wireless devices like smartphones all for free! You can also use multiplayer wirelessly like the DS. Right now I admit the PSP you have to use memory cards (which are expensive) to save movies and music and save games. But they are making Re-writible UMD's so soon you could save two movies onto one inexpensive disc and then when you are tired of them you could record over them! Blockbuster ETC are soon going to carry the UMD's so the PSP is good just as a movie player. Second I have to say the Screen is amazing. The graphics are actully better than those on a PS2!!! It may be expensive but trust me shell out on the PSP its WAAAAAYYYYYYY better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was planning on only getting the PSP but i played a demo and got the DS.

Even though its not out for America yet the, Japan have it and they are saying its awesome. But no one will know entell there both out. Nintendo said there going to have online but were is it? There both awesome system but i would wait for both to see which one is the better one. I wish i had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I bought this game for his birthday, and loved it. As soon as I bought it, the battery was already charged, and it was an unopened box. I played it all day not having to recharge it until that night. The battery lasted an unbelievably long time. I thought the demo was really dumb, and a waste of time. So i was glad i had decided to buy another game. The other game was Urbz: Sims In The City, and it was really fun. If you buy the Nintendo DS i suggest you buy other games for it, because you could never survive off that demo. The reason i gave it 4 stars was because the demo was really stupid, and there's not that many games out, there's only about 5. Otherwise Nintedo DS is totally awesome, and I suggest you buy it now, before it sells out around Christmas time, which is 25 days away (don't ask me how i know how many days exactly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew all of that already!","review":"I knew everything you said already!

With a touch screen, pictochatting, and lots of fun games, you just can't go wrong with this machine! The touch screen has to be one of the best features of the DS. It allows for more action, and more thrills, because you often have to watch both screens at one time. Pictochatting is also a lot of fun. Right now, you can only chat about sixty feet away from another person, but Nintendo plans to expend that to a world-wide connection. There are many fun DS games that have already come out, such as Nintendogs, Yoshi Touch 'N' Go, and Bomberman. I, and many others who have written reviews, can assure you that, if you purchase a DS, and take good care of it, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait for the Sony PSP if you are a gamer of any kind","review":"I Own the Nintendo DS, and while a very good system, I was hugely dissappointed by its shortcomings. At E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) People were told that its name would be changed, and that it WASN'T a Gameboy 2. Both were false, as it is still a DS, and is embarrassingly obvious that it is a sequel. The Graphics are amazing, I admit, and Nintendo is cashing in all of its credits in the Mobile Gaming industry. It is an inventive and fun product, but it will take more than good graphics and an overhyped touchscreen to win me over from the DVD and mp3 playback of the Sony PSP (Due in Mid to late March). It is a good purchase if you don't mind limited games, and an overall 'Kiddie' like platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"better off","review":"I am an actual ds owner.

I was very pleased with the preformance, and still am. I currently have 3 games, two of which are Mario games....which in fact was the reason I bought my DS...for the Mario games. I now feel that I have outgrown my DS, because of the fact that the games are either for 10-12 year olds (Mario & Nintendogs) or for an adult with the new Brain Age game. The DS is more for the hardcore Mario gamer, or for the adult who wants to own a handheld video game. This is where the DS meets its downfall. There is no medium in the gaming, and only six (6) that's right SIX sports games. Becuase of the lack in sports and adventure games (other than Mario) there is not enough to make the average teenager purchase this item, and this is why many teens are now using the Sony PSP. Take my advice, and only purchase this system if you really want to play Mario, or you are an adult looking to pick up a handheld machine again."},{"rating":"2","title":"FYI","review":"to the person who said ds suck, well YOU ARE A LOSER! as you see a ds is more better because of its easy to use touch screen! but the psp has stupid buttons that make it hard and the psp screen is not big, its smaller you lier! and the games on the ds are better and more cooler ie mario cart, animal crossing, and nintendogs. the games psp has i can get for my gamecube so its not special! and the movies are horrible except i, robot on the psp! the ds has pictochat and a ds download to download other games! so it dosnt have movies! so what i have a dvd player and an internet and plus the ds has a wi-fi so it can travel 10 times more than a psp!!!!! and the double screen are coller cause they are unique! a psp isnt specail its a waste of money and plus the ds got a better score on amazon and in stores than a stupid psp! and a ds sold like 25, 000, 0000 million on the first week but a ds stuck with a lousy 10 million!get a ds! you wont regeret it!! a ds rules and over 100 game cricits agree with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Divice for all kids/adults too!!!","review":"This DS is all you can imagine.

To me that just makes games less mobile by having to constantly touch something. Also just for some updated news on PSP, a web browser is going to be available for the PSP next week that you download off the system (lets see DS do that).P.S.Who cares about 2 screens???

Also, in Japan, the DS is sold out everywhere if that tells you anything.I grew up with mario but feel out with other games that were online multiplayer capable. If you do get this, definitely buy mario kart DS to go with it. Online play is very addictive. I can't imagine Metriod DS and what it will have to offer.

The dual screens took time to get used to and the first time I used I got a headache from trying to look at two screens at once. But I soon got used to it. The games were a little skimpy but as time went on, more gaes came out. I started with Nintendogs and I was very happy with that game. BUT... after a few months of using the touch-screen, I got a dead pixel. It is only one and barely noticable but it is pretty annoying. That is my only complaint.Overall, a great system. The battery life is amazing, and I love the game selections. Get this system, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Before I begin this review just one thing:Dudes stop bashing the Nintendo DS just cause it's not the PSP!!! You guys are probably just overly obsessed SONY fanboys bashing the DS with nothing better to do. So just shut up, freakin fanboys!On with the review about the DS. It's size is really big which is why I minused a star. The wrist strap is quite handy. The adapter is convienient and doesn't take up that much space. The stylus is rather tiny but it slips in the DS comfortably. And, if you lose the stylus, no need to panic because they included another one! The Pictochat is useless and the clock pretty much sucks. But that really has very little to do with the actual system. The backwards compititablity is a very nice feature except it won't play GB Color or the original Game Boy games.Overall, I think this is a great system and worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Playstation Portable V.S.

I had worked hard and saved my money and bought it for around $138.00, It was totally worth it. I have five touch games now,(Animal crossing wild world, Nintendogs, snowboard kids, Super mairo 64 DS, and Yoshi touch & go.) And they coulden't be any better. I think somthing amazing about it is that the way nintendo has changed over the past decade, My brother ownes one of those vintage GAME BOYs and it is HUGE!! (5.7 inches tall and 1.1 inch wide to be exsact) And all he has right now is a gameboy color, no built-in light, no 3\\" screen (it's like 2\\") , no L-R-X-or Z buttons, and It's not a laptop.But I think the greatest feature is when you turn on the system, It's just like a PDA! It shows the time, date, everything! Therefore, I think that the Nintendo ds is the greatest game system ever made (so far)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest videogame system ever made?","review":"Ok, saying that may be lightly exagerating. But not by much. The DS has, and always will be, one of the best systems ever made. The games are amazing, the graphics are great for a Nintendo Handheld! And the Innovation is enough to choke something that actuly eats innovation! Games like Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing:Wild World, and the upcomeing Metroid Prime:Hunters, are changing gaming as we know it. Finally decent, free online for a handheld. Mario Kart DS has re-defined the monumental series, Animal Crossing managed to create a Console-to-handheld transition with enough bonuses that made it feel similar, but still worth your money. Metroid Prime Hunters will create a new benchmark in Online FPS games, and bring another amzing series to a handheld. Truely this system proves that Nintendo does, and always will, own the Handhelds market, no matter WHO tries to stand in their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Awesome!","review":"The nintendo ds is the best of the handheld gaming systems so far.

I borrowed my friend's to give it a try and I felt like a girl fiddling with her palm pilot. Not only are the ds' graphics horrible, it is annoying using the micro-sized stylus (which I might add is smaller than a pencil in diameter). Honestly, I was cracking up at how bad it was - with the kiddie games and all - ***IF YOU ARE A DS FAN THAT WON'T READ THE REST OF WHAT I'M SAYING, JUST CLOSE THIS PAGE NOW*** How does metroid compete with games like Metal Gear or how does rogue agent event come near the soon coming GTA game? And tell me... how many rated M games are there for the ds? And just for the record... why do you need the ds to chat to someone?? can't you just take some steps forward?

I find it funny that everyone is writing a review about it (myself included), even though the system has not yet come out. The real test is when people will start playing it in the palm of their hands. My main concern is how well the DS will do with the older demographic, and if it will accomodate people that are over the age of 18 years old. I noticed that some the games including pictochat appeals to much younger kids. I just hope that the DS will accomodate to kids of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"This Nintendo DS is cool. No, I mean hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All the games that are currently out for the system are sub par at best and the graphics are nothing to smile about. The D-pad is a little too small and usuing the stylus for controlling a character in Mario 64 DS is worthless. Anyone who thinks the DS has better graphics then the PSP has obviously needs to go to www.gamespot.com and just look at some pictures. I am not a PSP fanboy, its just that the DS was rushed into the market and so were the games, if you see the poor graphics of Madden football and its terrible frame rate. I admit animal crossing and mario kart DS will be fun games, but its sad that your \\"heavy hitter\\" games are already on the gamecube, and will not be that much differnt, and of course the graphics will not be as good. I would not reccomend buying the DS untill PSP comes out, so you can see what both have to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokes the PSP","review":"Nintendo just made a better system, lets face it. They showed the world that they still have new ideas that can change and revolutionize the gaming world.

New ones cost at least $149.00 and that's a lot to pay for young children who are not very careful with electronics and may lose them.

So far, I am very satisfied with it. Graphics wise, it is impressive but the PSP fares better. However, it is the games that separate the PSP and DS. The DS, quite simply, has better games at the moment than the PSP, especially with Advance Wars DS coming out in a few days. If you have played the other Advance Wars, I am sure you would agree that they were extremely fun, and I will bet money that the DS version will at least be as good, if not better, than the originals.I still have faith in Sony and the PSP, but as of now, the DS seems like the better choice, especially after the difference of the DS being $150 and the PSP at a alarming $250."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for adults too !","review":"My boyfriend bought me the aqua nintendogs bundle, and it was the cutest thing.

It is a great size and fit well on my desk. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks, it stopped getting very cold. Then it stopped staying cold. After about 6 weeks, it stopped getting cold at all. Needless to say, I was not pleased. When I contacted the seller to return the item, I was told curtly that the warranty for this product is only 30 days, and I had not contacted Amazon until nearly 2 months (!!) after the purchase, so it could not accept the return. After I pressed the point, the seller not-so-subtly implied that I had broken the item, as these types of items typically last for years, and again that it could not accept the return.

It'll hold six soda cans if they're stacked horizontally. But, it's perfect for storing drinks at your desk! It'll take up another outlet, but it can be taken on the go with a car adapter (which it comes with) in case you go on a road trip or camping trip or something. My house is generally at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and this thing keeps my juices around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, which works for me.With S&H;, this little guy ran me roughly $55, which isn't bad for a portable little mini-fridge.Some folks have mentioned that it's a little loud, and it is kind of noticeable, but I can't really tell since it's right next to my PC tower (which is loud-ish already).My one and only complaint, is that the handle is turned as it's one piece of plastic.

He was a professor at Sorbonne at 21, and had been an accused murderer at 24, a thief, highwayman, and disappeared at age of 32 when he was banned from Paris in 1463... His rough, non compromising poetry is now considered the greatest in French literature... Eamon's lyrics reminds me of him..Little boring history of French literature ... Still, check it out..

This wannabe R&B ballad is laced with expletives, bitterness, and simplistic, brain-dead rhymes. Yes, Eamon tries something new by putting angry gangsta lyrics in a R&B ballad, but it just doesn't work here. The song is nothing more than the ranting of a naive young man's first serious relationship that failed. These lyrics are best left in someone's private diary. If you want angry lyrics, then listen to Eminem, as he is a much more talented songwriter and performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the REAL Eamon","review":"my name is also eamon, and i was playing music long before this punk was even born. i write songs that convey more feeling that \\"wah wah, i don't like you anymore\\". the depth of emotion shown by this artist is appallingly shallow. what's his next song gonna be? \\"F***, i want my blankey\\" what a herb, and that's the word from the herd of big bird, ait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FACTS","review":"You know Eamon isn't a bad guy he is just expressing himself..You can't hold his lyrics against him..What he is basically saying is F**k it he went through alot with his girl and you know what if i was him i would call her a hoe to.. no girl should cheat on her man..I Feel what he is feeling because guys cheat on us girls and we get over it eventually ..if we cheat on you guys and you find out your with someone else the next day..so think about it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is wonderful!!!","review":"I just love this song!

NOT SO!! Here is why I think this is the worse piece of crap to hit the airwaves in a very long time.1)The lyrics - All it took to write this song was a rhyming dictionary and five minutes of free time. Lyrically this is the most banal, vapid tune I have ever heard.2) The music - An overproduced, pedestrian, meandering mess.3) The Singer - One of the thinnest voice on the planet (Sounds like Keith Sweat with a massive headcold).I could care less about the profanity, Rock and Rollers and Rappers have been mining that field for quite some time, and to some degree the profanity used actually make the song.

You cant judge someones lyrics because of vugarity if they are really being serious about it.he didnt write these lyrics cuz he thought he was hard (thats retarted reasoning) or to be edgy or whatever. But he wrote them because that is exactly how you feel. he put them in just the right words. This song wasnt made to gush over or to be once of those sad ballads that get taken the wrong way. this is a sad song and he made sure that when you hear it your reminded of it.The only complaint I have is the first stanza is a little too subtle compared to the rest of the song. It might drive these wussys away cause they arent expecting such emotion..this is for people that need real emotion behind what they think and not just another Jagged Edge like ballad with lyrics that are never clear enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst song I've ever heard","review":"Eamon is the worst music act I've ever heard. he sounds a lot like Justin timberlake, Girlie.

I found more humor in the song myself just because of the contrast of the lyrics and the slow beat, yet at the same time, the beat sets the mood of the song. If you look at this song and judge it solely by the profanity, then I'd say you will probabaly despise the song. Now I can't say you will like Eamon's voice either. Not many people can truly sing though...just go to a karaoke bar, you'll see what I mean. All in all, I think it's a great song, and it's one of a kind in it's own class. I can't recall any songs in the past which go into a story like the one in this song, and the artist just gets as blunt as raw emotion would go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Ok.. I admit, this guys voice is ok. Its kinda weird, but nice to listen to. He can sing.

The song would be 10 times better without the swearing. He was saying how much this girl meant to him.. and he seemed sad, but now hes talking all this sh*t because she cheated on him. I mean, is it just me.. or is it stupid when he says \\"Those gifts I gave you, throw them away, and the kisses didnt mean jack\\"? If those kisses/gifts he gave her while he was with her didnt mean anything, then he was sending her false emotions. No wonder she cheated on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eamon Doyle is Awesome!","review":"I never heard an artist with such a wide range of skill. The CD is a must buy, Eamon has a sick voice.

The lyrics are simply awful...","review":"This is simply such an awful song and it is so overrated, I can't believe people can actually enjoy this. The lyrics got on my nerves the first time I ever heard this song and it gets worse every time I have to listen to it...His whining is so incredibly annoying, it is absolutely impossible for me to even tell whether or not at least the music has got some qualities.

This further proves why I should become a singer because this guy has no talent and neither do I, as far as singing. If he can come out with this crap, so can I, and I'm cuter. I thought Mark Morrison's Return of the Mack was trash, but I can tolerate that, but this mess, NO! Why this song has gained so much popularity may just be because of the bashing that most people can relate to after being in bad relationships, but goodness, that voice, if you can even call it that is such a disgrace!

Ah, but this is music that is played on my radio station - a station which plays music that I like. Therefore, after listening to this song, I do have every right to be reviewing it (and being a professional DJ does not make you any smarter than the rest of us).This song is terrible in every way -the girly singing, the vulgar lyrics, and the same old worn out beat. If you like to listen to the same sounding music, then go ahead and buy this.

They cooked up a gumbo of cajun, Irish jig, Brazilian samba, jazz and traditional Quebecois - and that was just the first tune. Doc Martens turned magically into \\"laughing booties\\" and no one could stop from dancing. These guys are unbelievably good. Like nothing you have ever heard. But please please please, oh Amazon gods of e-commerce, go find their live CDs, like \\"En Spectacle\\". This group was meant to invade your living room for a PARTY."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES it!","review":"I bought this CD in anticipation of a 2 day car trip with my 20 month old son. He loves The Wiggles on TV and now he loves this CD too. We listened to it probably 3 times a day on our trip and it always made him happy - a big deal because he doesn't love the car. All of the songs are very upbeat and it includes most of his favorites from the TV show. My 2 nephews (4 and 5) also loved listening to it and sang along with their favorite songs. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Practical?","review":"If you are teaching or learning EKG's this is not the book for you! Although this book is initially inviting because of the color (it is much easier to measure strips on colored ECG paper) the measurements in the back are wrong in the appendix and are confusing to learners. This book also does not have \\"beginning\\" strips to learn, or typical strips for that matter. There are limited examples (50) to identify and that is NOT sufficient for learning ECG's. With the price of this book I would highly suggest another choice...any choice for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader friendly","review":"I liked this book because the chapters were so small.

No spiritual kiddie pool here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and mellow","review":"I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the sound of singers like Jennifer Knapp, Sarah McLauglin, and Ginny Owens.

There are many choices out there,but I must say I am soooo thankful that I found Sara Groves. My favorite song is \\"The Word\\" but all of them are good. Others have said why this is so wonderful, but what I simply want to say it this album really says something and is beyond price. I also bought Past the Wishing which I just got. So far So great. I am glad that Sara got past the wishing. Hopefully we all can. God Bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this CD!","review":"This is an incredible CD. I saw Sara live, she is a very talented singer, musician and songwriter. I listen to this CD when I need to get focused on what is most important, my relationship with Jesus Christ. Some songs are like prayers, and others really cause me to reflect on my own life and what I could be doing better to truly walk with Him. The music is melodic and thoughtful to upbeat and fun, I truly enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sermons In Summer","review":"I've always wondered what a butterfly's wings would sound like if translated into human notes and now I have the answer; it is Sara Groves' voice. This cd is light, fresh and airy yet teaching the profound Truth. The instrumentation is simple and gentle and Sara is beautiful. No, not that kind of beauty but the kind of irresistible beauty that just glows from within. My favourite song probably is \\"Generations\\" but the entire cd is amazing especially the first several songs. There is a dash of something Julie Andrews-esque about a few of the songs (probably my imagination) and the song \\"How Is It Between Us?\\" has a Dionne Farris feel to it but you still come away knowing that this is uniquely Sara, quietly singing but serving you a cool, refreshing, honest sermon-ade. And I'm loving it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I heard All Right Here before Conversations, though Conversations came out first. While I'm glad to see that Sara grew and evolved into something wonderful (All Right Here) and that I heard the better CD first, I'm not impressed with her older works. I would not have picked up any of her other music if I had heard this first.Perhaps I am a rare Christian, but mainstream \\"God this/God that\\" music doesn't interest me - it all sounds the same, making it feel bland, repetitive, and in a way, depressing. There are some Christian musicians who figure out how to do Christian music right...Jennifer Knapp, for instance. Or Sara Groves in All Right here."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this album doesn't touch you, nothing will!","review":"This album is one of, if not, THE BEST thing I've listened to. Sara's music and lyrics really speak to the heart and the soul. My friend bought this album for me specifically for me to hear \\"Hello Lord\\" because I have been facing some rather difficult decisions lately. Even though I am still facing the situation, this song gave me comfort in knowing the the Lord is working through my problems, even if I can't see his work right at the moment, and to just be patient and LISTEN! I would recommend this CD to anyone.

The reception is great, he takes one outside and leaves one with me so we can talk and he can check in with me. He has only taken them out into the front yard and across the cul de sac, so I'm not sure what kind of range they get but for short distances they are crystal clear. So far he has dropped them on the floor multiple times and left them on all night. They have not shown any signs of falling apart and battery life is looooong.

He totally flipped out with excitement when he opened the package. This set is not actually a toy. It is the real thing--not top of the line, but not a toy either. This kid knew that and was very, very impressed. He, his teenage brother and sister and even his Dad are getting a lot of milage from this gift.

I also found some of the examples to reinforce negative stereotypes about the borderline patient's anger, which simply do not jibe with a lot of clinical experience that is more nuanced and subtle.Also, the insistence that anger simply equates the \\"abuser role\\" and other shortcuts that the authors use belie the complexity of not just these patients' emotions, but anyone's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mala Fe album","review":"As much as I love Merengue and Mala fe's music, This album sucked.

In my experience working with 2 to 6 year olds, ALL children are extremely kind and good! In fact, I am constantly blown away by how inherently good, kind and innocent they are. (And I wonder what on earth happens to us to make us change as we get older!) Yes, there are always fights, squabbles, cruel words, etc., in any daycare center or kindergarten, but these are a tiny, tiny portion of any day. Paley is a wonderful writer and she tells the truth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"myopic, absurd, and ultimately all about paley","review":"It's unclear why Paley would even want to publish a book that is so absurdly indifferent to the facts of life. Doesn't she care about her dubious reputation? Yes, children are capable of great acts of kindness, but you'd have to be living on Mars not to recognize that children are equally capable of cruelty. Paley's simplistic view is so saccharine and unhelpful that it defies explanation. Paley's primary interest, it seems, is to put her own self on stage--to be the heroine in the lives of the kids she cursorily encounters. She's pleased as punch with herself and can hardly stop marveling at her own genius, even goes so far as to wonder out loud whether she should reveal her true identity to a stranger she meets on the beach ... as if she were a rock star in disguise. Read Robert Coles' The Moral Intelligence of Children for a real look at how the best in our kids can be brought out and strengthened."},{"rating":"1","title":"What dream world does the author live in?","review":"Paley must have been one of those kindergarten teachers who were off humming to themselves while her students were beating the tar out of their unfortunate \\"playmates.\\" Children are not sweet little angels, most of them are utter horrors who have to be taught to be good and kind-sometimes it works, sometimes not. Paley's rose-tinted view of childhood, straight out of Little Lord Fauntleroy and Pollyanna, reads as amusing fiction for one who suffered at the hands of her \\"kind\\" schoolmates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cybermen story ever","review":"Returning to Nerva Beacon from Skaro (in 'Genesis of the Daleks') to rejoin the TARDIS, the Doctor, Sarah and Harry arrive some 1000 years earlier than when they left.

And lurking out in space are the Cybermen...The first appearance of the Cybermen in 7 years, and sadly a very poor story. In the broad, the story sounds fine, but (as the saying goes) the devil is in the detail.

There is still good material on the album much of it re-runs of his standards - like fishing blues with a little bit of added narrative which is not all that meaningful.Some of the songs sound like he used a drum machine.I really think your money is better spent on an album like \\"Giant Step\\" the kids won't care that it wasn't made specifically for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd Sucks.","review":"I have never been a huge Taj Mahal fan, and this Cd is what completely turned me off him.

Instead, it dissolves quickly and easily with just a few stirs. It's the right serving size, too... filling but not over-sized. Some other brands are so large, there are actually TWO servings in the cardboard cup. (Read the labels if you don't believe me!) Now how are you supposed to handle that - throw half away? Store it in your desk? Right. I like the vegetables and the balanced seasoning in the Nile Spice version of Split Pea Soup; again, it's just right.

Detail is lacking in loud sections, a characteristic of several other SACDs I've heard (but never from Telarc).

He is an awesome performer, having lots of fun up on the stage, and so relaxed while he is performing. When I bought his cd, it was like being at the concert all over again. What an amazing list of songs! There is not a one you would want to skip over! His voice is just incredible! His band was very complimentary to him, too. They were all smiling and having a great time! Keep up the great work!! This has just been one of the best cd's I've bought in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Currington --True Country Singer","review":"\\"Walk A Little Straighter\\" is the best country CD I have bought in a long time. Billy's voice is pure country. The unique writing of each ballad transforms the listener into the song, makes you feel like you are there experiencing every word.The CD provides the listener with more than just everyday ballads. Traditional country, swing, romance, heartache, happiness, and just plain fun along with a spirited instrumentation makes this CD is a MUST for any country music collector. It is hard to pick a favorite song. All deserve more than 5 stars. My recommendation for the next single is Time With You. Billy gives this true to life romantic song special meaning with his powerful vocals. After listening to this song, who wouldn't want to sweep their love one off to a romantic getaway? Billy Currington is a name that will be around Music City for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy!!!","review":"Billy Currington's self titled CD is a must buy for any country music fan. Billy is a talented singer/songwriter that can have you swinging with such titles as I Got a Feeling and Where The Girls Are or slow dancing with his song Time With You. There is not a bad song on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all country music lovers!!","review":"Billy Currington has an amazing voice!!

Billy Currington is destined to be a big star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb CD","review":"This CD was surprisingly good. Actually, I bought this CD not liking the first single, Walk a Little Straighter, too much. But, I listened to a few other song previews on this CD and realized that Billy Currington has true talent and decided to buy his CD. The songs on this CD, even Walk a Little Straighter, show such depth and his voice carries out the emotion trying to be conveyed. Growin' Up Down There gives a fun, great view of life growing up in a small town while Time With You is a powerful song about love that captures the idea of love in a hectic world so wonderfully. Next Time and Hangin Around are also favorites of mine. But, in reality, all the songs on this CD are amazing and any true music fan should appreciate the music on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen Clay","review":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!! That sums it up. This album is so good. It is an album that you could listen to over and over and over again.

He is going to be big and he is going to get there fast! Way to go Billy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Read","review":"I found this text extremely poorly written. Run-on sentences and excessive use of adjectives were rampant making it difficult to ream the meaning out of most of the sections. I looked through the entire text for a single example of a clearly written and concise statement and was disappointed.

We religiously cleaned the box as well as surrounding areas frequently, according to the directions. Due to the fact that there are SO many parts, this became more time consuming than just sifting from a 'less technical' litter box. It worked well... for about a week. The motor was too slow/underpowered, so it would get caught in the middle of the box during sifting. After about two months, we had to prop up one side in order to get the sifter to go through the litter completely without getting caught. Unfortunately the sifter gets pushed up, so dirty clumps get caught on the bottom. FINALLY about three weeks ago, our Purrforma stopped working altogether, only 8 months after the original purchase. What a waste of $250."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Concept But Out-of-Date","review":"The first part of the book has a good description of practical hints about shooting effectively on location. This part is very good. However, the larger part of the book is an out-of-date country by country description.

Anyone with more than a passing knowledge of late 19th C history or military history will have their teeth on edge throughout this whole book. The book is competently written but the historical errors the author makes are inexcusable. Factual research on any of the \\"situations\\" Lt Crofton finds himself in is easily available in any public library. The author embarrasses himself with his inaccuracies on Custer, the Little Big Horn Battle, US Cavalry, weapons, West Point, Cuban Independence movement, Zulu War, etc. I cannot recommend this book as historical fiction but if you find a (free)copy in an airport and have a long layover go ahead; just don't expect to learn anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I'm a nut for historic fiction and I was very excited about this book's release. It had been hyped up to me by a few friends, so when I read it, my expectations were high. And I wasn't disappointed.Coplin's writing style is addictive - I hardly put this book down, and it only took me a day or so to read it. So much happens in this novel. There isn't really a dull moment. Even when Crofton isn't fighting in a war, it's still exciting. Crofton is a really likable character as well, because he's like a flawed hero. He has real problems just like all of us do, so you can really identify with him throughout the book. There are crazy twists that are just exciting.I really loved this book. I think it's unfair to compare it to other works because this book is really one of a kind. It's an addictive read, with a great story and terrific writing. You should definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH!","review":"Some people will do anything for money. The producers of this compilation apparently belong in that category. The only track with any hit status is track #1 \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\". Do yourself a favor...AVOID this.

The music is in the best tradition of Carter's past recordings ('So What','The Bass and I'). Quiet, cool jazz, now with a touch of Latin culture. Certainly his bass is superb, his quiet hand is behind the band in every note, but it's not a 'bass plus five' band, it's a real sextet with carefully arranged solos for each instrument. Special thanks to Bill Frisell for excellent electric guitar solos. Also, the album is very carefully produced, so the bass sounds natural on any kind of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill does NOT save the day on this one....","review":"After the first few promising bars, the wind chimes kick in and you know that this lightweight recording is far, far less than the sum of its parts. After running through it a few times, it's going right to the used bin. While Bill turns out a couple of nicely lyrical solos, he, like the rest of the band phones it in.

If anyone wants to hear a recording of the Four Seasons garanteeing not to put you to sleep, I can't recommend this one enough.

I enjoy Indian music and most experimental music. Indipop is fertile ground for some truly original and exciting music. But this isn't it.The overarching impression this album left me was that of an underdeveloped, juvenile artist (approximately 8th grade). In other words, the experiment flopped. I cannot listen to this album without constantly hearing John Cage, Yoko Ono, Brian Eno and Ofra Haza and even the Art of Noise. I enjoy many of these artist because their art is authentic.

At larger magnification distances, the image becomes very blurry, unsaturated, and distorted, not to mention that it has to be pitch black to actually see the image, which you will be squinting to make out. The 6\\" max paper size also too small for anything complex, and the sides fall off significantly in brightness and focus.My recommendation to anyone who will be using this to blow up images (I used it for paintings), is to get an overhead projector instead. I can't believe I struggled with this thing for two years, when an overhead will give you an incredibly straighter, brighter, and sharper image. If you are worried that making transparencies is going to be a pain, almost all inkjet printers will make a beautiful transparency if you get decent quality film (the Inkpress transparency film works really well on my Epson)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely adequate for any artist","review":"I have used this projector and a stand for over two years, using it for pencil composition overlays for paintings. The unit is nicely designed, light weight, and easy to use. The problem with it is the poor optical quality, it must be used in a pitch black room and if you are enlarging a photo, many times the image is so blurry, that it is difficult to determine when it is in focus. It is mainly only good for getting a rough idea of where you are placing objects in the painting, any detail work needs to be drawn by eye. Another problem is the image window size of only 7\\"x7\\", which means you may need to project large photos and materials at a smaller size or in pieces, to get them to fit into the small window size. I am now in the process of replacing this opaque projector with a digital projector that can be connected directly to my computer, I feel it is a better use of money to pay a little more and get a more usable piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent condition","review":"Received this item quickly and in mint condition.

It definitely helps to be familiar with the writings of Meher Baba prior to reading this book so that you understand who the author, William Donkin, is and what he was trying to accomplish, namely create a chronicle of Meher Baba's arduous travels to contact masts.

You're given extremely detailed info as to the appearance and habits of various masts but only from a dry, superficial and external perspective -- never any juicy insights into their subjective experience. Masts are categorized as a 1st level or 5th level, etc. but the basis for the categorization seems arbitrary and baseless to me and I've studied higher consciousness experiences for over 30 years. The descriptions nof Meher Baba's work with the masts can be summarized as caring for their physical needs, and that's it!! -- again no insights into the subjective interactions going on. Devotees of Meher Baba are likely to find some inspiration into these stories, but I recommend anyone else to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD","review":"This is not a review of the movie, but a criticism of the MGM DVD release.

Miguel (Sinatra) and a mob of Spanish peasants (and let's not forget Sofia Loren!) beat the Brit to the punch and lug that massive piece of artillery all over hell and half of Madrid and finally use it in a typical Hollywood battle. Along the way, both Grant and Sinatra vie for Loren's affections.(Gee who saw that comming ???) Both the book and this film are a major a stinkeroo!

Please don't. It is terrible book that I, an art student, couldn't read for longer than two pages in a sitting. It felt over my head, because even though it is categorized as an art book it is in fact a psychology book. When I asked other students if they were having similar troubles with it, they all agreed, saying that even when they reread the paragraphs several times they still didn't grasp the concepts. The author is far too long-winded as well and feels that she must repeat the same thing over an over to drive the point home, when really each chapter could be reduced to one question.

The book is a great concept - give a book of problems and enough information on the theory to solve them, including some step-by-step examples. And, sometimes, it works well. What kills it are the repeated glaring errors in the answers it gives for the questions - so far, I'd venture to say that, after the first couple chapters, more then 10% of the answers are wrong, be it from swapping a sign someplace or an outright mistake in understanding on the part of the person who solved the problem.

First of all the phone has NEVER and I mean NEVER failed me! This will be the 5th Sanyo I have owned, starting with the faithful 4500, and have never been let down. I have seen numerous complaints about sound quality, but short of the volume being a little low on occasion, I cannot see too much fault. The speakerphone is only half-duplex, but most cell phone speakerphones are only HD at the moment. Also you cannot expect board room sound out of a tiny micro-sized speaker! It does very well for its size. Ready link performance is top rate, as well. All in all another great Sanyo product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Phone But...........","review":"Having just sent a Samsung A-500 swimming off of Catalina Island, I decided to try a change of pace with the Sanyo 8200. As others have noted, the Functions and Menus on this phone are outstanding. The Camera is a lot of fun and really preforms pretty well.That being said, I'm really dissappointed with this phones sound quality. When listening to callers with the phone flipped open, you'd swear that each and every one of your callers has swallowed a bag full of cotton or marbles. The calls sound downright horrible. It only gets worse once you plug in the earbud. Turning up the volume only distorts the call even worse.I'd love to keep this gadget friendly phone but will be switching back to the Samsung.

If you use your phone for business calls, like I do, look elsewhere unless you want to constantly ask your customers to repeat themselves. Just recently I have been facing the battery charging issue mentioned by several of the other reviewers. I am disappointed that this product does not live up to the service I received from my previous Sanyo's. I will say that the other features of the phone have been okay, but overall I would not recommend this phone. I spoke with Sprint several times regarding the voice issue and either they didn't care or dismissed it as bad reception.

The title track, definitely the best song on the album, is a bold statement that God's grace is waiting there for us, no matter what we do. \\"There You Are\\" is by far the most upbeat track on the album, electric guitars and all...However, it's the slower songs that are more lyrically profound, like \\"No Place So Far\\", \\"Hold On To Jesus\\" (written for Quinn), and \\"Damaged Goods\\".

This means that prospective students will increasingly forsake California colleges for those in other states. This will in turn starve our universities of the very students and funds necessary for their survival. These schools will increasingly become underfunded wards of the state, much as the California state college system is today.THIS is the legacy of Ms. Washburn's groundless fear of 'corporate corruption' of her precious academic purity.

Dr. Jaffe explains the grieving process to adults so they may help their young children work through this complicated process. She accomplishes this in a way that allows even small children to ask questions and express feelings that may be confusing and unfamiliar to them. The activities are very simple, yet allow the small child an outlet to express himself in all these unfamiliar emotions. Dr Jaffe explains grieving in very simple terms so the adult who is guiding his/her child through this process of grieving can be of the greatest comfort and help to his/her child. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has experienced a loss in the family and has a child who is also struggling with this loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Taiko recording I've heard!","review":"Even though Portland taiko is not as big as some other taiko groups in the US or Japan, this is one quality recording! Better sound quality than most of the recordings by taiko masters like Kodo! Taiko are instruments that produce a great amount of sound with very rich overtones and this makes it very hard to record. Portland Taiko recorded this one in a theater big enough for that amount of sound with a great sound engineer who obviously knew what he was up against. From the big drums, the big Okedo and Odaiko, to the little dums and percussion instruments, this recording is crystal clear and has great depth.

Also, my skin is fair, and as the directions state can happen, I experienced angry red spots where the device was applied. I ended up returning it and will stick with warm, wet soaks for emerging break-outs. I certainly don't discourage trying it out since other reviews indicate it can work effectively, but unfortunately it didn't perform as hoped for my specific skin issues.

Two and a half minutes is far too long if you have more than one pimple to treat. 5 pimples at 2 treatments a day comes out to 25 minutes not including the ridiculous warm up times this thing has. Good luck using Zeno without standing in a mirror and repositioning the tiny treatment plate every 2 seconds to make sure it is touching in the proper spot. Not to mention that the tip has to be replaced every x number of days.As for results, I wasn't able to see results using the zeno. Maybe this is due to the fact that I simply didn't have enough time to do the proper number of treatments on each pimple.

I am very glad I did as I have found it to be highly effective in eliminating pimples. In fact , I have seen a reduction in eliminating pimples on certain areas of my face after using Zeno.

Even though I was now a few days beyond Amazon's 30 day return period, they did the right thing and sent me a new Zeno. Thank you Amazon!

Silver convention is, of course, through and through 1970's disco. But I love the idea of vocalizing without a lead: the harmonies become another instrument.

Also nice to just relax and view the country side and let the GPS tell me in plenty of time which way to turn. Finds really great short cuts, and verbal prompts so not to miss any turns.

Our bathroom sink was draining very slowly and drain cleaners were not helping. So, I was planning on taking the drain pipes and trap apart to solve the problem. Not necessarily a difficult task, but I wasn't looking forward to emptying out the vanity, the mess, etc. So, when I saw this for such a low price, I thought why not? And, here is what happened: I inserted it into the drain and pulled it back and out came a disgusting clump of black goo, hair, etc. I rinsed that off (swirling it in the toilet...don't tell my wife) then repeated this a few times until it came back clean. That sink now drains like it was brand new! The instructions say to throw away after use.

Finally I gave up.A few days later I bought a \\"Cobra Products 650 Air Drain Blaster\\" form a nearby store. Although I saw it on Amazon I was not convinced of its effectiveness.

I think it has something to do with it not being quite long enough to reach the clog in my drain.

I swear if a spaceship crashed landed in his backyard he could fix it. Anyway I listened to him and the item worked great. Cleared the drain, of course it won't work if the clog is farther down the drain than the item reaches.It is a 100% better alternative than using chemical agents to clear the drain. Also, the package says to use once and throw away. The reasoning is the sharp teeth might cut you while cleaning. Well I cleaned mine fine, granted it is cheap at about $3.00 but I like to try to reuse something before just throwing it away.This should be your first step when unclogging a drain, before using a sink plunger, chemicals or calling someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Disgusted...& Pleased.","review":"I rarely review products that I don't buy directly from Amazon, but I have to toss in my $.02 on this one. I was SHOCKED at how easy this was! As long as you have a relatively shallow clog, this little thing will work miracles. I used it in both my tub drain (which was draining veeeeeeeerry slow) and my bathroom sink, which wasn't giving me any problems, but I figured while I was at, why not? The mess I pulled out was truly horrifying. So glad I wore gloves, a mask, and lab glasses. It was seriously that gross.Just as a word of advice--this works by getting the \\"teeth\\" snagged into the clog. Those same teeth can get caught on your drain or on joints in the pipe, so while you'll probably encounter some resistance, DON'T FORCE IT! Try to push it back down and wiggle it loose--this will help avoid breakage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than liquid decloggers","review":"With out a doubt better than any of the liquid brands. Those bottles are like $7 and they didn't do anything to declog my bathtub drain. I used the zip-it. And it is tricky to get down the drain at first because the bathtub drain goes vertical for an inch and then all the way horizontal. So you have to do some manuevering. Its also very durable.But once I found out the trick, I kept at it. And after about 15 minutes of using the zipit I was able to get about 2 tennis ball size of hair from the drain. It was disgusting, but also very cool at the same time.Pays for itself literally on the first try, no more wasting money on the expensive liquid crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"My shower drain was not working well because of my wife's long hair being stuck in it but use this one time and it clears right up!

It didn't make a noticeable difference in the water flow. I imagine that's different for everybody.As for cleaning it or not, I would say absolutely try to clean it, unless you have some thick gunk hopelessly tangled in the sharp teeth and you'd risk hurting yourself. In my case, I just rinsed it (above the toilet so the \\"catch\\" wouldn't end up in the sink again) and all the stuff easily came off.Store it in the package it came out of it. You don't want those sharp teeth lying around without any cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for hair clogs in the shower!","review":"LOVE this product. Bought one 10 years ago and am just now looking to replace it since the 'teeth' are really wearing down after all the years of use.

I will be getting one of these to keep next to every sink I own.There is no way that one of those little velcro things could have worked as well.

It looks more like a zip tie for garbage bags than something that could unclog a drain. It was only 18 inches, so I'm not even sure it reached the clog. When I used the handle to rotate inside the pipe, it got twisted and started bending. When I pulled it out, it was almost unusable and all bent up without any debris from the pipe. This is definitely a light duty tool, that should have had 3 or more in the pack. I bought this at a store that didn't have any other options. If there were a true plumber's snake or auger there, I definitely would have bought that instead. Buy the real deal with at least 5 feet of metal with some heft behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"This product is amazing!

I had to unscrew and remove the blasted pop-up stopper anyway, in order to free the Zip-It. If you are going to remove your pop-up stopper, you might as well use a bent shirt hanger. It's cheaper than a Zip-It and works almost as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zip it, failed","review":"Just got my Zip It with high hopes that FINALLY the drain in my sink would be moving again. But my dreams of having flowing water moving down the pipes were dashed! After getting the Zip it down the drain rather easily, pulling it back slowly as directed, nothing came up. Nada, nothing. OH, maybe a tiny speck, spot ( and I mean tiny) of dark grease but nothing else. So I tried again and again, but...nada! At least I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. So now I'll be off to buy what another poster suggested; \\"Power Hair and Grease drain cleaner\\" by Scotch. I am so disappointed.

The rest of the gang have a hunch things aren't what they appear to be and the stage is set for a showdown between a classic horror creature and a beloved cartoony dog.Except for the fact that, well, the monster wasn't exactly who he was, this story reminded me of some of the old Abbot and Costello monster movies.

This is the artist at his most intimate, contemplative best. If you like spare, gorgeous solo piano improvisations that are musical meditations rather than compositions per se - you'll love this cd. I have a number of Mr. Budd's cds, and they're all wonderful. All with a kind of reverb/watery shimmer to the sound & feel of his piano on them. This one though is sans reverb/effects. Seems just like its he & his piano - in the listener's living room playing just for you & what you get is the simple acoustic beauty of Mr. Budd at the piano playing just for you alone. Each of the selections on this cd blend seamlessly into the next. The overall effect is one of a soothing, cleansing, gentle musical phosphorescence that nourishes heart & soul. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"No ordinary pianist","review":"It occurred to me the other day that within my vast CD collection, Harold Budd is the artist whose name appears on the most albums. This has happened quietly and without fuss over more than two decades.La Bella Vista, reportedly recorded impromptu and without Harold's knowledge at the time, explains why. He is truly the master of an instrument that I had, prior to listening to him play, little time for. I had always found the piano quite an overwhelming and jarring instrument, and for the most part still do.But this music is just sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeemoriies..Talking bout' memories","review":"The other day..maybe really months ago, I had an incredible dream and it was this: It was an incredibly lucid dream of me in the mind and body of a crawling baby on a shaggy rug in a foreign room, with foreign wallpaper. There was an female adult(never saw her before) sitting in a love chair watching me crawl. I felt with my mind what it was like to be a conscious breathing crawling baby. To see out of its eyes, trying to keep its neck up. I noticed the fragility and newness of my limbs. Most importantly, I (what an epiphany here, folks) realized that my consciousness now was the same when I was a baby. Perhaps even more important was the familiarity(like I had been there before)I felt in that strange room with that strange person. It was not unlike a Quantum Leap episode.Harold Budd's La Bella Vista, does alot of the same thing that this dream did. What a fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blitzkrieg","review":"WOW, what a great album.

The magnets are too small and not very sturdy or heavy. It is quite tedious to design something or to follow the designs provided in the kit. There is no easy way to keep track of the tiles so we ended up putting each color in a baggie but they are not easy to get out of the baggies once they are in there. They are so small it is very difficult not to lose them and very easy to vacuum them up. The box showed many more designs than are provided and of course my daughter wanted to make one of the designs for which there was no provided key. We tried counting tiles from the picture on the box but it was too difficult for her. Overall it is somewhat fun but not the hit I had hoped and not something she seems to be picking up and using over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful art at your fingertips","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm way over 13. :) I've been interested in mosaic making for a long time but don't have a studio with all the requisite tools and materials to make mosaics and space to store them. This magnetic mosaic gives me the perfect opportunity to create beautiful pieces on my living room table.The mosaic isn't actually a toy, but rather the means for creating pieces of art. It's most suitable for a patient person who enjoys mosaic making. The mosaic projects take quite a bit of time to complete and are a great way to zone out (almost zen-like) and think of anything or nothing beyond the colors and shapes.The product description is acurate -- that's exactly how the mosaic looks, and it's great.

Even with Devi's suicide attempt, her affair ( apparently with her brother-in-law) , miscarriage, temporary muteness, divorce ( of Devi's sister), desperate house-wife ( Devi's mother ) , an ultra modern grandma and recipes like Lamb clitoris , the book fails to impress.

That being said, my collection is quite large and so I feel that I am somewhat of an authority on the genre. This book looked promising, but fails in several areas.

The plot (without giving anything away) is badly executed, the climax leaving me wanting to throw the book across the room (I did, and only finished it a month later because I had nothing else to read).

The biggest problem is the introductory material. Each track starts with an introduction, first in English and then in Spanish. While it is nice to know something about the songs, it is a long span of talking before each track and it quickly (like, the second time through) becomes very irritating having to wait for the end of the intro to hear each song. If they had only made the introductions into separate tracks it would have been much better-- you could skip over the intros when you didn't want to hear them. The other problem is a matter of personal taste-- after wading through the intro material, most of the songs are just not appealing to me. Yes, there are some fun instruments and unusual sounds, but for the most part the songs themselves just don't move me. For kids Spanish songs, I much prefer the Sesame Street \\"Fiesta Songs!\\" album and the Jose-Luis Orozco albums (especially \\"Diez Deditos\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This collection of songs is truly fantastic!

It is really taking you of on that african journey.The wise tortoise explains all the zulu songs and stories. With lots of clicks and animal sounds you can try to copy. One of the classic songs is The Lion Sleeps Tonight. But it is preformed in an more authentic way. That \\"aaawwwiiii!\\" is a word, I'm guessing and not some mad women screaming.Like almost with all African songs, rythm, drumming and clapping hands are basic ingredients. There is also a children choir who preforms. Songs are in Zulu and English language.As Fudugazi (the tortoise) wisely stated; \\"There is magic in these songs; close your eyes and listen, and you will feel the magic too!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I have the \\"Journey of Dreams\\" CD by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It is delightful, swirling, singing music by a group of men from Africa. I liked it so much that I bought another CD \\"by\\" the same group called the \\"Gift of the Tortise. A Musical Journey Through Southern Africa\\". Most of it consists of a lady talking- not singing- about the animals, places, and people of Africa. In a couple of places ordinary children are heard singing in the screechy, ordinary way children sing. Every ten minutes or so, a muted male voice sings briefly in the background. There seems to be a big difference between what the producers of this CD consider artistic freedom and what I consider a bait and switch rip off.

The video and sound are great. The video was mastered in High Def (16x9) and the picture shows that (wait till we get a High Def DVD!). Barry sounds great, does a lot of his standard songs and some new ones from his broadway show. Full orchestra backup. I don't know how long Barry can keep belting out those ballads..not easy songs to do for as long as he has been doing them. This is a definitive video. My only question is the sound mastering. It is done in DD/DTS 4.0, which in this case means no center channel sound. I don't understand the engineer's choice on this as I much prefer an \\"anchored\\" voice in the middle. The engineer could have blended some of the vocal in the center. Ah well, a small problem. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Concert!!!!!","review":"Barry Manilow is one of the greatest entertainers today. I purchased this DVD yesterday and I wasn't dissapointed. When Barry opens the show with \\"Could It Be Magic\\", The crowd is on their feet. Barry performs a lot of his classic hits such as: \\"Mandy\\", \\"Daybreak\\", \\"Copacabana\\", \\"Can't Smile Without You\\" & \\"I Write The Songs\\". I love when Barry plays the kazoo on the song, \\"Flight Of The Bumblebee\\". Barry also performs songs from his hit musical: \\"Harmony\\". This DVD is for any Barry Manilow fan. Way to go Barry!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album in Many Years!","review":"I've been waiting for this album to come out for a long time. I was lucky enough to see John at Eden Park in Cincinnati last year in May or June and he played a couple of his new songs. Both songs were great, and the full album is even better (although it's been a long time coming). This album seems to have more of a feel like the John Anderson of the '80s. The best song by far is \\"The Call\\", followed closely by \\"It Ain't Easy Being Me\\". \\"I Ain't Afraid of Dying\\" and \\"Appalacian Blue\\" are classic John Anderson at his best. Best Country Album To Come Out In A Long Time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good....:(","review":"This dvd is less than an hour long. Unfortunately, you learn absolutely nothing for half of it. Most of the movements are repetitive in content and the explanations are not even good. Also, the editing is very poor, as the instructor messes up his descriptions way too many times for a professional dvd. I find it hard to believe that \\"Hypno\\" put this out, since his stuff is typically much better. Air walk is not a common dvd topic, so I appreciate the undertaking. However, I don't think anyone should spend money on this particular dvd. I would watch it for free because there are about 5 total minutes of useful information. Hopefully this guy can try again and deliver a real instructional dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy for the price!","review":"I was really excited to receive the Bushnell Instant Replay as a birthday present. However, I quickly learned that it's an incredibly difficult binocular to operate. First of all, I had trouble opening the battery compartment cover. I had to pry it out with a knife after many unsuccessful attempts. Then I had a hard time installing the Flash Memory card. The instruction booklet was terrible and did not mention the right way to instal it. I installed it the wrong way and it got jammed so I had to pry it out with a pair of pliers!! After doing all that, I got the camera to work. Then I decided I had to instal the software - the driver and the Photosuite. The driver was installed easily. Not so the Photosuite. After three attempts, the icon did not appear nor did it appear on Programs.

This was such a great deal compared to a small kit that we bought at a book store. The other kit was also by scratch art and was called scratch magic glitter board. These were smaller more like heavy cardstock and the background was black not white. These were easier to scratch than the white paper and the white left a little residue behind.

Balsamo shines in that version with an amazingly wide range and incredible heart-wrenching \\"Gethsemane\\", while Carter is much better suited to the smaller role he plays here.As an added bonus, this recording features Alice Copper as King Herod, in a delightfully different twist on the role. This recording's available as both a highlights CD and a full two disc set, so you can enjoy the entire show including Zubin Varla's Judas singing a terriffic \\"Damned for All Time/Blood Money\\".Don't waste your money on Glenn Carter's horrible butchering of this wonderful musical, get Balsamo's version, and you'll be much more pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Ever???

Any JCS neophytes would be best advised to check out other recordings. If you think this ... sounds good, you'll be blown away by earlier recordings. To my knowledge, Could We Start Again Please? has been featured on a large percentage of the recordings dating back to 1971 Broadway and has been a permanent fixture in the show since then as well.

Like Van Hunt, there is plenty of soul and creativity to her lyrics. Unlike Hunt, there are a few too many appearances of the overused pop/dance sound. Maria's voice is potentially a great seller and the popular sound should have granted her more exposure, but somehow pop listeners missed the mark on her. The uptempo songs such as \\"Hate to Love You\\" and \\"Coffee in Bed\\" are less than outstanding. However, with sincere ballads like \\"Miss You\\" and \\"Intoxicating\\" or the electrifying yet honest desire of \\"Always\\" and \\"Simplified\\", My Soul is a sure winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we listening to the same album?","review":"There was nothing special about this album.

It seemed to me as if was a CD made from what someone thought was an \\"R&B\\" blueprint. If I wouldn't recommend this CD to people who are fans of Soul.

Now I'm looking to hear from Maria again. She's like my new Chant'e Moore (but not) her music and words I found some what haunting sweet and seductive.

If instead of a visitor from Venus the man Helmut Dantine were, say, a visitor from Tonga, the required changes in the script would be minimal, and the locals' astonishment at his speaking impeccable Oxford English might perhaps be even greater. Although one of the most unbearably boring sci-fi movies of all times, \\"Stranger from Venus\\" provides first-rate documentary evidence of the profound, meaningful changes which the notion of Alien (both terrestrial and extra-) has undergone in the intervening 50 years.

I would get standard rechargeable batteries instead of these sealed lead acid batteries. I decided not to replace the battery, because if the solar panels don't work either, then i'll be doubly screwed- I wouldn't be able to use the battery for anything else. Or the battery just might not fit. I read the product dimensions given by most SLA batteries, and they measure too small for this lantern's compartment.

The spotlight feature is moderately useful. The design is a little awkward for hanging (to read by), but the light produced is just a little less than needed for reading anyway.

It was fantastic!!! It's amazing to see how the jokes change in order to keep them contemporary. That's what I like about this DVD, it gives demonstrations in its extra features about that evolution.

My teenage boys also found this to be hilarious and wanted to see it more than once. Definitely a DVD for the whole family...I'm not a fan of the \\"Titus\\" scene-humor about cut off hands isn't my bag-but it was in the play...

The prologue is the best I think I've ever read anywhere, as far as getting the reader ready for the ride. Everybody loves haunted house stories. This one is a very good one. I liked The Haunting-I know a lot of people like it as well. This is The Haunting with teeth. In this novel, the reader is shown the terrors. Perhaps the bogies might rival Lovecraft. One thing for sure, this writer has not shortchanged anyone in creating this book. I won't be surprised to see a movie made from The Infinite. As for that, I think I'll be surprised if a movie isn't made. What can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrow House owes Shirley Jackson a Thank You.","review":"This is a great book, despite early comparisons to The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill, and most recently Rose Red.There will always be studies in the paranormal circles of haunted houses and the people who claim to have \\"special powers.\\" As we watch and read these studies, we often wonder, why the heck these people? Are they all psychologically damaged, emotionally needy people who are looking for the one thing to completely set them over the edge?Probably not, but that's the mixed bag you get with the psychics who are invited to study Harrow House in Watch Point, NY. A home with a storied past, most reently a fire tahat destroyed the school it used to harbor, it vibrates with the energies of past inhabitants, a battery which stores the most destructive of memories.I recommend this book for the ewasy-going style of Douglas Clegg and his ability to make you feel for even the most hateful charaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book builds to a quick ending.","review":"This books starts out like very interesting. I kept waiting for the supernatural to take hold, but instead I had to read 200 pages of character profile. When they finally reach the house your expecting the horror to begin.

Unfortunate because I thought the Halloween man was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real action until around page 300","review":"This was a long read in my opinion and definitely not one of Clegg's best. I have read quite a few of Clegg's books and have never found them boring but this one was an exception to the rule. If you like long drawn out novels then read this one otherwise you would be safer buying one of his other books such as The Halloween Man, You Come When I Call You or The Nightmare Chronicles.

I really like the author's style of writing (while the proofreader should have cought some GLARING screw-ups). I liked characters and the idea behind the book.I had problems with the over 200-page character set up and then nothing. The booked died as if it was hurried along just to finish. The so-called spooky bad guy free for all was all of the last 40 pages and then it was still a HUGE let down.This was not a very 'horror' horror book, unless you call the pulsing walls scary.(That was not even ten pages from the every end.)It needed a lot more spook and to be longer...or the character setup shorter.Don't buy it. Just don't.I am going to give the auther a second chance and pick up a different book. I want to see if it was him or the story that was the screw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the horror","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I read a lot about Clegg and his supposed great talent. I finished the book wondering where all the hype is coming from.The book had a promising start, and the long sections introducing the main characters added some emotional heft to the hovel.But let's fact it, most readers of horror books want something scary to happen. With \\"The Infinite\\" you are three-quarters of the way through the book before anything remotely scary, or horrifying, happens. Then it's over very quickly. Plus, what does happen really isn't all that interesting.People can criticize Stephen King all they want, but King, along with other writers such as Dan Simmons, know how to dole out the scares leading up to a big ending.With \\"The Infinite\\" it was all build-up and no pay off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The DVD started really good, but when it came to the songs he was singing, The sound quality was terrible.

The famous floating heads are gone, instead the heads pivot from the center of the assembly - i.e. they tilt away from your skin rather than into your skin. You end up trying to shave with the middle of the shaver assembly, where there is no cutting head.Also, they moved the trimmer inboard so it is hidden by your hand if you hold it the way you would normally. This you can adjust to.They need a major redesign of the detachable shaving head assembly. If they made the cutting heads pivot on their centers instead of from the inside edge, it would probably work and they could sell guys like me the redesigned shaving head assembly.

The concept is great, but after a month or so I noticed my father's shave wasn't as close. You cannot really clean this razor head. You cannot take the blades apart to clean them as in many of the older Norelco models. The whiskers then clog up in the razor head. I have found myself using a toothbrush handle and tapped on the razor head repeditively to losen things up and I could not believe the debris that continues to come out of the razor head even after the daily cleaning.

Yup - it looks cool, very avant garde, and high-tech.The results I experienced - after 4 weeks of trial as suggested by Norelco - is that I had to shave two or three times a day. I could have had far better results with a blade just once in the morning.I tried shaving in the shower - which Norelco says works better - with no better results than dry shaving. My razor is on the way back to Amazon for a refund.My compliments to Amazon for their return policy.

I was disappointed to find few popular song requests in the book and hard to play chord combinations for a \\"fake book\\" with little musical accompaniment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Piano fun!","review":"As a frustrated beginner, I found this book to be so much fun. Because of the ease with which it is written, it is encouraging to be able to sit and play and have the music sound as it should. I would recommend this to anyone from the beginner to the experienced as there is such a wide selection of songs to choose from in this one book. Great addition to any musician's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Song Book - Should be titled 300 songs","review":"This book has a very limited selection of songs from 1960 forward. I did a rough count and there is only about 300 songs from 1960 - 2000's. That's only 25%Hal Leonard Publishing definitely doesn't want you to know this, since they won't allow Amazon to publish the table of contents.I have uploaded the table of contents for 1960's - 2000's. Let's see if Amazon is allowed to keep them up on the site.I bought it and returned it. Hope you won't have to go through the same hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old wine in new bottles","review":"I totally agree.... All books should have a preview like the real thing in a real book shop. Looking at the index one can instantly make up one's mind whether it is what he is looking for or not. I'm stuck with a book which is too advanced and all because I had no way of knowing what was inside, I was led by the writeup of the author. Well anyway advertising is a sophisticated science of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE READER FROM GA","review":"I also would like to see the list of songs included in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient information","review":"Was interested but not being able to see what it actually consists of (view inside) I passed it by and spent $$$ at a brick and mortar store where I could look at what I was purchasing.Don't need a lot but not being a pro musician I have no idea what is actually in a fake book.This is the net folks, not a brick an mortar, wake up if you want to sell to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Heart of Rock & Roll\\"","review":"Hokay, so you can't list all the songs in the book. How about if it has a particular song. Huey Lewis & the News, \\"Heart of Rock & Roll\\"??? I'm looking everywhere for it. Any answers???"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother if you want music from the recent decades","review":"I'm over 30 and I have only heard of maybe 10% of the songs. A lot from the 1930's and so forth. Not a younger person's choice for pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not enough modern songs for my taste, but that's not the problem for me. The BIG disappointment for me was half of the pages falling out off most of the binding when I stood the book on its end. The plastic binding is too flimsy for the size of the book. Saw one reviewer who said they hole punched the thing, but for the price, I shouldn't have make an additional investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Inaccurate","review":"This book is incredibly inaccurate. A large portion of the songs have incorrect root notes, wrong and/or missing chords, misprints (flats that should be sharps, etc..) and out-of-sequence lyrics. The book is good for jogging the memory, but unless you are familiar w/ the tunes and have a good ear, it can't be relied on."},{"rating":"2","title":"More songs than you know what to do with","review":"There is bound to be some toe tapper that you will recognize in this volume. I bought one for myself, and told my older brother about it. Then he wanted one. My other bro came to visit and sat at the piano and started hopping from page to page. I had to get him one too, so I can keep mine around. Excellent for improv musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Science","review":"This is a great book to read. Even though you won't learn how to do anything. This book gives insight into things that have been available for a very long time. It helps you to understand the metaphysical and the mind better. It's a book that's not to be taken lightly. And I hope that the authors will come up with even more and an update for the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"and I worked in a toy store...","review":"This is a great album for kids and adults. I used to work in a toy store and this is one of three cd's we could listen to over and over. I recommend it to parents that don't want music to drive them nuts. If you like this album I also recomend Sweet Honey in the Rock (anything by them really). They have a great children's album, but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of it! The last album is by Los Lobos and nope can't remember the name of that one either. I'm not much help am I? Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is some of the best children's music we've ever heard.","review":"My kids have requested to listen to this CD endlessly. They love it and so do I! We never grow tired of listening to the music. It is so upbeat and educational at the same time. We have learned about Zydeco Music and the musical instruments that comprise it all while singing along, clapping, and tapping our feet. Thanks so much to the musicians that made this CD, they have given us so much enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant family favorite!","review":"Both my 2 year-old and 7-year old immediately loved this CD as well as my husband and I! Happy music, great for travelling and singing along to, with the added advantage of teaching a musical style in an entertaining way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for Kids and Adults","review":"I bought this for my son, who loves trains, but the whole family has enjoyed it. I enjoy the style of music, as well as several familiar songs with just the right amount of twist on them. Of course my son loves all of the songs about trains. He sings \\"Little Red Caboose\\" all the time! This CD teaches about music and culture both, in a fun way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total bounce","review":"Choo Choo Boogaloo is a great find for kids of any age. The first time my son heard it, he was 2 and almost jumped out of his car seat in the excitement of singing along with the title song. Now 7, he plays it often and races around the house to the music.Everything about this disc is adult-friendly as well. The narration is low-key, the music is great, and you won't get tired of hearing it over and over as you drive from pillar to post. They even add a little gratutious educational content at the end. Choo Choo Boogaloo will add bounce to any child's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product","review":"IThis CD has not worked and have tried it on several players. I have no recourse as I have not retained the paper work. Very disappointed as both Zydeco CDs I ordered were a disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, a favorite at play group!","review":"Lively music that gets the kids moving and the parents asking, \\"What music is this\\" (in a good way, lol). Love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult kids love it too!","review":"We first got this CD when it was new, about 17 years ago. My kids are now 18 and 20, soon to be 21. My daughter wants a copy for her 21st birthday. It gets set aside at times for maybe years at a time but it is always fun to dig it out and listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly becomes grating","review":"After a couple of these songs, the novelty sure wears off in a big way. The idea of trying to jump-start some of these just plain worn-out tunes such as Little Red Caboose, I've Been Working on the Railroad, of Skip to My Lou by reworking them in yet another musical genre is noble. But the younger kids don't really like the arrangements (neither do I), and older kids are already bored to death by the retreads. Like so many other attempts to exploit the kid's music market, this recording grates rather than elates.Your best bet is to check out the CD at your local library, let the kids listen to it for a couple of weeks, and spend your cash on some Trout Fishing in America CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choo Choo Lover's Mom","review":"This is a great CD and my 18 mo LOVES it. He now points to the CD player and says \\"Train Song\\" until I play it - again. It's great music for both kids and parents. My husband and I both find ourselves singing along."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is okay!","review":"This is not what I expected. By the reviews you'd think that this is going to be a fast paced hip hop record. If you like the Streets this may be something for you to check out. It has nice beats and don't get me wrong it does have a reggae feel to it. I would not call it hardcore techno. It more has the feel of lounge techno. By that I mean, just sit back and nod your head to the beat and enjoy the what you are hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco with a big D","review":"This album is a disco classic from 1978 when Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood spent weeks in the top 10 all over Europe and House Of The Rising Sun was another huge hit. This was considered underground disco, a far heavier sound and mood than stuff like Chic or The Village People. Besides the aforementioned tracks, this version of Street Fighting Man, Sevilla Nights and Eternal Light also stand out as memorable highlights of an era. Strangely enough, it has aged rather well for disco music, perhaps because its almost heavy metal edge was mirrored in the 1990s by a blend of dance beats and heavy instrumentation that approached the same territory, by industrial artists like Ministry, Nine Inch Nails and Revolting Cocks. Disco came in a multitude of styles and Santa Esmeralda's unique guitar-driven style sounds great today."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not play","review":"Had been looking for this CD for sometime,very excited to receive it, then CD would not play, we tried 2 other players with the same result."},{"rating":"2","title":"cost effective sloution","review":"I had been using NERO because the CD burner that comes with MS was hard to find. When I got a new computer I lost the Nero. After reading a lot of the reviews and seeing how poor Nero and Roxio were rated and how complicate they had become I chose the NTI. It has proved easy to use and loaded onto the computer without problems. A very simple tool to use for copying data and photo files. Menu's are clear and easy to follow. If you don't need all the complicated bells and whistles of the other programs this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SONOFAGUN!","review":"I rec'd the software today, but I am returning it tomorrow.

Great doing business with these people. Have not used the product as yet but am looking forward to doing that in the very near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good and simple to use","review":"I was using Nero brfore getting this program. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as Nero but it is a lot easier to use. It is also cheaper than Nero. If you need a good simple program for burning CDs and DVDs this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Just purchased this software to turn my homemade movies into DVDs. The software doesn't recognize my videos downloaded onto the computer because they are in AVI format. I used the free SDcopy software to change them into MPEG format, but the NTI DVD Maker tells me they are now in MPEG-1 format, and they need to be in MPEG-2. In order to convert them into MPEG-2 files I'll need to buy an additional MPEG-2 plug-in from NTI on their website for $15. Now, I'm new to this whole digital video thing and in my naivete I expected the NTI CD/DVD Maker to handle all aspects of DVD burning. Kind of one-click-does-it-all deal. Apparently it does not, and it requires the additional purchase of a video file converter. This is disappointing, and I just started with this software. I'm wondering if there's anything better out there in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD&DVD Maker 7 Platinum is fine, but be wary of Media Maker 8","review":"NTI CD&DVD Maker 7 Platinum has been upgraded to Media Maker 8. I had no problems with Maker 7, and Maker 7 has been my main CD/DVD burning program. But Media Maker 8 appears to be incompatible with Microsoft's Media Center. Even when uninstalled it leaves some problems that can take considerable work to repair. Timely service was not available from NTI, and the company falsely claimed it was a problem specific to my computer, not one with their program. The company takes a \\"10% transaction fee\\" in any refund and if you pay for a CD copy rather than a download, you will lose shipping charges, too. So, I suggest that if you want to try Media Maker 8 (or Maker 8 Premium) do not pay in advance. Go to the NTI website itself and download a trial version first to verify that it will work in your computer before you actually buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't copy unrestricted DVD's","review":"This software won't copy the same original DVD which I have copied using the My DVD program which came FREE on my computer. It simply says \\"not recordable\\" although the same DVD and the same empty disc WILL record using Sonic's My DVD. There is no copyright protection on the DVD being recorded. This product was definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs. Griff","review":"Had a little problem on the beginning trying to get it to install.

They were real prompt on shipping it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Access 2000 Comprehensive / Shelly Cashman Series","review":"Excellent book. The book goes through access step by step. It shows you visually what the screen should look like after you performed the given tasks. It is very comprehensive and touches on every aspect of the program step by step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Jencks' segment","review":"I found this an especially interesting segment.Jencks is one of the major writers on Post- Modern Architecture. He says that the New Architecture is Science- based and comes out of the sense of cosmic genesis. He talks about a New Architecture of Waves and jumping. As he understands it the overall motion of the Universe is towards greater and greater complexity, greater and greater organization, more and more sensitivity and culture. He points out that this is not a single- line development that there have been violent destructions in the history of the Earth. Jencks speaks quite plainly, without any real enthusiasm or excitement. But his ideas are interesting and he presents a coherent picture of where he believes Architecture and Human Culture as a whole are going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if you want to cultivate these plants","review":"I was under the impression that this book would provide the information I needed to cultivate these plants on some scale. I was very disappointed. There is no way that you could reliably produce these plants with the information provided in this book. There are much better books out there for that purpose. If you are a novice, homegardener wanting to learn about wildflowers and grow a few in your backyard, this book would be okay for you. But if you are knowledgeable on the topic already, I think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New England Wild Flower Society Guide to Growing and Pro","review":"Four of us took this book along when shopping at an amazing nursery...not that it failed to dissuade us from shopping to the max, but because it was the best yet information on wildflowers in cultivation and answered some of our (pretty much experienced) questions about propagation failures. This is a nice adjunct to Phillips' propagation book. Also great photography, but as usual, prefers bloom to leaf and habit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool book","review":"This is the best reference I've found for native plants, and it's a worthy book for a coffee table. Accessible and extensive, it's pleasantly written, with care information about the species and then add'l info on specific plants in the species. The photographs are often quite nice, although I wish they more consistently showed the plant's habit in addition to flowers. There's also an appendix in the back on seed propagation.If you get this, purchase the companion shrub&tree; reference, too. It's just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information, Weak IIlustration","review":"This is a wonderful book about the culture and propagation of North American native flowers. The author clearly knows his stuff and communicates it well.The only weakness is the limited and low quality photography (lots of depth of field problems) which, I gather is not the author's work, but came from a wildflower society. There really are far too few pictures considering the wide variety of plants. Don't plan on being able to tell which of the diverse Eupatoriums or Asters you want to plant by looking at their pictures.HOWEVER, this book would be worth it without pictures, just for the information. Go buy the book and then write the pubisher a note saying the illustration is beneath the writing....just like I just did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would give it 6 stars","review":"The author provides understandable explanations regarding soil and weather conditions. Although I am very experienced in growing wildflowers, I was impressed with the guidelines for propagating native flowers from cutting and seed. Although more detailed information for individual species may be available online as one reviewer indicated, I find the book very useful. My wildflowers are in an isolated region where there is no internet or WiFi readily available. I have purchased the other books in the series - love 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"Keep it in your library. Good reference tool when trying to identify and great pictures for winter doldrums. Answers to most concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential.","review":"This revealed teaching is essential for anyone investigating Christian Gnosticism, post-resurrection narratives, kabbalistic cosmology, feminine Christology, or the writings of Hurtak. It is not a simple read, but deeply layered, speaking of the Kingdom of Light on many levels to humanity. The Savior truly shares a great revelation with his disciples and the author of the text had clearly been very gifted. This translation is not perfect, but conveys the messages true to the context in which they were intended: metaphysically. Serious para-Biblical students should definately acquaint themselves with Pistis-Sophia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad layout","review":"This book has the titles that (I assume aren't part of the text) run almost seamlessly into the body of the text so one ends up reading titles as if part of the body text, I don't know what other copies of Pistis Sophia are like but if you are considering buying Pistis Sophia I would suggest a different edition.Pistis Sophia is of course historically important not only simply because it is an ancient Gnostic text but because this was -if I am correct- the only Gnostic work that scholars had basically in full to understand Gnosticism from (apart from of course what the Church Fathers accurately reported to of course) until the Nag Hammadi finds.As to the work itself Pistis Sophia is of course a book of vile lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Friends With Sophia","review":"For research, for the curious, this is a cleaner \\"write\\" than other versions I own and use; very accessable to every level of reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pistis Sophia","review":"Other versions may have been written better, text lacks consistancy with too many thee's and thou's. Unfortunately due to the lack of flow in the text, it can very easily be one of those books you put down and forget to pick up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor translation, totally worthless","review":"This book contains a worthless translation. The words used to convey meaning are common thus obscuring the original meaning. Here are some examples: \\"whole distribution\\" is not the same thing as \\"total expansion\\", \\"workmen\\" are not the same as \\"servitors\\", \\"habitations of their spheres\\" is not the same as \\"houses of their spheres\\", and \\"first statute\\" is not the same as \\"First Commandment\\". Many nouns are left uncapitalized so the real meaning behind the items being expressed is not conveyed. And all these examples came from the first two pages of this totally worthless translation of Pistis Sophia.This version is a made from two imperfect versions: a French translation (1856) and a Latin version (1851) not from the Coptic text. Try to find Mead's second edition (1921) containing some valuable help from Carl Schmidt's German translation (1905). Mead's second edition of Pistis Sophia is almost a complete rewrite of the first edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL edition","review":"I'm not sure if other editions were the same, but this one was AWFUL.

I.e., if you need to play #8, you push #8.The remote has number keys, but the remote doesn't always work.

Very in depth detail, from site selection and preparation for zero depth foundation ,to step by step numbered instructions with photos. I haven't built one yet using this book, but I could.The only thing I found lacking was info about codes. I suspect that since they are building on reservations they don't have to deal with that. This is a load bearing bale wall and those are not accepted everywhere. The foundation is also not standard.

I have also found that you can easily spot fake lossless conversions with this because a low bit rate conversion will sound muddy or have a fluttering sound but without the adapter you would not notice.

My daughter didn't like it at all, and got bored within a few minutes. It was too spartan, with little musical accompaniment. Most annoying was that all of the songs were a bit too slow, even popular songs that all children sing seemed as if they were recorded at half-speed...it made each song sound depressing and way to similar to all the other songs. I guess I was expecting something happy and upbeat (more Raffi-like) and the CD put us to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very mellow, but wonderful!","review":"I first found this at the library last year, and had to go ahead and buy my own copy. I would say that she has a Joni Mitchell sort of voice, and that it's very low key. But I appreciate that sort of thing! Some of the songs are supposed to by finger plays, which is great.

I don't hear that version as often, but it's an important one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I have to agree with some others in that this CD is very slow. In fact, it puts my kids to sleep rather than provoke a sing along or dance.

A few songs into this CD, I thought that the folks who gave this a positive review must have something to gain from the sales of this release. It's really not a good CD for children. Yes, she has a somewhat pleasant voice, but this isn't the kind of music that captures a child's attention. It's way too slow, too high pitched, and not at all conducive to singing along. \\"Do you know the muffin man?\\" sounds like a painful piano bar rendition.

Interspersed within each section are some brief scenes with an actor portraying the historical Buddha (as shown on the cover picture for the DVD).As the other reviewer observed, the film doesn't have a whole lot to teach; some of the most important moments in Buddha's life are covered far too quickly to be of much use (his enlightenment for example). Overall, it seemed more like a filmed travelogue than anything intended to be instructional about the Buddha or Buddhism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Enlightening","review":"I did not feel like I learned anything about Buddhism from this film.

Even so the explanation of the babylonian and Italian hours could be better.So the Rohr book would best be used as an adjunct to the other texts but if you are just starting out, buy the book by Waugh first then Mayall and Mayall and then perhaps Rohr if your library hasn't got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book provides an excellent overview of feminism.","review":"Here is an excellent retrospective on the women's movement from the first wave to the present, in all its ramifications.Tobias does well in describing the various forms of feminism and in discussing the conflicts within the movement today."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"Pickin Led Zep volume one is excellent.

His characters encounter the unusual in the midst of ordinary life, and they are changed by the encounter. In Scandal the unusual is embodied in masochism, the love of the pleasure in pain and self-annihilation. In parallel with the out of body joy of masochism, the protagonist has his own epiphany.

Though the shave is good with new cartridges, I have a great deal of trouble cleaning the hairs out from between the blades. Hot water from my faucet simply isn't enough. With former razors (Ultrex twin blade), a pass along the edge with a toothpick would do it easily, but the vertical wires on the blades make it impossible to clean these cartridges efficiently, resulting in my having to spend a lot of extra time cleaning them or keep changing cartridges, which really increases the expense.

Like Mach3, the Quattro Schick comes with lube strips of Vitamin E and Aloe. Also, the perpendicular wires to the blades help prevent nicks and burns. Based on all the negative reviews, there's a good chance that it's all from Gillette that simply wants to wipe out the competition.

However, the blades are even more expensive than a Mach 3 (even the Turbo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Converted from Gillette!

Schick Quattro cartridges are the cheapest of the bunch (Mach 3 Turbo, M3 Power,..), last the longest, and deliver the best shave. They also cover in one pass what a M3-product would take 2-3 passes to clear.No way these negative reviews are for real. Who uses a toothbrush to unclog a razor?

I usually use a gillette mach 3 turbo and love it but decided to try the quatro.I use a shave brush and shave soap. So I lather up and start shaving. The hair got stuck in the blades and it stopped shaving well after only a few strokes. I tried running it under water,shaking it violently under water, and even running my finger with the blades with no results. It stayed clogged. It now sits in my cabinet with the extra blade, useless. I once used a clogged bick razor and it took a chunk out of my forhead. So I went back to my trusty Mach 3 Turbo. I havent tried the auto vibrating one. Seems like a gimmick. The only worse blade I ever used was a dollar store brand.

Yes, the shave is close, but no closer than the Mach 3. The Quattro is awkward to hold, too. But the big letdown is the comfort. I feel like I am shaving with dull blades when I use this Quattro -- even with a brand-new blade cartridge. One shave is all I need to make my decision. I am throwing this Quattro in the trash or giving it away. Or maybe I should ask Schick for my money back. Hmmm. Maybe if I had never tried the Mach 3 I wouldn't be so down on the Quattro. I mean, if you've never had a really good shave, you might think the Quattro is awesome. Alas!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH, Go buy a Mach 3 instead.","review":"Years ago, I shaved with the Schick FX Diamond, I liked it. Then I moved on the the Gillette Mach 3, marked improvement and have been happy with that for years. Now I come to the \\"next generation\\" of razors. I thought it would be a decent product because of the quality of the Diamond. I couldn't be more wrong. I can not remember the last time I cut myself shaving. It felt as rough as those plastic ones you buy in 20 packs. I took one swipe with it and wanted to stop completely, unfortunately I did not have another razor handy. It felt like rubbing sand paper on already sensitive skin and it didn't even shave closely. I will NEVER use this razor again. I want to run out and stock up on Mach 3 cartridges so I can survive until the 5 blade razor eventually comes out. Hopefully Gillete will make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stick to the Mach3","review":"I hate to make the site look like a broken record, but this razon honestly hurts to use.

The first thing I noticed is it's not as smooth as my usual razor, and mostly it clogged up with hair SO BAD that I had to discontinue using it.Like another reviewer mentioned, there's too much \\"going on\\" with it behind the blades for the hair to be able to free itself.

To the point where I have to question what KOSS was thinking when they made these, it's ridiculous.If you care at all about hearing your music the way it is meant to sound, these are not for you. If you don't care and you're the type who turns the bass boost on your speakers all the way up, you might like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these","review":"These headphones don't allow the earpieces to extend enough. They fit poorly. The headband ends with two large-ish, black plastic pieces (where the silver starts) which rest fully on my head, digging into it and causing discomfort. I have to constantly move them to get relief. Fully extended, the grip is bad and the headphones still move around a lot. If I tilt my head forward or back, the headphones shift, perilously close to falling off. The sound output is also more tinny than my simple iPod earphones.Cable length is good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Wild","review":"I bought this copy because my original got lost and I had to replace it.

Also, this shares the same tone as the Lydia Bach book (Awake! Aware! Alive)--don't bother with the Lotte Berk Method unless you are already in shape. All of the people in the DVDs are fit and toned--not a normal person to be seen.

I wanted to start with the basics so I got this set. On a positive note, the concepts are great and very effective. On the not so positive note - the instructors are absolutely annoying and bizarre! If you can get past that part - I really can't - then the workouts are effective - although they seem to be geared for the extreme beginners. There are some bonus features and you can do the workouts without narration - which I would totally do after watching it one time. Not really thrilled with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotte Berk Method for Beginners","review":"The set of dvds is a great workout and the time goes pretty fast.

I'm in pretty decent shape but have been looking for programs to increase my strength and conditioning. This dvd set does not do the job. First of all, the video is poor quality and for anyone that has a larger tv, it looks pretty awful. Also, the instructors wear these horrible outfits and talk in this patronizing annoying voice. The actual workouts are short, low in intensity and dominated by instructions. These dvds might be good for someone just beginning to workout, but anyone who already has a baseline of fitness should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD with a few leg lifts on it - why all the hype??","review":"These have got to be the worst exercise videos ever.

Or days I just dont feel like working that hard. The ab exercises are good. but thats only 5 minutes of the tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous! These Feel Great !","review":"I purchased the complete set at the beginning of August. I was looking for something to strengthen my back and get into shape after my second child. I was having some back problems and gained quite a bit of weight with my pregnancy. The movements are challenging and carefully explained by the instructors. It took me a while to get the set up and posture correct. The result are worth it! I feel that I am constantly challenged and much stronger. I have not have my back go out since I started doing the video's. I love them and hope they will make more soon! They are not hard to follow and feel great.

I love the ballet barre section, my legs feel so strong now. The knee dancing is difficult, but I have gotten further with each work out and can keep up pretty well now. At first I modified and just did slight raises, which built up the strength very quickly. The instructor does a good job, and I feel that it's a great, no-nonsense workout that you can do almost anywhere. I am lucky enough to have a spare room that I work out in, and I'm going to install a barre on the wall to make this work out even better. I also love that they do so much stretching between moves. As boring as it is to stretch, it's so important, and she explains that along the way.

I received only 3 DVDs, even though I ordered the set of 4. Then I discovered that all 3 programs included the same basic exercises with very minor variations. If you're interested in trying this, The Basic Essentials program contains all of the exercises. Don't bother to order any of the others. The excercises here are actually re-hashed, old style calisthenics.

Bosko the Talk-ink kid may be offensive, but the other cartoons have him sounding like Mickey Mouse! There isn't one thing half wrong with him and Warner Bros. is just too darn picky! Do they really think this stuff is going to offend people? Bosko is one of the greatest cartoon characters ever made! Some people claim he is a rip-off of Mickey Mouse, in a way, the resemblance is clear, but in another, pretty much any cartoon that you watch made in the early 30s is going to be like a Mickey Mouse sort of premise! Besides, Harman and Ising (Bosko's creators) learned to draw the exact same way Walt Disney did along with everybody in his staff! Bosko is a great character and he should be shown on cartoon network.

Selling this pile of tripe allows him to peddle another version of it that does have the original trilogy on it. Lucas lost all credibility by destroying the Star Wars legacy with the horrendous prequels and his constant hacking up of the original trilogy. He also annoyed a lot of Star Wars fans recently by banning Dave Prowse (Darth Vader) from any Lucasfilm events.

My brain tried to justify him speaking, but in the end it said NOOOOO!!! (in my opinion) it seriously takes away from the scene that we all know. Vader hadn't spoken in over 25 years why have him speak now? Actions speak louder than words. Obi-Wan's yell does not need to be there at all.In fact all the changes (save for enhancing Yoda, or blinking Ewoks) don't need to be there.

The CGI additions are incongruous with the visual style of the rest of the films; the additional dialogue robs the original films of subtlety (are people so dense that they are incapable of sensing conflict in Darth Vader without him shouting \\"NOOOOO!\\"?); \\"Han shot first,\\" &c., &c., &c. . . . the list of grievances is too long to share in a brief review.

I don't want scenes inserted or changed (example: Greedo shoots first).I want a *technically* improved product. Remix the soundtrack so it sounds better in home theaters, but don't change the music. Improve the picture quality so it looks as good as possible on blu-ray. Leave everything else alone, or at least give the customer a choice of \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" version. The original Star Wars movies are considered classics; messing with them is not appreciated by a large number of fans!The Alien(s) blu-ray edition is an excellent example of how to do this correctly: each film on the blu-ray can be see in the original theatrical version or the new version and the films look GORGEOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas has lost his mind!","review":"I was really looking forward to the Blu-Ray release but now I have no intentions of buying it!

Not the best young cast ever, but a truly revolutionary piece of storytelling.It's been over 30 years since, and George Lucas can't stop screwing with it. I was 11 when \\"A New Hope\\" was released, and I saw it over 50 times over the following months. But it's not the same movie any more. He's not just screwing with his film - he's trying to re-write the past with a broad brush, marginalizing all the brilliant strokes in the original release. He's worth billions - as a \\"job creator\\", he should be willing to spend a million or two, clean up the original releases with 4K scans, and do his myriad of fans a huge favor.Pre-order cancelled. I'm just hoping someday the original will be re-released, as I so vividly remember it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it alone George","review":"Dear George,I understood your desire to 'fix' your movies in the re-release several years ago.

I collected all of the toys. It was a part of my childhood. Just as I was beginning to get over the fact that I hated Haydn Christensen as Anakin and the strange racial tones of Jar Jar Binks, George Lucas has once again decided to destroy his own work and mess with my childhood memories. Not only is he replacing Yoda with the soulless CGI version, but among other unnecessary changes he is actually making Vader say, \\"No!\\" as he sends the Emperor to the abyss. Truly unbelievable and a finger to all of his longtime fans.I think this is actually it, I am sadly done with Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Choice","review":"I saw Star Wars when it was released in the theaters, many times. I bought the action figures and games, then the VHS tapes, then the LaserDisc, then the DVDs, and then the Special Edition DVDs.

I cancelled my Amazon pre-order once I learned that the blu-rays do not contain this option.

Please Release with all versions!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas up to no good again","review":"I would say that I'm very frustrated by this, but I'm kind of used to it by now. Lucas doesn't know when to leave well enough alone and he continues to change certain aspects of his films because it's an improvement in his mind. There is nothing that could possibly be improved by adding CGI here, or making Vader talk there.

I've never been outraged by them until now, though. George has all the resources in the world to give the fans what they want (and include his ever-changing vision of these films, as well), but instead he gives us only the latter. And now the original films contain spare parts from FIVE DECADES. Is this out of arrogance? Out of spite? Senility? Perhaps we'll never know.Like most fans, I was looking forward to watching these films in Hi-Def, Special Editions or not, but these films continue to sink to new lows. Don't reward anyone for it. These have ceased being films and are now amalgams of classic movie moments, bad (modern) special effects, and even worse story revisions. Stop it, George.

There is also absolutely no reason for the original theatrical editions to be on these same discs. Why does he do this? Why does George Lucas do this?

I don't think that George Lucas realizes that once an artist creates something it is no longer their's. . . it belongs to the world. Michelangelo didn't continually re sculpt The David down to nothing, Fitzgerald didn't re-write The Great Gatsby every five years. sometimes you just have to learn to let go.This just proves what I've suspected for years -- the Trekkies were right all along.

Roddenberry was the true visionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooooo!","review":"This addition to a classic is a complete failure.

Funding the new Films wont be an issue, I bet you, All producers would want to bank on this Franchise, because it's an instant success.Star Wars Universe has so much potential for a New and Exciting Stories. Honestly, I'm TIRED of Anakin & Luke. I want to see the Next Generation Jedi's on the Big Screen. Solo & Leia's twin kids Jaina and Jacen would be Awesome. Or, a Han Solo & Wookie one shot Film.

Just take a glance at the comparison chart on the product description page and you will see just how many Star Wars releases there have been of late. This is just their first try. A new version will come along (\\"The Complete Saga - Collectors Edition\\"), which will include all of the versions of the original trilogy, the original special features, and maybe even a few new ones.

Before you do something silly and buy this set, please check out Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon call and Vader's new line of \\"No... NOOOOOOOOOOO\\" at the climax of episode VI... Think long and hard about whether George Lucas deserves any of your money.I will be happy to buy the star wars films of the 1970's and 1980's if they are ever released, but I will not spend money on this garbage.I encourage all real star wars fans to avoid this product and give it a one star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"More changes?!","review":"Well I had pre-orederd this...until I heard about there being even more changes.These are no longer the movies I loved as a kid.

The new krayt dragon call is clearer and more chilling despite the scoffs of so called \\"fans.\\" The scene of Vader defeating the Emperor has been improved and now linked to the end of the \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" almost like the meter of an epic poem.Improved audio and increased clarity with vibrant colors are to be expected with a Blu-Ray release.

The first time the original trilogy was released was good... i can understand revamping them a bit, but this is stupid. The second trilogy was bad all on its own... horrible acting and horrible directing... but whatever, I'll swallow it.... but at this point, the Star Wars universe has so much more to tell on the big screen that's just dumb to recreate the same thing over and over.OVERKILL ANYONE???Buy this if you want to feed the corporate work dog which is Lucas Art.Don't BUY IT and petition against this lack of creativity.Regardless, I love star wars, but don't take advantage of my LOVE. -___-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems Playing Blu-ray on LG LHB335","review":"Problems Playing Blu-ray on LG LHB335.

Loved just sitting back and enjoying them, even RotJ. Watched them countless times and never got bored; enjoyed each viewing like it was the first. With that in mind, I have sat all the way through the Phantom Menace once, Attack twice, and Revenge once, and that is enough for me. In fact, since the prequels came out, I have only watched the originals a couple of times. Lucas has lost whatever magic he once had. It is time to let go of the reins and let someone else take over.

That said, these films are significant in film history and continuing to change audio and video (arguably for the worst) while completely ignoring the versions that made this series such an important part of our shared culture is just a big slap in our collective faces.

When he's in full control and able to express his ideas without any limitations, his stuff really isn't that good. I do hope he stops his constant fiddling with these movies.

I for one will NO LONGER support the Star Wars franchise and the fiasco it has become. This is a travesty to motion picture in general not honoring the original classic for the LOVE OF MONEY is disgusting. Lucas needs to \\"GET A CLUE\\" and give the original fans what we want plus a future generation of fans and silence the thrones of angry fans.

Just say nooooooo to fake Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace to cinematic integrity","review":"Why would Lucas choose to once again screw with a perfect product, while many will call those of us delusional and childish about such minor changes in the classic films. The point is that they were classic films and that in making these changes and adding scenes and dialogue that weren't in them previously just because he can seems like he doesn't care what we the fans and consumers want, if these films came out today with Lucas at the helm and with today's technology these films would be panned by critics and snubbed by movie goers because the films would rely heavily on CGI and poor dialogue without a coherent story. This is verified by the prequels and the only reason that they were successful was because of the fan base of the original; which Lucas continues to destroy with his ineptitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT give in to the dark side!

I've seen the originals and quite honestly, the changes they made to the blue ray don't change or deminish my love for the films. Yes, episode 2 and 3 sucked big time but the sound quality and picture in both trilogies are amazing. I still haven't seen the extras but will soon. If you are even remotely a star wars fan, despite all the negative comments people are giving, you definitely should buy this edition. If not for the movies do it for the amazing collectors box it comes in. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it doesn't include the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Star Wars on Blu-Ray.","review":"Star Wars finally on Blu-Ray thank you to George Lucas.

After watching this, I poured myself a glass of water, took a deep breath, and started watching the Lord of the Rings on blu-ray instead.

You'd think Lucas would figure out that folks will stop buying his movies if there isn't a compelling reason to buy them. With the digital upscaling on most players these days there is no reason to buy this set vs. one of the older sets. If you must see the deleted scenes (which face it you'll watch once), just rent it.

And now they have no interest in their cartoons anymore, star wars are the go to movies! And I think these will be a perfect addition because my one year old will be next in line and the discs I have will be burnt up by then!

After hearing Lucas changed more, I was HOPING that he would have just changed the few things he did this time around on the theatrical versions, like starting from scratch. Obviously even that was too optimistic. These are just BluRay rereleases which have been further destroyed. Don't waste your time or money with these. Yea, the picture quality is amazing in all 6 films, but then again the first 3 films aren't worth watching anyway.

While George Lucas has every right to change the Star Wars movies before the Blu-ray release, I guess that means \\"complete\\" applies to himself on how he views the Star Wars movies. When I see \\"complete\\" for a movie release, I would assume that a theatrical release of the Star Wars movies would be included and not any additional tweaks that Lucas has done since then.Are any of the tweaks, like replacing the Muppet of Yoda with a CGI version, needed to make Yoda look credible for this HD release?

The only reason I would have bought this set was if the original three episodes were included sans the 'Special Edition' crap. The only film from the Special Edition trilogy that doesn't make me want to take a drive down to Skywalker Ranch to punch George Lucas in the face is Empire I guess because there wasn't a lot of 'fixing' done to any major scenes in that one. Enhancing explosions and adding in some extra background set pieces to blend better with the new trilogy is one thing, screwing around with the actual film by moving actors into positions they didn't really move to in order to create illusions of a 'Greedo shot first' scene or Han Solo stepping over the badly obvious cgi Jabba the Hutt tail in order to get around him are just ridiculous. And how 'bout Jedi with the cartoon band scene at Jabba's palace?

Well, what we fell in love with was what we saw, whether it was finished or not. He seems to be changing it for himself, because the majority of fans just want the theatrical release in Blu-Ray I would argue. The more he changes it so he likes it, the less we do.Lucas did better when he had less technology, he did what he could and focused on the quality of the story.

So in that tradition I don't care about these new Blu-ray releases. Seriously, I'm not that desperate.You owe the fans an apology....and not in the form of a shoddy half-baked Blu-ray someday.

The changed Krayt dragon call, the pink Lightsaber and worse of all the Darth Vader screaming Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! is pathetic.

Doesn't make Greedo shooting first any harder to swallow but I adapted. At least to the extent that I was still spending my hard earned money on Star Wars in general. Now that is not the case. George Lucas has ruined a pinnacle moment in cinema by adding \\"Nooo\\" to what was once one of the best non dialogued scenes in movie history. For this I cannot forgive Lucas. And for that he will never see another dime from me until I am able to purchase a version in which that scene does not exist in the manner it does. Why a creator chooses to alienate his fan base in the manner George Lucas has is beyond me.

Do we get the original cuts of each of the films, along with the newer versions, ala Blade Runner, The Exorcist, Apocalypse Now, Alien Anthology, etc. Did Lucas at least come to his senses and remove so of the more maligned changes - Greedo firing first, chopping up the climax of Empire by showing us Vader getting to his ship, every step of the way, including an obvious outtake from Return of the Jedi crudely inserted, Hayden's head crudely cut and pasted on Sebastian Shaw's body at the end of Return?

It's painfully obvious this movie wasn't re-color timed for the Blu Ray release. So many of the scenes had a very disturbing magenta hue in the blacks and were otherwise so off that I found the movie almost unwatchable. In one cut the colors were great and then the next scene people's skin and hair color was suddenly different.I'm going to have to find a previous version of this movie to see if the same issues are there also.I'll watch episode 2 tonight and see if that's as bad.

I just wanted to let people know that the entire film series will be re-released in theaters in 2012 in 3D.

Now word comes that Lucas has made even more changes to the OT, changing Obi-wan's call to frighten the sand people (for some inexplicable reason) and adding blinking effects to the ewok's eyes. Those are minor and by themselves wouldn't bother me too much, but he also just HAD to add a reprise to the \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" from the end of the Revenge of the Sith by having Vader yell \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" while the Emperor electrocutes Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi.

This is unforgivable.Secondly, this is NOT the \\"Complete\\" saga. This only contains the latest reworks of the movies. You do not get the addition of the original presentation, nor do you get extras like the silly Ewok TV special.Thirdly, there are no Blu-ray enhancements (other than the basic better image and sound).

You owe it to them to show the world their hard work that helped make you famous. Those old effects were the gold standard at the time, before all the CGI.

The original trilogy is littered with terrible CGI, awkward changes, and deep running character changes that destroy what made Star Wars so great. Han Solo is a bad ass smuggler who doesn't take crap from some scum named Greedo. He shoots him straight out.

It doesn't even sound anything like the krayt dragon in the prequel film. How stupid do you think we are?I've had enough of George Lucas meddling with cinema history. It's one thing to go back and add some nifty effects. But Han shot first.

He's just got too much pride to admit his alterations detracted from the magic of the original movies, so you can't have those except in bad form. But George is no dummy when it comes to money. Would you leave millions of dollars on the table when it's right there for the taking? All he's got to do is give the fans who built his franchise what they want. Then he'll be a big hero.

It would be the sheer terror of Da Vinci wanting to add dinasaurs in the background that would ruin its cultural impact. Not to mention he'd probably give away any secrets ge may have had about the last supper.So here it stands, Lucas is a flesh eating bastard. He eats away at the same meal, until there are only bones and then he preceeds to decorate those bones with uneeded yellings and dreadful cgi bone eating maggots. Lucas has even gone so far as to desecrate Jim Henson's memory by using cgi to replace one of the most beloved muppets.

That said the extras that are here are quite good. I can also confirm that the animated short from the Holiday Special with Boba Fett is indeed on this set as an easter egg. Lastly, the changes.

The picture may be better but the cut scenes that weren't in the movies and were instead put on a different disc is total bs to me and waste of money when a lot, or most of us thought that the cut scenes would be put into the movies like they should've been, but we get ripped off again, and makeing me angry isn't a good thing.Maybe $30.00 should've been the price for what we got.

I'll just wait until George Lucas releases an ultimate edition that includes the original theater version, and all the altered re-released versions since then. We might have to wait awhile longer until after the new versions of 2020, 2024, and 2029.

I'm glad he did, because I am one of those fans that prefers the US version.When Francis Ford Coppola released his Apocalypse Now, he did the same thing with both the Original & Redux, even though he preferred his Redux over the Original. He too, respected the fans enough to do it right. I'm glad he did, because I've yet to meet anyone who liked Redux over the Original.Lucas - WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!!!

It's the fact that they're grossly incongruous and don't integrate well at all with the original films. Vader's \\"Nooooo\\" is easily recognizable as being recycled from Episode 3 for instance. However, it's the awful color timing from the 2004 editions that we were promised would be fixed that haven't been corrected.Why would we be promised this was done only to have the blu rays unveiled with virtually none of the color timing issues fixed? I.e white colorless lasers being fired from the star destroyer in the opening shot. Yet time was found to further sully the classic films with more idiotic tweaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry George, try again.","review":"The properly restored, original theatrical versions of Star Wars (1977), Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return Of The Jedi (1983) will be the next things I purchase from Lucasfilm. I didn't purchase the 1997 altered versions, the 2004 altered versions, or the 2006 altered versions - and I have absolutely ZERO interest in these current abominations. This set does not contain the films that captured the public's imagination. The poorly done, non-anamorphic, DVD copies of the 1993 laserdiscs that were released as bonus discs with the 2006 alterations were a slap in the face to the fans who put George where he is today. I've never seen a situation where the director digs his heels in a this level and goes out of his way to make sure the fans get only something they've repeatedly said they don't want. It is truly an ego out of control."},{"rating":"1","title":"This and Polio Ruined My Life","review":"Why? Why bother?Could you imagine what would happen if Mr. Lucas had access to time travel? Lincoln would have shot first. Hitler's ghost would look like a younger version of himself. The evolutionary line of all animals would have been altered so that even arthropods and fish could blink. Lucas would have painted rocks in front of the Mona Lisa. There would be more young men drafted into wars because Lucas always wanted there to be more troopers, and they would all sound the same. All credit for Empire and Jedi would have gone to him.Grow up, George."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and great movies!","review":"I may not be a star wars purist but for me, all the bad rep given to these movies in Amazon is just unjustifiable. I know the same dvd changes made before were kept (so, they are not exactly as we saw them back then in theaters) but I think these changes and retouches are in line with our HD world (and also, is George Lucas vision, deal with). I still think that replacing the actor who played Darth Vader with the new Anakin from the later movies was (still is) wrong but that does not mean these movies are not awesome! The quality is just great and having watching them already, I can attest that it is true. Besides, the price is just a bargain and the extras (I have not watch them all) are pretty good. In conclusion, buy the movies if you want these movies in good HD quality and listen to the experts so you will not miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for a present!!!","review":"I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loved it.

We finally have to part ways. And it's not me. It's you. You've gone one unnecessary change too far for me, and seemingly for a lot of others.

I really hate having to submit this 'review' at all as it's a pet peeve not to EVER post any 'review' for a product that is not out yet. So this gives you an idea of how much Lucas' tinkering is bugging me. I'm not going to post the long details as they've all been covered by all those before me who have elaborated on all the changes like Obi Wan's call and Vader's \\"No.\\" in ROTJ that make those scenes laughable now. Who knows what changes exist that we don't even know about? But enough is enough. I just cancelled my pre-order. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to Star Wars. How may I help you?","review":"No need to review these films. George Lucas had dollars on his mind the minute he realized the merchandising potential of what he created right after the first film.

Spend it wisely, George!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't support this version of the movies","review":"Seriously? There are more changes to the original film? I will not be buying these movies now.

I have just finished watching episodes IV and I with my 11 year old daughter. We chose these two first to compare the different eras of SW films. These were viewed on a Samsung 46\\" LED TV and with a standard 5.1 surround setup. The detail on both these films was beyond my most optimistic hopes. We could make out the individual pores on all the actors' faces. We could see tiny granules of make-up on Carrie Fisher. The colors were vibrant and crisp. Sound was equally impressive. The synchronization of the dialogue to the actors' lip movements was perfect. These Blu-rays have been meticulously re-mastered and the results are truly awesome. The price is reasonable considering you are paying about $13 per movie. Even if you own the DVDs, if you are a videophile and/or audiophile you owe it to you and your family to add this incredible set to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want Star Wars they way I remember it","review":"If you want to release an altered version, fine...but make the original also available.

This time though, he has altered the climax of the saga, inserting a moment which has become widely mocked (Vader's \\"NOOOOOO\\" from Revenge of the Sith) into the most emotional point of Return of the Jedi.And to think, Lucasfilm tried to slip the set onto the market without letting anyone know about the changes they made this time.I have been a fan of the series almost my whole life, and I have stuck with it through all the alterations so far. These changes, however, were the straw that broke the camel's back. I do not recommend this set at all.That is unless you desperately need a feature length documentary on some fans who cosplay as Stormtroopers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing price","review":"So I've pre-ordered this movie in August thinking of saving money.

(One of the things that won me over to Blu-Ray was watching Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean at the local Wal*Marts.

I would dare you to try better.But George. This is it. The last time you suckered me in with the newly cleaned print, albeit with even more changes. And some outright quality control issues to be perfectly honest. How many different prints could you have to rescued Moff Tarkin's line from?? Reversing stereo channels? Really?

The sound is tremendous, however. I watched Episode IV last night and I remembered how it was actually John Williams who should have become the multi-billionaire, because without his music, that movie in particular is pretty hokey.

I watched a marathon Episode 4, 5 & 6 last night along with the spoof reel (good stuff). I wasn't really offended by any of the new tweaks added to the series - I actually enjoy some of the changes (like the yet again reworked Greedo scene - this scene moreso than any other seems like an ongoing dialog between fans and Lucas - he doesn't want to give it up, but always tried to compromise and improve it).You can join the haters and those calling for boycotts (I imagine most of them are secretly purchasing it anyway)or you can enjoy yourself. Enjoying a tweaked Star Wars is like any guilty pleasure - you savor every moment and then complain to your friends that you hated it.Buy it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"These are not the discs we're looking for\\"","review":"I had the hope that I would be able to replace my old Laserdisc set of the original three movies, but at this point, I will never see a better quality product of the original version of the films.

There I said it.If you're willing to pay for another version with the horribly done additional footage then you are not fans of Star Wars. You're fakes.The movies were PERFECT. The additional footage only made them worse and should have been added as extras, not forced on us like revisionist history. I cannot in good conscience pay for another version of these films in their present state. They only detract, not enhance as the extra footage for the Lord of the Rings trilogy did. It's obvious that Lucas has lost it....look at episodes 1-3. Terrible. And Chrystal skull?

However, I still think the changes are minamal and only improve on a masterpiece. I enjoyed the prequels and I love watching the Clone Wars with my 10 year old daughter. In short I like what Lucas has done with the Star Wars Universe and it seems that a lot of other people feel the same way. Even if you don't agree with me can't we stop the nastiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"eww! they changed things AGAIN","review":"It sounded nice to have all 6 movies in one blu-ray set ... then I found out they changed things.No sale George. I was willing, albeit grudgingly, to accept that the changes in the theatrical re-release were the movies now, as long as the original was an extra on the disks (insert grumble about anakin's face here).

George Lucas has bastardized this series -- his own series -- in a way that degrades their quality and makes them practically unwatchable when you know what really happened (such as Han just taking Greddo out; he's a scoundrel, right?).When Lucas gets off his throne and really listens to the customers -- the people who lined his pockets -- then and maybe only then will we ever see the original episodes. I doubt that day will ever come. I have given fat-head George enough money over the years (hey, I saw the original Star Wars over 20 times when it was in the theater), and I don't care to buy this crud either.Good luck, George. When you die, I hope Alfred Hitchcock's waiting to bitch-slap you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still #1 selling Blu Ray on amazon...","review":"I canceled my per-order because it made me sick of all the new additions and I know a lot of my friends have too.

It just made me laugh all the complaints and people canceling their order its still the #1 best seller on amazon for weeks. It honestly seems like people are complaining but are still gonna buy lol. I personally wouldn't buy for ten dollars because the only way Lucas might come around is for nobody to buy it.(which i know wont happen but he wont get my money on principal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why George, why?","review":"The fans who have made you a billionaire, you can't throw us a bone? How about your \\"special\\" bastardized versions, and the complete un-retouched originals in the box set? Far be it from us lowly fans to recognize some story points you've destroyed with revisions, were perfect the first time. The complete saga isn't really complete if it doesn't contain the originals also in high def. But you don't care. Your ego makes you deaf to what we would like as being irrelevant.

Stop surrounding yourself with Yes men, like your little lap dog Rick McCallum and listen to what the fans, the people who have given you their money for years, want.I could put up with Greedo shooting first, barely, that scene alone destroyed the character of Han Solo. I can understand a CGI Yoda for TPM, that makes sense, but having Vader shout 'Nnooo',come on. We can see what Vader is going through without you having to add some real crappy dialouge.

How far this mighty giant has fallen is left to personel interpretation (a.k.a. how royaly pissed you are by his changes). The sad thing is, Lucas feels so right about it. How? The man who stood up in front of Congress in 1988 condemning the change or even alteration of any kind of art has now become the biggest of perpetrators.

If you want the unaltered version the Star Wars limited Edition DVD'S are widely available still that have the Original Theatrical versions. To me this is a great Blu-Ray to buy and well worth the $80 the best Star Wars has Looked and sounded Ever. Don't listen to all the negativity about it something you just need to judge for yourself like I do I never pay attention to negative reviews I judge every movie myself. if you do not give this set a chance you will be missing out 40 Hrs Of Special Features alone warrants a buy for people who love Star Wars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not be buying this!","review":"I am done with Star Wars.

George Lucas created these movies and they are his to change if he wants. The orginial movies were not how he envisioned them. The technology was not advanced to where he was satisfied, which is why he has made these changes. The fact that he wanted these changes is reassuring because art is ever changing and evolving. These new versions are closer to what he feels is perfection, and since he is the orginial artist and creator, his is the only opinion that actually matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars Blu-ray: EPIC FAIL","review":"There really isn't too much to say here.

In fact, it isn't even the classic episodes 4-6, it is the new versions with too much cgi and Hayden appearing as the ghost of Anakin at the end.

If Lucas has no intention of releasingthose originals again, the easiest way of showing your disapproval is with your wallet. In pointof fact the original Star Wars was great, Empire was the best one and only about 60% of Returnis watchable. Of the newer trilogy... well watching them is like watching a roadside accident.

I should've quit buying this stuff years ago on my wife's recommendation but I was unable to see the light at that time.I'm sure the quality, etc... is fine on the BRD's themselves but I just have to stop willingly handing over massive amounts of money to a guy who can't even see (or simply doesn't care) that he's killing one of the greatest franchises in cinematic history.I am officially done buying Star Wars merchandise until the original theatrical editions are released on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"What disappoints me most about Lucas is, not the fact that he keeps \\"updating\\" his \\"abandoned\\" movies, but when he does make these awful changes, he forces his audience to abide them and disregards their personal preferences by not releasing the original/unaltered versions of the original trilogy. Also it seems almost as if he were sneaking these changes in to get us to purchase a product not-as-advertised, as we only recently discovered these changes, so close to the release.It's a shame that the most we can do is simply cancel these pre-orders, as it's not likely Lucas will have a change of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"These films are destroyed","review":"Don't buy this set.

But this critical moment of Vader's sacrifice for his son, his own redemption, and the end of the galaxy wide conflict was not only the highpoint of Return of the Jedi, and a highpoint of the whole trilogy, but it's also a classic moment of film history. Ask yourself if you can enjoy the finale to the Star Wars trilogy with this new version of the climax. I know I cannot. Save your money, folks.

I watched them with my daughter and she absolutely loved the movies. I showed her the original trilogy and then we went back to watch the prequels. So, before you completely dismiss this collection, trust me that you'll enjoy seeing them in HD and having George's definitive vision. He actually \\"improved\\" the Han Solo/Greedo meeting in the Cantina and although Han didn't technically shoot first, it was recut to look a lot better than the previous version. I was pleasantly surprised. He actually gave in a little and listened to how awful it looked before.Anyway, I really like having them all in one collection and you will too.

The prequel movies are universally viewed as inferior to the original trilogy, yet with each tinkering George makes the original trilogy more like the prequels - lots of CGI with no heart. Blu-Ray technology easily allows Lucas the ability to incorporate more than one version of the film, so if he must alter them over and over, he could at least include both versions (or even all four versions at this point). Lucas doesn't care about the fans. He doesn't care about quality. He cares about getting paid billions of dollars more to fund his next Star Wars alteration - the 3D version that's coming, with doubtless more \\"surprises\\".

Lucas has steadily ruined them against his own fans/customer's wishes and the latest Blu-ray release with it's 'improvements' only added insult to injury after promised corrections that never came.It's bad enough were stuck with Jar Jar, yet various other key scenes remain edited and ruined, or only fixed partially with a single frame fixed out of several giving a sloppy impression of the editing that was done.Given their track record, there will probably be yet another 1-2 more Blu-ray box set releases yet none will ever truly be fixed or give the series back to the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"MATTHEW WOODS, WHERE ARE YOU?????","review":"I was under the impression that Matt Woods, the guy in charge of the SOUND for this release was reading the blogs and knew people are so pissed off about some stuff.Well, why can't Lucas release this retarded version, AND give ALL the STAR WARS fans, the original trilogy as well?

'Who controls the past' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\" (Orwell, 1984, Chapter 3).Pretty much a perfect summary of what Lucas is doing, isn't it? My plan at this point is to track down the originals on DVD or VHS and forget about buying any new versions unless Lucas finally sees fit to do what he should have done in the first place and release the theatricals on high definition.Darth Vader's not-so-great new scene in ROTJ is what did it for me. That scene was one of my favorites. It was so powerful before.

As the reviews are showing, I am not the only person disappointed with Lucas/Lucasfilms' decision to alter the films for the Blu Ray release. Let Lucasfilm take note.

He is a salesmen.Here is what you get for $90:- The PT.

And that's what this is a 2 star.BUT the originals...are terribly doneFirst off, it's not true HD. In fact most of it looks standard. Secondly in A New Hope, during the escape from the death star, where Luke and Han are shooting the TIE fighters. The fighters have a little brown box around them on several frames, AND during one frame it actually goes back to FULL screen, from widescreen. Then while Luke is about to destroy the death star, one of the tie fighters there, actually is transparent somehow lol. Luke's lightsaber still changes color twice. AND Obi-Wan's does as well during the fight with Vader it turns purple several times.I'm actually really considering returning this.

I think they did a very good job of balancing the use of new special effects with preserving the original look and feel of the work.I know a lot of people are unhappy about some of the editing choices based on what I read here but for me this is an amazing update to a childhood classic. And, a good value at less than $15 per episode not including the bonus material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection, once I upgraded firmware","review":"I Popped this into my Panasonic BDP-51FD Blu Ray player, and was not a happy camper when none of the discs would play.

In the original version of Empire, after Luke jumps and falls through the chute in Bespin, there's a scene which shows Vader briskly walking and in a pissed off, gravely voice says \\"Bring my shuttle\\".In the new version, the voice in the same tone as Jedi, says \\"tell my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival\\". The very next scene shows what is supposed to be the shuttle landing in the star destroyer. It's not, it's the opening scene in Jedi of the shuttle landing in the Death Star2!! I mean come on king George. If you're going to tinker with your toys at least try not to insult our intelligence.I would like to know why in the original version of Jedi, R2's beeps changed from the first two films and Vader's voice became more digitized.

You can thank Gary Kurtz for how well \\"The Empire Strikes Back \\" Turned out. They had their falling out over the direction of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".

Return of the Jedi has completely lost its impact, and atmosphere from the 1983 original. BUYER BEWARE!! I'm just making this opinion from watching it, and now I wish I hadn't.

In Empire Strikes Back, you can vividly see the fur on the tauntaun. The special edition additions were blended in much better then with the previous DVD set. I'm not a fan of the Special editions, this set makes it more bare able. The prequels look on par with the original trilogy, however episode 3 is the show stopper. By far the best picture quality of the set.2. Audio 7 out of 5. - The sound on this set is amazing. I couldn't believe my ears as the Tie's were buzzing past my ears from my home theater.The only reason I am giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't include the original theatrical versions.

Why should I have to suffer and only be able to receive the crap that Lucas wants to put out? Make it available to have a choice and I'll change my rating, but as far as I'm concerned this product is only worth 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are still 3 more episodes....maybe.","review":"As with Walt Disney's feeling about Disneyland, I feel like George Lucas' opinion on \\"Star Wars\\": Episodes 1-6 as something that he will ALWAYS be tinkering with.I'm one of those fans who still believe in my heart of hearts that he will finish Episodes VII-IX in the next 5 years. Even his best friend Steven Spielberg has said that \\"George always wanted to do 9.\\" I know that he has said that he's done doing theatrical Star Wars films...but he has said many things and done the opposite.People say that he's too old to do another trilogy..well, some directors were directing well into their 70s and 80s.I will be one of the many fans/or fools, to be purchasing the 9 disc set. I'm also a Episode 4-6 'purist', and that the prequels were a bit of a let down for the over 35+ year old crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"They did it with the Godfather","review":"Lucas could take a hint from his friend Coppala. The Godfather trilogy on blu-ray with its original theatrical release was not cleaned up, but restored. Lucas, do a restoration to the original trilogy for us. A good film to watch in the dark in its original glory. Part of being in this business is giving your fans and the people what they want. Cameron did it as well with the Alien release. Your other friend Steven did it with Encounters of the third kind. ITS NOT HARD. Include ALL versions, for everyone. YOu will make a HUGE amount more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet 6 pack! plus three...","review":"Fun! Great addition to my video library. I am glad to have this set.

While the picture and sound may be the best yet for the series, Lucas once again makes ridiculous changes to the original trilogy (who cares what he does with the prequels... They're awful) that need not be made. George, for the sake of Star Wars fans everywhere, please just stop. You've done enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott","review":"One of the definitions of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome than before. DON'T buy this crap in the hope that Lucas will finally get some sense and put out the product people want. So long as people keep shelling out money for new versions of Star Wars minus the original cuts, just so we can get the few new extras he cynically adds each time, he will continue to pull this moneygrabbing crap and withhold what everyone really wants. Lucas: \\"Come back to me baby. I won't hurt you again!\\" Right answer: \\"No\\". Wrong answer: \\"OK, baby. I'm sure you'll be different this time because you WANT to change.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanting the original versions","review":"Do I want the movies to go to blu-ray? Yes. Do I want the new \\"better\\" versions? No. I liked the movies the way they were before Lucas \\"enhanced\\" them, thereby eliminating the appeal for me.Will I buy these on blu-ray? No. Not without the original versions. I have the originals on DVD--and even threw out the \\"enhanced\\" versions, in favor of the ones I saw when I was a kid.So, until Lucas changes his mind (what little there is of it--he's a nut, if you ask me), I will not migrate to blu-ray for these inferior versions--even if they are on blu-ray. I'll stick to the old tried-and-true versions--where Han shot first--and YES, I care about that, because having Greedo shoot first totally alters Han's image--for the worse.So you go ahead & go for the blu-ray. Even if the quality isn't at the top of the heap for the old ones, I'll stick with them instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This package is just great, all of it from the box art to the content inside.

Lucas should buy the Mona Lisa and add some more paint to it every couple of weeks. I hear in the 3D version that the unmasked Darth Vader will now be a black guy. There are many more changes than people think. There are so many ridiculous additions in the scenes leading up to the bar scene that its unwatchable. I couldn't get through the Episode IV. This will stay in a drawer somewhere and go down as a waste of money. I won't even bother to watch V & VI (Noooooooooo). I-III are made for TV junk anyway. Hayden Christenson was horrible to start but gets worse every time you see it again. Those 3 are were ruined beyond repair the moment Lucas decided to direct them.Anyway that is getting off topic. This is ridiculous. Worse than Woodstock on Bluray in which they re-mixed the songs adding new music from the kids of the musicians 40years after the fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that changed Hollywood","review":"George Lucas may tinker with the movies, and fans my cry and whine about it, but in the end, Star Wars created the Hollywood blockbuster and brought me (and countless others) many, many hours of fun and play as a kid.

Got it in a week after release thanks to shippign mistake and put in my computer Blu ray drive as thats what I run my home theater from.Lwo and behold, Fox studios changed the encryption on its newer blurays, including X-Men First Class and Star Wars, and so software Blu Ray players wont play them at all. Contacted software manufacturer who said they are working on a fix, but its been 2 months and still no word on a possible fix.Contacted Fox DVD, they said its not their problem as it plays on standalone blu ray players.So spent $90, waited over 6 months or so now, and still cant watch any of the saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOoooooooo","review":"That should pretty much sum it up.

The only other thing that I'm kind of mad about besides this whole Vader screams \\"Noooo\\" thing, is the fact that 3 out of the 4 local stores by my house won't sell me gold spray paint, Sudafed, or Crazy Glue anymore.

He has a right to change his movies. Sure he does! He has a right to burn in hell but I don't want to follow him there. Some of the original changes made for the SE were at least tolerable and at least one change made sense, like the voice of the actor who spoke for Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back was replaced with the voice of the actor who played Jango Fett in the prequels; but it's getting out of hand with this new release. What would it look like if some nut went back and put digital alterations on the Wizard of Oz or The Sound of Music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Definitive Collection Laserdisc is still superior","review":"For the sole reason that it still is the \\"definitive\\" version. It has the best picture of an unaltered release which is sad to the say the least.I was ready to buy the Blu Ray collection even with Han shooting first until I heard of Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOOOO\\" at the end of RTOJ.I'm definitely not a fanboy, but I refuse to buy these as long as Lucas has slung even more abuse upon \\"his\\" films.Instead of bowdlerization of books as in the 19th century, we have \\"lucasization\\" of landmark films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars in Blu Ray","review":"So Star Wars has never been perfect, but that has always been what has made it special.

As a fan of the original movies, it kills me when Lucas adds in extras to a movie just because he feels it makes it \\"better\\". Yes, it's his property and he can do with it what he wants, but it still doesn't mean he SHOULD. Adding in Christensen at the end of ROTJ was bad enough in the DVD release, now adding in another \\"Noooooo!\\", CGI eyelids and a terrible redo of the Krayt Dragon call seals, or rather unseals, the deal on buying the blu-ray edition. As a fan of the Original trilogy, please George, release the original, unaltered versions of the movies on Blu-Ray.

This time they've added to the CG adulteration and the addition of Vader yelping \\"nooooo\\" as he tosses the Emperor. All this does, other than to turn classic into corny, is to remind us that whatever Lucas was in the 70s and 80s, some kind of mental degeneration has turned him into something else entirely. With every corny, cheap, unimaginative, and tasteless project he's taken up since that original trilogy, he's only worked to sour the legacy of those amazing 3 movies. And now this Blu Ray serves to inflict that onto those movies themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOOOOOO","review":"Garbage. The revisions need to stop.

Disappointing as they were, they were too minor to ruin such otherwise great movies for me (although the CGI sarlacc was really dumb). However, this release is an entirely different matter. One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOO\\" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke. I don't want the next generation to grow up watching this version which why I urge everyone to rate this set 1 star. Casual fans of the series or parents looking to buy this for their kids need to know that this is not the version to go with. Why can't Lucas just release the remastered originals? I've been a lifelong Star Wars fan and and it looks like I have finally joined the Lucas haters."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mas!","review":"Lucas has tinkered with the original trilogy one too many times.

Don't laugh, it will happen.I'm done.

For even hardcore fans like, me it is a lil' disappointing to see no original trilogy without any changes, any way, the changes made to the films make it really good. For example, the animated Yoda for episode 1 is just fantastic. So if you don't mind watching a modern anakin skywalker at the end of episode VI, this might be for you.

Maybe a loss of 30% of detail due to black crush is unimportant to many people. Maybe pink lightsabers do not trouble majority.

Lucas has to be sitting on this because the mid 90's widescreen VHS release was close to this very thing.Such a shame.

Then the ridiculous scene with the CGI Jabba, which stands out worse than anything, continues the downhill slide. The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.Just like Darth Vader now says \\"NOOOO\\" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this \\"Star Wars\\" release."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER","review":"hate to tell you guys this, but it's unlikely we'll ever see the theatrical releases on blu-ray.Lucas can say all he wants about remasters and how expensive it is to remaster blah blah blah.there are enough fanboys out there who have access to the equipment needed..

I'll stick with my laser disc copy. I threw away the fully legit copies I bought (several btw, not just one bite at the apple) because the only way to see the Cantina scene with the original music and where Greedo is murdered in cold blood is to steal the film -- that is, if you care about aspect ratios and image quality anyway.

If so, it's hideous. If not, it's still hideous. Based on what some folks have already written here on Amazon, I went over to the official site to find the actual specs. That's specs as in aspect ratio, transfer rate, format, languages, etc. And you know what? I couldn't find them. Maybe you'll have better luck searching than I did, but this does not bode well for what these discs will contain. You'd think LucasArts, or any studio, would be trumpeting that these blu-rays are prepared using the highest transfer rate available, that they're new digital \\"prints\\" taken direct from the masters, that this is the definitive version of each film...unless, of course, they aren't.

You first released Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977. That film made you a bajillion dollars then and in the years after. Ditto for the original releases of ESB and ROTJ. Maybe you hate them now. Maybe you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, tortured over the hell you created in 1977+. Well, too bad. Suck it up. You became a billionaire thanks to fans who watched your films in 1977+, not '97, 2004, whatever. I'm going to be that guy and say it, you OWE US the originals. Period. End of discussion. Why? Because those are the films that made you rich, that we loved growing up. The films we paid for in 1977+. So, yes, George you friggin' douchebag, you OWE US those films.

TIA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I still had a VHS machine","review":"Like so many others, I pre-ordered this edition back in January of 2011 with great anticipation. Given the large data capacity of the blu ray disc, it never occurred to me that Mr. Lucas would NOT include the original theatrical versions of Episodes IV-VI alongside the \\"improved\\" editions. While I respect Mr. Lucas's right to manipulate his property, I will not give him my hard earned money for this version of these beloved movies from my childhood. Call me a nerd, call me a geek, call me an old timer. All I want are the original versions we saw in the theaters. Mr. Lucas, maybe if enough of us return or cancel our orders, you will reconsider this ill-conceived release. I'd gladly pay more for the original versions alongside your updated ones in one giant set. Amazon... you'll be receiving my return shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"George ruining everything","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. The changes George made with the special editions was bad enough, but he's not completely neutered Darth Vader.The biggest travesty is that Lucas is making all these changes and the only movie in the original trilogy that he wrote or directed was A New Hope. I'm sure Jedi's director wouldn't agree with that Vader \\"Nooooooooo\\"I was going to buy the Blu Rays, but not anymore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming soon...3D!","review":"I understand a 3D version will be released in February. Imagine the possibilities: 3D original theatrical, 3D revised theatrical, 3D updated revised theatrical, 3D where Greedo and Han shoot at the same time. I can see the comments now: \\"I want a set with Episode IV in 2D, and Episode III in 3D, but only with pre-THX 1.1 sound. And wouldn't it be great if Harrison Ford could be inserted into Episode II as some sort of time-warped Indiana Jones.\\" Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas is a Jerk","review":"This release had the potential to be something wonderful. We could finally have all the magic of Star Wars with the advances of more modern HD technology. Lucas has become obsessed with visual effects, so you'd think this update would be right up his alley. Sadly, he took this opportunity to change the original trilogy again, and add in more crap that just makes the movies worse. Beyond that, the updates to visuals could have been a tad better as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad changes","review":"Not what you remember.

Haven't seen them since I saw them in the theater and let me tell you, they LOOK fantastic as far as transfer goes and sound fantastic... BUT, these movies didn't get any better over time after a second viewing. I will forever ignore this era of the SW chronology. I know the original SW films seem a bit cheezy coming back to them, but they HOLD UP! These newer films do not. Terrible. Just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hrrmmph.","review":"I, like most true fans, am angry that the original films won't be present on this new set. Having said that (Larry David), I will - of course - be caving and purchasing it. Mr. Lucas, you are a thief if there ever was one. Know that with every dollar you amass you tear a little piece from the foundation of your legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Death of Star Wars, and the End of a Legendary Legacy","review":"Star Wars was a classic. Empire Strikes Back was a great sequel. Return of the Jedi was a letdown. The Prequels were an embarrassment to filmmaking. And then... Lucas started CHANGING THE ORIGINALS FOR NO REASON AT ALL. This was an abomination, and this is where I, and many others drew the line. Do not buy this. Do noy line Lucas' pockets. Take a stand and show the world that revisionism of classic movies should not be tolerated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redoiculous","review":"I'm wondering... Is it possible for Mr Lucas to maybe take my life and redo it as well so that I don't have to witness this kind of scam anymore. I was trying not to think about the release date on blu ray ( hoping the time would go by quicker) but I couldn't wait so I went to pre order and saw all of the poor reviews, which I read, and to no surprise was thoroughly disgusted and angry.Doesnt he have enough money to make his own copy that he can watch on his own?

The additions, especially the Vader NO are ridiculous and this has to stop at one point.Lucas is completely out of touch with reality and being the only powerful guy that nobody can say anything to him, he is doing obsessive ridiculous things.Lucas try to remember again, movie making and Star Wars as you said before, is not a one man work. It was a collaborative effort and the input of all those great people, made it great. Star Wars is not great just because of you. YOU DIDN'T MAKE STAR WARS.Learn from Lord of the Rings George. I just gladly bought again the entire trilogy on Bluray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Well, thanks for ruining the ending of Return of the Jedi. I know now not to buy this set.

All I have to say is if you don't like the new movies don't watch them. If you don't want to pay for the new releases and new material or the added scenes... then don't! Last time I checked I didn't think it was a requirement to be a Star Wars fan. Appreciate the story, appreciate that Lucas after 34 years is still getting fans. If nothing ever changed neither would the fan base the stories would die with the aging fans that are still trying to hold on to their youth for some strange reason. And for the record for all of you that think that Harrison Ford is just as upset as you about the state of the galaxy did you see the Crystal Skull? I rest my case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying this.","review":"I see now that I have to hold on to my THX laserdisc original versions a whole lot longer.I will absolutely, unequivocably, NOT buy this. It really irks me that George Lucas shows such flagrant disrespect not only to fans of the films, but to the films themselves. In the interest of brevity, let me put it simply: RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS! William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin did it right with The Exorcist Blu-Ray: they treated the original 1973 version and the 2000 expanded edition as seperate entities, and gave each a lavish and respectful co-release in one, awesome package. That way, Mr Lucas, you present your updated version, while still honoring and respecting the hallowed place the original films hold in the hearts and imagination of a generation. Until then...NO SALE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defaced Edition","review":"George Lucas didn't make Star Wars single-handedly, not even close. He didn't do much of the writing on the 2nd or 3rd, nor did he direct them. Hundreds if not thousands of artists collaborated to give us episodes 4,5, and 6, but whether you're a fan or a historian of their work, its impossible to see it. What we have instead are versions where one maniacal individual has defaced numerous scenes, and completely destroyed others. But hey, lets just pretend that he owes nothing to the people that made these films great against all odds and that we the fans who willed his little media empire into being with our support 30-some years ago shouldn't expect the tiny modicum of respect that it would take to authorize a disk with the un-altered films. It blows my mind that there are people who care enough about Star Wars to defend this, and yet can't wrap their head around why the special ed versions are terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movies keep stopping in the middle of the movie,,,,,,,another waste of money and it was a gift for my son.

More like Boo-Nay!","review":"I've never purchased the original trilogy on DVD, as I wanted to spend my money only once on a pristine edition of the three films I remember from my childhood. I'm saddened by George Lucas opting to not include the versions we purists prefer. And really, it's not so much a case of hating on his digitally 'updated' renditions; it has more to do with omitting pieces of theatrical history. It's as though Lucas has gone to work in George Orwell's world of 1984, rewriting history so many times that nobody can remember what the truth was anymore. Boo. Nay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic Computer Animated Version","review":"Don't buy this unless you like computer animated cartoons inserted randomly throughout the movie you grew up with.

Keep the original films the same OR AT LEAST include them as the original presentation with the package. Any changes done should get positive approval from the SW community.You would THINK of all the people working at Lucasfilm that they would have at least 10 hard core fans view all of these changes and give their honest opinions about them. I'm starting to think George Lucas comes up with an idea and no matter how bad it is (like these ridiculous sounding new audio clips) the cronies at the ranch just say \\"Yes, master\\" and do the work without any honest input!A \\"no-brainer\\" purchase just got turned into a \\"we'll see\\". :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Original Versions","review":"These films are Lucas' babies.

That's the reason why I won't buy them. Unless the original theatrical release versions are released on Blu-Ray as well (or with seamless branching) I will not give Lucas any more of my money for these films--especially for Blu-Ray editions. Blu-Ray is the best format available and consumers deserve the best release--and that would be the versions that WON the Academy Awards for visual effects--not re-tooled band-aid versions!

Some of us really like them that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed this will not have original theatrical versions","review":"I had originally ordered this set in April, 2011 only to cancel the order after thinking about it.

Like the Alien Anthology, Fox has opted to use a sleeve-book case. Not a multi-disc BD case, not slim BD cases, not even a digipak. Just the lackluster protection of cardboard sleeves to guard the Blu-Ray discs.However, from the pictures I've seen, the UK release uses a more commonsense case design (either a multi-disc BD case or slim BD cases in a box).Using a case like this for a catalog title of this magnitude is utterly disgusting.

Obi won's new howl as well, is really shockingly poor.If these revisions weren't disturbing enough, the colors are still atrocious, Vader's lightsaber is still pink in certain shots, the black levels are still crushed, and most of the other errors from the 2004 masters are still here.

Yeah there are some scenes its noticable, but I don't care that much. But at the scene in Return of the Jedi when vadar grabs his master and tosses him to save his son, its a very powerful scene but adding no has no value in it and sounds really silly. I'm glad I got the dvds that have the original theatrical release. I'm very surprised that the Blu ray doesn't have them which is a major downer. So I would buy it one day, but not this copy.

He couldnt leave the classic poster designs of the period alone.As far as the films are concerned, I wish Lucas would just get on with it and digitize the entire saga with digital characters, voices etc.I have a sneaking suspicion that after the entire world buys yet another format of this film, he will license Criterion to release the ORIGINAL trilogy as it was released back in the 1977-1983. BTW, is it me or is Lucas starting to look like Jabba the Hutt? Where does his multichins end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for fans to edit back to the originals","review":"First off, the fact that episodes 1-3 are included already makes this a waste of time and money. Those movies were some of the worst movies ever made. To make things worse, the alterations and additions ruin episodes 4-6. At some point, the true fans of Star Wars episodes 4-6 will find 35mm prints of the films, and re-edit them in high-def to their original, un-molested form. Wait for those versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"To quote Caesar...\\"NO!\\"","review":"OK, George.

I encourage others to do the same. Sorry Amazon but this is pure garbage and George Lucas is an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have any respect for Star Wars, don't buy it.","review":"For those of you who want the original, unedited trilogy; I'm sorry, you won't find it here. Not only that, but you have to buy three completely worthless movies just to get the ruthlessly edited three good ones. I'm not going to lie, it is still possible to ignore all of the edits and have a good time; the original trilogy is just that good. At this point however, I just don't want to give George Lucas any more money, as the man clearly has no respect for his audience, his critics, or even his coworkers (for those of you who are unaware, one egregious example is the fact that Lucas superimposes prequel trilogy actors into key scenes involving Darth Vader and the Emperor, thus overwriting and erasing the work of the actors who originally played those roles.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime without the theatrical versions!","review":"The 2011 Blu-ray release will NOT include the theatrical versions of the original films. Instead they will include only the special feature versions with all of the unnecessary and distracting computer generated special effects that Lucas added years later. If Lucas wants to re-write the films, he should re-shoot the entire movies. Simply inserting a few minutes of special effects using the latest whiz-bang technology into a film made with older technology is completely distracting. Furthermore the additions add nothing to the story line and are totally unnecessary. Save your money until they sell a blu-ray release that includes the original theatrical versions. Lucas did the same thing when the series first came out on DVD - he included only the special feature versions in the first release. A few years later he released a set that included both the special feature versions and the original theatrical versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucker....NOT!","review":"George...tired of making excuses for your obvious disregard for the fans that have created your fortune.

It's also written lucidly, and it has projects or problems scattered throughout the chapters, as well as at the ends. of the chapters.I found Word 2000 for Dummies very useful when I wanted to quickly tackle a task I rarely do. The index is helpful, and the text is clear and easy to follow. For example, its discussion of mail merge is one of the clearest and most logical I've seen. It enabled me to do a mail merge when I suddenly had to do this one day. Following the instructions in Word 2000 for Dummies, I did this successfully on the first attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book because I wanted info on how to insert data from an Excel spreadsheet into a Word document. The 1/2 page on Excel spreadsheets was absolutely worthless as all it said was to paste/copy, which is not what I wanted to do. After a lot of trial and error I finally figured it out by myself. If you just want the basics I guess the book is OK but for anything advanced it's not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"A little more wiccan than witchcraft, but still a good read. I liked that the author's writing style is very personal; she writes as if she is talking to you which is nice. She also includes a lot of nice little folk traditions like the story about the woman walking counter-clockwise around her heighbors house to hex it, or her own experiences with the Morrigan. I think that this book probably does present a good picture of actual practice of some people in Ireland today and so its worth the read to get a feel for modern witchcraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense..no fluff","review":"I haven't finished reading this yet, but from what I have read, this book is a must. Ms. O'Brien pulls no punches and tells it just how it is. It is down to earth and not full of the Fluff101 garbage that so proliferates the world of Pagan writings of all kinds. It is a great read, and I can't wait to finish so I can read it again. I have found a new book to recommend to people who are just starting out in the Craft or who just want to know more about Witchcraft. After reading this work there should be no mistaken perceptions or delusions. I also am so grateful for the proper pronunciations she provides of the gaelic language she uses throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I really didn't find anything new in this book that I hadn't already read somewhere else and in those books, I didn't have to deal with O'Brien's Irish elite philosophy. Sharynne NicMhacha\\"s Queen of the Night has much more to offer. O'Brien has a real problem with anyone claiming Celtic origins due to the blood in their veins. To me this denies cellular memory and the natural inclination to work with tribal and ancestor deities that one may be drawn to. I'm proud that she can call herself a \\"Irish Witch\\", but equally proud to call myself a \\"natural witch\\" with an Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Texan ancestry. I would love to visit the country and I would love to learn the language and I'm sure it would enrich any spiritual path, but it isn't a prerequisite to being an authentic witch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Irish traditions to life","review":"There is a rich heritage of occult and witchcraft in Ireland, usually grossly mis-represented by non-Irish authors. This is the first book by an Irish practitioner and one which successfully bridges the gap between the serious wiccan practicioner and the indigenous traditional Irish witch. It provides a firm grounding in Irish customs and folk-belief, debunks the great myths imported into the culture in recent years (witchcraft as a religion, etc) and also gives insight into how the author herself has managed to include a deeper understanding of her country's heritage and occult traditions with her already established Wiccan training. An ideal first point of contact book and one which i would hearilty recommend to anyone genuinely interested in serious Irish traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is It Folks!!!","review":"After reading numerous books on the subject of wicca/witchcraft, and hearing them used as the same word for so long, I am really glad someone finally put the fact that they are indeed two different things. This is not a book for the \\"frou frou\\" wiccans as I like to call them. If you want \\"frou frou\\" look elsewhere. This is a must have book in your library if you are truly trying to deciepher between that of the once very serious craft, now being over run by \\"frou frou's\\" who think that charmed is witchcraft at it's finest. If you are studying anything Celtic period this book is great, It's not just witchcraft in Ireland, it's history, it's geography it's IRELAND Period.

You get the impression right away that Gene knows as much about as Oz as most of us probably do, and that would be the 1939 musical starring Judy Garland. This book is about as far away from that movie as you could get. And its absolutely brilliant. Once Gene crosses the gate into the strange world of Oz he is thrust into a situation that may very well spell the end of this happy go lucky world of weirdness. The story itself is told through journal entries between Gene, trying to survive while well over his head, and his friend Aurora who firmly plants herself into the forefront of the action. All the classic characters from the film are present, but you may have to look twice at a couple because you probably wont recognize them. Over all it has a uniqueness to it that will probably appeal to most fans of the bizarro genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"OZZY!","review":"Think the original Oz books are plenty strange...but looking for something even stranger? This may just fit the bill. Oz is real, and Skipp and Levinthal crank up the weird for this decidedly modern take on Baum's classic world, filled with many of the original characters (who may or may not be as you remember them), plus conspiracy, sex, war, goomer meat, and a haunted computer. Judy Garland is rolling in her grave. Check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's how we fight a proxy war in the merry old Land of Oz","review":"Oz gets a gritty reboot. Instead of a special, magical place, it's a real place you can actually visit, provided you can get a visa. Oh, and there's a civil war going on, which is, of course, funded by the CIA. Oz is a dangerous place to visit. Magic in Oz is another kind of science; the Tin Man, Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Lion are war veterans; and as the enemy circles the Emerald city, the American expatriate owner of the most popular Mexican restaurant in town becomes a hero in the last war for Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware....","review":"I don't know if this RAM is any good because it doesn't actually fit in our PowerMac G5.

They have small wires perpendicular to the blade to help avoid slicing your skin, and this actually works quite well. The only problem is that hairs can get caught in these, so make sure you clean it out well. The little lubricating strips are also small enough to not get gunked up after repeated use.The blades shave close, last a while, and are pretty inexpensive. I would guess that since men tend to shave less surface area than women, they could last even longer.

This piece has something for everyone, all cultures, all ages, all beliefs: Traditional, rock, new age, alternative, including: Flutes, Ocarina, Drums, Cello, Guitars, Didgeridoo, Harmonica and if you get the video, the dancers are SPECTACULAR and there's no imitation there either, they are actual competition dancers from various nations. This is one CD/Video combo that everyone should have in his or her collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best CD in my collection","review":"I, too, bought this CD because I first heard the incredible voices of James Taylor and Alison Krauss in their rendition of \\"How's the World Treating You\\" on CMT. To be honest, while I appreciate all kinds of music, I had never even heard of the Louvin Brothers (they broke up before I was even born), but I rushed out to buy the CD about 2 months ago and it has hardly left my CD player. I can honestly say that every single song on this CD is outstanding. I played it so many times the first week that I memorized the words to every song, and then I bought copies for both my mother and my father-in-law, and now they're both addicted, too. I also bought the Dolly Parton compilation CD this year \\"Just Because I'm a Woman\\", and it is wonderful as well - but this is simply the best CD that I have ever listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music by great artists","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband, but have loved listening to it myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From 'O, Brother' to the Brothers Louvin","review":"Having been a long-time fan of the harmonies of the EverlyBrothers, then reading a biography on the Everlys that notedtheir affinity for the Louvin Brothers, then seeing the afore-mentioned video of Allison Krauss and James Taylor on CMT, leadto a quick search and purchase of \\"Livin' Lovin', Losin'\\".The Krauss-Taylor duet on \\"How's The World Treating You?\\" blewme away on television and captivated me on CD. Other 'ear candy'from this tribute compilation: Emmylou Harris/Rodney Crowellon \\"My Baby's Gone\\" (like it even more than Krauss/Taylor duet);\\"Are You Teasing Me?\\" (Patty Loveless/Jon Randall); and\\"Cheater's Waltz\\" with Linda Ronstadt and CD producer CarlJackson.

I was impressed with the consistency of Carl Jackson's production, the songs seemed to all work well together. Also, there is a nice line up of country stars, some of my favorites being: Terri Clark, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, Dierks Bentley, and Johnny Cash. Tracks: \\"How's the world treating you\\", \\"Must you throw dirt in my face\\", \\"I don't believe you've met my baby\\", and \\"Keep your eyes on Jesus\\" were my favorite cuts off of the album, and I would highly recommend them.

I bought it for track #4, \\"How's the World Treating You\\" with James Taylor and Allison Krauss. But listening to these wonderful old songs reminds me how clever, harmonious and REAL country music used to be. There are plenty of famous people singing the Louvin Brothers' songs - Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, Merl Haggard, Linda Ronstadt, Del McCoury, Dolly Parton - but the quality of the songs transcends the years gone by or the singers performing them. There are just no songs better than \\"New Partner's Waltz\\" or \\"Are you teasing me?\\"...and the harmony will have you singing along too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real sleeper","review":"I discovered this cd by chance and what a find! The vocals (all duets), instrumentation and arrangements are pure and exceptional. In addition to outstanding performances by the recognizable stars I also heard a very talented Carl Jackson for the first time. Especially enjoyable are Emmy Lou Harris/Rodney Crowell, James Taylor/Alison Krause but every cut is great listening. Whether or not you've heard the Louvins' original recordings any true country music fan will appreciate these excellent performances of their timeless songs.

I had to order it so we could enjoy it on CD. It was a hit on Christmas morning. Now, the new CD is off to college with the freshman... hope the room mate likes it as much as our son! What I have always appreciated about the entire \\"Child's Celebration\\" series is that all the songs are by the original artists, not some cutesy singer doing a cover of the songs. These tunes wear well on moms who spend a lot of time in the car, as chauffeur, or at home with pre-schoolers.

There are no words to describe the value of realistic hope to a narcissistic individual who is working toward characterological transformation.

There are 6 tracks in D#-/F#+, 3 tracks in Bb- and that leaves two tracks in diff keys. If they'd changed the keys on most of the songs to give more of a variety, the CD wouldn't be as repetitive.

This is a definate defect in the cradle and Magellan should replace all of the Roadmate 700 and 760's with a free unit of comperable features.

I happen to own an outdated Garmin Street Pilot V and thought this would be a superior unit, but the Garmin at least has accurate maps. 1200 bucks wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product","review":"finally rcvd my replacement unit from amazon(1st one was NOT working!).i agree with everyone here. this is a horrible unit! work OK if you can get this unit to power up. then you have to make sure that the unit stays power up. dont hit any bumps on the road.....and little movement will turn this unit off!then u have to wrestle again on powering this unit up---ahem--if u can get this thing to power up(repeat).worst mapping ever---and they wanted to charge u to update the maps?why am i paying $$ for a unit with OLD maps? i checked with a few \\"big\\" retailers, and the salepeople there confirmed that this unit is the most returned unit!mostly---DAMAGED AS IN NOT WORKING! i am returning my unit andwill get one from a better company with a better product and support.magellan--- waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with signal acquisition","review":"I purchased the Magellan 700 and took it on a trip to the Dallas area the first week. After a few days of owning this unit, it finally found where I was and performed quite well the first day or two in Dallas. We drove up to Richardson and lost the signal completely for about 4 hours. We only re-acquired it as we were returning to our hotel! The unit for some reason thought we were in Georgia! I am unable to fathom why I paid 1200 dollars for a machine for which I probably need an external antenna at extra cost. It should work well as is for that price! I am regrettably returning the unit for a refund. I am wondering if the Garmin has better signal retention?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the first year","review":"It worked for the first 15 months. It stopped acquiring the satellites after 3 months past the warrenty. I called the tech support, which is India, and was told to try a few things. They did not work. I paid 155 dollars plus shipping to have it repaired. It came back, without an explanation of what was wrong. It worked for 3 weeks and the same problem happened again. One thing that I should mention is that there was no problems until I upgraded the software (another 100 dollars). Could it be that they have a bug in the upgrade????I would never buy anything from that company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antenna Sucks","review":"Very slow start-up (sometimes 5-10 minutes to acquire a signal.) This is incredibly annoying when you need to get somewhere and must pull over and wait several minutes for directions. Five minutes seems like an eternity when you're running late. I'm no GPS engineer, but I believe the unit is slow because the antenna/hardware sucks, and no amount of software upgrades will fix this - especially in newer cars with heat reflective coatings in the windshield. (For existence my '05 Honda.) The upgrade from version 3 to version 4 costs $99, so make sure ver 4 is included. Ver 5 will release Dec '05, so wait and see if they really can fix the problem. Bottom line - I'll just buy a Garmin next time. I have not heard of similar problems with their equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"Bought this due to its price. I immediately encountered outdated maps. No problem - just download the update from the website right? Right - for $99!! They sell me an outdated semi useless device and want me to pay $99 to update to what it should have been when I bought it? I don't think so. Called the useless customer service people. \\"Nothing we can do, sorry.\\" Wrote email. No response. Called customer service again. \\"Sorry, nothing we can do.\\" The routes this thing picked were also ridiculous. Returned the unit. End of story. Good luck if you choose to ignore this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good a value as I thought","review":"The Magellan is adequate, but just is too clunky. The interfaces are not as intuitive as Garmin's new Quest or C330. I wasn't happy with my Magellan. The antenna didn't seem to keep signal very well and I couldn't get the position very well adjusted to stay out further on my dash, because of its design. If I put the unit way out there, it was so far out it became harder to read the text. Returned it for a Garmin C330. Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I acquired my RoadMate 700 Vehicle GPS about six months ago and I'm still learning my ways with it.The device works well in most locations but in cities the external antenna is a most, since the reception is quite poor.Other issues experienced are frequent freezes, some requiring to restart the device (Is it running on Windows?) and about a week ago the cradle tab broke. Believe me, I'm not the kind of guy who treats a $1,000 gadget roughly: so be aware... is fragile, quite fragile.In summary I'm not impressed by this device. When I purchased it I was thinking about the Never-Loss system that Hertz cars have, but this device falls far below the one you find in rental cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not best GPS","review":"I bought this device based (last month $569 now is $499)on the reviews here. I love it, however, there are some negatives I would like to add:1. The Manual Instruction did not help much, you'd better play around with it for the set up (configuration)such as AUTO RE-ROUTE, otherwise you maybe frustrated when getting lost on the road, and the device keeps ignoring you !2. LOCATION: won't be able to save it on the address bookSay, when you travel from point A to point B, and you stop somewhere, and try to save this location. But NO, you can not!3. POI: Point of Interest. After spending time puching the name to find the location, you can not save it either !This is my first GPS, I don't have any experience with others, so it seems OK to me. At this price right now $499, it is a good buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Magellan, Buy a Garmin","review":"You never know if the magellan will find the satellite when you turn it on. It can take up to 15 minutes. I turn it off & on trying to cycle it. I've used a Garmin 330, Works perfectly. You'll be throwing your money out the window with mine if you buy a Magellan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy a Magellan Roadmate","review":"I have been a magellan Roadmate 700 owner for over 2 years now. Customer service is lousy, and that's being generous. Map upgrades cost $100 and still didn't have my home street. This was after contacting NavTeq to have it added. (My home street shows up in mapquest.) Thales/magellan customer support assured me the updated maps (April 2006) would have my street. They didn't. On top of that, i had to purchase the AC adapter separately to install the update. The AC adapater should be included and maps should be more reasonably priced. Starting today, the auto power cord is on the fritz. The new software doens't remember my previous address if I turn my car off/restart. I have go through the cumbersome menus to reselect it. This is a DOWNGRADE from the original function. For $1,000, I expected a LOT more than this. I will be buying something from garmin for christmas to replace this piece of junk.I would give this thing 0 stars if it were a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough points of interest","review":"I was trying to search Barnes and Noble bookstore from this GPS unit but it started giving me bookstores in NY when I was located in VA. There is no way to sort the search result by proximity. I tried many other place I generally go, but the GPS could not find them. This works best when you want to locate Restaurants, gas stations and ATMs. But it will not work if you want to find a specific type of restaurant like Thai/Indian etc. For getting directions, I find Google maps much better and accurate than this GPS. Google Local's (local.google.com) \\"find business\\" fuction is far superior and extensive. There are some good things in this GPS but definitely not worth this price. (Like you can locate where you are in any unknown places )I am going to return this and try Garmin GPS instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The products is not reliable - DO NOT TRUST !","review":"I'm very upset with Thales Navigation. I bought my Roadmate 700 in April 2005. After 4 months, it started to show power issues . it was not turning on. Only blinking . but not turning on. And that happened when I was travelling !!!So I decided to send to the Repair Center. After 2 weeks, I receveid the product back ...After 4 months again ... It is showing the same power issues! It is not turning on! I'm sending the product back to the REPAIR Center, thanks god It is still covered by 1-year warranty. But I definitely feel like NEVER doing business with this company again.If you can NOT trust the reliability of a GPS ... you should not buy it! It happened twice with me ! I hope it's not bad luck ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If they only iron out the problems","review":"My Roadmate 700 arrived about 2 weeks ago. I loved the features, ease of use, and accuracy. About a week later the unit kept shutting itself off. There seemed to be a problem with the power connector that plugs into the cradle. I called Magellan Technical Support, which is very responsive, and they had me return the unit for a new. My new unit arrived today and inside of an hour it died. Magellan is now sending me another unit. If it worked I would rate it 5 stars but I am skeptical about the quality of the product. The mounting bracket is terrible but Magellan will replace it free of charge with a suction cup mount. I really like the unit and hope I get one that really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy!","review":"Afer reading many reviews about how wonderful the roadMate 700 was, I couldn't wait to obtain one. A great big mistake. Apprently it is defective. I can't place an address or location anywhere near my state, much less any other local location. As for help--NONE, not from the company or from Amazon. Look out for Amazon. They actually advertise that returning an item is easy. That is far from the truth. You can't get a rational reply from them on what to do with this defective item. Also if you start corresponding with them about trying to return someting, be prepared to spend about two days on your computer trying to explain anything to them. Easy to return indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PURCHASE ANY MAGELLAN PRODUCTS","review":"The Magellan 700 Series worked wonderfully for 19 months then it stopped working completely.It stopped working a few months after I decided not to upgrade the system.I contacted Customer Service located in India and was told there was nothing they could do for me and refused to give me an address to where I could send my GPS to be repaired.I would never recommend anyone to purchase a product from them."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},C={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",L,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const G=d(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-05789e5d"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/43.md","filePath":"sponsor/43.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/43.md"},M=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(G)]))}});export{x as __pageData,M as default};
