Taken as that, and not a comparison point for later Steve Earle, it's an excellent assortment of contemporary rockabilly tunes. Every song is not a classic, but, after hearing the vinyl album over 20 years ago, I can still mentally hear a fair number of the songs because they were that refreshing, distinctive, and enjoyable. I really liked the guitar playing and the pre-Dire Straits not-overly-processed Strat sound. The version of Devil's Right Hand on this recording is superior to any version that followed. Oddly, Steve Earle's southern accent is LESS evident here than on more recent recordings where his twang is almost annoying. Maybe he took diction lessons from Gillian Welch after this album, I don't know. Anyway, if you listen to it for what it is- rockabilly- it's a very enjoyable collection of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"This compilation, recorded in 1983 at the now-defunct LSI studio in Nashville, was the product of Earle's record deal with CBS. \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\" and \\"A Little Bit In Love\\" show writing promise, and Earle's impressive, gritty Texas guitar and sparse rockabilly instrumental arrangements (particlarly \\"Nothin But You\\") make this piece appealing for Earle die-hards and collectors, but was deemed unfit for country radio and the finished project here was unceremoniously shelved. (Ironically, \\"A Little Bit In Love\\" would later surface on Patty Loveless' second MCA CD.) For the most part, however, Earle's singing is not up to par and the few rays of light contained here did not prepare the listener (or Nashville's music heirarchy) for the monolith that was to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Tracks [EXTRA TRACKS] Specially This CD Was Skipped","review":"I See Track 4, 11, and 10 They Were All Skipped At The Whole Time"},{"rating":"2","title":"hot to trot (and cook beans)","review":"I live at a high altitude.

Story ruined by makeshift love interest. African dialect very hard to understand and sound quality poor. They took a serious subject and trivialities it with short choppy incomplete stories.

No depth, just short vignettes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train Wreck of a Movie","review":"\\"In My Country\\" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale. This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide. Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters.How did it turn out? Take a look at the DVD extras: Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found. This is a man who knows quality and knows junk. He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could.Good move.

The lyrics on this album are some of the worst I've ever heard - \\"My name is Senor Velasco, I drink my milk with tabasco\\". What! Before buying this album I bought Kindness of Strangers and Beware of Darkness, two albums I was impressed with, but this CD disappointed me. If you've never heard Spock's Beard before and you want to get into them, I recommend Beware of Darkness. Also, if you don't care about lyrics then you'd probably like this album because it is superb instrumentally."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best...","review":"This debut CD of Spock's Beard is certainly one of the best works done in the 90s. It contains four tracks only, so you can guess that the music must be monumental. It clearly is - highly complex, versatile music with odd metrics and a heavy keyboards. A must-have for Gentle Giant fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album; my first experience with this band.","review":"I don't see how this album could be rated 4 stars. From beginning to end, this is one awesome disc.I haven't heard any other of the Beard's albums (the only other material I've heard from Neal Morse is his voice on an Ayreon album), but this is by far one of my favorite purchases of the year, maybe ever.The first track is a definitely a highlight of the album. Some of the lyrics are very weird, but the whole song has a generally warm vibe, and is near perfect.The other highlight is the 23-minute epic, The Water. This is a really amazing song, and is equally as great as other prog epics such as A Change of Seasons by Dream Theater.This album is really special. If you're into progressive rock, get this now. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy effort","review":"The Light constituted my introduction to Spock's Beard. It's good enough that I want to hear more, but not so good that I don't want to hear more... you know what I mean?The title track is spunky, eclectic, and, yes, long. \\"Go the Way You Go\\" and \\"On the Edge\\" are smaller-scale: less structurally complex and more immediately palatable. However, \\"The Water\\" crosses some line with me -- a line dividing \\"interesting\\" from \\"obnoxious\\", so I tend to skip this track.The frequent comparisons to Echolyn should be qualified; they don't sound like Echolyn, but I can see some similarities in their brand of \\"progressiveness\\".A good listen. I look forward to their later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Prog Band Around","review":"I can't say enough about how amazing Spock's Beard is. I give five stars \\"plus\\" to all three of their CD's. \\"The Light\\" is composed of a few very long tracks, but unlike some prog bands, they never get bogged down in flash. The Morse brothers are such gifted musicians and the rest of the band really rocks. If \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"Foxtrot\\" give you chills, try Spock's Beard. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally some great prog","review":"Spock's Beard's first CD, \\"The Light\\" is one of the best examples of progresive rock I have ever heard, and anybody who doesn't think so needs to stop taking the music so seriously. If the lyrics are not a new revelation in your life, then fine, listen to some great instrumentation played by people who know what they are doing (for a change). Yes and Genesis are all well and good, but the lyrics they wrote are no more spectacular than these lyrics.

Whenever some deluded individual cuts me off in traffic or throws a soda can at my car I whip out \\"The Light\\" and fast-forward to the expletive-laden notorious song some people find make their jockstraps crimp up uncomfortably. To me this song is cathartic, allowing me to express my little pockets of rage SAFELY, singing along with the alienated narrator in \\"The Water\\" who feels persecuted by the world.

You'll find yourself tapping your fingers to the opening track, bobbing around joyfully to the second, and building on your musical elation until you are dancing like no one is looking when \\"Hurry Up\\" plays on your preferred media player. If \\"Please Please Please\\"--possibly the albums climax--didn't already do that. Of course the album settles you down into a mellow state of Swedish bliss with the last two tracks.

I tried removing it manually with a wrench, then repeatedly tried using liquid wrench and tapping the sensor to loosen over the course of several days, to no avail. Finally I took it to my local repair shop, where a mechanic was willing to do the replacement for a low price.

The Last Open Road far transcends car racing. This is a book about coming of age in both mind and body (Buddy Palumbo's and a few others). If ever one could wish himself into a role as a character in a novel, this is it. To us younger readers, sportscar racing in the 1950's seems like a swashbuckling experience that I am sorry I couldn't participate in...This book is simply marvelous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes just ok","review":"I was disappointed with this cookbook.

There are a lot of historical inaccuracies and anacronisms, and all the action happens \\"off-stage\\" so to speak. Hardly anything is actually dramatized, so it all feels very distant. I am very interested in the Children's Crusade, but felt this doesn't capture the medieval mindset at all and does not do a good job of capturing the fervor of the time.

However, using what he had written, various letters, and notes, his daughter Sandy collected his writings and edited them into this delightful book. I was fascinated and extremely amused reading about the exploits of the gifted (and wealthy) young Preston. His childhood was anything but usual, what with globetrotting and famous dinner guests and all; and the story of how he became a movie director is most interesting and entertaining. Full of wit and charm, this book is sure to entertain; not unlike a Preston Sturges' film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Listings","review":"1. Shorting Out2. Views (Dance Goes On)3. Wild Places4.

I love the way that Shannon Hale shows that difficult things can happen in the lives of everyone, even princesses.

If your child's looking at it, don't let the size of it discourage them, it reads pretty fast.

Her mother tries to hide and make Ani forget this gift, and bring her up as a responsible princess. But when Ani's father,the only person (except her long-gone aunt)to understand her gift dies, Ani's world is turned upside down. True personalities will be shown for good,in this tale of betrayal, surprises (both pleasant and unpleasant) and new beginnings.I would highly recommend The Goose Girl to anyone who has the time and will give any book a chance. I am also looking forward to reading the second and third books in the series, Enna Burning and River Secrets.

I read all of them in one month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I'm pushing 60 years young and I love to read these types of books. Like Robin McKinley, Shannon Hale can really write. She gives the reader a great sense of the world of Bayern and its people. The heroine, Ani, is very shy and awkward at first, but she grows throughout the book and takes great strides in standing up for herself by the end. Falada's fate is disturbing, but the author handles it well while still remaining true to the original fairy tale. I look forward to reading the rest of the Bayern series and all of Ms. Hale's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore","review":"This book captivated me instantly. It has the clarity, skill, and beauty characteristic of a classic and deserves much more acclaim than it has been granted. Although it has been categorized as a young adult book, the author's voice is mature and simple, and, I feel, relevant to any age.The plot and description is immaculate and the emotion, real. It stays with the original fairy tale but is original in its depth.I have much respect for this author and will be reading all her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goose Girl","review":"We listened to this book on CD as a family.

But I had read Shannon Hale before, and knew I wanted to see this through because I generally like her, but I didn't feel connected to the story or Isi until she got to the city and became a goose girl. I ended up being really engaged, and I intend to continue on with the series, but I have reservations: I found some things predictable, but it was so in the way that fairy tales are, so this wasn't as much of an issue as it could have been. Also, I sometimes felt that the writing was a bit heavy-handed, if that makes sense. And as I said, it takes some getting into. But in spite of all this, I would still recommend it. There comes a point where the characters come alive and seem to come into their own, and that is enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goose Girl","review":"This book always had me on the egde of my chair!

Although it is generally predictable, the main character has realistic feelings. It's just a well written, fun book. The author follows her usual traight of having the main character learn a unique skill. I have also read The Princess Academy and Enna Burning by the same author and this book is slightly better than Enna Burning.

Along the way her lady-in-waiting and her cronies mutiny so Selena can take Ani's place and become queen in Bayern. But Ani escapes and learns to survive by becoming the king's goose girl and befriending others.The Good: It's a cute story, clean, and has morals to teach, such as finding who you are. Ani is a strong character and so are the others that we meet. Shannon Hale writes this story well.The Bad: This just wasn't my style. I enjoy a good fantasy novel, but this one didn't hold my interest. But I can see why so many people like it.

I'm usually someone who gets car sick VERY easily, but not so with Ms. Hale's The Goose Girl. Apparently, my body recognized how much I loved this book and responded accordingly. Or maybe, my imagination was just so engrossed by Ms. Hale's fantasy that I was able to escape even motion sickness. Either way, this book is fantastic.

How thrilled I was to read a novel based upon the story!Shannon Hale, as most writers of fairy tale retalings, goes an extra step to make a threat of warfare behind the simple story of a betrayed princess.Ani is a princess with a load of responsibilities and loyalties, including an arranged marriage with the purpose of creating a union between two kingdoms. She also happens to have a special gift--speaking to nature (which fits very well into the original fairytale).This is a story full of the usual romance and adventure, but it also packs an extra dose of magic and a surprisingly delightful addition of political strategy.A great read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hale's Masterful Debut","review":"Author Shannon Hale uses her talent of writing beautiful prose and her masterful gift for storytelling in this epic, emotional, fast-paced and stunning debut novel based on the fairly well known Brothers Grimm tale. The book may be long, but each of its 383 pages are captivating and dripping with detail and sentences so incredibly visual that the reader often feels as though they are actually in Bayern, the country in which a vast majority of the story takes place in.The main character, Ani, is delicate, gentle, lovely, and yet stong-willed and intelligent. She is beautiful and graceful, and, although she is a princess, she is not a steriotypical one at all. Ani is out there, in the world, suffering and striving to reach her ultimate goal, and, on the way, she finds love and discovers who she truly is, and who she is meant to become."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I started reading it on recommendation from a friend with no background knowledge of the story.

In addition, it continues on to more advanced topics which may not be covered at the undergraduate level; for example, the heavy emphasis on determinants and the more rigorous treatment of spaces, leading to affine spaces.

First, it was a little dull. Reading it soon after Keith Mathison's \\"Postmillenialsim: An Eschatology of Hope\\", I found \\"Amillenialism\\" to be quite a bit duller. It took me a while to get through it. But, it does go deep, no doubt.

There are some helpful tidbits, the scholarship is fine, but is very basic, undergrad, laymen material. So if your looking for a good introduction to the subject of amillenialism, this book is fine. If you are looking for a lot of depth, this book is sorely lacking in my opinion, especially in the section on the Olivet Discourse-Matthew 24."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"book arrived within a week and was in excellent condition.

While other books, perhaps those that adequately discuss each of the historical, orthodox views of the end of time, might be a better introduction to how those positions opposite amillennialism differ, this is an excellent introduction into the topic. The issue of the devil being bound in today's day remains one of the more thorny issues for amillenialism, and while his book does address this, it remains a point of fairly obvious contention for others. All in all, a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned knowledge or Spirit knowledge","review":"Content much different than what has been talked about and taught in the general Christian public.

This book is the whole Bible agreeing on the events of the end times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive effort to correct End Times Sensationalism","review":"Excellent topic by topic refutation of premillenial and post millenial errors.

Thanks be to God!Sincerely,Mark Raddatz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presenting the Truth","review":"Dr. Riddlebarger does a masterful job of presenting the different millennial views held by most Christians. He is so thorough in his discussion of this topic that the Premil and Postmil reader will most assuredly reconsider their positions and the problems contained therein. The need for a book that clearly lays out the biblical support for the Amillennial position has been needed for sometime and I would have to say that this book fulfills that need. This is a book that every student of theology should read and carefully consider when dealing with the difficult subject of eschatology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - even for Dispensationalists","review":"Let me say up front I hold a dispensational view when it comes to eschatology, however, I must admit I have not spent much time studying covenant theology. I was challenged by several to consider the other perspective, and so I did a random search on Amazon to find a book which covers the topic. I landed on this one, and I must say it is a very thorough work. The author does a nice job exploring in depth the key passages - Daniel 9, Rom. 9-11, etc. and providing the covenant interpretation. His book answers several questions regarding the covenant perspective. It's presented in layman's terms, and is an easy read.At the end of the day he has not convinced me to adopt covenant theology, but if you're interested in understanding how key, end times Scriptures are interpreted from a covenant perspecitve, I would highly recommend this book as a starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful, but limited study","review":"Riddlebarger has written a helpful summary of the amillennial eschatology. His book is especially helpful when it counters the dispensational view, but is not as effective in countering postmillennialism.If you want to know what drives the amillennial outlook, this is a helpful (though deficient) book. For those interested in seeing a postmillennial response to some of the key arguments, see: Kenneth Gentry, ed., Thine Is the Kingdom (Chalcedon). It would have been interesting to see how Riddlebarger would have responded to Gentry's counter-arguments. Maybe in a second edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This series has two great CD-books, and this isn't one","review":"This CD is just a series of animal noises.

It boggles the mind why MGM would cut the section described as it doesn't seem to have been a Code violation.Although I'd much prefer the original French dialog track with English subtitles, I thought the dubbing wasn't too bad, but it's lost in the poor quality of the audio which is heavily distorted in the loud parts.Given the choice of this version on DVD versus nothing at all, I'd say get this version -- however be aware that it has many faults and it will leave you wanting to find a better version.I rate the film 5/5 but this transfer 1/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"The depiction of child sexual abuse in the movie is a powerful and truthful account of the devastating effects child abuse has on a person.

Pretty much the same storyline we've seen time and time again. But, I love Kimberly Elyse. I'm not a church person so I won't comment on the LONG scenes in the churh with the songs, because if you're into that you'll love it.

The Church is not going to truly make a difference until she gets her head out of the sand and faces these realities. I applaud Bishop Jakes for keepin' it real and having the courage to address the issue of sexual abuse. I had to confront the issue with my wife's family because my wife was abused by her brother for 9 years. This is a very real problem that needs to be addressed without any sort of buffering to those who are not victims. As in the movie where the main character's mother does not believe her, my wife's family sided with her brother and looked at me with contempt as if I'd done something wrong.

This gorier version still doesn't cut the mustard in the plot development department and the computer generated werewolf is not scary...can anyone say FAKE!, I'm bored of this review.

NO.","review":"The commercial for the movie made it seem like it was going to be 'really scary.' but after I saw the movie, I was rather disappointed. The movie was not scary at all. and I had gotten my hopes up for something really good before I saw it in theaters. the first thing that I want people to understand, is that if you are expecting a true horror film, this is NOT it.but even though it was not scary, it was a fairly interesting movie. you want to know what happens, so no, you don't get bored easily. it was an 'ok' movie. but after I saw it, I knew that I did NOT want it. Don't see this movie. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wes Craven, go back to Elm Street please","review":"Hey Wes Craven, i like your Nitemare on Elm Street series but this is not ur cup of tea. It is bad enough that the pace of this movie is slow but when you add Chachi from Happy Days to play a small role here, you know where this is headed. Who wrote the dialogue for Curse anyways. If this is your day job, quit man. It is just a typical run in the mill howlers for all you wolf masters out there. Ricci is a good actress and she does a good job with what is given for her part but the dialogue stinks. I actually fell asleep so i do apologies for not being able to tell you if the ending is anti-climatic or not...then again, let's assume it is....would i recommend this movie for good entertainment fun? ..LOL that is funny.This is the type of movie you show on Mystery Science Theater 3000 but not for the big dance. It's 80s style cheesewhiz gore....if you into those, then watch it. Just be prepare to doze off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Christina Ricci's talent was wasted on this movie, the gore was kept low and the werewolf was hilarious.

But like so many movies these days involving my two favorite creatures (vampires and shape-shifters, it went awry.

Some things are meant to be gory, not funny and down right brutal!I like Christina Ricci but this is one of her worst films to date! I recommend Dog Soldiers if you're in the market for an excellent werewolf movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm....","review":"So this must be why Miramax was able to convince Wes Craven to promote Project Greenlight...He failed with this turkey.

Check out American Werewolf or the Howling instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half baked attempt","review":"First of all any movie that has Scot Baio playing a cameo of himself is in deep trouble. Wes Craven is old and tired, like Stephen King, both ruled their respective world's, but now must move aside. The tank is empty, the imagination is dried up, and whatever the make is just a shadow of past works.Not any scary scenes here. Mostly just quick appearances that are supposed to make you jump (whee). The gay high school wrestler was the final straw, I finished the movie just to finish it. I don't understand why anyone would buy this. This is a movie that is watched once and quickly forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word: Lame","review":"Tired cliches, the cheap \\"shock\\" scares with sudden noises or imagery, and nothing redeeming about it. Apparently the film studios are hurting for money and want to get horror movies out ASAP, otherwise I can't see why they would make such trash. This film could have been a lot better, a rehash of the teenage werewolf tale, but it fails miserably. Seems they ran short on the budget at the end, as we didn't even get a fully transformed werewolf from any of them. Sad, sad, sad. Skip it by all means. If you must see it, rent it, buying it would be a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary! Sorry Wes.","review":"A brother and sister team are biten by a werewolf that then stalks them. I'm usually a fan of Wes Craven, but he missed by a mile on this one.This is a hugely flawed story. The brother and sister are biten by a werewolf, but still run when it shows up. Why? What are they afraid of, aren't they already cursed?Then there is the flaw of the werewolf that made them wanting to destroy them? Why did he turn them to werewolves in the first place if he just wanted to kill them? Didn't he make killing them harder by turning them into something supernatual? He could have just killed them in the beginning.Also, Craven strays from the werewolf legend by making the werewolves retain their control and ability to reason when morphed into full werewolf. It would be scarier to make the werewolves into out of control creatures that mindlessly kill without reason.There were a couple attempts at humor that did not help the story and came across as cheesy. Not what I want in a werewolf flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it could have been","review":"I agree this movie pretty much sucked but Craven fans should know the facts before they start raving about how low he went on this film. Wes owed Dimension one more movie and that ended up being Cursed. Now what we have here isn't even that film he started to make. Craven originally filmed most of this movie in an almost entirely different version that Dimension decided they didn't like because it was a HORROR movie and wasn't hip and funny enough. That's when Kevin Williamson rewrote the script to be this piece of poo that we all watched. So Wes had to re-shoot the movie to suit the new script. Basically he hates it, and his new movie coming out, Red Eye, is for I believe Dreamworks pictures not Dimension.Thank you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, not terrifying.","review":"I watched this movie not knowing exactly what to expect, so-unlike some- I wasn't disappointed. A cute story with humorous dialogue. Somewhat normal when it comes to the plot: a typical werewolf movie. I did enjoyed it greatly and would recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh and doesn't mind a bit of blood and gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cursed is right!","review":"What a letdown. Two great horror/comedy wits and a great cast add up to very little in this werewolf film. Poor Christina Ricci was probably just looking for a way to get her face back on screen while awaiting the fate of Prozac Nation. It's a terrible waste of a very talented young actress. Really bad misteps that could have been funny are the weirdness that is Scott Baio and Craig Kilborn here. FX are not even that good. Portia DiRossi is kind of a hoot in her tiny role - but just because its so weird. Maybe if they had cut a half hour or so, they could have had something a little better, because this fees like it runs on and on. Take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a bit scary","review":"Cursed is not even slightly scary. This movie is about 2 siblings that are looking for the werewolf that bit them. The movie is full of CGIs that look like the came straight out of Scooby Doo (the movie). It's just bad, not even a bit entertaining. This is not the kind of movie I expect from Wes Craven. Scooby Doo was scarier than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Ricci At Her Best","review":"Everything About This Movie Is Just...DAMN GOOD!Not Only Is It Scary Or Creepy But:Christina Ricci Looks Adorble In ItYou See A Guys Nude Ass (Nice Change From Seeing Girls In Scary Movies)A Guy Turns Out To Be Gay In The Movie (Bo)And Christina Doesnt Die..(YIPIE)So I Love It She Is Great Im nOt A Big Fan Of The Rated Version But Enough Blood And Of Course They \\"EDITED\\" The Action Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"This horror movie breaks a lot of rules and really ends up being a comedy which is as fun to watch as the old \\"Nightmare on Elm St\\" movies.

I wasn't expecting that at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Wes Craven's fault (it's Harvey's)","review":"This film was taken from Wes Craven by the Weinsten brothers at Mirimax. Harvey has a long history of chopping up films because he doesn't like them or they don't test well . It was reshot and severely edited by Harvey and bares little resemblence to the film Wes shot. Let's hope now that Mirimax is out of the Weinstein brothers control, all the directors who had their films ruined can go back and have a proper DVD made of them (It's no coincidence that Mirimax, while the Weinsten's were there, never released any director's cuts of their films. Heaven forbid that any directors get to edit their own films)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good movie but not a good scary movie","review":"If you have nothing to do and you need something to watch then this is the movie to turn on but if you need a movie for you and your friends to watch on Halloween or just to get a good scream or two then don't even bother with this. The story is very common you know a werewolf is running around and killing people but in this the mystery is who is the werewolf. They actually do a great job of hiding who the killer is. The special effects are good the acting is well done but the movie just isn't scary at all. There are a few scenes that give you a jump but that's it. So do yourself a favor and watch it on cable leave the DVD alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!!","review":"This movie was ridiculously horrible. I was shocked that Christina Ricci would choose such a bad movie to act in. The dialogue was attrocious and unbelievable, the story was painfully unoriginal and extremely predictable (I guarantee you can guess what's going to happen next... every time) and the acting was horrible.I would give it 0 stars if I could however, it was so bad that at times it made me laugh, so maybe it does deserve one star.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IT IS CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy the Werewolf","review":"This movie had some moments that worked really well, but most of it feels like Teen-Wolf-meets-Wednesday (from the Addams' family, not the day of the week)/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer. The potential was there, but the story falls flat on its face - very predictable and too \\"Buffy.\\" I was also disappointed with Christina Ricci's performance. Christina, Christina, Christina - whining does not equate acting. I'm beginning to think she has more an act than accomplishing any acting, which is a shame since I do believe she has talent, and certainly doesn't need to be following in the footsteps of Sarah Michelle Gellar.An OK movie that will have you jumping with fright out of your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Werewolf movie that could have been better but","review":"then again what did you expect with the 50th or Werewolfmovie ever made? Originality? A plot? Twists?Comeon people you've seen it all so stop complaining as ifyou could have done a better movie or that this moviewasn't any different. Of course it wasn't just likemany Vampire/Mummy movies.It was great though in terms of the acting by ChristinaRicci, and others. Special effects were a mix bag, somelonger and more in depth transformations would have beengreat, but for what we get, it's good.The spooks and thrills were there, I give Wes and the writerscredit for at least giving some good thrills here. It's nota total flop, nor is it a total winner. However if you're lookingfor a movie to waste away time with and see some ok Werewolfgore, and effects, \\"Cursed\\" is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! BAD!","review":"I don't know what Wes Craven was thinking when he took the helm of this horrible movie. Basically, in this movie you find two siblings(a brother and sister) who lost their parents and the older sister tries as hard as she could to take care of her younger brother. When suddenly they chance upon a werewolf who is in the process of killing a person and they happen to get scratched. For the next 50 to 60 minutes we find that these siblings trying to gain back their humanity. WHile in the process trying to figure out who the werewolf strain goes back to. And who are the ones to trust.However, in reality this movie is horribly edited, acted, and almost to campy to be called a horror film. It is more a movie that leaves you wanting to see an actual WereWolf film than not.If you want to watch a recently made, GREAT werewolf movie I suggest watching a little known film called GINGER SNAPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"Christina Ricci was soley what possessed me to see this movie.In short, even her presence was not enough to save this badly edited increasingly corny peice of crap. The movie started out fun, and had a few scares, but 20 minutes into it, it took a nose dive. This really needed to be rated R so that cool gore effects could've added SOMETHING to the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has Wes Craven DONE?!","review":"This movie tries SO hard to be scary, and a good thriller, but its just NOT - i mean dont get me wrong, it is a watchable movie, but its more of a dark comedy with gorey touches every once and a while, but other than that it failed as a horror movie! How could Wes Craven do this? After such hits such as: The scream trilogoy, the dracula movies, people under the stairs, this was just a complete let down. Since this in America, the land where movies are constantly butchered, I haven't seen the R rated version yet, so I'm hoping that that version will be a LITTLE better than this PG-13 version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible...warewolf movies are NOT cool anymore.","review":"Ok...anyone who liked this movie is clearly under the age of 13. This movie was NOT scary, NOT entertaining and had really stupid puns. Ms.Ricci cant act worth a dime, and the kid that plays her bro in the movie, I have never seen act anywhere else but he acts a lot better than her. Too bad it was for such a stupid movie. I cant stress enough how bad this movie sucked. IT WAS HORRIBLE. Not even worth renting. But they got my $8.50. I was a sucker :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Two things stopped this from being a 4 star","review":"I bought the PG-13 version before I saw the R rared version. Bad Move.MISTAKE 1: Buying Cursed as pg-13. The R Version editing is far superior than the PG-13. The special effects is 5 fold. Don't get PG-13 - big , big, mistake. If your craven for a Craven this R version is a must.Mistake 2: Christina Ricci. I'd rather have a can of Tomato Juice than her in this movie. It seemed everyone was enjoying the script except for Christina Ricci.Summary: Buy the R Version and mentally substitute Christina Ricci for a can of Tomato Juice. You'll see a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal howler lacks bite","review":"Largely formulaic film which features OK as well as sub-standard SFX, (though Rick Baker involvement). Apparently film maker Wes Craven wasn't pleased with this outing either, but that is another story. Nothing new here, though some OK scenes and decent camera work occasionally shine, (such as the opening scenes). Overall I found it rather boring and not scary. Though not a total loss, this was largely an example of missed opportunities, further marred by a couple of lame sub-plots aimed at the young-uns. While this is no AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON or THE HOWLING, I would still recommend it for rabid Werewolf film fans. You certainly could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch it....you will waste your time","review":"This movie is a prime example of what is wrong with most of the horror movies being made today. Take a bunch of 'pretty' young actors/actresses,a weak script,bad acting,even weaker special effects,some gore and you have the makings of a really bad film.This one is no different from the vast load of 'teen' movies that studios are trying to pass off as horror films these days.This is why I mostly only watch horror movies that were made before 1980. When are directors and movie studios going to realise that not every horror fan is an angst filled teen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welp glad i rented","review":"I thought the movie was pretty good up until the end. they took what could have been a very well made/well acted werewolf movie and made it JUNK!! the ending is so freakin dumb.

It had some great points, a different twist on the classic werewolf movie, and other great points.

Suddenly they go from geeky to cool... With some unexpected side effects: craving for blood, unsightly body hair and the curse of lycanthropia.Cursed was a strange film. It tried hard to be a 'hip teenage horror film,' but failed. Then it tried to be a romance. But that also failed. Because of its PG-13 rating it was neither horrific or... very good.

Not only was it fake as heck it was just not scary and the plot was lacking in order to try and scare you. It is by far one of the worst scary movies I have seen. It ranks up there with Boogeyman, just not worth the time you waste watching it or the money you waste renting or going to the movies. I like the actors in the movies but not the acting. And they hype up characters to make you think it is them but then the characters just seem to disappear in the first half of the movie so it is extremely easy to guess who the real werewolves are.

I did enjoy the werewolves walking on their hind legs and bouncing across cars in the parking garage scene, and the scene where Christina Ricci draws out the werewolf towards the end with insults (and ends up getting the finger for her trouble) was amusing, but overall this is formulaic and bland and not really worth anyone's time.

The acting is terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the storyline is largely uncompelling. The werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience. This movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is \\"cool\\", but if you're looking for a scary movie, don't look for \\"Cursed\\".

As for the actual singing part, well, pressing buttons on the controller JUST the right way will help you stay in tune with the musical notes you hear. This isn't any fun, though.

For the rest of us, this is a waste of money and time. Wow, you get to choose the costumes and the hairstyles! That is hardly what I call gameplay. As for the gameplay itself --- if you know the difference between a triangle, circle, etc. then you are 90% percent of the way there. Again, your preschool tots might find this a little daunting, but they will be the only ones.

The boorish baboon pretty much bested Hopperrooo on every occasion--even though I am the much finer singer and overall superior talent.

I have a few friends who invite me to monthly viewings of their favourite \\"indie\\" movies, most of which I find tediously pretentious, and this was last month's DVD. Much to my surprise, I found myself laughing uncontrollably at some of the one-liners and situations in this one. \\"Ask her if she likes bologna.\\" And the runnung gag about \\"Cat-itude.\\" I ultimately decided this is a secret parody of the \\"art movie.\\" The quirky behaviour and dialogue of the characters just reek of \\"indie,\\" and the ending is thisclose to being Hallmark-ish, but it's also too well made to fall into the \\"so bad it's good\\" camp.

Even more when they suggest that it will be about meaningfulness... This is the kind of movie that comes from someone that when to school for to long and got cut up in the Art theory without any connection to anything touching or moving. To top it off, what a shame, to involve many children in it and give them very low script to say. For example, pooh in my but and I'll pooh in yours and then I'll pooh it back in yours, always the same pooh forever. Wow, and all the other children involve will show this movie to there friends.I really don't suggest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts on me and you, etc.","review":"This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen!!!!!

Nothing makes this movie unique to other better told narratives except for the fact that the characters are boring and the jokes only mildly amusing. The movie lacks a coherent message instead hiding behind the fact that is a more abstract piece of work.There is one scene that makes the movie worth seeing and redeemable however in which the two children have an online conversation with an older cyber sexer. This was one of the funnier scenes I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"See this film","review":"This was one of those films that I knew I'd have to sleep on before I'd be able form some kind of thoughtful opinion. While it has all the earmarks of so many 'indie' films, it nonetheless succeeds in prompting thought and feeling that is, for me, not contrived. Sure, it would be easy to disect the film so its parts would seem disparate, but the viewer is better served taking it as a whole. The characters are a bit more filmic than everyday, but that's no crime in my book. Instead, I found myself wanting to know more about them and wondering what may happen to each. I'll leave the plot and character description to others and just say that in an era where movies like King Kong and MI3 dominate the box office, it's a pleasure to find a film tells a simple story well."},{"rating":"1","title":"miserable people with miserable lives","review":"Others have found this movie intriguing if melancholy. I found it totally miserable as well as exploitative. It has that \\"indie\\" feel about it with characters that are supposed to be \\"quirky\\" and a little off-center. In this case, they are so far off center as to be dangerously deranged. The \\"hero\\" celebrates his divorce by setting his own hand on fire. Nice! His neglected kids, one a young teen and the other barely out of kindergarten, get involved in sex chat rooms with deviant adults. The \\"heroine\\" is supposed to be a talented performance artist but when we get to see her art, it turns out to be garbage. She falls for the hero for no apparent reason. He brushes her off; she persists and they end the movie clasped in an embrace that looked to me like the grip of a python around its prey."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I watched this film because it earned awards at five film festivals, including Cannes and Sundance, but save your time and money--it's horrible. The dialogue is dreadful, the plot unbelievable, the multiple sub-plots distracting, and the teenage sex ridiculous if not perverse. So, the experts are wrong, including Roger Ebert who gave this film 4 of 4 stars. Richard is separating from his wife Pam and works at a shoe store. He meets Christine, a starving artist who drives a taxi for the elderly, as if we should care. I guess the film revolves around the single line of a senior citizen to the effect, \\"Your whole life could be better, starting right now.\\" Yes, especially if you avoid this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It actually deserves no stars, one is being generous...","review":"Wanting to catch up on my pile of new DVDs, I sat down this evening to watch \\"Peacock\\" and \\"Me and you and everyone we know\\". While I loved the first (Cillian Murphy is just brilliant) this one left a lot to be desired. Im about as liberal and open minded as they come but the scenes with the 5 year old sex chatting and the two teenage girls/adult man really put me off the whole film. I cant understand for the life of me why it has received so many rave reviews!! To be completely honest, I disliked it so much that Im actually fighting the urge to go to the backyard right now and throwing it in the flaming barbecue."},{"rating":"2","title":"We can leave Park City standing... for now","review":"This flick is one of the reasons we shouldn't burn Park City to the ground, assassinate the organizers of Sundance, and completely scrap the phrase \\"independent film.\\" This is old-school independent: a character-based flick full of awkward yet warmly human situations, heading into territory studios would never touch (instead of aping their style on the cheap) and expressing a unique vision. This is a somewhat wordy way of saying this is easily the best movie of the year, but that doesn't mean you'll be the one to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"The movie was simply wonderful and I reccommend that you go and see it, I saw it 3 times; and then came to the conclusion at the rate I was paying to see the movie I could just wait and purchase the movie and watch it all the time.It was a pefectly told story of how some random people were all interconnected.And I suggest checking out the score for this movie, simply wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours I'm never getting back","review":"I completely agree with prior comments regarding, most importantly, child abuse, and also pretension. It was only after ten minutes of watching this that I realized I had seen it once before, and that's because nothing actually happens.I'd like to add another dimension to previous comments; Miranda July, like many feminists, clearly hates women. The female characters in this film are universally pathetic victims, further the two women with the greatest power in the film (the elderly women who anticipates her own death, and the divorcee) are treated with hostility by Ms. July.Clearly if you're not as dopey as Miranda July, you just don't seem to get the reality of it all. And, surely this film will become the primary citation for the lunacy of deferring to film festivals for insight into film quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWK!","review":"If you like indie film garbage writing, psychotic women, & let's face it, a trend towards child pornography... then this is your film!

Watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another film school project?","review":"While I have nothing against indie films (and normally actively seek them out), this is one of the genre that makes it hard for other indie films to reach a wider audience. It tries *really* hard to make its point, and all of the principal actors (at least the adults) seem like stereotypical, overly-motivated theater majors who are dying to see how emotional they can make their performances.I found it overall flat and overwrought, while my wife was so disturbed by some of the imagery (particularly the adolescent/child sex theme) that she didn't watch the whole thing. If you think this might be your cup of tea, I would definitely recommend a rental before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won awards?","review":"ughhhhh... First off, the plot is nothing new, pathetic people living despearte lives in shabby apartments working, dead end jobs etc. This one takes it to a new level with children soliciting for sex in chat rooms.

Surely the dialogue and actions the childern were directed to say/perform violate more than just the bottom level of taste they occupy.Is there a joke somewhere that i'm not in on?

Quite to the contrary, the book swept aside my reservations from the moment I opened it. I was drawn into the lives of Kaplan's incredibly engaging characters and the wonderfully tense situations he creates for them. I found myself compelled to recount every scene to my girlfriend who also hung on every word.

In between the line, the author is introducing his non-muslim movement Qadiani instead of introducing a study of the Quran. This is because the author himself strictly speaking is not a muslim and belonged to a neo-colonial religious movement known as Qadiani which has since the gaining of independence by the Indian sub-continent has been exposed as a non-muslim movement.

I have only done tea so far, both hot and cold, and it works great. I find that the \\"cowboy style\\" works better since you can drink without removing the H2JO! from your waterbottle.I have no issues with leaking or the lid coming loose like other mentioned.

It works great with my Klean Kanteen wide mouth - coffee, tea, etc while on the move. I should probably buy another one.Update:I still can't believe how well this works for making cowboy coffee on the road.

Excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I was pretty leery about buying this after reading about all the troubles other users have had with the threads. I'm glad I did! It fits my SS DukJug and my SS Guyot Standard bottles perfectly. It takes up virtually no room in my bag (when you're not making coffee you can leave it installed on your water bottle) and with my backpacking stove, I can make fresh gourmet coffee anytime, anywhere when I'm out in the field (army training). Anybody that has ever had genuine US Army Field Coffee can surely understand that this is worth its weight in gold ;) Pretty handy when I go camping too."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised","review":"Bought this months ago, and now that I've used it on a few camping trips I love it. I bought a Nalgene wide mouth bottle to go with it, and it's now the dedicated coffee bottle since the plastic retains the coffee flavor and anything you put in the bottle after tastes like coffee. You could probably get the taste out by cleaning the bottle with boiling water, but I've never bothered.No matter which method you use (the packaging explains 2 ways to use it) you WILL get some grounds in your coffee...If you're the type who camps and uses simple methods like this it probably won't bother you, I don't mind. The directions specify \\"coarse ground\\" coffee which I cannot find pre-ground, so I go to the supermarket that has a coffee grinder.All in all it has lived up to expectations and works as advertised.If no grounds ended up in the coffee I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits on the insulated Klean Kanteen models.","review":"I like fresh brewed coffee so I fill my Klean Kanteen with hot water and then hours later I open it, drop in the GSI H2JO with coffee grounds and let it sit for 2 minutes, give it a little stir and bam, fresh brewed coffee! The H2JO screws snuggly on the Klean Kanteen and the Klean Kanteen lid fits on top of the GSI H2JO. I would say by no means is it drip-proof or a tight seal so that's why I carry them separate and fit them together when I'm ready for coffee. A Klean Kanteen insulated travel cup and this GSI H2JO would make a perfect gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant and instructive","review":"As both a heady intellectual and a pragmatic field organizer, I have throughly enjoyed this book.

Disc 1 contains three future popular Santana charts in Jingo, Persuasion, and La Puesta De Sol-aka Fried Neckbones. Disc 2 is titled Santana Jam, and that's pretty much all you have to say about it.

Sylvester has proven his ability to write compelling human drama that doesn't rely upon simple chills and thrills to make you turn the page. Sylvester's writing style is direct, vivid and action-oriented. It was exciting and a delight to read this book. I read it in two nights. Couldn't put it down. The settings are described in enough detail to bring them alive, but without excess like many books I've struggled through and the characters are strong, especially the hero, Randy, and the main villian; but even some of the minor characters create a real impact. Randy is a talented and smart individual whose love for his son and wanting to save him from harm takes him half way across the world into some tense, dramatic situations. Ghauri's Sword is a great modern adventure story, full of excitement, romance, intrigue, and fun. I highly recommend this book.

Her command of language and plot is enthralling in this breakneck paced tale of a young woman, recovering from a long bout with alcohol and drugs, working in a peep show in Times Square and supporting an abusive boyfriend. The story has an undeniable ring of truth, and Reed keeps you rushing from chapter to chapter to find out what will happen next in the lives of her indefatigable heroine, Tiffany, and her friends, family and co-workers as she emerges from years of abuse and wrong thinking and learns to show out in more ways than one. The peep show milieu is fascinating and presented without judgment, quite a feat, and my jaw dropped at the end of the final chapter. Timothy Reed is an astonishing new voice and I cannot wait to read what she has in store for us next."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 great songs, short video clips from performance","review":"Three great songs clocking in at 15 minutes.

Hobson was a student of the Russian language studying at a local university. She describes life in the student hostel she lived in, along with all the interactions with other foreigners and Russian students. She said very little about the university. This book details all the interactions with other Russian students, and life in the USSR during this transition. After the New Year came, she experienced life in the Russian Federation. Society's mores certainly changed during this time.This book shows a personal experience of a society changing from Communist to Capitalist. It is interesting in how Soviet mores changed drastically during this time. The book had a good flow to it and reads easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource!","review":"This is an excellent text for an introduction to the application of evolutionary ecology's theory and methods to human behavior as well as containing information for those acquainted with the subject.

So I purchased 3 sunscreens from Amazon. Burnout Ocean, Burnout SPF 30 for Kids and Aubrey Organics. The only one that is worth keeping is the Burnout SPF 30 for kids.Aubrey Organics was a bit watery.... as expected and very thin in terms of consistency, which means i had to use a lot and lot of it to get a \\"full\\" coverage. The things is once applied, you can't see if it's there or not. Meaning if you go for a swim or after a couple of hours, you can't tell if the sunscreen is still there or if you need to re-apply.That was OK with me, what turned me off was the smell. It smelled like old oil paint. I just couldn't stand it. If unscented means smells like cooking oil, i rather get the scented one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scent is overpowering","review":"I have never been sensitive or allergic to smells, but the scent of this moisturizer is so strong and overpowering that I had to wash it off because it was making me feel slightly nauseous. I wish I had listened to some reviewers from other websites who warned that Aubrey Organics products can have a very powerful scent. Now I must admit that they were right. I also bought Aubrey Organics hairspray and deodorant, and they also smell very strong. If you are sensitive to scents (or not accustomed to unusually powerful scents), you should probably think twice before buying products from this company.I am also somewhat ambivalent about this product containing Padimate O as the active sunscreen ingredient. There is some controversy about the safety of Padimate O and other PABA derivatives. Unfortunately, I happened to read about it after I purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moistuizer - Denatured Alchol the problem?","review":"The 4th and 5th ingredients are alcohols and this is probably what makes the blue green algae moisturizer smell horrid.

However, aloe vera is one of many ingredients in this product. I want to know what % of this product is pure aloe vera? Is it 1% or half of 1%?

Unless you get this question answered, stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant smell & too watery","review":"I bought this product expecting it to have a more gel like consistency but it ended up being too watery. It is almost like a toner. Plus, it had a weird smell to it and I couldn't stand it unless I put a separate cream on top of it to cover up the smell.

I ended up w/ 2 bottles of this product and used it right away for a beach day. I put it on myself and my 6 year old daughter. It was thick, it has a weird smell that I can't place (possibly the zinc) and it was so tacky/sticky that my 6 year old complained so loudly that I was hurting her as I rubbed it on her. My arms looked like I was wearing a clay mask at first and it took a lot to rub in - gave myself an arm waxing while I was at it.

This sunscreen meets the criteria for safety (according to the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database), and is unscented. The problem I have with it is that it is quite oily and causes my face to sweat. Once I'm out in the sun, I feel like I've been basted. The instructions say to reapply after perspiring, which would mean (in my case, anyway) reapplying almost continuously. This really negates any benefits from the sunscreen!

I was going to take it on two-week trip, where the eight of us could save all of our pictures, and review them in the hotel during the trip, and burn a DVD for all at the end, but after discovering the following deficiencies, I threw it in a drawer instead: (1) power brick and cables were almost as large and as heavy as the unit itself, (2) the unit took 5-7 seconds just to display the next picture - making quick review very frustrating, and (3) the video cable for displaying on a TV did not work, or just barely worked if one jiggled it and held it out 1/16th of an inch and applied pressure - either a defective or poorly designed cable/plug.

I never thought that I would encounter another book as depressing as Children of the River, yet Rice Without Rain certainly was the one. The story was about Jinda Boonreung, a village thai girl, who goes through many struggles to free her father. She also seeks love and happiness from a city boy in Bangkok, Ned. Though they met and fell in love, they couldn't be together. What a ironic twist, huh!? To find out more about this ironic love story and what happened at the end, I'll recommend that you'll need to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking the emotional chord in all of us","review":"\\"Rice without Rain\\" was a very down-to-earth and practical story.It discussed the key issues of poverty and unfairness towards farming communities.I was very emotionally touched by the life that Jinda went through as a result of all the revolutions and mental torture. She showed me that she was a strong character still very much in touch with her roots and that she treasured simple things in nature that city-dwellers like myself have come to take for granted---like rain.Indeed, in the last part of the story, as Jinda remembered all of the past, one could see that a new life was in the making.The rain was like healing water soothing the wounds of the land, curing all the suffering in the land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the BEST","review":"i read this book when I was 12 and after a decade, it is still etched into my mind as one of the best books I have ever read.

Come these people are wandering the streets right after the attack not to mention still driving cars, listening to the radio although EMP would trash all of them unless they are hardened. Then the main character takes her kids outside for a picnic and nobody seems to be concerned with fallout. If you want to watch a realistic movie then you need to see Threads, By Dawn's Early Light or The Day After and don't bother with this one. Most importantly don't believe for a minute that this couldn't happen to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, because it could happen","review":"Of all the end of the world / nucular attack movies, this one is by far the best. Jane Alexander gives the best performance I have ever seen in my life. Showing her running through the house like a maniac, looking for her son's teddy bear. So she can bury him with it. Unlike other pictures, there is no buildings or cities blowing up, just people. This picture summed it all up. Nucuelar war is not about cities being destroyed. It is about the death of our children."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a feelgood movie but a must see","review":"If there ever was a more powerful movie than this I have yet to see it. I have seen this movie several times since it's release in 1983 and the effect has always been the same. You go to bed and it replays in your head then you wake up and it dominates your entire following day. With performances so powerful from Jane Alexander and others that you will never forget. Also this movie makes use of scenes with children asking their innocent questions as they do that will tear your heart apart as they are among the first to succumb to the radiation sickness. So if you want to see a film that will be hard to shake from your memory for weeks but will not leave you feeling particularly happy this is the ticket. I personally think it should be required viewing in all schools across America to remind our young that there are some things much more important than the latest Britney and N' Sync releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio not quite up to par","review":"This is an excellent movie. The video portion is quite good, however the audio was a little less than expected.

This is a staightforward story moving story with no gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over Rated by Amazon Reviewers","review":"I bought this DVD based on all the positive reviews, and boy was I disappointed! The story goes nowhere, the kids are whiney brats, and believe me, you'll be GLAD the Dad is only in the first few minutes of the movie. Yes, the mother character is well acted by Jane Alexander, but the dialogue is lame, the plot is dead, the scenes are choppy, the events are predictable, the townspeople are annoying, and there's a lot of crying. A lot. I'd give it one star just to drop this over-inflated 4 1/2 star rating, but thought 2 stars was more honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one.","review":"Beware, Beware, Beware. This is a warmed over lifetime movie about a family dealing with death. If you are expecting a \\"dangers of nuclear war\\" movie like On The Beach, The Day After, Fail Safe or the like, I would suggerst staying away from this one. It is not a thriller, the characters are very poorly developed and there is no clear story. I hoped that at some point a stray bomb may fall into the main characters city. It might have helped to give some explanation of what was going on. No special effects at all. Bright light means nuclear bomb.

The whole dumb blond thing is NOT romantic. There was nothing even happy about this story. The first part is the beginning of what sounds like the dumbest coupling in the world. The next part is written like we're watching some stupid teenage drama where the characters think back and cry and deny and act so immature. Once again, we're brought to a part that's more like a movie of two past lovers who broke things off but now see each other again and want to be with each other but don't want to appear vulnerable and \\"weak\\" if the other doesn't feel the same way. Really, these two were like middle-schoolers. She was so air-headed, and we don't even know enough about his past to decide if his attitude was understood or not, so he comes off as an arrogant, shallow jerk. And the sex scenes?

It didn't generate enough cold to keep the dough from softening at it's normal rate on my non-cooled rolling surface. I also had a problem with sticking unless I were to add a significant amount of flour which would have made the dough tough.

At the risk of being labelled a braying pc-er, let me ask you to THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP into bed with Rushton's perception of human variation. His logic is, in brief...1. Human groups differ in some traits (e.g. crime & sex), 2. Human groups differ in some genes (e.g. those affecting skin color), therefore , 1 is because of 2. This logic is neither \\"obvious\\" nor \\"brave\\" nor \\"anti-pc\\"...it's just flawed at the core. Rushton's been rejected by most evolutionary ecologists not because he is a seeker of hard truths that shatter pc illusions, but because he uses blizzards of often irrelevant numbers and paper thin or incorrect logic to make arguments that automatically resonate with many folks regardless of their knowledge of the science involved(see other reviews here).

Just when you think all is lost he discovers buffalo ranching, and the beauty and organic nature of that enterprise is enhanced by all the failed efforts at cattle ranching that preceded it. While I'm excited about buying some of Dan's all-natural bison meat, the book is far more than a lengthy advertisement or even any kind of polemic against conventional beef raising on the plains.

But the musical score is almost unbelievably poor (Leonard Maltin's capsule review refers to the songs as \\"icky\\"), the character designs pale in comparison with the nifty pen-and-inks Jules Feiffer drew for Juster's book, and Jones's Milo runs his hand through his forelock so often you want to break his wrist. Worth seeing, for Juster's admirers and Chuck Jones fanatics. But only once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disloyal to the text - a real disappointment","review":"I'd read the book to my daughter before getting the video, and I looked forward to a true rendering of the book. What we saw was a travesty - the filmmakers took tremendous liberties with the spirit of the text and I felt that we were seeing a completely different story - and it wasn't one bit interesting. It took forever for the plot to begin; the filmmakers seemed to be having more fun showing off the \\"gimmick\\" of moving between real images and animation, but it got to be obnoxious and wasteful - where's the story? Stick with the book... maybe someone will come up with a better film version. (For the record, I'm not against all filmed versions of book: I love the films of Charlotte's Web, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory - renamed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for film - and the Harry Potter films.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"movie is not book","review":"Io bought this mvie hopping it would be a good education tool. It was not. It does not follow the book and kids notice these kinds of things. If it is based on the book it should say so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound is spotty","review":"Ever since I saw this movie nearly 2 decades ago, I've been wanting it. I was so excited to finally find it on dvd! I was happy with it, but I just wish it had better sound quailty. For instance, most shows or movies are played with the volume at a level 7 or 9 at most. I had to turn it up to 15 to hear it. And towards the end of the movie, the sound sort of wobbled up and down several octaves. But, overall it's totally worth it for a hard to find classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom Tollbooth dvd ripped","review":"Was very disappointed that this \\"DVD\\" was a copied DVD and not the official release of the movie. Thankfully I was at least able to watch it, but still I don't want this and wouldn't recommend this purchase to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck had lost his fastball by then","review":"I agree with some others here: The book is so good that this cheapo adaptation can't compare. And yes, the songs are dreadful. I have to dock it an extra star (down from 3) because the source material should have yielded a better film. But I really do think Chuck Jones was just mailing it in by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"A valuable lesson","review":"I read the Phantom Tollbooth as a 4th grader, soon after it came out, and it was my favorite book. When the movie came out I rushed to see it, and it was the first time I\\"d seen a movie that had been made from a book I\\"d read. I was bitterly disappointed. The movie is a failed adaptation of the book. It taught me a valuable lesson- reading a book is always better than watching a movie.Fast forward 30 years and this book is now my son's favorite. He's dying to see the movie, and will learn the same lesson- movies can never come close to creating the world that books allow us to enter."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible","review":"\\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. So I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely dashed. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's \\"Pogo\\" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, imaginative adventure that kids and adults will enjoy","review":"This is the story of a little boy who is bored and completely unstimulated. He is what would be termed a veggie. This all changes when a toll booth comes in to take him on a wonderful adventure. In his journeys he gets to rack his brains with logical, scientifical and other riddles and just have silly fun. All throughout his journey he learns new things and learns things about stuff he already knew. This is really enjoyable and helps to stretch you brain a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie!","review":"All my kids have loved reading the modern classic by Norton Juster, The Phantom Tollbooth, just as I did when I was a kid. So I was delighted to find this animated version, which was a treat for our entire family.Some of the animation, and especially the live action, seemed pretty dated -- but that was part of the fun! Really, it seems quite imaginative for its time, and I'm glad we still get to enjoy this entertaining blast from the past.If your family is totally jaded by cutting edge technology, it's probably not your best choice, but I'm happy to have it in our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 8 Year Old Loved It","review":"We watched this together, and while many of the elements of this timeless classic may have gone over her head, there is a lot to be learned from this entertaining and educational movie. The DVD remaster is crisp and clear, and the movie does a great job of taking a fantastic book and perhaps even enhancing the \\"wisdom\\" elements a bit for the younger viewer/reader. If you have a young man or woman in your house, and want to have a positive and entertaining way of teaching a good life lesson or two about complacency, cooperation, time management and determination, have them sit down and watch this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom Tollbooth DVD","review":"Our Nephew is playing the lead, Milo in this DVD at a local theatre group. So we wanted to see the show to get an idea of the lead part. The DVD was perfect and we very much enjoyed it even though it is a DVD for a younger aged group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous for all ages and abilities...","review":"This is one of the most educational and entertaining films of all times. Although some of the concepts may be above young childrens' ability to understand, all will love this wonderful adaptation of Norton Juster's fun filled book. From Milo's trip through the Doldrums with his faithful pal Tock the watch-dog, to the magical kingdoms of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, this tale is full of magic and learning for kids and adults. I think all will benefit from the different points of view offered in this lively tale. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like I remembered","review":"I remember watching this as a kid, so after reading the book (which is great!) to our kids, we bought the video.

The research methods are slapdash and often rather dodgy (at one point the author flatly states that a certain poem was sent to Samuel Bowles, merely because in the transcript made after Dickinson's death the poem was headed with his name, even though there's no such heading on the manuscript form written by Emily) - and the portrait drawn of the poet is rather pallid and ordinary. Sympathetic, but quite simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks, comfort, and convenience","review":"These loafers are very versatile, with simple, clean lines that go with a business suit or denim equally well. They are very comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and very durable. The understated rubber sole overlay on the sides keeps scuffing to a minimum. It took about a week for the insole to form itself to the sole of my foot, but now it's like it was custom molded for me. Doesn't move or slip, but not constricting either. I love the driver-type backsole at the heel that protects it from scuffing while driving. Highly recommended. Be careful when choosing sizes--I wound up a full size smaller than normal with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAR release","review":"Let me start by saying this music is great. The Samples are one of the best and most original bands out there. This cd has a lot of good music. Why the 1 star? The musicians who make up the Samples do not get any of the royalties from any of these songs or for this album. The WAR (What Are Records) label owns the rights on the Samples work from 1989 to 1994 (this should explain Heathcliff's complaint about a lack of songs after 1994).The current incarnation of the band has put out better compilations of their work in Landing on the Sidewalk, Sparta, and Anthology. Go out and buy some of the original more recent Samples including Here and Somewhere Else, and Return to Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culmination","review":"The Samples took the best of 80's music and made it their own. In fact, their music is the culmination of global art finding a comfortable nexus on humanity's terms. They were the sum of manufactured genres and a testament to something beyond that status quo. They took soul, reggae, folk, rock, bluegrass, etc., wrapped it up, and went after it! During the 20th century, media brought the world together in a way person-kind had never known. The Samples helped solidify that reality. This music moves beyond the arbitrary classifications that human beings find pleasure in. In fact, this band was a manifestation of the beautiful things than can happen when humans see past difference. Music can, in an era of ringtones hits, still mean that much. It's up to us to place it in a broader context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand.","review":"I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it.

I have one in the smooth face and one in the waffle/milled face. It is made in the USA and is durable. I only use it for building stuff though, never for demolition work. Estwing solid steel hammers are more durable for that. They are not nearly as comfortable for all day hammering work though.The hickory is nice for sliding into a hammer loop and doesn't slip when I'm sweaty. I stripped the varnish off of mine and tung oiled it. This still lets it absorb sweat to prevent it from getting slippery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best turn-based strategy game I've ever played","review":"For people who are enthusiastic turn-based strategy gamers, and who love Civil War games, this is one of the best investments you'll ever make. The game is very low on graphics but high on playability and allows you to fight the entire war, and the course of the war is determined by how well you do in battle, what weapons you purchase for your men, how badly you defeat the enemy, whether you capture any of their generals, etc. Great game and definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple strategy","review":"Good game, easy to understand but challenging to win.

Perhaps for $25-30, it might be worthwhile, albeit flawed, but for $50, definitely not. The illustrations are few, and not well reproduced, the maps are actually too numerous, yet a mix of good, and amateurish, and there is a distinct lack of personal accounts. It is a dry recounting of the eventual failure of virtually all of these poorly trained, and I surmise, poorly motivated combat formations. I applaud the author's intent, but not his results.

I can't bear to pick it up again.It starts out fairly interesting, with lots of quirky characters and intriguing plot lines. That's for the first 300 pages. That, in my opinion, could have been the whole book. However, it continues for over 400 more pages, with the same people, getting more and more complicated with each turn of the page. To be honest, I simply got lost. I couldn't remember who dated whom, who hated whom, and who...Oh, forget it.Now, I read books, I read lots of books...And I got lost. I gave up, around page 450. But, I tend to read books that have a few base characters whose lives are built upon chapter by chapter. This book does that, tenfold. If you think you can keep up and stay interested, go for it. It IS well written and interesting, it just seemed like I'd have to start taking notes as I read. No, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't read past page 725","review":"I picked up this book since it was discounted and by William Goldman (Princess Bride being a favorite book and movie), so it was on a whim... I thought it looked interesting with lots of dialogue between characters - which is a style that I usually like. Until I started reading it and realized that this book was ONLY dialogue and that was used as much as a crutch than to tell a real story. All the characters are grating and annoying and the dialogue is contrived. So when I finally got to page 725 of page 751 I just stopped the insanity and decided to quit then and there since the extra 20 minutes seemed better spent elsewhere than reading about these characters. There is better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"an eye opener","review":"Boys and Girls Together is my favorite book.

The sound engineer Dallas Simpson used a custom designed in-ear microphone to create a 3 dimension surround sound in real time. This CD is suppose to sound at its best using headphones. The music is rather free flowing with mystical Celtic overtones but something reminded me of a Mark Isham theme from the movie \\"Mrs. Soffel\\" staring Mel Gibson & Diane Keaton. Yes, its that Irish tin whistle sounding like blowing wind. The CD hasn't grabbed me yet, maybe because I can't find a special time of quiet listening these days, but the talent & engineering are unquestionable.

Also putting them down and picking them up takes just that much more time because you have grip them just so to actually use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely tea","review":"Delicate aroma and flavor and a lovely tin.

BIG disappointment.","review":"I bought this CD in an effort to reduce my son's stress when doing schoolwork/homework. I was very happy to have found a cd that was *supposedly* relaxing with lovely harp music. What I got was a basic classical/easy listening cd. In one song I wasn't even able to hear harp music. The first song on the cd has a rather obnoxious beat to accompany it. If you've ever enjoyed listening to true harp music, and know the calming and soothing effect it has on nerves, this cd will be a huge disappointment. I can only assume that the other reviewers who listed 5 stars are not used to good quality harp music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what was pictured","review":"I ordered this because it shows Thomas as the train that comes with the video but I got a different train.

Ive used these techniques for haunted attractions as well as the short horror films I make. This book is a must have if you are interested in doing special fx makeup with your typical Halloween makeup supplies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Beginners","review":"I am a film student who needed to learn the basics of special effects makeup very quickly. This particular book did a great job of laying out some fundamentals of the makeup world. The book is organized into different effects, which if you only take at face value is limited. However, if you go through and read each effect that is being taught you will quickly realize that the book isn't a specific how-to for each effect, but rather an organized method to teach the fundamentals. For example, even if you don't need \\"monster hands\\", the chapter on making them is really just a great introduction into how to use latex on a medium scale.Overall, this is a great resource for the beginner who wants to being learning the fundamentals of special effects makeup. It will certainly get your gears spinning and allow you to start thinking of how you can apply the different techniques it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a dissapointment","review":"After reading a rave review of her live performance, and hearing that Sugar Pie is Natalie Merchant's favorite vocalist, I thought I'd give this disk a whirl. What I found was a voice past it's prime, and some spectacularly bad song selections - some clearly out of her range, others that would sound awful sung by choirs of angels, Ray Charles, Kiri Te Kanawa, or any other singer living or dead. HOWEVER, there is one absolutely essential cut on this outing, and that's \\"I wanna Know\\". This version is dead, dead, dead on. The woman who sings it is not just interested in knowing, she's entitled to, in a cool, firm, steely way. I'd almost buy more of Sugar Pie, in spite of the dissapointment of the other cuts, just to look for more of THAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antonio Aguilar Coleccion de Oro: Vol. III","review":"The product arrive at the specified date and in the conditions i was told it would be"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 for 2 - Not a high quality television","review":"When I set up the TV the remote didn't work and the indicator lights on the front of the TV didn't illuminate. So I exchanged it for a different one and the second TV is worse, because it loses the programmed channels once it's turned off. I don't have faith that a 3rd TV will work properly, so I plan to ask for a refund.There are other odd things that happened such as...We tuned the TV to a station, but only saw a blue screen. We decided to leave it on that channel and after 15 minutes the channel suddenly started working. When we turned the TV off and back on again, it was back to the blue screen.The one positive thing was that the picture (when the TV actually worked) was nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coby TV","review":"The Coby gives a very clear picture and has very good sound for it's price.From the other reviews about the screen turning blue, really isn't a problem.

High on a Hill depicts life where it began,the crusifiction of our Savior. At the other end of the spectrum Beyond the Pale gives and outstanding view of life after the first death where all is at peace and to quote the song \\"the lion lies down with the lamb.\\" The rest of the album hits various topics between the two.

In a departure from the \\"Kansas sound\\", Livgren explores new musical territory, while continuing to give voice to his Christian spirituality. If you're a fan of rock music artistry, you must get this album. It will definately reach out and touch your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different direction for Kerry Livgren","review":"The music on this album sounds nothing like Kansas, nor for that matter like Kerry Livgren's first solo album _Seeds of Change_. _Time Line_ is pure 80's rock a-la bands like Survivor and Night Ranger, with little of the progressive rock direction that Livgren brought to Kansas during the 70's. While some of the music here is pretty good, it isn't great; the symphonic element that made Kansas such a great band is gone. The lyrics here are also problematic. Unlike the Christian lyrics on _Seeds of Change_, which reflect mainstream Christianity and the excitement of a new convert in a positive, uplifting manner, the lyrics here are of a more negative, oppositional nature and veer into Christian Reconstructionist sentiments all too often, with jabs taken at the \\"secular\\" media and the New Age movement. The vocals on this album are performed by Warren Ham, who was the vocalist on the last two albums by the early 70's band Bloodrock."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it, I like it!","review":"Kerry Livgren has certainly proved that he is a talented writer as well as being a versatile musician. I have seen Kansas a few times and was always impressed by his quality of playing live. I was sorry to see him split from the band but he hasn't lost a single step. The writing is still quality and he has surrounded himself with top notch players. The only thing missing was Steve Walsh's vocal ability. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this to any music lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not scared of these spiders","review":"Synopsis:The noviization of the Speliberg film.

However I found it a bit boring. The photography is plain, rather a sequence of standard shoots of touristy spots. Very little human life, nothing of the real life of the people of the province. There is no spoken commentary, but only a local music soundtrack, which I found a bit repetitive. A little booklet in Chinese and English does provide additional information, but not really anything that you would not find on any guidebook that any tourist is going to buy. Video quality is average."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent, cheap costume","review":"The costume is a cheap one for sure.

I don't beleive you can buy a higher quality light/lamp assembly for the money. One reason for my 4 out of 5 star rating, I was a bit disappointed in the wire and insulation of the connection wires. Also, in the lamp intensity and projection distance of the light. Perhaps my disappointment in the lamp intensity was more likely a function of my unreasonable expectations. I would recommend these driving lights for anyone looking to enhance their current night driving needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong unit, performs well. Supplied wiring is okay","review":"Firstly, the wiring that came with this kit was okay. Was a little short for me and I was only running from my bumper to the firewall. That being said, It had everything I needed. In my mind, the switch they supply is worthless and the LED is too bright at night (almost blinding).The lights themselves are very strong and the metal is of high quality. Easy to assemble/disassemble for replacement and mounting. Rock guards are of a soft, but rigid plastic that holds up in extreme temperatures. No fading for scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHARMING CHRISTMAS TALE!!!","review":"Quite surprised with this obscure Russian Christmas/Fairy tale which features a witch and the devil causing mayhem during the holiday season. The witch captures stars from the night sky and the devil has it in for the local blacksmith who has painted a rather insulting image of the devil being made to look ludicrous by the church. In order to gain approval and win in hand the young maiden, the blacksmith must procure a pair of royal slippers/shoes to present to his beloved, who appears a bit standoff-ish if you ask me!All in all, a whimsical Christmas (in color) fairy tale for the entire family to enjoy...odd and enjoyable, strange yet familiar.

The cover at first glance seems nice , the weight seems good but the plastic is the thinnest I have ever seen on a grille cover. If it weren't for the felt backing a slight breeze would tear it apart. The plastic has torn a way from the seams at the threads. The only thing holding it together is the felt backing.

It seems to be made of vinyl, with a fuzzy interior liner. The vinyl is not very thick, and has several holes already. The interior liner is wearing away quickly, so whatever protection it may have afforded is diminishing rapidly. The seams have leaked water from the beginning. It doesn't stay on well in wind.

However, it didn't take long for the winds we have to wreak havoc on the cover. We keep our grill outside on our deck, on the leeward (eastern) side of our house, yet this cover simply did not last a year. By the end it was in tatters and torn in many places.

A \\"fairly large\\" one is 38 by 24 feet, complete with concrete foundation, plumbing, heating, electric lights, and 12 foot ceilings.If, like me, you are looking for ideas for a small backyard aviary for a few canaries, you should look elsewhere.

It was written before he became world famous for his musical talent but describesthe beginnings of his musical career as well.Chris describes one special memory of standing in the empty, quiet arena at Cheyenne Frontier Parkas a teenager dreaming of being able to ride in the Frontier Days Rodeo. I can just feel the emptinessof the big arena and hear the Wyoming wind whistling through it. When Chris performs in Cheyenne, it isalways very special to him.

Pulled back a couple of inches and had someone turn on the water. Waited a minute or so and turned off the water. Pushed the hose back to the clog- no luck. Tried this about 6 times- nothing.

Many of the issues in the young man's life weren't resolved, or resolved with only more anger, bitterness and malice, and the journalist's story is tragic.

I bought these to do work around the house, yard work, auto repair, etc. The kind of thing you don't want to wear your nice slacks for. Although I do use these for those applications, my favorite thing is to just wear them around the house, yard, etc. They are SOOOO COMFORTABLE!!! I may be another pair to actually use. ' :)That being said if you do use these as intended, they are great. I can put lots of tools, pencils, cell phone, etc. in all the pockets without bulking it up. My one concern is the fabric probably won't hold up to working on pavement or concrete very long, but I do use kneepads when I do that kind of work.All in all a very good purchase that I am quite happy with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickies men Bib overalls","review":"I wear overalls every day , these were the worst fiting ones i ever tryed way too long had to hem about 3 inches, and to me when you have to do that they never look right, also the legs are too wide they look like the old bell bottom pants,i think it not all the inseam its the body of the overalls thats made too long , i will not be buying anymore of these"},{"rating":"2","title":"i am to fat","review":"i loved them, very fast shipping....but I had to send back and get a refund because they were to small and you did not have a bigger size.....

I am 5-11 with 38 inch waist and wear 32 length at 181 lbs. I ordered the 40 x 32 to make sure I could wear a shirt and sweater underneath if needed for colder weather. These are lightweight and soft probably not for winter use here close to the Lake Erie winters, but should be fine for fall weather. Besides, if needed, there should be no problem fitting these over long johns. The length is just a little long but think 30 would be too short, but not sure. I just turrned up the bottoms which gave them a better look. The big reason for getting these is that they don't fall down, and can say I'm pleased with the product and glad I ordered two pairs. For working around the house and yard nothing works better and the rolled up bottoms keep the grass clippings from getting in my shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"Great for the money. Seem durable enough. This being my first pair of overalls I must get used to the fit. They give a slight wedgie sometimes.

Its extra-sharp, aggressive teeth make starting undercuts on downed logs quick and easy. I have been able to crosscut large, dead logs up to 15 inches diameter with no problems. The removable handle can be mounted upside-down which is handy for cutting logs that are flush with the ground as the handle is then up in the air, not scraping against the ground and impeding the cut. I bought two Bear Saws and reversed the handle on one of them so I would always have that orientation at the ready even in cold, snowy conditions when stiff fingers aren't very dextrous. My neighbor recommended this saw and let me borrow his before I ordered mine. I used his for just one day and was convinced that this was the saw for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for children","review":"This was a favorite of mine as a child so I was thrilled to reread it now and give it to my 7 year old grandson who loved it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting scrapbook of Steinway","review":"Relatively recently updated, this book is a brief and sugar coated, but very interesting history of the Steinway & Sons company, arguably manufacturer of the finest pianos in the world.

It goes great with the Tie Interceptor and Tie Bomber since all 4 sets use the same basic Tie design. The \\"wings\\" on the standard tie fighters can be a little wobbly but if you rearrange the positioning of the flat 2-by-3 on the top of each wing pylon it will make them much more stable (use it to bridge the seam and then use two extra gray or blue flat 1-by-2's to fill out the remaining gap that was left by moving the 2-by-three.) The mini-figs are pretty cool. Pay close attention when putting the cape on Darth Vader...what looks like two arm holes are actually meant to overlap on the neck post and give the cape a curved effect.My one dig is that the aft engine exhaust port on the Advanced Tie fighter leaves a little to be desired. A few spare parts were needed to give it a sort of \\"engine\\" main thruster look"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tie fighters are great","review":"Tie fighters and darth vadars spaceships are crucial bits of lego for anyones collection and having built a few tie fighters in the past, I was really impressed with the design and build quality of these. You wouldn't think that Tie fighters differ from one set to the next, but they do! I believe over time the lego masters in Denmark have progressed and improved the design of the ships. They all look the same essentially, but its the subtle details that change and improve.I have to say this is a great bit of kit, quick to build and fun to fly around the room, the droid ship that comes with it is really cool too, but I can't figure out why it is included? Although having an extra ship in my collection, I am not complaining about. The design of them all are great with some lovely little design touches, great use of colour on the bricks and the fact I now have another darth vadar in my collection rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"Don't be fooled by the description, this flag is NOT made in the USA. I purchased the flag under the impression that it was; when it arrived, the flag had a sticker on it that read \\"Made in China\\". A US Flag made in China... how ironic.As expected for the price, the quality of this flag is low but it still looks good hanging on a wall. I wouldn't fly it on a flagpole since the print is one-sided. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China, this is a cheap immitation.","review":"When I got this, I was rather disappointed that it doesn't match the quality of the other flags in my collection. It's very thin and seems very frail, which, I feel wouldn't last long in the windy parts of my state, let alone on the back of a boat.Like another reviewer stated, it IS made in China, and as we all know, they do what they have to to make a profit. Thankfully I only paid 1 (plus 4.99 shipping) which should tell you about the quality right there. No worth returning, but does look good on my wall, if you ignore the one small area of misprinting near the top truck of the flag.For novelty use, go for it, but if you expect to fly this thing, you're better off getting one of better quality than this. You will also pay for that too. Ones that are $25+ are usually good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but misleading","review":"I bought this after looking at the description and reviews on the website, but had no clue that it is essentially a date book with pictures of textile arts and very short passages (generally 2-4 lines) about making things scattered throughout.

I am a fan of Dennis Hopper somewhat but no matter how you slice it or how much his Hollywood friends try to dress it up this movie stunk. I bought it back in the early 90's and watched it.

I watched this movie because I wanted to see what caused Dennis Hopper's demise with the studios after the success of \\"Easy Rider\\". Disjointed, boring, interesting somewhat, really bad lighting and sound. It's a star-studded borefest. Would be great if Mr. Hopper would re-release a new version that made sense.

For me at least this is the perfect mixture of sarcasm, wit, and dry humor.The quality is first rate and the digital remastering is superb.

I'll be first in line for the remaining 4 seasons to complete the set at less than half the original price.Make no mistake this is one of the funniest shows ever done, headed by the genius of Buck Henry, Mel Brooks and Leonard Stern.

Like a lot of Queen's songs, you can enjoy it as some very talented musical and poetic creations (or if you just enjoy the noise). Or you can analyze it to death as I tended to do:I see some evidence of how deeply disturbed Freddie Mercury has been by his religion. First, Bohemian Rhapsody bemoans how his god made his life a living hell. Then, the moaning finally stops in Innudendo, where he questions the motives of his god. Note the cover of the album is of God the Trickster. (Actually, it's a modified copy of The Jugler of Universes by Jean Ignace Isador Jerard/Grandville.)If you enjoyed the audio CD, try to find the video of Innuendo (and the other pieces on this album).

This album manifests why. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is one of the top 10 greatest songs ever written (in my book), if not the best, and it gives you an out of body experience. The opening title track reminds us why Queen (along with Bon Jovi) is the best rock band to ever exist. \\"Don't try so hard\\" makes me feel it was written just for me. \\"These are the Days of Our Lives\\" will make you cry.

Thank you very much.","review":"This is their best album!! The music is amazing!! It is completely underrated and has passed many radio stations that it even exists as none of it's music gets played on the radio. It is proof that a major international rock act throughout the world and U.S. (and still sells major amounts of records (including this one!))can put out an album and be ignored by the media, radio, and television!! Too bad. Everyone out there should request this music in your own home towns!! I wish this album would get more attention!! (Also check out \\"Made In Heaven\\"!!!!! That c.d. is just as good if not better!! Seems how they were both recorded at about the same time!!! These were two classic c.d.s by no stretch of the imagination!!!! Listen to the lyrics and music played by these legends!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...","review":"What made queen great was that unique ability to play kick butt rock while maintaining their own artistic identity and at the same time be popular. This album exemplifies all of that. Great rock music with a flair! Definitely one of the bands best pieces of work. This album seems to be a return to the \\"night at the opera\\" phase where they best balanced their artistic ambitions with powerful rock which is what i always loved about queen. The \\"professional\\" critic at the top of the page doesn't get it. I think \\"these are the days of our lives\\" is a great song so what if it hints of radio ga ga? \\"Innuendo\\" and \\"the show must go on\\" make for great book ends to a very powerful collection of songs. Anybody who loves great rock guitar will love brian's work here. Freddie sings his heart out and over all the whole band is very tight..........socks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Artistry","review":"Such a pity that this album was produced towards the end of Freddie's life, if it wasn't so, we could have had something even better. But as Queen albums go, this is still amazing, probably their best, with such strong and powerful music. It starts off what seems like another Bohemian Rhapsody, Innuendo, maybe it was Queen's way of making sure they went out with a bang. Then there is another classic rock track, Headlong. But the tip of the iceberg for me, has to be The Show Must Go On. It is sang with such feeling 'inside my heart is breaking, my make up may be flaking but my smile, still stays on'. A fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innuendo or not, this is still a good album","review":"I've been a fan of Queen for a long time. Yes this was the last album they put out before Freddie Mercury succumbed to AIDS, but it is such a great album. This album does not have all the different arrangements as albums in the past. It still rocks though. People always give the earlier albums of artists more props than their more current stuff and it is a shame. If you enjoy Queen's legacy give this album a go and really listen to it with open ears. It isn't much different in reality to earlier albums. Innuendo kicks with a punch and it was a fitting title for the end of their original line up and it did put a stamp on the 70's and 80's even though it came out in 1991. Pick this album up and have a fun time."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVIEW FROM A QUEEN FAN","review":"Listening to 'These are the Days of Our Lives' still brings tear to my eyes. Freddie, knowing what is about to happend, sings his loungs out. This was his last working album with his friends and co-workers. But he insists 'The Show Must Go On'. But what is Queen without Freddie Mercury? This album, released in 1991, has many good songs but also some average ones. But the good songs are somehow so strong that it's hard to give this cd 'only' 4 stars! Standout tracks: The Show Must Go On, Innuendo, These are the Days of Our Lives. GO FOR IT! IT\`S WORTH IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"swan song","review":"When you see the high praise given to this album, the last one released before Freddy Mercury died, you might think people gave it 5 stars just out of sympathy or what have you, but no...the material here is actually deserving of such a rating. Freddy was suffering heavily throughout the making of this one, which makes his vocal work on \\"Headlong\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" that much more admirable. There is also the sweet sweet harmony of \\"These Are the DAys\\" and the silly \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad.\\" To hear him wrench these vocal takes out of his pain-wracked body is just a mind-blowing thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to get their last one.","review":"I beleive this was Queen's last release while Freddie Mercury was still alive; and well, if your a true fan you should really buy this. The songs are, as always, amazingly original, and the emotional \\"Show must go on\\" appropriately finishes up the playlist. I'm a big fan of all the songs in Greatest Hits I and II and like the older classics better than the newer ones, but this album is much better than Hot Space and is a nice collecters item b/c it was fm's last. If your not a hugh fan but want some great original queen, buy \\"A night at the Opera\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most unusual, yet entertaining film","review":"I recently screened this film and it's very unusual.

The movie has been rereleased a few times, two sequels (soon to be three), and a television series (I hesitate to mention the failed cartoon show). But who can deny that Queen's music wasn't good for Highlander? Since there was no official soundtrack, this album is the closest you can get. With the powerful and popular themes \\"Princes of the Universe,\\" and \\"Who Wants to Live Forever,\\" and the metal-rocking \\"Gimme the Prize,\\" and \\"Don't Lose Your Head,\\" Queen holds their place as one of the greatest rock bands ever. Excellent production and musical quality, this is one of the best albums Queen has ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album by Queen","review":"I wouldn't rate this one as one of the best Queen albums, but it's still pretty good. Best songs on this album are One Vision, A Kind of Magic, and Princes of the Universe. Who Wants to Live Forever is an okay track, but the rest of the album is filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This album is partially a soundtrack in that 7 of its songs (Forever, Who Wants to Live Forever, One Year Of Love, Gimme The Prize, Princes Of The Universe, part of Dont Lose your head and the title track) were included in the film Highlander albeit in mostly different versions. One Year Of Love itself is very underrated, its one of only 5 Queen songs that dont feature Brian Mays guitar playing at all and it has a light pop sound but it works. This album also is the most Prog Rock oriented of Queens 80s studio albums and after The Works ignored the genre save Mashines and Hot Space did not feature it at all its nice to hear it back in Queens sound (even if naturally not fully). This is a good album and one of the highlights of Queens 18 album career."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Queen album.","review":"Currently I own two Queen albums, this one and Classic Queen. While \\"Its A Kind of Magic\\" doesn't include the three songs that my age group thinks of when they hear the name Queen (Bohiemian Rapsody, Another One Bite the Dust and We Are the Champions) this album showcases the bands talent and is a album that I feel should be in everyones collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than magic","review":"I'll keep this short- I had this tape in my walkman for over a year and never tired of it.

I would have preferred to have gotten the original album because the two additional tracks are kind of pointless.

That being said, it is a cd that must be in any music lovers collection. The discKind of Magicitself is that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Mostly) bland euro-pop","review":"Essentially, this is the soundtrack to the film \\"Highlander\\" and provides a few strong tracks.\\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" may very well be Queen's most emotional song.This album becomes the first not to achieve an award for sales. It is deemed too \\"Euro-pop\\" to be a success in America.This had to have been true as this same album became a huge success through out the entire world and one if it's singles (the very pop \\"A Kind Of Magic\\") was a number 1 hit in over 35 countries!Sadly, this album contained too much pop oriented music for even my own taste and in doing so, is one of my least favorite records of theirs.At least the album's cover is fun and imaginative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously bad.","review":"The so called \\"die-hard\\" Queen fans must be so blind (or deaf) to give this pile of rubble a five star rating. This is pop rock mess (a bad one, by the way), one of thew worst efforts ever by Queen. I think even HOT SPACE is better than this swindle. The album is simply atrocious. \\"Gimme The Prize\\" and \\"Don't Loose Your Head\\" are two of the worst songs ever recorded by this great band. Ballads \\"One Year of LOve\\" and \\"Love is close to whatever\\" are so pedestrian that they made me wanna vomit.Also, drummer Roger Taylor seems to have asked the producer of this album (a guy called Mack) to give him the worst drum sound available at the moment.

That's one thing I've always enjoyed about them, all the way through Innuendo (Made In Heaven wasn't really an album in my book, but an EP). From the opening track all the way down, there's a different flavor on each.The only reason I gave it four stars is that I don't like the fact that it's almost like two mini albums in one. I still enjoy the Mack production, but David Richards adds so much in the studio. The Richards tracks are much more ambient and full, while the Mack stuff seems overcompressed at times. We really get to hear Freddie's voice much better on the Richards tracks too!This is the Hollywood Record's re-issue, not the original Capitol release.

Drops of Jupiter was excellent and my favorite one. Bette Davis Eyes and I Want You Back were very good as well. Aside from her covers, Last Kiss is probably the best vocally. The worst vocally is probably Enchanted, although that's one of her best songs from the studio.I did not go to her tour this year, but I did for the Fearless Tour. It's a shame because this one, by the looks of it, looked even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!","review":"My Daughter love,love,loved this she has watched it at least 20 times. it came in perfect condition and very quick!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At-home Concert","review":"I love this CD!!!

As an amature musician, I've come to appreciate her talent a little more with every listening. Saw the Speak Now concert and was amazed, particularly in her acoustic cover of a local artist. I expected a cover since she did something similar in all the previous US venues, but I was still blown away by her version and how well she pulled it off. She must have done 30-40 or more different accoustic, solo covers on this tour, and I'm hoping that maybe some of them are in the bonus material on the DvD. Not sure since I haven't watched it yet - it's a gift for a family member. Regardless, it's a rare thing that can get everyone in the family to take a break from our busy lives and sit down and enjoy together, but this is one of those gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice job, Taylor!","review":"I used to never even know about Taylor Swift, but now I love her music! I was at this live concert and I thought it was fantastic... This CD is great too! You should buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It used to be about the music.","review":"As much as I enjoy this live video, I prefer Taylor Swift's studio recordings more. To put it simply, this recording has just too much screaming from the crowd. The screaming takes away from the impact of the music. You're watching an event instead of a musical concert. Her lyrics can be quite deep in her songs, but they become rather buried in the craziness of the fanatic fans. Taylor Swift has incredible talent, don't get me wrong - I'm a fan, but this concert footage is not so much about the music but the praising of Taylor Swift. Does she deserve all that praise? Sure, she's earned it, but Taylor Swift the musician/songwriter can be better appreciated with her studio recordings. That's one man's opinion and I thought I'd share it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Taylor Fans, but FYI...","review":"This album is great for collectors. It differs from the original live album with three extra songs on the DVD and a documentary for the making of the Mean music video (also featured in Behind the Video on CMT).

Why can't so many people see the truth, see the fake guitar playing, the Les Paul prop, the manufactured smile? Someday the industry will look back and laugh at what they gave Taylor, so many awards stolen from other artist? Oh well, I congratulate her marketing skills and merchandising skills - good luck. These songs are fine pop tunes, but nothing more. These words do not \\"count\\" since they are basically about boys, kissing, and high school bleachers...not too deep to be considered an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people find this music so good?","review":"Reviews are mostly, if not exclusively, written by fans of an artist. I am making an exception with this review. Ms. Swift is, by most accounts, a nice person. Her music however (regardless of performance flubs) is at best \\"cute\\". I can see pre-teen or even teenage girls liking this sort of material. They buy and Ms. Swift's sales go through the roof. She is a star by all rights. But let us not kid ourselves here. Take away her image and extremely aggressive marketing and what you are left with is only inspiring if you are not curious about music in general. Once you you listen to musicians with real talent, it is difficult not to feel sorry for people who will continue to listen to Ms. Swift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much screaming on the live version.","review":"I thought it would be a good value but it sounded like a bunch of girls screaming in the background.

Taylor swift is more talented than most people her age and look at How many singers can write music, play guitar,are beautiful and have a personna like taylor at that age. There may be a few around, but very rare. Real talent is not just about amazing vocals. Look at lots of the amazingly talented indie rock bands out there, they put out and have created a lot of the best work in music, but a lot of them dont have amazing vocal. their talent lies in so many aspects of music and production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This \\"book\\" is terrible.

Unfortunately, his attempts have been failures, resulting in superstitious beliefs in monsters, and other chaos. Posch spends his free time relaxing in his spacecraft, in Earth's orbit, quite happy with his lazy occupation. Then one day, his bosses decide Earth is going to be destroyed. Their plan being a threat to his laziness, Posch embarks on a mission to save Earth. Along the way, he offends the minions of Hell, resulting in demons as well as aliens chasing him down.

The characters are very ... one dimensional. The book starts off quite well, and manages to keep the reader intersted for a while. But somehwere near the middle, things start moving so fast, its almost comical. By 'fast' I mean that it doesn't spark any questions/ discussion in the reader's mind. It just happens. The concept isn't all that bad, but everything else could've been dealt with a little more attention to detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky but sometimes annoying","review":"I don't know if I can really comment on Pohl as an author, having only read this and Drunkard's Walk. Anyway, this book is entertaining about half the time and aggravating the other half. I actually like Dopey, one of the aliens. The human characters are ok.. but sometimes too one-dimensional. At times he could do a better job of describing them so we can visualize. The fairly frequent sexual references are indeed a snore. There are grammatical errors and sometimes the sentence structure is not pleasant to read. I don't think I will get the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will the story start?","review":"The first 3rd of the story was a boring mystery style with a detective for a main character and almost no sci-fi at all.They get abducted by lame aliens (easy to fool, look like people in costumes, etc) for the middle 3rd.Eventually some new aliens that have some hope of being interesting attack for the final 3rd, but in the end nothing much happens.The book was called \\"The other end of time\\" but should have been \\"a short discussion about the other end of time\\".The worst part was a recommendation by Greg Bear on the cover. I love his work but apparently he will recommend anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I normally love Pohl's work, but this didn't work for me at all.

Then the plot slows down considerably. It picks up a little at the end, which I read for lack of anything else to do, but it has no real closure. However, I wouldn't want to read a sequel. In some parts, the story is a litle suspenseful, and that does add to the factor of wanting to read a little more, but most areas lack any form of suspense at all. \\"The Other End of Time\\" really isn't worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very uninspired book for Pohl.","review":"The few books I've read by Pohl have always been better then this. The plot moves along at a plodding pace, particularly in the middle. During this time, everything takes place in a small cell in which Pohl documents each and every time one of the character has to relieve themself. This is occasionally broken up by visits from their alien captor, but these visits do nothing to break up the monotony. The ending, once I forced myself to read that far, seemed rushed and there was no closure. It felt like Pohl just decided to cut the book off at that point. A few more chapters could have easily been added. Also, I didn't find my self liking any characters at all. Pohl does manage to paint an interesting picture of the future and bring up a few thought provoking topics, they're just buried under piles, and piles of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor Pohl","review":"Although I haven't read much of Pohl's work, I LOVED the Heechee books.

No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder where we go when we die.","review":"I was in the Sci-Fi Section of my local bookstore, and someone recomended Pohl to me. I can see why.

It really is one of the best Sci-Fi novels I have read in recent years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"Suspiciously similar in some ways to Wall Around A Star, which I found so boring I couldn't finish, this simply wasn't very good at all. Long, boring, surprisingly crude writing. Pohl's capable of great work but this isn't it. I sincerely hope that this was just a bad book and not a harbinger of further decline."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice branches, weaker tree","review":"The Other End of Time had a lot of interesting, if not terribly novel, concepts. The method of transportation via duplication is an interesting one, with clear ethical implications which we haven't as yet had to address. Additionally, the representation of the aliens was provoking -- the story never resolves who are the \\"good guys\\" and who are the \\"bad guys\\", but then real life is rarely black and white.But despite the positive aspects of the work, the end was a profound disappointment -- too much was unresolved. Normally this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but in this case the reader is left feeling empty; little is learned. So while The Other End of Time has components of interest, overall it's lacking, and the characters, which are established in a promising fashion, descend towards the end into cliche. The interesting discrete elements fail to make a compelling package.Overall, it's hard to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pohl could learn a thing from Stephen Baxter","review":"Typical of Pohl's depressing SF, where the world is horrible and uncaring and the hero's neurotic and annoying. Pohl is so unsympathetic to the Omerga Point theory of John Barrow and Frank Tipler, it makes you wonder why he bothered to spend the time writing a trilogy about it. Pohl could take a lesson from Stephen Baxter, who uses Barrow and Tipler's ideas about escatological cosmology to great effect in his own novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"My rating is really -5 (negative 5)","review":"Really, Amazon should have ratings from -5 to 5.

That obviously never happened, Cuba has always been dependent, first on URSS and now needs Venezuelan oil and remittances from USA to feed their population.This book is a shame for Latin Americans, it says that our failure its not our fault, its a major piece of sad self-complacency.

He tends to focus on the negative (which is fair in a lot of ways), but from what I understand from some of my teachers, this is not the best source of historical analysis on Latin America.

What I read in this book were things that I was not taught, even when I received a major in Spanish in College. Galeano is scathingly opinionated, but he does back up what he writes.

What stands out is the lack of special effects and the energetic editing. It's all done in the camera and in the cuts. The throwback qualities of the visual would not be so obvious if it weren't for the Kraftwerk/Tangerine Dream style soundtrack, which sounds like 1982.Really cool filmmaking. Not impressively deep but exceptionally well executed and very kinetic. May become something of a cult classic due to certain mind-bending sequences which establish the film as the work of a director functioning as an auteur.

It had a pulsating soundtrack provided by the Chemical Brothers,it had action,stunning fight scenes, stunning locations , what went wrong? Simply a script that was jerky,messy and bloody awful backed up by poor direction. I really wanted to love this film but was so disappointed and can only give it 2 stars!

What could have been...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews Must Be Fake, nothing exciting about this movie","review":"I read the reviews and can't believe any over one star are real.

Directing and editing are so choppy it makes one feel nauseous. Kate Blanchett should be ashamed of herself for appearing in this debacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies","review":"I watched this movie mainly because the trailer was well made and the ranking was very high at IMDB (7.1 at that time with 20-30K raters). I was thrilled during the first 15 minutes then at the middle of the film I was already bored. I kept watching it hoping some good twist or surprise towards the end of the film. I was wrong, totally wrong. One thing I did learn from this movie is not to count on the reviews/ratings. But then, how and where can we get more objective opinions. It is not about the money wasted on this stupid film, but about the time and emotion you put in that 100 mins.I will never watch a movie directed by Joe Wright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"A waste of money and by no means comes close to the excellent action movie \\"Columbiana!\\" There is NO comparison. I read other reviews which enticed me to orderboth DVDs which was a huge mistake! In fact, I couldn't even finish watching it! Ifound it to be boring and a waste of film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the trailer, then skip the movie.","review":"Trailer got me interested in the movie, but that was a mistake. You saw the whole movie in the trailer and the parts they added for the movie were boring and, at times, very poorly produced. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just A Vehicle For Gratuitous Dumb Violence","review":"Thought it might be good since Cate B. is in it but she must have needed the money. I need not repeat the very implausible story line, but I must say the movie insults your intelligence throughout, although intelligence was clearly not a key consideration by the producers for the target audience which must be people who care not a wit about impossibilities but just enjoy fast action chases with an attractive young sweet-face teenage girl who suddenly explodes into a fantastic hand-to-hand killing machine over and over - all lovely 98 pounds of her. The only redeeming feature of going to this movie is that if it rains you're under a roof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time watching","review":"Eric Bana is not an action star, has no athletic ability and yet he somehow teaches a young girl how to fight?Saoirse Ronan did a good job of making it believable that she could fight and do all those amazing things, although not as well as Chlo Grace Moretz, better known as \\"Hit Girl\\".The dialog was done fairly well but was over shadowed by the comical fight scenes with Bana and the assassins sent to kill Hanna.Within ten minutes I found myself wishing I had not spent the money to watch this movie. A wannabe \\"Hit Girl\\" movie.Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage; how did it get such great reviews?","review":"As my title says, \\"How did this get such rave reviews?\\" Simply put the first part of the film is what you'd hope for--tense, action packed, and mysterious, a great setup that leads to...well, a movie so dull I almost fell asleep watching it. What little action there is amounts to nibbles spread out into a few fights and a LOT of chases; see Hannah meet people we could care less about, and see them die; see Hannah act with all the emotion of a robot. See the end sequence come and just END, no epilogue, no follow-up.Unless you've got insomnia and need something to put you out for the night? Avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"I was really excited to watch this movie. The previews were pretty awesome but once i saw it I was left wanting back the time I spent watchig it. The best parts are in the trailer. It felt like some aweful indie film. The acting was great, just the story (it had potential) and how it came off through the lense was not decent enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"One of the worst movies I have endured for quite some time. Don't fall for the 'perfect assassin' routine. It's not about that....at all. It's really a very, very, lousy coming of age movie. This girl was sheltered from the real world until the movie starts. After that, it's her confusion and lousy writing that make the movie. Please, do yourself a favor, don't waste your dime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not great","review":"Overall the movie is entertaining to watch with some great action scenes. However I did feel that there was some part of the story I was missing. The movie lacked fluidity from chapter to chapter or lacked substance. The main characters of good and evil were not convivincing enough in their roles as ruthless assassins, something was lacking - may be because I have seen them in their alternate roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - enough with the arty overlay","review":"The film had a great concept but in many places the execution was poor. Often became aware of cast acting and the scenes looked very manufactured. What a shame considering the cast available. The pace was so often stalled with arty sections that the whole pace was painfully disjointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird","review":"too many holes in the plot in order to believe it, even with suspension of belief. could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been Good","review":"Before I watched this movie, I thought it would be an exciting one. Hanna is a girl raised by her father in the woods. She learns everything there is to know about survival and protecting herself from any threats (human or not) from her father. Her father is an ex-CIA agent.The first part of the movie was good. However, the rest (or most) the movie was very predictable. The plot was basically a one big chase, and the final showdown. Another problem with this movie was over the top sound effects and the music, both of which was very distracting. This movie was made in such a way that the viewer would have to fill in lots and lots of blanks without questioning any of it. At some point you think it is just not worth it.There is some action in it, but nothing like the Bourne series."},{"rating":"2","title":"We saw this in the theater. Thriller to the max. Super","review":"We watched the trailers and were spellbound. Too many movies today are essentially the \\"trailer\\", but not Hanna. If i were ship wrecked on an island and could choose 10 movies, Hanna would be in the top 5. The movie makes you think, and laugh so hard, you might need a break for the toilet. And if i could have Hanna with me on that Island life would be grand. She is an innocent with skills and a mind set that trips you out. She knows so many things that she doesn't even know she knows. Hanna takes \\"home schooling\\" to a higher bar. I hope they have a sequel. Several sequels. Watching Hanna on DVD tops the theater. You can rewind to see a scene you thought you comprehended, but as you re-watch, you see Hanna as the perfect person. She is the Honey Badger of women. You will not regret watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Take on the Revenge Thriller","review":"Hanna is a great revenge thriller that boasts some great fighting scenes and terrific cinematography. The supporting cast, including Bana and Blanchett, are great here but the film is really driven by Ronan. She convincingly portrays a naive girl that truly doesn't anything about the world except for what her father taught her, and pulls of some great stunts. She owns this part and I'm excited to see the path her career takes as she's given more roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining enough","review":"A pretty good girl action movie with enough grit to keep it interesting. It is very well shot and edited, though there are enough holes in the story to keep it from being more than an entertaining evening's fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinocchio is a better story...","review":"I was very very disappointed... Great start (first five minutes) then a senseless salad of chases and violence, a non ending torture of patience in anticipation of something meaningful that never materialized. Pinocchio, Little Red Riding Hood, and Three Little Pigs blended over a soundtrack that was unsuccessfully trying to mess with your head. The last funfair scene tied the room together... Very very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"Crap. Plus really obnoxious music. What was the story? A waste of a talent like Cate Blanchett. She must have needed the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanna","review":"This film is without any value as a story or as a film. It is filled with senseless Follywood violence, very poorly written, badly acted and filmed cheaply and poorly.I feel dirty and stupid for having watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great buildup leads to nothing..","review":"This is by far the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.It tries to create a story, which at first keeps you interested, but then half way through the movie, crumples and falls apart, taking you on an endless run (literally) that's as far from interesting as can be - it becomes utterly boring and you lose all interest in it. Very seldom do I feel like I've wasted time when watching a movie - this is one of those occasions.The acting is good (for the most part), but having good actors perform on Titanic won't prevent it from sinking.I collect movies and will buy nearly anything, but this one will not make it to my collection, simply because I will never ever watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slept through most of it!","review":"I had very high hopes for this movie, but I was completely disappointed! First, the storyline/plot lacks detail; I had no idea what was going on. Next, the lack of focus. Maybe I missed the point from the start which would have been crucial to the rest of the film, but it wouldn't have mattered because there was very little dialogue between the actors anyway. Hanna sucked, bottom line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This movie is trash. The actors are no good, the filming isn't good at all & what's with the psychidelic music?! Waste of time & Eric & Kate's talent. Who rated it with 4 stars...it's creators?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Horrible. This movie sucks and was a huge waste of time. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money. Buy Killer Klowns From Outer Space instead on blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"I thought Hanna was very entertaining.

Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, and Tom Hollander are all stand-outs in their roles but the actors who played the quirky but unfortunate that befriends Hanna are excellent.It is clear what their fate is in the movie but apparently the studio told the director to avoid highlighting their fate. A much better and much more interesting conclusion would have been to have had the their daughter save them by after having learned from Hanna in much the same way that Hanna learned from her. Hence my 4 stars instead of 5 for this movie.Still, a good movie with an amazing soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This movie make know sense.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanna","review":"Not a small wonder this movie is in video already. Its a sad state of affairs when a movie this bad even makes to the theaters and so many people liked it; are they getting paid to write these reviews. There were some magical scenes like when she is in a hole and Hummvees are passing over at 60 mph then the next scene she holding on to the bottom of it magically. That was a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame with a capital L","review":"A well photographed, well acted, quirky, esoteric film that goes no where, with characters that meant nothing to me. Cate Blanchet was obviously contractually obligated to be in the nonsense. All the cool music, great sets, fantastic locations, and odd audio in the world will not supply a story for a film that has none. Sorry. This film was a zero and it implied zero all throughout. Episodes of Adventure Time with Finn and Jake have more to tell and say than this canned ham of a film did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal film for young adults","review":"This was a more brutal film for young adults then I thought i would be. I yhought it would be more like an agnet film then it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action movies can be art pieces too!","review":"This is most definitely an action movie at heart. What makes this movie different than your typical popcorn action movie is its style, atmosphere, and direction. The characters keep your attention and are actually likable when on screen. Ms. Ronan is an incredibly talented young women, and she only gets better and better in her roles. The other characters are creative (except Cate Blanchett's stereotypical government agent role, my only main gripe of the film). The music by the Chemical Brothers enhances the already visually appealing aspects of the film. The film is an artistic action piece, and a must see for anyone who is up for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw the switch","review":"I like Eric Bana. I think Cate Blanchett is one of the great actresses out there. Jeff Imada - who choreographed the action scenes has been doing that for a long time and is also excellent. Seemed like a no brainer. The anticipation and early promise of the movie was so good that I stayed until the end. Here's what I'd do if I had to do it again. The beginning is great. When Hanna throws the switch, you do the same, and you've seen the best of the movie and won't waste your time waiting for something else worth watching to happen. Trust me - this had to read better as a script to lure in that cast. Don't make the same error they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Wow ,what a dissapointment.The first twenty minutes i was thinking,this is gonna be a great movie.Oh boy was i wrong.The rest of the movie is meaningless scenes of her traveling with a family that reminds me some weird clockwork orange film.The music reminds me of a rave party and the cinemetography makes me think of willy wonka and the choclate factory (johnny depp version).I wish i new waht i was watching but nothing really ties together and the story line never develops.watch the first twenty minutes and the last ten then return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Bebo reviews Hanna and rates it with 5 bleeps!","review":"Length:: 1:45 MinsUncle Bebo gives \`Hanna' 5 Bleeps on the Bleeps Movie Rating Scale (5BMRS) - Review: Exciting, original, global chase thriller - Go to moviebleeps.com for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Film, Beautiful Filmography","review":"I really really liked this film (I should probably have given it five stars but I reserve that rating for the greats). The film follows Hanna, a very like-able teenager who leaves the forest where she grew up to try and make a normal life for herself. The only thing is - she's being hunted. Hanna travels from Africa all the way to Europe to try and meet up with her father who is also on the run. I won't say any more for fear of giving the film away.This really was a great thriller though and the filmography was absolutely beautiful. It's not what I've come to expect from action movies or thrillers but it really works well. I couldn't recommend it enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best Movie I've Seen This Year","review":"This isn't a movie where the plot is completely laid out for you. It gets the juices flowing, if you know what I mean. This is not your typical action movie. It's thought-provoking. How often does anyone refer to anything that Hollywood pumps out as, \\"Thought-provoking?\\"The cinematography and editing choices are completely unique (that's a good thing). It works well with the Chemical Brother's soundtrack. Very cool to watch the successful collaboration between both director and artists.Thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual feel-good plot or soundtrack...","review":"I really enjoyed watching \\"Hanna\\". It's not the usual feel-good movie that we all come to expect. Everything about this movie is different (plot, actors emotions, scenes) and for me very interesting. Even the \\"sound track\\" is unusual and exciting. Also, If you want to test your sound system's bass tone or sub woofer--the DTS HD Master audio sound track on this movie produces BIG bass. I actually had to decrease both my bass tone and sub woofer so I didn't get bounced out of the room LOL.If you are looking for edgy, out-of-the-ordinary entertainment then I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Movie.","review":"Disapointed flick that lacks theme and development.

There is no building of the characters nor did the plot and historical flashbacks truly offer any substance. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so good","review":"This isn't a show that makes you like any of the characters, or root for any of them. There's a lot of senseless death and running around in a daze. There's no good point to the show, not even a bad one. No good guys get rescued, and nobody cares. What a waste of money and time.

Interesting but full of just downright immoral sickness. At the end of the movie i could only say .... that was sick and messed up. There is a lot of just aimless and gruesome killing, as well as a cup full of liberal views. They basically have multi-gendered people and very perverted people introduced and also a lesbian scene with the main character and another little girl who is suppose to be like 15 or 16. Then there is the religious view mentioned almost in passing, as if you couldn't tell by all the other stuff, that nature brings us closer to god.... but not THE GOD but any god and whatever you believe in whether krishna or whatever. And the moral of the story is.... we dont know, but post modernism. Anyway , would not recommend watching this movie if you plan to have a bad feeling in your stomach during the duration of the movie.

The videos 965, Sunshine, and Story had me mesmerized (also EO, which is from an earlier work).AI seems to be a highly talented songwriter/singer/performer who's at ease with driving techno beats as with gentle ballads. And if you're a fan of Janet Jackson or Beyonce, you may have noticed AI in the background. As I drive taxi in a college town, AI is one of the few artists people ask about and text themselves a reminder to check out. I'm looking forward to her future releases.

They only pushed the God thing to sell albums. When that stopped working, they switched to a \\"harder\\" look and sound. Give me a friggin' break. How ... cheesy can you get?

Not a high end amp but for the price you can't beat it. I purchased a set of 6-1/2 inch Polk Momo speakers and decided that the 18 RMS watts in my Alpine receiver was not enough. This amp provides 75 RMS watts so the sound is close to my home stereo system which has 100 watts driving Polk RT7 speakers with a Polk powered subwoofer. I could not rate it 5 stars because I heard my son's high end MTX amp which has cleaner power with less distortion. Most people won't be able to hear the difference but they will definitely hear the difference between 18 RMS watts and 75 RMS watts per channel. If this is your price range, I highly recommend it.

When I received the book and dvd however, I found that the book was not the \\"standard\\" wohlfarht sixty studies op. 45 that every violin teacher I know uses - and that I was led to believe this book was as well - this book is a blend of studies from op. 45, 54, and 75 - and really doesn't contain very many of the studies from the original op. 45 book. The description on amazon does not mention this fact and in my mind is a bait and switch.

Baudelaire's extreme content--his embrace of putrefaction, filth, sadism and ennui as fit stuff for poetry--owes much of its impact to the tight, disciplined meter he chose for his medium. Most Baudelaire translations don't capture this classical edge in English, turning the poems into free verse or prose. While Martin has to bend the exact meaning a little (often a lot) to get the English to fit, on the whole he does an impressive job of making the verse sound exact and controlled but not too sing-songy. There's no ponderous introduction to bug you either, just a short & highly personal 'Afterthoughts' section with some intriguing insights. This isn't the only translation you'll want to read, but it recovers a side of modernity's bad boy that's hard to find anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort at translation","review":"This is the first complete translation of Les Fleurs du Mal that I've seen which captures both Baudelaire's symbolic rhyming and his strict syllable count (10 per line in this edition vs. Baudelaire's usual 12).Martin's translation could be improved by following Baudelaire's order of ideas and literal diction more closely, but he captures the spirit of each poem in a way that makes this volume stand out from most of the previous efforts I've seen.If you're looking for a Baudelaire translation by a single author, this is a good one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Poems by Charles Baudelaire","review":"I purchased this book just for one poem; \\"FLEURS DU MAL, or \\"Flowers of Evil\\".

I feel like i wasted my money on this book! Its better to stick to translation by Louise Varese or at least stay away from this translation. the language made akward and because i know french and the french version on the opposite page-i can see his translated badly in some parts- sometimes at random-he translates word for word which makes the poem's reading too hard to bear! then other times he takes artistic license! This translator should be locked up for crime against poetry for destroying Baudelaire's work. All I can say to the translator is Shame on YOU! Please do not buy this book- i beg you- or you will not be able to enjoy Baudelaire because he is one of the greatest poets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eden","review":"Like much of Robert Adams work, this book at first appears transparently ordinary--photographs of a truck stop somewhere in the middle of nowhere--but somehow resonates with memories. There is the irony of the name of the place cast against the bleakness of the photographs--but Adams claims that no irony is intended. But my own memeories called out by this book are of long car trips before air conditioning, the smell of hot engine oil, of cars overheating, the taste of cold coke in a bottle, and the smell of diesel engines long before anyone thought of air polution. The biblical Eden was a place of perfection before the fall, but these pictures must refer to the same place at some later time, after the the tree was cut to make way for the interstate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album, but maybe a bit overrated...","review":"While I agree ANATO was a breakthrough album in showing that good music has no boundaries, I sometimes wonder if it is overrated once I look at the actual songs here. For all of its influence on the 70s rock scene, I found the actual album didnt flow very well at all. The subject matter is all over the map, as Queen goes from singing about love affairs with cars and lovely ladies to a madman's apocylptic visions in \\"The Prophet's Song\\" (without a doubt the best piece of work on this album). The longer, \\"5-star\\" songs are broken up by songs that are often heavy on filler (see the tedious \\"sweet lady\\")To its credit though, the production is outstanding, Freddie Mercury sounds positvely angelic (of course) and the musical performances are stellar. For more consistency, see Queen's next effort, A Day at the Races. To hear the album that everyone talks about when Queen is discussed, pick up a Night at the Opera..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen - At Their Most Eclectic","review":"This album is best known for producing the monster Queen hit \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which has become an all time classic still receiving major airplay more than 30 years after it's release. The album also spawned John Deacon's \\"You're my Best Friend\\" another huge hit. I think this was the album that introduced me to Queen back in the day and I remember being totally fascinated by it. I had literally never heard anything like this before, and it remains a truly unique album to this day. Queen throws everything at the wall to see what sticks and for the most part it all works. The album contains metal, progressive rock, pop, ragtime, folk, ballads pop, hell even a song about being in love with your car! It sounds stupid, but Roger Taylor's gritty vocals and percussion work make it irresistible. \\"Death On Two Legs\\", \\"39\\", \\"Love Of My Life\\", and \\"The Profit Song\\" have all become Queen classics Ya gotta love it, and this album shows everything that made Queen great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This album is simply amazing. Freddie Mercury's vocals sound incredible on every song. This album defiitely showcases the band's versatility, they can do everything from the operatic \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" to more metal-y songs like \\"Sweet Lady\\". There isn't a song on the CD I don't like. A must-have for lovers of all musical genres; there is something for everyone on this album. Five and a half stars!-Bohema"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps in 5.1 but in stereo....","review":"I can not comment about this DVD-A sound quality in multichannel because I am a stereo guy. I bought it recently (I thought I was lucky finding a new, unopened item in a very old cd store) but after listening I am not sure I was lucky: the two channel tracks do not sound as high resolution. As a matter of fact is a very lifeless, undetailed version of this magnificent music. I made A-B comparisons with my mofi version, and the Mobile Fidelity Master Golden CD is much, much, much better. Mofi is virtually the high resolution when compared with the stereo track included in this DVD-A. If needed I have a DVD-A for sale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic album, w/o the remixes","review":"classic Queen. i don't know what it is with re-releasing already classic albums with remixes and live tracks.just leave these albums alone already and put those b-sides on albums all it's own. with that aside this album really is perfect. freddie mercury had one of the most beautiful voices in all of rock history and should be remembered for that as well as his incredible stage presence. \\"death on two legs\\", \\"you're my best friend\\" and \\"bohemian Rhapsody\\" are there more well known songs,but the rest compliment the album beautifully and don't qualify as mere filler. check out the uncategorizable \\"'39\\" for starters.probably Queen's greatest album, aside from their greatest hits albums.BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Queen Masterpiece","review":"It is very difficult for me to decide on which is my favorite Queen album, but this is one of the best. It is as close to perfect as even Queen could get. From the venemous opening tune \\"Death On Two Legs\\" you are entranced by the amazing variety of music on one album. \\"39\\" is a folk style wonder, and \\"Seaside Rendevous\\" is one of Freddie's campiest and most fun tunes. \\"The Prophet's Song\\" is an illustrious multi-tempo rock classic that should not be missed. The one and only \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\" are included, but only a part of an album that is classic from beginning to end. I wanted to add that this was just voted best album of the 70s on votenumber1.com. Freddie voted best male vocalist, and Queen best group of all time. Bohemian Rhapsody was best single ever. More reason to add this classic to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my god","review":"I have had several people sit in my car to listen to this DVD audio. Everyone of them looks at me in awe as the song Bohieman Rhapsody plays. This is an absolute MUST for the DVD Audio player. They should use this DVD to sell the car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"even if you don't like Queen....just buy it.....","review":"I am not a Queen fan or a big rock and roll fan for that matter.But, this is one of those few gems...\\"Love of My Life\\" is SO overlooked as a ballad for the ages. If it wasn't for the garbage that's been Top 40 for the past 10 or so years (exceptions - \\"Groove is in the Heart\\", \\"Waterfalls\\" and some of Will Downing's ballads), this ballad would be a huge smash even today.The entire collection is classic...rating up there with \\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Ben Webster Plays Ballads\\" and Will Downing's \\"Moods\\" as perfect mood pieces.Just buy it...dig the harmonies in the middle of \\"Prophet\\"...and the ditties are cool, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYTHING AND GOD SAVE THE \\"QUEEN\\"","review":"The greatest album that Queen ever made. Terrifically harmonious, A Night at the Opera features some of Queen's most memorable tracks including Death On Two Legs, Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon, You're My Best Friend, The Prophet's Song, and Bohemian Rhapsody. Regardless of what you might think of Freddie Mercury this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best studio album","review":"Okay, everyone bought this in 1975 for Bohemian Rhapsody. That, in and of itself, makes this album a great buy. If you don't know a lot about Queen, you might be in for a bit of a suprise by the whole album. Queen always dabbled in experimentation with music and vocals. They basically covered everything from rock to country to disco. Casual fans would want to get Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits. The true fans always have this one ready to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining Why Queen Matters","review":"Queen's greatest album should be the guide to how to be a rock band. Like the Beatles, Bowie, and in some ways, like Led Zeppelin, Queen pushed their skills and style. Bob Dylan did it too. I wish today's bands had the guts to avoid the rut of writing for a demographic, and wrote such variety and quality.As you click through the samples, you'll remember a lot of the songs from the days when FM radio played real music and not just the short pop songs.The rock is solid, but they crank through more than a few power chords. The melodies behind \\"Love of My Life\\" and \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" are delicately woven, yet don't lose the fact that they are rock tunes.\\"The Prophet's Song\\" is an incredible multi-layered song competing with \\"Bohemian Rapsody\\" for articulating intense images amid a storyline.And \\"Bohemian Rapsody\\"... simply one of the greatest songs ever.I fully recommend \\"A Night at the Opera\\" by Queen.Anthony Trendl"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best - Night at the opera","review":"This is the best CD I have ever known. Mercury can be called: Mozart of the rock music.I am really happy that this album was released. Thank you Queen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Harmonious Mix of Electic Styles","review":"Freddie Mercury said once that his two biggest influences were Jimi Hendrix and Liza Minelli. That says everything about this CD, which is a mix of styles that would have seemed impossibly different had Mr. Mercury and company not taught the rest of us just how well they go together. In \\"Death on Two Legs,\\" the album opens with the rough-edged, loud rock and roll that made Queen a Top-40 favorite in the 70's and 80's. It is closely followed by \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon,\\" a lilting feminine romp that celebrates idleness. The combination produces a surprising flavor I've never tasted anywhere else. This band is one of a very special kind. And this CD is perhaps the best example of their talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Piece","review":"Queen are my favourite band, and I think this album is probably one of their best. When I first heard this album I was amazed! It is such a great Album. All the tracks are fantastic and they live up to the Queen Phenomena. Death On Two Legs, The Prophet's Song and Bohemian Rhapsody are just simply the best, I'm not downing all the other tracks but these are my top 3. This album is just the best, even if you're not a Queen fan you'll love it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"The CD is great Queen, However, the editing is okay at best. Death on two legs cuts off early. About 3 seconds early. Other songs cut. I think for the money charged, it should have been better edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen's First Good Album","review":"This album has a mix of rock and Queen's opera-like vocals. Some people not like it, it definately isn't their best, but this has their breakthrough songs such as \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Best Friend.\\" I like it and it's a good, solid album, but there are a few filler songs on too which keeps this from 5 stars. Queen starts a new music genre that mixes loud opera-like vocals with Mercury's piano playing, and some nice guitar work with great bass and drums. All of the songs are original sounding with no annoying covers. This sound sparked many followers (did somebody say The Darkness?) but none of them sound as good as Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry Just Have To Clear Something Up","review":"OK WHOEVER SAID THAT JOHN DEACON SANG YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND IS INSANE.

This is, quite simply, one of the best rock albums of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Night to remember","review":"Ok, Bo Rhap is a classic but that shouldn't be your only reason for getting this album. From the opening chords of Death on Two Legs you know you're in for something special. As that song blends into Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon into I'm In Love with My Car you realize you have just recived a lesson in the varied styles of Queen. This is a fun album full of all that makes Queen Queen. Sit back and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it more...","review":"Without a doubt, this album is among the best albums of rock-and-roll ever recorded. \\"Bohimian Rhapsody\\" is, of course, epic and very \\"Queen.\\" But I most definatly think that \\"The Prophet's Song,\\" however long it is, takes the cake with this album. It truly saddens me that it never really got the recognition it deserves. Freddie Mercury's voice is unmatched by any artist to date. All in all, the album is the greatest gem that Queen ever mined from the mountian of their talent. And what a mountian it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Queen don't rock!

I have all the original 8 studio albums on cd & only 7 on lp. ANATO is my all time favorite. The songs are really great & amazing. In it's day it was the most expensive album ever made. All the songs are great, but Good Company & '39 suck. Here's the songs:1. Death On Two Legs (5/5)2. Lazing A Sunday Afternoon (5/5)3. I'm In Love With My Car (4.5/5)4. You're My Best Friend (5/5)5. '39 (3/5)6. Sweet Lady (4.5/5)7. Seaside Rendezvous (5/5)8. The Prophet's Song (5/5)9. Love Of My Life (5/5)10. Good Company (3/5)11.Bohemian Rhapsody (5/5)12.

Freddie Mercury is an excellent vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"This is where I started back in 1975 with Queen (on an album and have upgrated to CD). I became addicted - and fast! From Death on Two Legs to '39 to Love of My Life --- What a Voice!! This was a great place for me to start with Queen and I kept going, and going, and going. . . I definitely recommend it. Go beyond Bohemian Rapsody and listen to Freddie at work. His live shows were beyond any concert I have ever attended! He is greatly missed by his fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raul Jose's Review","review":"From listening to his many recordings, Romero Lubambo is an awesome guitarist.

I got the basic jokes then, but the subtle humor elluded me, until now.I will probably watch the 22 episodes again in the near future while I'm biding time for Season 2.I gave only 4 stars because the extras were on the soft side.

The actors lips are a beat ahead of the sound and it annoyed me so much I took it back and got a refund. As no-one else on this review thread has mentioned this I'm left wondering if I was just unlucky. It's not just this DVD where I've noticed the problem, it's also on my Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 1 disc although not quite as noticeable. Needless to say this explains my one star rating, otherwise it would be a definite five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ensemble Comedy At Its Finest!","review":"This is the finest first season of ANY sitcom. I would strongly disagree with the customers who think that the show hit its stride in the second season. \\"Cheers\\" hit its stride when Diane said \\"You gather my inference\\" to an obnoxious customer in episode 3. It flew into the stratosphere in the two-part finale which featured some of the sharpest acting and writing in film or tv. Don't let those reviewers fool you. \\"Cheers\\" was in full bloom from nearly the very beginning.I am excited about the DVD release. Now how about \\"The Duck Factory\\" with Jim Carrey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I have been waiting for the DVD for ages and thank-god for my multi-regioned DVD player that I can get this.

I can tell you from MY experience, this is not the case. I would take 1-2 pills a night before bed and just about every night I would wake up locked up or cramped in my stomach. After getting fed up with this feeling and just the nauseousness that I got from taking these, I went to a Vitamin World in my area and purchased Magnesium Citrate which is just as bio available and has caused me zero problems overall.

But marketing this as a course in miracles dvd is incorrect. This is a small cult run(or WAS run) by a man who claimed to be the Master Teacher (Guru). The course specifically urges us to avoid this type of situation. End of story. Some people find comfort in cults, intelligent people do not.

Onechanbara is just a middle of the road low-budget Japanese film."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fun","review":"It drags a little through the first half but the ending made it worth having in our collection.I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't rock as a movie.

Fast, furious, tight, loud... amazing songwriting with an incredible delivery. It is a far cry from the teenpop punk and nu-metal movements. Anyone who thinks bands like Good Charlotte \\"rock\\", I would have to insist that they pick this CD up and prepare for a solid ass kicking. It opens with an explosion and doesn't let up for 40 minutes. Standouts for me include Bone China and Petal, but every track holds its own. Its such a relief that there is finally some decent rock music hitting the scene again. I hope that anyone who cares about what the music they listen to sounds like will find this CD and enjoy it at least half as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Ocean is Golden","review":"What a breath of fresh air this record is. A sonic blast! Every song on this record is invigorating, smart and palpable. It's amazing that such a huge wall of sound is coming from just three people.There is not a weak track on this record. The standouts for me are Bone China, Long Painting, Dog Days, Diving, and Petal. Kristin Hersh's voice, as distinctive as Bjork or Joanna Newsome is on full throttle. It's both shredded and strong and sung with such an urgency that it makes you feel as volatile as she sounds. The music within each song change on a dime. Direction, tempo and speed are all elements that Hersh, Bernard Georges and Rob Ahlers are playing with successfully here.The songs are not derivative per se because they definitely have Hersh's stamp on them. But for some reason it recalls elements of early Nirvana and The Pixes and of course Hersh's baby Throwing Muses which is not bad company to be in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult reading for the average layman","review":"I rely on customer reviews when deciding on a book. Apparently the three reviews I read that appeared to be helpful turned out to be a disappointment. This book is obviously written for someone with a very extensive vocabulary. It is filled with $10.00 words and ideas that are really hard to decipher. I was under the impression, via the other 3 reviews, that this book would provide an explanation of \\"mindblindness\\" in terms the average layman could understand.

Driving a few screws or drilling holes in tight places from time to time, nothing beats it.

The same thing happened to Camel when they tried to please the record company with The Single Factor (the title gives more than a hint).If you like the slower, more textured or more adventurous stuff you'll find very little here. I hear a bunch of guys trying to sound like a band, but lacking real chemistry.Having said that, these guys are too good to make an album without some strong moments.

Be that as it may, this, \\"The New Fowler's Modern English\\", is bloated, tedious, clumsily written, and deadly dull--constantly belaboring the obvious.

This simply does not sound like a Bobby Bare record. There's no connection to the Bare persona--the laconic, hell-raising raconteur-- developed over some three decades of recording. This sounds like someone was producing a Jack Jones record and at the last minute Jones pulled out and Bare filled in for him.It seems as if Bare Jr. is playing some sort of joke on his father and the listeners.

A typical season is 13 regular episodes. Hulu has Episode 10 as does Amazon.If they expect people to shell out $50 for a 10-episode season, SyFy needs its head examined.Steve has potential, but why SyFy made him a \\"gay\\" character (Pete often acts more gay than Steve does) seems to indicate that SyFy is being politically correct...make a character just for the sake of \\"diversity\\" and not because it's relevant to the story arc.I'm not bothered much by Claudia's maturity. It was hinted she is up to be the next \\"caretaker\\" of Warehouse 13...indicating that caretakers might live long, but eventually pass away.I'd change this review to more than one star if SyFy puts out more episodes for this season, but if it's over at 10, I don't think it deserves extra stars for shorting the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theology unfolded","review":"This is an excellent book for those Christians who wish to gain a deeper understanding of Jesus's teaching \\"unless you become like this child...\\". This book also provides a helpfull resource to Catholics who may be constantly challenged by fundamentalist Christians to be born again. Cardinal Von Balthazar very clearly explains what is involved in being like a child unto the Lord and gives his readers many insights into the mystery of life with God, the Father.It is a short book in terms of pages, but each page is packed with reflections. This book is best read as part of a meditation regime or one's \\"lectio divina\\" (prayerful study of religious texts).I think readers who are looking for a substantive theological exposition will appreciate this book with its balance between deep theology and careful reasoning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this realistic yorkie!","review":"My husband actually got this for me for Christmas. I love yorkies and had seen it in the store and fell inlove. Its so cute and realistic with the cold nose! The only complaint I had like another post was that I can't keep the velcro shut to keep the battery box in. I had to resort to safety pinning it. Other than that I think kids or adults will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"I felt compelled to write because one reason I bought this was that I'd read several good reviews. We have this Yorkshire Terrier version of this toy, and I regret the purchase very much. The reviewer who mentioned the battery box issue nailed it - it's pretty much impossible to keep the velcro closed because the dog's hair is all stuck in the hooks, and the battery box is too large and heavy and doesn't want to stay in the too-small compartment. It's pretty cute, but you don't see its eyes AT ALL - they show in the photo, but I don't know what you'd have to do to it to make it look like that. I will say my daughter doesn't want to get rid of it (not that she plays with it all that much) but I always want to because every time I try to stick the battery pack inside I'm pretty sure my blood pressure goes up.Maybe a different version of the toy without long hair would be okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer movie, but even better, AWESOME music soundtrack","review":"after everything's been said or written about this movie, that's the one part I felt I must highlight; the music for this movie was credited to Carpenter, and in the DVD format, it just rocks, just gives the speakers a serious workout. For a 1970s movie, or for any decade, for that matter, it's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASSAULT AND BATTERY EQUALS ENTERTAINMENT","review":"Imagine a abondened police station, with only a few oxxupants, and little ammunition, taking on a youth gang. It's an explosive, edge of your seat horror movie, a guarenteed good time for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a place in a good video collection","review":"When this came out in 1976, it was regarded as one of the most shocking depictions of nihilistic violence ever made. Of course, it doesn't seem like that now, and the convicts who help the isolated cop fight off the youth gang actually seem like heart-of-gold softies rather than dangerous killers. The interracial youth gang's blood pact, the shooting of the girl with the ice-cream and the attack with silenced weapons are still pretty scary, and the movie holds your attention to the end. The music is rather effective, if very 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly a B movie, prolly B minus.","review":"Face it fan boys, if this didn't have the name 'John Carpenter' there'd be nothing to love. Everything about this movie is sub par. That's not always a bad thing though. Most B movies are sub par and some of them are great anyway. This one isn't great though. It's barely watchable though and so it gets two stars. MST3K would have plenty here to make fun of. The bad guys walking around as if in a trance, the cheesy synth soundtrack, the horrible script, the lackluster acting, and the unbelievable premise, all conspire to make this a B minus movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"About average for Carpenter","review":"ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) Directed, written, scored and edited byJohn Carpenter.Starring Austin Stoker, Charles Cyphers, Nancy Loomis and HenryBrandon.An early crime film by Carpenter about a Los Angeles police stationabout to close down and with a skeleton crew that finds itself undersiege by a large(and unlikely interracial) street gang with high poweredweapons. Not brilliant. Flawed in that way nearly all of Carpenter'sfilm are. Vaguely wince inducing dialogue. Still. An entertainingcrime film and an inoffensive time killer.And yes THAT Henry Brandon who played Barnaby in BABES IN TOYLAND andFu Manchu in DRUMS OF FU MANCHU!!!This was apparently remade recently!! I imagine with CGI gangmembers??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like \\"Rio Bravo,\\" but with machine guns!","review":"This is one of the coolest of John Carpenter's films.The plot: Gang of criminals with silenced machine guns plan to wreak havoc on Los Angeles. They attack a local police station. However, this police station is deserted except for a lone cop and a couple of secretaries. The group must try to survive in the abandoned station against the unstoppable onslaught of the criminals outside! Any action fan like myself can enjoy a scene in which the station is shot to bits without the slightest hint of sound. The weapons are silenced so you hear no shots. You just see windows break, papers fly off of desks, and a man's chest explodes into bloody mist. Great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cult Classic","review":"For me it isn't quite a four star film, but its nearer to that than 3 stars. Effectively its a remake of Rio Bravo, restaged in contemporary Los Angeles. For those not familiar with Rio Bravo, a Sheriff and some friends are holed up in his office fighting off an attacking gang.There are reasons to criticise it. Some of the acting is really awful and nothing can ever hide that. However its directed by John Carpenter at a time when he only made good and sometimes all-time classic movies (Halloween followed this two years later). The pacing, camera-work and action are all first class. Carpenter also contributed the original music. This is one of his very best pieces of music, very sinister, and I'm sure that it contributes a lot to the overall atmosphere of the film.My view is that its a flawed classic, that you'll either love or hate. The fact that they bothered to remake it three years ago indicates that it must have had some good qualities. Watch it and find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOTTA SMOKE?","review":"One of Carpenter's earliest films 'Assault on Precinct 13' is an early attempt of a future going crazy story like 'Mad Max' or 'Escape From New York.' Set in the not so distant future, (the film was made in '76) all the gangs of L.A. have united into a huge organization and stolen a large supply of weapons. With the police on red alert, a soon to be shut down station comes under siege and a single cop, some death row prisoners, and a secretary are forced to defend the building from seemingly countless gangsters. The plot is paper thin, but fast paced, gun toting action and an intense score by Carpenter compensate well. Casting was done well though I only found one character (Wilson) truely relatable. But 'Assault on Precinct 13' is a story meant to be just enjoyed, not intensively dwelt on. So if your looking for a good time without having to strain your brain, this flick is definitely worth a check."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon Wilson; Genesis of Snake Plissken?","review":"Everyone else has already mentioned the paralells between \\"13\\" and Rio Bravo and Night of the Living Dead...but...hasn't anyone else noticed the striking similarities between Napoleon \\"got a smoke?\\" Wilson and Snake \\"\\"got a smoke?\\" Plissken. Its all there; the cynicism, the minimal dialogue and the antihero we love to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the action genre's best with loads or humor.","review":"A group of Los Angeles gangs attack a police station with only a lone police officer, two secretaries, and two inmates to oppose them. The action comes fast with humor an excellent and atmospheric score by writer/director John(Halloween, The Thing, In the Mouth of Maddness) Carpenter. One of his best films."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING CARPENTER FILM. ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVES.","review":"THIS FILM HOLDS UP WELL IN ITS RUTHLESS DEPICTION OF RANDOM GANG TERROR. A GREAT STORY TOLD WELL WITH STYLE AND VISION. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE POORLY GIVEN THE PLOT, BUT IT TOOK A CARPENTER TO TAKE A LUMP OF CLAY AND MOLD IT INTO A FINE CERAMIC. THEY SHOULD RE-RELEASE THIS ONE. I THINK IT WOULD DO VERY WELL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best of B-Movies out there","review":"Howard Hawks, John Carpenter. Rio Bravo, Assault on Precinct 13. That's what it boils down to. John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 acknowledges the influence that Howard Hawks had for him. Carpenter did a truly memorable job as a director with a truly low budget: $100,000. This is pure action, more than the norm for 1976. Some might say it's Carpenter's best film.The DVD is pretty much available to buy online. It's not overpriced, the film is a good copy, widescreen, with an actual trailer. John Carpenter also has a feature-length commentary on the film. All in all, the DVD is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic that SHINES on Blu-ray","review":"I won't burden you with a full-length review of the film, or the rise and fall of the gang \\"Street Thunder\\". I will say that this is easily the best presentation of Carpenter's classic yet. With the exception of a few very grainy, barely-improved scenes, the film film is absolutely crystal clear, and surely looks better than it did in the theater. Most notable flaws is the opening scene, and a couple inside the Anderson precinct that look so lousy, they look out of place compared to the quality of the rest of the film.It also includes an old (but great) Carpenter commentary, an old Q&A; with JC and Austin Stoker, and an isolated track for Carpenter's excellent, creepy score. I can't give this five stars because the picture isn't perfect in a few spots. But overall, it's great, and if you're a fan, do not hesitate to pic up this 70s gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD","review":"This is an awesome album.

Im too lazy right now to pull out this album and give you a track by track review, but this album is a MUST HAVE for any hip-hop conisseur.

The products arrived promptly and were well made, but they did not fit on the seats. The write up claims that the cushion \\"...easily slips over your seat and is held on with heavy duty elastic straps.\\" No matter how I tried the straps (which are not adjustable) would not go around the base of the seats and could not be secured. Bayliner has the same seats in many of its smaller bowriders and sells lots of boats. I don't know what make or model these were designed for, but my guess is that they won't fit most boats or lounge type back-to-back seats. Bottom line... great idea, but bad execution.

The album starts off with the title song and it doesn't stop moving from there. Their sound is and will always be the straight ahead hard rock of the 80's hair metal days. To say that Christian music hadn't seen anything like them is an under statement. I remember being around 12 years old hearing about these long haired, make up wearing, yellow and black spandex wearing people that threw out New Testament bibles at their concerts and thinking I have to check this out! Each and every song is good and has that mid 80's heavy metal sound that was copied and recopied by many bands. If you enjoyed the 80's hair metal days pick up this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best!!","review":"This is THE quintessential Stryper album. Every song on here is well written, heart felt, and touching. Michael Sweet is one of the best vocalists of our time. Oz Fox is an amazing guitar player. From rockers such as the title track and Makes Me Wanna Sing to ballads like First Love and Together As One, this album has it all. If you don't own any Stryper albums and want to give them a try, this is one of their best and a great one to start with. Highly recommended!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Stryper ever put out. Hard and powerful....","review":"This CD is pure, original Stryper from the good old days before the group abandoned it's powerful message. I believe the title track to be the band's best - a combination of powerful lyrics and hard pounding bass and guitars. Notice the way the band is able to keep the guitars together - something you rarely find in rock this hard. \\"He is the Rock that makes me Roll\\" (Track 4) is similarly great.

I had to stop helping customers and fast forward everytime the song came on. And to think some of the reviewers here bought the cd for that song! This is like listening to someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard for an hour. The singer sounds like a midget is jumping up and down on his stomach while he sings. This is nothing like the Cure as reviews say. The Cure is one of my favorite bands and I don't recall getting a headache listening to Robert Smith.

One great track follows after another. Best songs include the single \\"Bandages\\", \\"Naked in the City Again\\", \\"No Not Now\\", \\"Talk to Me, Dance with Me\\", and \\"Aveda\\".Needless to say, HHH does not find any airplay on radio stations, but (this is an old tired song), it is telling about the state of radio. Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Mess Wit The Heat","review":"some idiots write bad reviews about their songs bein' all the same, but that's BS. The beats are all different and kick ass.

It is impossible to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Strokes and White Stripes ... here comes some fun!","review":"With lo-fi garage revivalism storming the airwaves, this latest offering by this Victoria, Canada outfit ought not be missed. Sounding like a hybrid of the Strokes and the White Stripes combined with generous helpings of The Kinks and Buzzcocks -- hell, even the playful side of The Cure thrown in for good measure, this is one fun album that makes for a breath of fresh air from all the aggro \\"rebel without a clue\\" posturing of so many rock acts today. With a quirky sound and droll lyrics, songs like \\"Get In or Get Out\\", \\"Bandages\\", \\"Oh, Godamnit\\", \\"Talk to Me, Dance With Me\\" and \\"Save Us, S.O.S.\\" are winners in my book.

Most certainly my favorite album of the last two years or so.As I listen to them, I'm reminded of a lot of the great, subversive, bouncy pop of the late 70's and 80's like Joe Jackson, Elvis Costello, Oingo Boingo, and others, but thankfully I never feel like they're ripping anyone off. OK, there is one riff on one song that sounds exactly like a riff from a mid-80's Iggy Pop song, but I'm willing to forgive that.Anyway - fantastic stuff this. Forget their earlier, pre-guitar player material. I think the band themselves would agree that this album is where they hit their stride in a big, bold way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare combination of humour and erudition, a must read","review":"Fiona Pitt-Kethley has a rare talent for bringing the ruins of antiquity to life, allowing us to see them in a completely new light. Moreover, she is endowed with a superior sense of humour, that includes the most difficult one to achieve, self-addressed humour. Someone might be turned off by her declared interest in casual sex (and probably many people cannot yet accept a woman speaking in such terms), but her adventures are always painted with light and humorous brush strokes. And everybody that has been in the scene, knows that, before you meet a prince, you must kiss many frogs. I have greatly appreciated both her descriptions of antiquities, the classical world and of the few things that are known about the Sibyls, as well as her descriptions of many typical italian males (which, being italian myself, I can certify are very much to the point). A highly recommended book, provided you can read between the lines"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spunky collection","review":"In this spunky companion volume to Wayward Women (her book about women travel writers through history), Robinson collects the global travels of women like Lady Mary Wortley Montague, Karen Blixen, Freya Stark and Jan Morris.

Some of their CD's are nothing more than vinyl rips and I've heard they'll even use a cassette tape if they can't acquire the original master tapes. Don't know about this one but I've bought enough of their CD's to know it's a gamble. The last one I got only because I forgot to check the record label. It had a \\"Finger nails across a chalkboard effect\\" I got a headache that stuck with me for a couple of hours. Only listened to two tracks, I had to turn it off it was so bad.

It is a shame that they where over looked. Most of the Ripping Corpse crew went on to do greater things such as the guitarest Erik Rutan who was in Morbid Angel and now has his own group called Hate Eternal.

The meat-iness of her mellifluous voice practically stopped the crowd in their tracks even though they were all dancing to begin with. I stood and stared and thought, that woman should be dancing with me.... and she did... a little. Anyway, if you want to hire an amazing artist to fill a room with a voice that will stick with the listeners long after they have left the venue, then Vanessa Trouble [sic] is the girl (woman) for you.

I don't generally like reviews that tell the entire story so I won't be one of those reviewers that do that, just take my word and give this great book a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Haven't read it myself but my teenage daughter loved 'Looking for Alaska' and stayed up all night to finish it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for alaska","review":"I really liked the book but I had so many questions at the end and just wanted Alaska to come back and answer them all for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Touching and extremely fulfilling.

John Green is AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I bought this book (along with Paper Towns and Fault in our Stars) after watching a few episodes of the Vlogbrothers. The only thing I knew about this book was that the main character read the last words of famous people, and let me tell you that this was probably the best choice I have ever made. This book rekindled my love in books, and for that Thank you John Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaningful Book.","review":"I really thought this book was good. I enjoyed every page, and i thought the quotes from other books was a very nice touch. Green did an awesome job on the ending it was very deep and a lesson in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, lazy ending","review":"I had to get this book after reading all the rave reviews, but I have to be honest: the story has a strong set up and message, but a really lazy follow-through. The ending is very very rushed and almost meaningless and the last half of the book is pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre ...at best","review":"This book is not very good. Every word seems calculated and is technically \\"right\\" but I found myself not caring about these characters.There is a distinct lack of depth to these characters and we never get to see below the surface. Reading this book is like watching a talented boxer dance beautifully around the ring, but never throw a punch. Something seems to be missing. It moves along in an obvious way, sort of like a new TV show, and its structure is representative of what passes for art in the 21st century, but it left me cold. I want so much more than a tepid, quirky, cleverly concocted story like this. It seems to have been written with a particular audience and a particular batch of critics in mind. The overall tone of the book is very smug, while pretending not to be. I think Green has some talent, but I think he should stop writing what everybody wants him to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to pass the time.","review":"Looking for Alaska was a revetting and touching story. It show what every child or young adult goes through in a stage of his/her life. Miles story of his life at boarding schools is both funny and emotional. My favorite feature in this book is that most of the adults that appear in the book are more like real people then those who just want to make a teens life miserable. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy a good book about a teen facing tragedies and gaining friendship from unexpected places, you won't want to put it down until you have read the whole thing. This is a good read and was well written, a must read for all teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no farther for a good story","review":"Great book, great story. A writer that we will see more of and this is a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is great. I couldn't put it down. Looking for Alaska makes you think about the problems with alcohol and what it can do to you. Also it makes you think about others and not just yourself. The ending of the book is sad but makes you aware of life. I have read a lot of good books but this one tops them all! Read this book, it wont be a waste of your time. Thanks John Green for such a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Maybe I'm just too old to be reading this book, but I didn't find it particularly intriguing or interesting. I had high expectations for the book because I kept seeing people quote lines from it all over the internet, but I definitely could have gone without reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but...","review":"I'll skip the synopsis as well as the gushing over John Green's good writing and just say that in my opinion he IS 'over-glorifying' the constant use of cigarettes and booze by the young teenagers that are his characters. I know for a fact that there are many teens who get along just fine without smoking and drinking all the time - and some, hardly ever, or not at all. I don't think those habits added to the development of the characters, and certainly diminished their lives. As for the sex well, it IS a coming of age book. But again, to give the impression that this is 'average' young adult behavior and therefore acceptable - give me a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Alaska","review":"Good teen read, energetic and fast paced and holds the readers interest! Green does again what he does best and writes great stories for young people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cry, laugh, learn","review":"John Green is genius. All nerd fighters as well as anyone who has read his novels will recognize this. Looking for Alaska is my favorite work of his, he captures what it is to be a teenager and connects to four (arguably five) characters that will take you for an emotional roller coaster. With an ending that is, well, tear-jerkingly hilarious..

It set the pace as well as the mood, so perfect for a coming-of-age novel. This book has all the elements - friendship, family, loss, grief, guilt, coping through it all.The story is indeed heavy but just the same, the author was able to lighten it with splashes of youth - things that teens think, say and do that make adults like myself (and like at least 2 of the adult characters in the book) shake our heads while smiling secretly.This just goes to say that we were also teens once - we've all been there, we've all done that. But now it's the younger set's turn to discover and we must let them be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for older teens and adults","review":"Miles Halter aka \\"Mr. Famous Last Words Guy\\" aka \\"Pudge\\" goes to a private boarding school in Alabama in search of the Great Perhaps. Together with his roommate \\"the Colonel\\" and a girl named Alaska, he discovers friendship, love, and the value of a truly great prank. The novel spans 273 days--136 before and 136 after. To reveal the event the novel revolves around would be a spoiler. I laughed, and I cried. I highly recommend this book for older teens and adults, but not for middle school readers due to mature subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Im not sure I've ever related to a character as much as pudge, or ever wanted to get to know a character as much as Alaska.Instead of chapters, the book uses a number \\"days before\\", which will drive you crazy trying to figure out what it is.

Not alot of feeling was felt for the characters, you just never really knew them. There were no troughs and peaks through the story, and the ending was left open. Sure I filled 4 hours of time.....wasn't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other ones...","review":"I think John Green is a good writer, but I've read three of his books now and they all feature the same sort of characters (a boy in love with a girl, the girl is a bit of a ingenue, a nerdy male side-kick friend). A lot of his stories also feature pranks and references to literature. I liked Paper Towns and A Fault in Our Stars, but this book was a bit more tedious for me to read. It took me a couple of days. I didn't find myself caring about the characters that much. The person I liked most was Mr. Hyde and he is a secondary character. I think I am going to take a little break from Mr. Green's work. It is still good, it still deserves awards, but I just need a bit of distance from it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review from MajiBookshelf Blog","review":"I heard great things about this book, so when we saw it in the library, we decided to borrow it. Unfortunately, I didn't see what was so great about this book after all. Just wasn't my cup of tea.Miles goes to boarding school to find his \\"Great Perhaps\\" and then meets some kids. He becomes friends with them, crushes on one of them, and they all mess around causing trouble.The whole time I was reading, I was asking myself, \\"Why am I reading about a couple of school kids messing around?\\". There wasn't a point to the story until \\"after\\" something happened, which happens more than halfway through the book.The \\"after\\" part does stir some things up and kind of makes the book interesting. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't talk much about the \\"after\\" event. It was a shock, and held great meaning towards the end, but overall I was just disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Change","review":"I was somewhat dubious upon reading Looking For Alaska's despcription--it sounded like a tired story that had already been done. But one chapter into the book, I was completley hooked. John Green masterfully tells the story of Miles \\"Pudge\\" Halter, a somewhat geeky, rather antisocial sixteen-year-old who has never dared to do anything more exciting than memorize \\"last words.\\"This ingenious novel is as well-written as it is humorous and introduces believable teenage characters with memorable personalities. The book is not sutiable for teens under fourteen due to sexual refrences and strong language, but it appeals to both genders and a wide range of ages.Parents who are concerned about the drinking, smoking, and sex should understand that it is not portrayed favorably and there are several \\"lessons\\" cleverly woven in throughout the novel. I strongly recommend you read Looking For Alaska: you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll lose yourself in the incredible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOB STORY","review":"I hopped on the John Greene train and hopped off after reading this trainwreck. I admit, though cheesy, I enjoyed part one of the novel. Then whoa, part 2, what happened? That just wasn't cool, part two. I actually cringed at the \\"rap battle\\" Pudge and the gang had. Cringed. Awful. I guess I'm too old for this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I'm almost embarrassed to say it because I am a fan of John Green's other books and I am a nerdfigther, but this book sucked. I knew what the general plot was going to be about a chapter into the book, the characters weren't great and it was painfully boring. His other books are great, especially Abundance of Catherines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time for me :(","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I think I might have been able to deal with the contents of the story more easily if the characters had been a bit older. I didn't like to read about such young people dealing with all the sex and drinking. Maybe I am really out of the loop on how things are, but I just didn't get into this story at all. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know to read. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Inappropriate for a School Library","review":"Due to the sections where the 2 main characters (male and female) are watching porn movies together and the comments she makes to instruct the teen boy and the sections on their rather graphic sexual experiences together, this book is VERY inappropriate for a school HS library.

I read this for a YA book group and couldn't tear myself away from the story of Miles Hunter and his entry into boarding school. I fell in love with the all the characters through Miles' narration, and longed for my own time at boarding school. Colonel cracked me up. Alaska broke my heart and I fell for her as easily as Miles did.Some members of my reading group found Looking for Alaska predictable, but I didn't see the plot taking the swerve it did. I wouldn't recommend this read for anyone under 14. The kids of Culver Creek drink, smoke, swear, and have sex; so if you want to shield yourself or your child from these topics in YA lit steer away. But for those of you looking for a smart, funny, heart-wrenching book you've come to the right place."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is so far the best book i have ever read! it makes you laugh and it makes you cry and by the end it is the best book EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaningful.","review":"At first, I wasn't sure I'd like this book, and I actually stopped reading it about page 50 and didn't pick it up again for another year. When I did, I read it all in one sitting, realizing my mistake. The character's were amazing, believable, and easy to relate to. They also had distinct personalities, and showed real emotion, which was the heart of this novel. It was hilarious, of course, but also sad and disturbingly touching. I loved the ending, becuase it left you with a laugh instead of a tear.Pudge was a great narrator, and I loved the Colonel as well. Alaska was an interesting and disturbing character, and even though I didn't relate to her or like her that much, I still felt for her, which is saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend it to all people of all age groups no matter what genre you enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, doesn't live up to the hype","review":"Having seen this book/quotes contained in this book/raves about this book EVERYWHERE, I bought it for myself. When reading Looking for Alaska in its entirety, however, it didn't exactly live up to my expectations. Certain passages and quotes, when pulled out and stood alone, are so beautiful and honest and poetic that it literally took my breath away BUT the book as a whole isn't like that. Still, I don't regret buying it. It's not a bad read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"Green's first novel, Looking for Alaska, was great.

I personally found Alaska to be annoying, but the writing was incredible good, so that outweighed me being uninterested in her character. I loved the last words part, and many other elements as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"John Green writes with a finesse that I believe no other author can truly ever embody. His novels bring great messages to their readers; this novel was no exception. Green writes with a tone that is both comical, yet deep; casual, yet serious. We all stand to learn something from the characters of Looking for Alaska; this book was truly awe inspiring, like no other. Looking for Alaska is a must read, and it will carry your heart on a journey with its magnificent characters who experience the heartbreak of a lifetime. And you will feel that heartbreak right along with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"I got this on a Monday and I was done with it by Thursday afternoon.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Alaska","review":"I happened to stumble across Looking for Alaska after finding John Green on the Internet. I think he's intelligent and entertaining in his video blogs done with his brother, but the fact that someone who is an Internet personality has written such a great novel, is a testament to his skill. I understand in people are using new ways to market themselves, and I think John Green has done a great job with that, but this book stands on its own.It had just the right amount of humor. A great read. I've since read a few of his other books and each is different, but none disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark but real","review":"This book was like a look into the mind of another person and realizing that we're not all these bright happy creatures.

Although as I reached the end of the 'before' section i was a bit cynical as I was unsure how the book could be finished, I was far from disappointed by the continued story and was, quite frankly, upset when it ended.Overall, thoroughly deserving of a 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have found Alaska!!!!!!!!","review":"Looking for Alaska is my favorite book EVER!!!!!!!!!! The characters are believeable, and relatable (I pictured each character as a person from my school because they act like people I've dealt with everyday) the story line is both fun, and bold, and kept me thinking for days afterward, each time I read it. Please read this book, it'll be the best thing you've ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"As a writer, I find that there are books that I can enjoy and then books that I simply wish I was good enough to have written; this book falls in the second category. I love John Green and everything he writes but this will forever be my favorite I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Alaska","review":"John Green is easily one of my favorite authors, and Looking for Alaska has gotten plenty of hype lately through the internet in the form of memorable quotes. This book, while not my favorite of his, is definitely a must-read. He taps into the true inner-workings of young adults and finds the words that angst-filled teenagers have been searching for. Bottom-line, this is another wonderful piece by John Green. I recommend this, and any other story by him, to all of my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"I liked this book a lot, but it did have some dragging moments where I had to force myself to sit down and read, but besides that great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read John Green","review":"John Green's books are fantastic. They are always funny yet thought provoking, and in the case of this book, heart breaking. I can honestly say that Looking for Alaska changed my life. Green's characters come to life, and in a very short novel leave you feeling less like you read a story, and more like you just experienced a part of someone's life. And on a sidenote, if you enjoy John's books, then you might just be a nerdfighter. Look up John Green and his brother Hank on youtube, especially on their channel, Vlogbrothers. If you like what you see, you should look up the numerous groups on the internet, such as the Nerdfighters of the Greater DC Area on facebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't do what I did...","review":"...and read this book in one sitting. Okay, it's short and incredibly good, which makes it easy to bolt down. But then you are going to feel like an idiot for not savoring the pleasure, and you're going to be bleary as hell the next day (if you finish it at 4 in the morning, like I did).This book deals with the Big Ones: suffering, loss, and grief, but it does so with such compassion and humor that the net impact is uplifting. Even the principal turns out to be a human being. There are no cardboard cut-out characters here.Be aware that the kids in this story do what kids actually do (smoke, drink, and have sex). If that bothers you, read it anyway. There are more important things in life than observing proprieties and pretending that bright kids aren't exploratory. You don't have to approve of these characters. It is enough to love them and learn from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"dragged on a bit","review":"this book is a very accurate portrayal of growing up bored out of your mind with nothing else to do but cause trouble. the characters are people you know and can connect with, though I could only connect with Alaska.

In addition, many characters proudly rebel against authority, have disdain for their elders, and one character's parents are alcoholics and physically abusive.This school is required reading at my local high school. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Fantasy Fiction","review":"While I'm sure my distaste for the novel stems mostly from my own PERSONAL experience, please do not behave ignorantly as I did and relate closely to the character of Miles Halter; blissful in the asinine fantasy that one can leave behind a school or place where they are \\"persona non grata\\" and enter a new place and make \\"BFF'S\\" within 5 minutes. I held on to the hope that Miles' story provides and was hit with the painful, brutal reality that real life is nothing like the reality this story portrays. Perhaps most readers have been a little more mature than I but I IMPLORE you, do not cling to these delusions that authors like John Green paint with colorful characters like Miles and the Colonel and Alaska because these types of people do not exist in the real world; rather they are the perfect, unattainable projections of our imagination.In short: Lovely Words; Disappointing meaning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch 70's power pop!","review":"Let's face it, the main reason to buy this CD set is the song, \\"Such A Woman.\\" I have looked for this title on CD since CD's came out, and only recently was finally able to find it. \\"Such A Woman\\" is clean, tight, power pop/rock at its finest. The recording is high quality and the mastering is flawless. The clip available on amazon.com is not indicative of the power of the song, however. It is a romantic, desperate, cry for a good woman. If you like Toto's \\"Hold The Line,\\" this song is in a similar vein in terms of guitars and harmonies. The rest of the music on the 2 (!)

People in an internet discussion group I belong to described it as a kind of poor man's Foreigner or Palbo Cruise (as if the poor man didn't already have Foreigner and Pablo Cruise!). The playing and singing is perfectly fine, but most of the songs just zipped past me without leaving any impression at all.The reason I'm posting this review, however, is to point out the fact that the single disc I received from the Marketplace listing did not include all the songs from the original two disc set.

For you parents that are truely concerned with what your children are listening to, I would say that this is a definitely positive, uplifting album that you may want to consider. As a bonus, It emphasizes the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is something that needs to be heard. I find it the best way to present the message of salvation to those that may be turned off with the three-piece suit and tie, crew-cut approach of presenting the good news to your kids. I know this from my own experiences as a metal-head, myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Christian Metal band ever!!

But songs like \\"Honesty\\" and \\"To Hell with the Devil\\" aren't metal classics, they're jokes that now sound hopelessly outdated. So do yourself a favor and leave heavy-metal to Satan."},{"rating":"1","title":"UMMMM???","review":"I remember it like it was yesterday, ... You see, I read all the great reviews ..., and figured it had to be great. And what's more, these guys were using their talents to glorify the lord God. However, I finally listened to the album on the way home in my car, and almost wrecked it. Why, you ask? Because I was driven to tears at how utterly bad this music was. I am convinced that Jesus Christ himself wept at the sound of Stryper. I feel sorry for the Lord because the only bands that glorify his name are generaly the worst bands in existence. If you really want to listen to redundant Christian lyrics, buy a DC Talk album because they don't disgrace the genre of Christian rock like STRYPER......

This is their best album, featuring the huge hit Honestly with Michael's high pitch vocals. The rest of the album is more straight forward metal, not really Christian lyrics all the time but condemning Satan. I picked up the Roxx Regime which contains Yellow and Black Attack and Honestly, and the only track better than Honestly on there is From Wrong to Right. Abyss the opener gets things going, a joke their not. With this album they have gotten rid of most of the 50s influences into a much more EMO Poison meets Slayer tongue in cheek Christian metal band with a humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD ALBUM","review":"This is a good album. It's not great, but it demonstrates what 80's glam metal was all about. Songs like \\"Free,\\" \\"Rockin' the World,\\" \\"Calling On You,\\" and \\"The Way\\" are very competent. Songs like \\"To Hell With The Devil,\\" \\"Honestly,\\" and \\"All Of Me\\" may be tough for some casual fans to stomach, though. Overall, this is 80's glam metal personified, cheesy but still cool in a sentimental way. Stryper's best album is their greatest hits collection \\"Can't Stop The Rock,\\" but for a regular album, this or \\"Soldiers Under Command\\" are the only two I really consider good. Whether you love or hate Christian Rock, \\"To Hell With The Devil\\" is at least worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok, but black sabbath is much better","review":"i would recommend you save your money on this album and pick up dio or marilyn manson instead. they rock harder and their message is more positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still havn't got my record yet!","review":"The only reason I'm giving a bad review is because I still havnt got my item yet that I ordered more than a month ago.

Instead, the book was more of a personal narrative; a collection of the author's personal experiences in teaching her own son how to play, and excerpts of notes written by her child's therapists.

Forgive me if I am wrong but I thought that pastors spoke with the leading of the Holy Spirit...does not Jesus say not to worry about what to say because the Spirit will talk through you.

Although they managed to land a total of five songs on the US singles chart only one of those, \\"Don't Let Him Know,\\" was able to crack the top 50 were it peaked at #39 in the late winter/early spring of 1982. If that song is even remembered today at all it is as the subject of trivia as it was written by one Bryan Adams who himself would make a big splash on the arena rock circuit during much of the mid 80's beginning about a year and a half later.It is difficult to imagine anyone getting too terribly excited about this stuff at this late date, but if this is still your sort of thing, here you are.

I can't even comment on the music because the format is so flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the purest albums I've ever heard","review":"Released in 1983, 'Speaking In Tongues' is Talking Heads in their most creative and purest form. With Brian Eno gone from the producer's seat, the band could really project their sound without his \\"meddling.\\" This also marks where David Byrne started to take control (luckily Speaking In Tongues is a full cohesive band effort, not a Byrne solo project).Opening with the big hit 'Burning Down The House,' we have one of the best albums in the past 20 years. The dancy and quirky 'Making Flippy Floppy' and 'Girlfriend Is Better' to the bass-heavy boogie of 'Swamp' make this the Heads' overall best effort (with 'Remain In Light' coming in a close second). Very cohesive and pure effort from one of New York's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most unique recordings of the century.","review":"In my opinion, this is the greatest Talking Heads record. It contains elements from their past recordings as well as elements apparent in thier future recordings.

This record will quickly become one of your favorates."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"I don't know what David Byrne was thinking when he put this together. Meaningless lyrics, funky sounds, and annoying vocals are not what I find entertaining.

I was amazed the CD even came with lyricsWhat kind of a track is called \\"Making Flippy Floopy\\" anyway?I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talking Heads Finally Put All The Pieces Together","review":"This is the Talking Heads' finest album because this is the one that strikes a perfect balance between the pop sensibilities displayed on \\"Talking Heads \`77\\" and \\"More Songs About Buildings And Food\\", and the adventurous experimentalism of \\"Fear Of Music\\" and, especially, \\"Remain In Light\\". On \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" the best elements of all that came before gel into a stunning, delicious, exquisite work that manages to be simultaneously complex, deep, infectious, incredibly catchy, and profoundly fun.

From Burning Down the House on down, this is in many respects the band's masterwork. It lacks the cuteness of later stuff like Wild Wild Life, and it is a step ahead of even the really powerful Remain in Light album.

I've listened to this album about three times, the second and third listens were because I felt I didn't give the disc enough of a chance. I'm a huge Queen fan, but listening to this album in its entirety is a challenge. Freddie's vocals are second-rate, and most of the songs are edited (which may actually be a good thing).Queen were a great live band, as proved by the 1979 Live Killers, but Live Magic is a pretty poor album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but...","review":"Queen Magic tour was amazing!If you want a good live CD you should by the Wembley Live.This cd was recorded in Budapest and the sound is not always good...Good for collection only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is the perfect example of how not to release a live album. Virtually all of the tracks have been edited (better word, massacred.)

It makes no sense as a proper double album from this tour (\\"Live at Wembley 86\\") was released a few years before. To make money perhaps? Nah, would a record company ever be driven by profits?Unless you are a Queen completist, avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Queen!","review":"Well Queen has made a pretty good Live Magic album, but the only problem is that many of the songs are composed differently than they are on the Greatest Hits album.

Enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen, \\"live\\" and abridged","review":"It's true that many of the songs are abridged (shortened) on this \\"live\\" show release, but that didn't bother me like some reviewers on here.

I am sure that I missed much of that meaning. However, one aspect of it is painful clear. The crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation. I found that premise disturbing and unrealistic. Also, it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex. If so, this movie could contribute, in a small way, to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof.Watch this movie if you must, but be critical of its assumptions about male/female relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I looking for something not there?","review":"As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who \\"ruined\\" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility?

But college girl is not attracted to Bad Guy, who, by the way, never talks in the whole movie. And college girl already has a boyfriend. So, through a complicated scheme, Bad Guy is able to have her work in his brothel. Poor college girl is now a prostitute. But Bad Guy continues to be infatuated with her, and sees her work through a one way mirror. And this infatuation will let college girl eventually get the upper hand and (sort of) get even.

For a more mellow sound, I recommend Real, but for the true Stryper fan, Truth is a must have. Ex-Bass player Tim Gaines, and Ex-Guitarist Oz Fox, formed Sin Dizzy after their departure from Stryper.

I don't know if Jeri Ryan had some martial arts training before (she has played Sonya from Mortal Kombat), but I'm pretty sure that was her in most scenes and she looked skilled.My favorite moment was at 32:45 when Seven discovers who she is fighting...I had a feeling it was going down like that :\\\\"},{"rating":"2","title":"I now pronounce you Man and Machine","review":"I really love episodes that have some sort of bartering with junkers and eccentric folk, I think it's because it reminds me of Star Wars or Firefly. You know it has that rugged, lived-in, space-outback vibe going on.The major focus is Tom in this episode and most of the plot also has to do with his relationship with B'Elanna (and another mystery woman). This type of story is not new to Sci-Fi or Trek, but I really like what they did with it here in the Voyager universe. It's solid writing; and I rather liked the guest actress, she was quite natural and her personification was fun to watch. I stamp my SEAL OF APPROVAL, for whatever that's worth. Enjoy Sci-Fi Junkies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"But so sad that it has ended. Voyager is my personal favorite, so I may be a bit biased.

I was excited to see is was available for download. But the video quality is not DVD quality. There is a part where it gets colored boxes all over the screen and the audio gets allot of static. Its not for long but its annoying enough to where you cant focus on what they are saying. It happens on the download as well as streaming. The quality is nowhere near as good as when I use to watch the show on TV. So great story, but only two stars because of the video quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst, SIMPLY the worst","review":"I own and cherish every other season of Voyager, except for this season. I literally found myself bored and nauseated by the writing, the characters, the clichés, and the pointless introduction of the \\"Borg Children\\" which made no sense dramatically and when the much improved Season 7 rolled around, they quickly jettisoned them. There were 2 great episodes (one being Voyager Conspiracy and Unimatrix Zero) but out of 24, not great odds. Adding to this the horrible return of the beloved Kes, this season they had a different producer at the helm and lack of writer Brannon Braga, and MY GOD does it show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my gosh I hate this episode","review":"Of all the Voyagers I have watched to date, this is by far the worst.

She could have snapped his neck by looking at him.There isn't enough space on the entire web for me to go through all the problems with this episode. It's like they fired the entire writing staff and let the neighbor's kids write for the day.Oh man. I hated this episode.

It's an important episode to set up future events, but I can't quite bring myself to buy into the premise. Even if they aren't interested in the children, the idea that the Borg would simply abandon the cube seems absurd. They would at the very least cause it to self destruct to eradicate the virus and prevent \\"inferior\\" species from accessing their technology. Also, what happened to the cube at the end? Would Captain Janeway really just leave it there when they could probably salvage all sorts of technology from it? Hint: transwarp coil.

A filler episode before the big bang that is the season finale, standard procedure in Star Trek. Some people might watch this and hate it, but others like me will still find it entertaining enough. Either way it could be skipped if you want to hurry up and get to the season finale, you wouldn't miss much. It's basically Neelix telling a spooky story the Borg kids about why Deck Twelve is off limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"It seems people either loved this book or not. I fall into the later category. The premise is fantastic, but the execution is weak. Lebbon's new style of writing tries to mimic Tom Piccirilli and T. M. Wright, but doesn't come anywhere close. What took Lebbon over 300 pages to write should have been a 100 page novella. Yes, there are a few great and original moments, but I think this book should have been in the fantasy section, not horror. It was as scary as an episode of Seinfeld."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 150 pages","review":"Tim certainly starts well -- I read FACE and his collection of short stories -- but he seems to end up padding the novels (FACE) and then just ending them without tying up the loose ends.DESOLATION started out really interesting, but then nothing really happens. And then nothing really happens. And then it takes 10 pages for a character to leave the apt and walk downstairs and outside...and nothing really happens. So I started skimming. Then skipping pages. Then I gave up about page 150.I think Tim's short stories/novellas are great because they are more or less \\"short\\" and it seems he feels the need to pad the novels to make them longer. At any rate, I'll keep \\"trying\\" his books because I think sooner or later, he'll hit a home run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raving for Ravens","review":"This was a Christmas gift and it exceeded my expectations.

Kerry's genius comes out on this CD. I brought it in its original vinyl form, and after listening to it one time, immediately went to the store and bought them out and gave copies to all of my friends. And now 20 years later, I still listen to it regularly. I think I can do all of the guitar riffs on my air guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change for the better","review":"I first purchased \\"Seeds\\" back in 1981 or 82,on vinyl.Being a Kansas fan back then,I was interested to hear what Kerry would sound like,minus the influence of the rest of the band.I wasn't a Christian then,but enjoyed his effort none the less.In 1991 when I gave my life to Christ,the album (lyrically speaking)took on a whole new meaning.If you love Jesus,and enjoy the 70's/80's rock sound,I think you will like this album.The tracks, \\"Ground Zero\\"and \\"Mask of The Great Deceiver\\"sound like classic Kansas,but with a decidedly Christian message.After his departure from Kansas,Kerry formed a band named A.D. The album \\"Time Line\\" is right up there with \\"seeds of Change\\",both musically,and lyrically.Sometime around 1992 Sparrow Records released a 2 tape set entitled \\"Decade\\",which has all of both \\"Seeds\\"and \\"Time Line\\",plus a whole tape of some of his other work from \\"A.D.\\".Some really good instrumentals.Worth the effort if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the Seminal Volume of Progressive Christian Rock!!","review":"This album is a milestone in rock music's evolution. Longtime KANSAS lead guitarist, Kerry Livgren, teamed with such rock luminaries as Jethro Tull drummer, Barriemore Barlow and Black Sabbath leadman, Ronnie James Dio to produce this one-of-a-kind classic. Far from being simply another rock 'n' roll rehash of tired Gospel themes, this work brings all of the lyrical freshness and musical innovation that made Kansas an international rock-music headliner. Livgren wrote all of the songs and serves in various capacities on the various tracks. If you liked Kansas' \\"Dust In The Wind\\", you'll LOVE Kerry Livgren's \\"Seeds of Change\\"!Another Review by:Michael Patrick King, author ofConfessions of a Rock 'n' Roll Wannabe: The Verse and Prose of Michael Patrick King: Volume One"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison to Kerry's work with KANSAS!","review":"I absolutely LOVED Kerry's brilliant songwriting and guitar playing with KANSAS, and I wanted to give this release the benefit of the doubt when listening to it twice. In short, this music is a far cry from the masterpieces and brilliant playing found on great 'albums' (CD's and MP3's now) like 'Leftoverture' and 'Point Of Know Return'. Listening to those MASTERFUL, 'tour de force' compositions, then going to 'Seeds Of Change' was a HUGE step-down in song quality and musicianship. It's like going from a Porsche or Ferrari to a Yugo! The songs on this release are quite lame in comparison to those aforementioned monstrous prog-rock opuses. That said, Kerry has a place in history for being in, and 'peaking' with one of the GREATEST rock bands, bar none, period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"As someone who enjoyed Kansas and Kerry's later Christian efforts in AD I was disappointed in this work. While I was much more conservative in what I considered Christian at that time, I still find it strange that Kerry, at a time when Dio was emphasizing satanically images he would want a brooding Dio singing \\"Live For The King.\\" The pain in his voice in this song makes you wonder who his king is. Down to the Core is a good song but the rest are mediocre at best and below his Kansas/AD standards IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Received the package ahead of schedule and the watch was packed very well to assure no damage came to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes","review":"In their pursuit of achieving God's design for their marriages, I would hope that readers would not follow the book's outlines alone.

Be warned- these are definitely off-road use only! Don't think you can get away with using these on road and not attract attention!!! I installed one set in a pair of driving lights and another in a set of fog lights, partially to test their performance in each, partially because that's just what I had. The fog's had a nice, wide beam but nevertheless reached much farther than the 55watt bulbs previously installed. The driving lights- well, they actually outshined even my 130 watt KC Daylighters!!!

So right now I'm debating to get another pair or go with another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am an avid mystery reader and was excited when the book arrived; but I found this story wanting. I was able to follow the story, but re-listening to chapters thinking I had missed something. I had some trouble understanding the motivation of the characters. There were many unanswered questions that tended to make the events unbelievable. I especially had difficulty with the character Snake; he was very unprofessional, and his actions in real life would have gotten him disbarred and probably arrested. The trial was contrived, I thought I was watching a Perry Mason show. The unnecessary filler was confusing, and another reason I re-listened thinking I had missed something. The dialogue was simplistic, so when advanced vocabulary was used it was glaringly out of place. After completing the book I had the feeling Mr Manchee had written 2 short stories and tried weave them into one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent design and quality","review":"My husband is so picky about his wallets.

A candid look behind the curtain of various creative minds, the listener hears their first-hand stories of inspriration. Interviewing such diverse people as sound designers at Skywalker Ranch where the Star Wars sound effects are done, how Dave Brubeck turned his crying baby's voice into a hit jazz tune, or how a delusional satire entrance essay won a student admission to his college of choice. This tape has 8 interviews only 2 or 3 of which had trouble holding my attention (mostly due to the interviewer, not the content). A great way to pass an hour in traffic or on the stair-master.If you enjoy listening to creative inspirational stories, check out the \\"Jerry Seinfeld On Comedy\\" CD where he reveals his inspiration on his own comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I just got back from a trip to Scotland--my first visit--and saw this film on the plane (Virgin Atlantic). Fabulous movie! I'm not Scots or a bicycler, but just loved it--beautifully filmed, wonderful acting, a great movie experience. I can't wait to get the DVD and watch it again with my family. Unfortunately I saw it on a small screen on the plane, but it was still terrific. The original soundtrack was also excellent. It was especially nice watching this on a trip to Glasgow, where it was filmed. Highly recommended for the cinematography, great acting, sensitive portrayal of Obree's depression, and the personal relationships that help him to succeed. Suitable for kids over about 8 or 10 in my opinion, one little bit with bad language (the f* word, said once). Very original film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope Obree got a lot of money for the rights","review":"As an active cyclist and fan of bicycle racing I was excited at one more motion picture about a bicycle racer. Viewing the film I was bothered by the trite elements. Was Obree ever a bicycle messenger? No. Did he ever put training wheels on \\"Old Faitful?\\" No. Did he fall off his bike when the officials red flagged him? No, he actually tried to run down the official standing in his way -- now that would have been a good cinematic device that would have been truly humorous.I hope Obree got a bundle of cash for the rights because the producers and directors made a mockery of his life and his personal struggle with a manic-depressive condition. If you really want to know about Obree and his life read his book which has the same name. It is a dark, yet inspriing, tale of the human struggle with demons inside his head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I am a cyclist and have been hearing about Graeme Obree for years. I am in awe of his physical accomplishments and understanding and sympathetic to his manic-depressive illness, as I have several family members who also suffer from this terrrible disease.

One of the worst movies that I have ever seen and it is such a shame, as Graeme Obree is truly a remarkable man."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a bicycle fanatic to enjoy this movie","review":"If you're looking for a feel-good fun and a highly pleasurable movie experience, then this is such a rare treat. With it's great cinematography, excellent acting and charming production values, I thoroughly enjoyed this subtle escape from the sad mainstay of the Hollywood-fiction-action-blockbuster. I'm not an avid cyclist so although I appreciate other comments about how this may have downplayed the full struggle Graeme Obree must have endured to achieve world-fame, I understand why the filmmakers had to strike this balance in order to make this delightful story accessible to a wider family audience. Thoroughly enjoyable and delightful spirit-lifting stuff !"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"SPIRITS SOARED\\"","review":"An earnest story of a Scotch amateur speed cyclist - Graeme Obree portrayed by Johnny Miller.

I've tried Sarah Lovett before and come away less-than-satisfied, but the Santa Fe setting of her Silvia Strange stories is just too seductive. I'm glad I was tempted back because this is an interesting and complicated book. A little gruesome, but interesting and complicated. The story has an early twist in that the murdered are violent sex offenders and the killer is a vigilante. In addition to following the ins and outs of the stories, we're challenged to examine how we feel about vigilante justice. There are some fairly extraordinary coincidences and some odd character development, but they are really incidental to the overall story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Books, Terrible Box....","review":"We love the books, but our 11 month old managed to take the yellow part of the snap off and stick it in his mouth!

As a Latvian cook, I can tell the author does not know real Latvian cooking. The best Latvian cookbook with authentic Latvian food is the one by Latvian women from Ontario Canada. The book is called Latvian Cooking. It has had 9 printings, so you know it is good. The Taste of Latvia cookbook has very weird recipes in it for Latvian food. Also it has editorial errors. For example, the recipe for Klingeris starts with \\" cups very warm milk\\". It does not specify how many cups. The recipe for Alexander cake is to make it in three layers. I have never made or seen one with 3 layers, not even in Latvia. It is always made with 2 layers. Also, the book is missing basic Latvian foods, like braised sauerkraut. Braised sauerkraut is a Latvian staple and no book on Latvian cooking is complete without it. I won't even go into her errors on Latvian history. The author would have been better off writing a cookbook from her own heritage. Latvian is definetly not her heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than just a taste of Latvia","review":"This book is filled with an array of recipes from yesterday and today, a newer Latvia. The pictures give you a taste of how creative and in love with the arts Latvians are. The folk songs are beautiful. As well as the symbols, and stories of yesterdays past. It is a great introduction into a mysterious culture that is very much alive, as well as unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste of Latvia","review":"Author Siri Lise Doub has thrown together her book \\"Taste of Latvia.\\" First of all the book was not proofrd nor edited. It shows the appearance of being thrown to gether. The Latvian words are printed correctly in others they are not. The carelesness shows that the author plucked recipes like she did with \\"dainas\\". I would be reluctant to test her recipes.

And they milked it. This CD is much more radio friendly and not as heavy as their earlier stuff, but still good. \\"Always There For You\\" was the big hit here. Between that and \\"Honestly\\" (from their last album), I was hooked on Stryper. \\"In God We Trust\\" is a comical song, if you think about it. It's a great song, but after their previous album they had to be richer than hell (pun intended). Oh the irony. \\"Keep The Fire Burning\\" & \\"Believe In You\\" are great tunes. \\"The World Of You & I\\" and \\"Lonely\\" are my two favorite tunes here. They are both have that ballad feel to them, but never fall into the sappy realm. I recommend this if you like their other stuff or if you liked 80's hard rock in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album ROCKS!","review":"I grew up on Stryper. This album is a must have for everyone who loves 80's Heavy Metal! In God We Trust, along with Soldiers Under Command, and To Hell With the Devil are their best albums. If you don't have any of these YOU NEED TO BUY THEM ALL, THEY ARE GREAT! Stryper was the first christian band I ever listened to and they changed my view of music. Buy In God We Trust Today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent album!","review":"Stryper was simply a band that rose to the passion to ROCK FOR GOD when it probably wasn't cool in rock music... Glad they made the effort! I listened to this in the 80's and have the pleasure of letting my children experience the 'rockin' heart pounding sensation this band thrived to put out... Thank you Stryper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold Certified","review":"This was the second of two gold albums by Christian metal kings Stryper and the follow up to platinum certified To Hell With the Devil, usually regarded as the band's best album. I would put this fourth on the tier of the greatness to their whole career, just behind the Yellow & Black Attack at number three but a notch above Soldiers Under Command. By this point they were a veteran act after starting in the local Hollywood scene. Key tracks are the title song, Always There for You and Lonely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stryper - In God We Trust","review":"\\"In God We Trust\\" (1998) is the fifth album from Christian glam metal band Stryper. This is vintage Stryper - yellow and black spandex, huge perms, and Michael Sweet singing like a woman.\\"In God We Trust\\" embraces the corny, poppy, catchy side of glam metal. It's incredibly cheesy, and almost every song has a memorable, get-in-your-head chorus. Almost certainly Stryper was making a move toward the mainstream.If that's what you're looking for, you could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album for die hard fans or collectors only","review":"I have always thought Stryper was a very good band. Not because of their supposed message or beliefs, but because they really are good musicians. I know this album has mostly received bad reviews & a lot of accusations about selling out. The bottom line is IGWT is a lousy album in comparison to their prior & later albums. There are only two songs that come close to rocking. The title track & The Reign. The latter being harder but the former being the better. But neither of them have the feel of their earlier rock tracks. Even the ballads on the album lack the feel of their predecessors. The majority of the songs on IGWT are mid tempo that lack any real luster or direction. The only positive to having this album is if it completes your collection. Otherwise unless you are just a diehard Stryper fan, I would not recommend wasting your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated, stick with Soldiers or Against the Law!!!","review":"I really dont understand why this album got so many good reviews... dont get me wrong I like Stryper, they are a very talented band and they have a unique style that they can call their own, but the songwriting on IGWT is just not as good as what is found on their other releases. Also there's very little 'Metal' on this album, just a bunch of 'cheesy' power-ballads and a couple of nervous-rockers that lack any feel or power. The Production is very good and the album went gold, riding on the coat-tails of their previous outing \\"To Hell with the Devil\\". Still, everyone with a brain knows that you cant judge an album on sales figures alone! The theme of the album also seems hypocritical considering the band's then current financial status. Honestly guys (pun intended), where's the beef?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for rock fans who are into quality vocals!","review":"This album is the pinacle for Stryper, who, from their 1st album to this one, have been awesome from the git-go, and have yet managed to improve. Stryper excels with lead vocals from Michael Sweet, backed up superbly with supporting vocals from Oz, Robert, and Tim Gaines. The guitars are timed perfectly together, and, true to rock nature, are hard hitting. There is some very great riff work in there, also. Michael Sweet has an incredible talent for songwriting, and a vocal range that's outta this world. This album is money well spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stryper now sounds like another MTV-friendly pop band.","review":"After the peak of \\"To Hell With the Devil\\" Stryper appeared by this stage to have lost its direction. While \\"In God We Trust\\" has its moments (check out \\"Always There For You\\" \\"Keep the Fire Burning\\" and \\"The Writings On the Wall\\") the album simply lacks the guts, drive and in your face stomp-factor that had become a Stryper trademark. While not a patch on \\"To Hell With the Devil\\" die-hard Stryper fans will doubtless love this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Stryper Masterpiece","review":"This was Stryper's final album with their classic yellow and black costumes. Their next album would bring a complete change of both their clothing and their musical styles. In God We Trust is typical of the classic Stryper tunes we all learned to love. This album is a must have for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like I expected","review":"Sorry guys, can't agree.

Solid, memorable guitar solos, well produced, excellent drums, and although derivative of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young as well as Queen, very catchy and enduring music. Strong lyrics and clever form make this an album that I never tire of listening. The CD rearranges the songs with a favorable result. The only song that I would have improved is Guitar Hero sincve the solo never steps out of the box, so to speak. Then again, it is a snarky satire of the proverbial guitar hero of the 70's and probably was supposed to stay mediocre as a statement. All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. After I lost my first LP, the songs kept ringing in my head for decades until I was lucky enough to find this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive shoe","review":"This is a great little shoe for dressy evenings out.

If you're looking for a quick read, well, I didn't find it here. It takes time to properly digest her writing. Also, if you're looking for a \\"cookbook\\" guide to becoming a mystic, this isn't it. Where mystical books range from the purely scholarly (say, \\"0\\") to the purely applied (say \\"10\\"), I think that this leans toward a scholarly analysis (say, \\"4\\"). I find it brilliantly written. Anyone with an interest in mysticism, regardless of foundational religious beliefs, should find nothing to be of offense. In fact, I imagine it will be very highly regarded by all who read it. Mystics, theology students, and students of human nature should find this book very beneficial. I highly recommend it.

For the most part, I think they we're trying hard to come up with something more superb and this is what you get in their debut. Pretty premature as far as albums like 'New World Record', or even 'Out Of The Blue', but if you purchase this album, you get it for its obscurity more than anything. You can here a lot of The Move in this album and The Beatles too, all over it and why not, since Jeff Lynne is a die hard fan, good tribute to his genre of great music. I personally like the first song '10538 Overture', I also like Roy Wood's 'Look At Me Now', nice little touch of Eleanor Rigby. I also like 'Mr. Radio' too.

Shining Star, Ordinary Man, Lady, and Caught in the Middle are awesome, and the Christian band that taught the world how to rock out acquired a seriously heavy edge right at the end; All For One is an anthem and Rock the Hell Out of You is thrash-metal a la Megadeth; Stryper by this stage were sinking but they went down with all guns (or should we say guitars?) blazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Rockin'","review":"I had always heard that this album was going to be totally not about Christianity and Jesus, etc. But when I got it I still heard the message loud and clear. Granted, in some songs it is disguised more and in a precious few, they do go off in a different direction, but the musicianship is still there and Stryper still can rock. Songs like Rock the Hell out of You and Caught in the Middle are awesome. And for classic Stryper ballads, Lady makes me cry almost every time I hear it. These songs mean something very special to me because of the things going on in my life at the time I got this album. In the end, that is what music is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reunite","review":"This is Stryper's best album next to To Hell With the Devil.

They stay in a small town, where Elle, the floozy of the two causes them to miss their bus. They spend the day sun bathing in bikinis and then have a split up over moralistic differences. Elle is kidnapped and everyone in town seems to be a suspect, or at least by the soundtrack. Karl Urban agrees to help, but she doesn't trust him either. This isn't like the 80's kidnappings where the women were stripped, raped and tortured. No nudity or sex. Some \\"R\\" language not mentioned on the rating guide.

It was the first more-or-less realistic war movie I saw as a kid and has held its own against more modern movies ever since, giving up its spot at the top of my list only to titles like Saving Private Ryan. That said, I was dissatisfied with the old DVD release, and looked forward to this special edition as a chance to get a better transfer of the film.No such luck. The picture quality vacillates between decent, acceptable, and unforgivably hazy. Some scenes look like a badly compressed JPEG image, and others look as though someone had just breathed on the lens (not a problem in my old VHS release, which still manages to look better than this DVD). The special features are nice, especially the interviews with Richard Attenborough, but then again, I didn't buy A Bridge Too Far for the special features, did I?Still waiting, patiently, for a better transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the ten best war movies of the twentieth century","review":"this movie shows just how good an all star cast can go. It is very long. Yet i find it vivid, moving, exciting. It is surely one of the last of the good old war movies. The film makes itself like the longest day an overrall lenghty adaption of one of world war 2's monumental battles. they both don't get into the horrors of war like Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan. Yet they glamourously display the mode and movement of the battles themselves. This is what keeps this film going besides the fairly decent action sequences and engagements, the strong acting, and/or very well detailed showing of the allied and german commanders striking in the battle. I like The longest day a little more than this but i still like A bridge too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Movie","review":"This movie is a very good war movie featuring an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, and Sean Connery.

If you like good war movies, than this is probably worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Still the best made war movie of all time, just not an allied victory so it never got its' due.

While the tension between the generals is effectively portrayed, there are too many hokey elements to the actual sets. Perhaps I am wrong and some European reader could correct me, but I find it hard, in the middle of the war, with prior bombing raids, to believe that the streets of the Holland town were immaculately clean. There is too much waiting around in this movie and not enough actual portrayal of action. Too many of the officers trapped in the town escape for me to regard the movie as realistic.

Connery seems to be the only personna that the viewer can latch onto, and none too well at that. Redford does a decent sequence, then disappears. Olivier seems totally miscast,and his lumberings down a dirt road under a full sun as a finale typifies the entire movie.It lumbers for 3 solid hours with the Allies and Germans giving \\"matchstick man\\" perfomances (to borrow a line from the Rock group \\"Status Quo\\").Annoying scene changes disrupt any flow that the film might have. Also, am I the only movie-goer who found the dialogue too faint and the music too loud? Anyway, the \\"good guys\\" won while the Germans and the audience finally lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor portrayal.","review":"This film plays the British Airborne in a very poor light.They were the most Elite soldiers of WWII sent to do a very risky and dangerous job. However, due to American incompetence(the U.S. Airborne couldn't even take the lightly defended bridges that would let British Tanks go through and support the British at Arnhem) the mission was a failure.The troops at Arnhem held out for 3 days against an enemy with tanks, artillery, mortar and the works and still managed to kill more Germans than Germans killed British.But just remember - the 82nd and 101st Airborne are not what they make themselves out to be.

Difficulties arose in logistics, defensive support, and interference by German Panzer divisions.The movie is worth seeing, but don't expect alot of humour. The movie theme is very similiar to the movie \\"Patton\\" with its historical action direction. This movie is about a desparate attempt to establish a glorious \\"D-day\\" invasion by capture five key bridges. \\"Men die in war\\" was the cold calculated statement, as the Generals abandoned support for the fifth bridge.

I read the book once and assumed I missed something so I read it again. Nope, still couldn't figure out what the bold new solution was that the cover claims. The writing style is extremely boring and the author uses about 3 or 4 questions in every paragraph. How did this guy get published when he is asking the reader for answers?

A stunning story of life, politics and society of the early years of the \\"Great European War\\", centered around the mythical politician. Historical biography at an all-time high by the master of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Problematic","review":"There is no doubt that Wallenstein is a terrific piece of scholarship. Mann totally assimilated the huge primary literature on Wallenstein and presents a comprehensive narration of his life. Beyond this, Wallenstein is a detailed portrait not only of its subject but also of political life and war in central Europe before and during the 30 Years War. The drawback of this book is the writing style. While Mann may be the victim of poor choices by the translators, Wallenstein is written in a somewhat stilted and self-consciously literary style that reduces readability. In a book this long and with this much detail, this is a real drawback. A smaller defect is that this English language version was published without footnotes and bibliography, markedly reducing its usefullness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halo Reflective Helmet Band","review":"It is difficult to overstate how unbelievably bright this product is.

The book is touted as a entry-level and intermediate manual, but right away it starts off in one of the more advanced aspects of the program (morph gizmo). If I had not been well-versed in 3D Studio Max & had previous 3d experiance, I would have been completly lost. The tutorials are fractured, B&W images in the book are misplaced, and phantom scenes the book refers to on the CD don't exist. I ended up frustrated, angry and uneccesarily $47 poorer. One should check NewTek's site to see what 3rd party instruction they recommend if they want to learn LW. However, if you DON'T want to learn Lightwave you should buy Alban's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Excellent Lightwave Book With Very Few Flaws!","review":"This book contains many many tutorials on how to execute the most complicated tasks in LightWave 3D. I quickly picked up on the program even though I had never touched it until I bought this book. My only objection is that there was too much emphasis on movie production instead of more steps on some of the tutorials which could get confusing. However, overall it's an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone with a craving for graphics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Frustrating","review":"If you need/want to learn Lightwave quickly, this book may not be the best. The sections that cover planning and profesional issues are excellent. The explanations of software functions are OK, but don't expect to much detail into what each action you perform is doing. The tutorials vary in quality. The first few seem out of place. Most of them are lacking in description, and there are quite a few typographical errors and some missing files on the CD. I spend a lot of time reading manuals and doing tutorials for a number of software packages, and this book has some of the most poorly written and constructed I have ever seen. If you don't mind spending LOTS of extra time trying to work through where the authors (there are actually six of them) and editors totally screwed up, take the plunge. But I don't think this book will be worth the money unless it gets re-edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been run by an editor first!","review":"Half the time I'm going through this book, I'm enjoying and learning tons of stuff. However, the tutorials are written in a confusing manner, as the author leaves out steps that, while simple and basic, leave the rest of the tutorial in disarray, unless you figure out what was left out. He leaves out parameters to input, which foul the models, and leave one scratching their heads as to where they went wrong. I'm not saying that this is a bad book. It just needs an editor to go through it a second time and point out some glaring inconsistencies, omitted details and the such. After that, I would add at least two stars to my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i bought this book in very high hopes of learning everything about lightwave. but i'm very disappointed. this book is very unclearly written and confusingly stuctured, both language-wise and content-wise. even though the tutorials were all very simple, the way it was articulated made them difficult to follow and succeed on the first try. i wish there was a better lightwave book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intro Good ending poor middlepart","review":"I found this book almost the worst of the inside series. The tutorial are badly explained, they require a high knowledge of the software or at least such a confidence with the software that the person that has it wouldn't buy the book. I suggest to read carefully the manual that comes with lightwave then read the book. Beside this The book give good Ideas for video post effects and character modelling and animation. What is not well developed is the explanation of the modelling techniques and without modelling you won't have anything to map or animate or to adding effect to, things that are in most part well explained.What I am trying to say Mr Ablan is to focus a little bit more on lightwave's gui and modelling aspects, since they are the base of anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"The book fails to fully explain some minor steps that a beginner might wish to understand in more detail. Information such as \\"feel free to look at this image closer by pulling it off this Book's CD-ROM\\" does not help if you don't know the name of the image, nor in which folder it may be. Also some of the captions don't correspond with the images (e.g. page 68). If you have a lot of time on your hands you may well be able to guess the missing links, but you will probably find yourself doing the lessons over in the belief that you missed an important step, only to discover that it is missing from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby","review":"What more do you need to say.

Had the scanner kept working I'd be telling you that you would get better clearer scans from something else and also that the software and installation is really out of date.Fortunately I don't have to go into much detail on that because this scanner just quit working for no reason. Something in the scanner itself, tried many computers and the USB port on the scanner is totally dead. The light on the machine does come on though.This scanner is just a waste of your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scanner for the price, with a few minor drawbacks","review":"I purchased this primarily for quick document scans for our office. I've had no issues at all with the scan quality. The scan speed is a little on the slow side but is still tolerable. However, the software (at least for Mac OS X) seems very unpolished. So far I haven't found a way to save some key preferences from session to session. It would save a lot of time if I didn't have to reset the resolution, color depth, and file type every time I relaunched the program.Two minor quibbles:1) The noise is more high-pitched (and annoying) than other scanners I've used.2) By default, the scan is oriented so that the top of the page is on the side opposite the lid hinge. This seems a little counterintuitive.The scanner still does a great job for the price with some tradeoffs in efficiency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Short story:Installed scanner, did a few basic scanning tasks b&w; documents, color photos - without exception, the scanner rendered blurry (to the point of unreadable / unviewable) images.Completely useless.

This failure is after numerous contacts with their tech support and repeated downloads of drivers, but for some reason it will not load the \\"scanner finder\\" - obviously a critical component. I have given up and will upgrade, probably to a Canon, but what a waste of what SHOULD be a still-functional item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powder-keg of action and emotion.","review":"It seems quite common to discount Chan's earlier films on the excuse that a) they weren't successful at the box-office, b) they do not bear much relation to the work he produces now. However, alongside Snake And Crane: Arts of Shaolin, Dragon Fist proves that Chan's experiences with Lo Wei were not all bad. The plot is simple, but gives way to rounded characterization, and certainly gives Jackie a role in which he can show off his acting skills. Veteran villain Yen Shi-Kwan gives a tortured performance, that really indicates the level of emotion under the surface. The action is superbly constructed and gives Jackie a chance to show a rage-induced version of his skills that has not been seen before or since. The print may be poor, but this really stands up to close scrutiny, and is another example of why the kung-fu cinema of the 70's is truly underrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS FUNNY AS BILLED. AND ALMOST NO ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I wish that I could write a really long review on this but I really didn't like it. It;s basically the same as project A except with limited action, stupid comedy, and a final fight scene that doesn't dissapoint because IT'S THE ONLY FREAKING ONE.

This DVD has cut a lot out of the original. The comedy in this movie is very funny and the fights are excellent. This DVD doesn't do it justice. One whole comedy scene is cut out. The action is still there, thank God, but the comedy adds a lot to this film, balancing it out more nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull sportsmovie with one awesome fight.","review":"OK film. The first hour is totally senseless, Jackie and his friends just fool around with some girls and there's not much action. They don't fight much, but they do play some starnge games so this film is more about sports than fights. Someone may like that, but I HATE sports. So I think it's rather boring. Still, the final buttkicking is real great. Whan Ing Sik (or whatever his name is) lauches about 64 punches & kicks to Jackie.

Well folks, you get what you pay for. I received the order fairly quickly (within a few days) and everything looked intact.

I play the DVDs every morning while exercising so I would like the operation to be as issue-free as possible. I was ok until I tried DVD No. 4 from the set which seemed to have a manufacturing defect in it. To get it to play seemed like an act of Congress and I ended up missing one of the episodes from DVD No. 4 because I finally gave up on it. I know it was not my DVD player because the other disks were fine. All total I saved $7.66 but it seemed like it was not worth the trouble.

Remember that this season corresponded with the last season of ST:TNG (Next Generation), and that is when the action is heated up with the Cardassians in the two series. It also leads to the launch of Star Trek: Voyager. About this episode: A great conclusion. This is one story that I'm glad had 2 parts. Just great Star Trek. There's space battles, aliens, Federation is on the brink of war, QUARK, and more. It's a must see if you are watching the series, or just browsing through the good episodes.

It has a good Trek formula going for it, and was nicely done. Some parts were a little slow, and the title is terrible, but the episode is worthy of the franchise and our cubits. 4.3/5 stars. I've always thought that the writers and producers saw a great thing in the relationship of the Chief and the Doctor. It's the comedy duo of the sci-fi series. (other great comedy duo's: Laurel/Hardy, Spock/Bones, C3P0/R2D2, Londo/G'Kar). If you like DS9, then this will leave you smiling.

But by 1994, that was very expanded upon. Even the Next Generation expanded upon it with multiverses. So why then, did DS9 put a whole storyline around this Mirror reality? I didn't really like the whole thing, and I don't think Gene Roddenberry would have either. I'm going to have to sit through 4 more of these (hitting the 2x). 2.6/5 stars because the cast seems to be having a good time playing different roles.

This episode is critical to his characters' story arc. Pretty great considering that he was only hired to be on the first episode, and there was no intention of continuing his character.

You would think that the Studio Heads would want to sell Season One at a more affordable price just to get them off the shelves. I even went as far as adding up all of the individual DVD's, volume by volume of Season One and, if you buy them used, you still come out cheaper than buying the complete set.

Frequently, the translation is so course that it reads like a cheap VCR manual, but often it is clear that the writing was just poorly organized and disjointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but not essential","review":"This short E.P. of mostly live performances was mainly an effort to hold fans over in-between albums. Some live performances with Queen were included, including a powerful hit rendition of the Freddie Mercury classic \\"Somebody To Love\\" (#30 US) and a lovely cover of Queen's \\"These are the Days of Our Lives,\\" performed as a duet with Lisa Stansfield. Michael also performs live renditions of Seal's \\"Killer\\"(#69 US), which segues into the Rolling Stones' \\"Papa Was a Rolling Stone,\\" and a stark, stirring performance of Bob Telson's Oscar nominated \\"Calling You\\" (from the BAGDAD CAFE). Also included, for somewhat inexplicable reasons, is a brief snippet of Queen performing \\"Dear Friends\\" from it's SHEER HEART ATTACK album. There are enough interesting moments to make this a fine listen for Michael's fans, however, none of the covers top the originals and most listeners will be able to live without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Nice Tribute","review":"I Personally cannot stand George Michael's voice and the claims people make that he sounds closest to Freddie is absurd. The Freddie Mercury Tribute is a great cause.. and this made lots of money. But George Michael, IN MY OPINION, cannot sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, get any true Queen records !!","review":"The tribute is a great cause but George Michael can't sing... Why didn't Roger Taylor and Brian May sing instead of him ? It would have been much much better. Just buy \\"A Day At The Races\\" if you want an amazing \\"Somebody To Love\\" song... I know George Michael didn't want to replace Freddie (really ?) but I still think it's a shame to produce such parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily This Was on Sale","review":"I ordered 3 watches for my neices.

Unfortunately, when we placed our baby on the scale for weighing, the mere pressure of pressing the button to \\"lock\\" a reading would change the weight reading - we read and re-read the manual, contacted tech support and ultimately figured that this drawback was quite real. Returned the product.We ended up buying aTanita BD-585 (BD585) Digital Pediatric Baby Scale. Its accuracy is lower than that of the SECA product, but doesn't have the drawback of changing readings when pressing buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil' Rufus","review":"Great CD if you are looking for some urban gospel music for kids. So glad I can share this with my church going children."},{"rating":"1","title":"short and confusing","review":"I wish I could have liked this book, but I found myself bored silly by it. The book was written in an extremely simplistic style generally found in books written by kids \\"...and then he did this, and then he did that, and then...\\" There was no character development, no exploring of motivations and no type of atmosphere developed. The characters were one-dimentional and the plot was as linear as you could get.The main characters have been imbued with fantastic powers, but they don't explore what this means about them or the world. A wiccan ceremony brings forth a bunch of monsters, one of which kills a person. But instead of this causing the characters to question what this says about the nature of reality, they see this as something that would make a great Halloween party. Luckily the monsters are cowed by telling them to behave.I can only assume that this is a vanity press publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddy is the best","review":"We got this book for my son when he was 8 months old.

This is one of them. Tourtellot's attention to detail and his particular focus on Parker, Hancock and Adams adds some real human dimension to the standard history. He writes with clarity and insight and doesn't fall into the trap of easy characterizations. His portrayal of Thomas Gage is layered and complex, just like the man. By the way, the other essential book is David Hackett Fisher's \\"Paul Revere's Ride,\\" which is a much more recent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful PMS Relief","review":"I break the capsules open and take less than half a capsule (less than 25 mg) at a time several times per day when my PMS is bad (as taking a whole 50 mg dose made me very nervous and shaky). At the lower dose, I get better relief from PMS symptoms (irritability, depression, and anxiety) than with anything else I've tried, including St John's Wort, Chaste Berry and other natural PMS relivers/mood boosters. One thing I've found is that drinking a strong cup of chamomile tea right after taking the 5 htp seems to help tremendously, as I feel calm and clear afterward, with no shakiness. This combination really does seem to help!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have anxiety, this product may make it worse","review":"I purchased this product after reading a book about amino acids and mood disorders. From everything I read, I was a perfect fit with 5-HTP and it would be a life-saver. However, I took it for two days and felt hyper, jumpy, and could not sleep at all. So, I stopped taking it and am now wondering if I have some sort of \\"atypical\\" symptoms that require the exact opposite of this supplement.

I have read a LOT of lesbian-centered fiction and this one just seemed to miss the mark from many perspectives. The book was not very well written... often hard to follow the flow of the dialog and the plot was all over the place. Story lines were introduced and not fleshed out very well and character development was non-existent.

The book is fairly well written, has interesting pictures, and some surprising revelations about the actors and crew. The Bill Daily interviews are especially interesting. However, if you're a big fan of \\"Jeannie\\", you may be put off somewhat by the authors smug attitude towards the show. They make it quite clear they are not fans of \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\". Two other gripes: the Jeannie episode guide doesn't include the first season. I don't know if that was just a glitch with my copy, or if they are all like that. Also, why the extended \\"Bewitched\\" section in the back of the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Why in the world would any author write about a subject he/she so detested? That's the real question with this book. I don't get it.The photos are a great addition, as are what little behind-the-scenes trivia exists. There's an awful lot of non-Jeannie \\"padding,\\" as if the author couldn't find enough to write about the show and just stuck in some \\"stuff\\" to fill in space- like a whole chapter of an irrelevent real-life death, and the entire end chapter on \\"Bewitched,\\" of all things!.Worst of all, though, is the entire beginning of the book, with its constant drivel about how terrible the show was. Well, I was there in 1964. I watched the Jeannie shows when they were first-run. It was NOT terrible then, and it's still pretty cute today.So, the question remains: Why in the world would anyone write an entire book that was obviously geared to a show's fans, when he/she couldn't say much nice about it? Sounds pretty ridiculous to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book!","review":"I've read Steve Cox's work before, and he never disappoints. He doesn't go \\"gushing fan\\" route, but truly delves into the entire project, warts and all. The trivia is new (and I've seen plenty), and the photographs are stunning.

There is lots of interesting, and even shocking, information about the cast and crew that I have never read before. There is a great chapter on other geanie oriented shows of the past, and an even more fascinating chapter on \\"BEWITCHED\\", the other show featuring a pretty blonde with magical powers. This is a must read for all of us who grew up with these zaney shows from an era that no longer, nor ever will, exist again.,"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I was born long after I dream of Jeannie ended so it was interesting to see how TV series where run in the 60's and the strict rules TV censers had. This book is unlike any I have ever read about a show. The cast/crew don't sugarcoat a thing and don't hide about what they thought of one another even when it's not good. Everything from Larry Hagman's causing Sammi Davis Jr to almost walk off the set and cruely belitting an ailing guest star in front of the crew to Bewitched's Elizabeth Montgomery nearly being replaced on her show because she became to demanding is revealed. There's also a Bewitched episode summary on episodes that where never aired.

It's basically about how Asra Nomani is fighting for women to pray beside men at a mosque located in Morgantown, West Virginia.What I like about the documentary is the fact that there is no narrator. It lets the people tell the story and give their point of view. It allows the viewer to make their own decision as to how they should feel.Also, the documentary is very fair towards the Muslim population in Morgantown. It winds up showing that this is not a fight against extremists or moderates, but a battle between people who have different interpretations of the Qur'an. In fact, that is a battle fought in churches and synagogues around the world.Overall, it is enjoyable to watch and very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just doesn't work","review":"This is not set up for the Motorola V365.

I swapped out the front for a Maxxis Ardent 2.4 and am very happy with this combo on SoCal trails conditions: mostly dry, rocky, sometimes hard pack, sometimes loose.While the High Roller has more rolling resistance than the Ardent, it excels in climbing traction, hence the rear designation. I am on my 4th High Roller in a year (I ride a lot!)and just received the UST version to see if it works better with my ghetto Stan's conversion. Although the standard version works fine on my WTB non-UST rims, once the tire gets old it doesn't hold the bead as well, and a good rolling 'burp' will ruin the casing. The price on Amazon was comparable to other on-line retailers plus free quick shipping makes the deal.Now just go ride!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good UST Tire","review":"I'm running this tire tubeless on the rear of my 2011 Fuel EX 8 on the stock wheel. Used the Bontrager rimstrip and Stan's valve and it airs up with a floor pump. No sealant necessary unless you want puncture protection. Running this on the rear and a Maxxis Ignitor (also UST) on the front seems to be the perfect setup for me and the trail I usually ride.I like the grip it gives in climbing loose dirt, rocks, roots. The sidewall seems to be much stronger (inherently so, due to UST?) than the rear specific WTB Velociraptor I was using. I liked the grip of the Velociraptor but it felt like it had too much squirm on the corners."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!!!","review":"The space blankes work, even if they are very thin and fragil looking , they actually work i took them on trip to New York, since i knew i was staying at a hostel , and it being winter, i knew i did not want to cary a bulky blanket, and to my surprice this worked great, it kept me and my traveling partner warm! defenetly a must if you know you will be in a situation where its very cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!","review":"I read this book as a child and was fascinated with it.

Instead it was mostly a summary of the NCAA tournament which just so happened to be won by UCONN. The featured play by play announcers were incredibly boring and monotone and made the most exciting moments seem like they were announcing a pre-season game. I was very disappointed with it. The background music and constant overdubbed slow motion playbacks made me feel like I was watching an infomercial. It failed to come close in capturing the real excitement of UCONN's championship. I expected more live footage and less theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad review","review":"I haven't seen the movie yet yet, but that's the worst review I've ever seen. UConn was a 2 loss team that was #1 most of the year. How can you say they weren't expected to go far? They were a veteran team with a couple future NBA players (although Voskuhl and El-Amin didn't do much in the pros), returning everyone and coming off a 2 seed the previous season. \\"Upstarts\\" is absurd... every UConn fan went into that season thinking maybe it was our year. Duke had the more talented starting 5, but they were younger and had no depth on the bench after Maggette. In common games, UConn actually outperformed Duke (for example, when Artest and St. John's took them to OT), and both of UConn's losses came with starters injured. Duke was the favorite based on talent, but UConn's speed, aggressiveness, experience, and depth made the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"weren't expected to advance far??","review":"Who is this moron that said UConn wasn't expected to advance far in the tournament? The whole 98-99 season the number 1 spot went back and forth between Duke and UConn. I remember Duke, Michigan State, and UConn were the top 3 teams and I don't even know who was supposed to challenge on UConn's side of the bracket, so they were pretty much a shoo-in to the final game. That's a pretty high expectation, and if Duke hadn't been so highly regarded going into this tournament, UConn would not have been an underdog story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all!","review":"The concept is good, however it is just not functional.

I have no problem getting her system in the bag and I have spare room for more books and cartridges in this section. I use the extra space when we go on long family road trips. I put 4 extra books in this section and that gives me a total of 8 books and cartridges that I can get into the bag. I am very pleased with the bag it has met all my expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens","review":"Very pleased with the photos that this lens helped to produce.

She is prettier than some of the HTF dolls. Her hair is a beautiful auburn (may be partial being a redhead myself) But being said growing up there were very unattractive redheaded dolls, always freckles and tight curly hair. Which I have neither of so I hated being a redhead and getting these dolls. They didn't look like me. ANyway if I was little I would of loved to get her, she is beautiful nice medium skin color, eyes are pretty and she have a beautiful face shape too. I got one for my daughter, I hope she sees the beauty in this doll too."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-cellent (X-Files:) version of Ring the Bells","review":"I bought this CD specifically for the whole acoustic version of James' \\"Ring the Bells\\", only a portion of which was in the intro of the DPO episode of the X-files. It's a haunting version, which alone is worth the price of the CD.

Now after a while, when I watch it on DVD, I realize that although it may not have been as funny as I thought, is pretty funny! Only a person like Tom Green could so effortlessly pull off a special like this. It never seems like the comedy is forced, but is instead, just who Tom is. My particular favorite bits include Tom stripping out of a Godzilla costume AND his normal clothes in the middle of a Japanese monkey zoo, him spending some time at Japanese temples, his time spent played with the Japanese band Aqua Juice, and the time he spent on a Japanese subway car! ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"F'ing hilarious!!!","review":"This movie is SO funny, if you like Tom Green then this is a must have.

The end of the cutter was not tightly crimped. I was very gentle using the cutter using only low pressure per the instructions. It did a good job cutting the styrofoam but it was slow. The problem is that when I pulled it back while cutting in the styrofoam, the cutter end pulled out of the crimp near the handle. This broke a wire in the cutter which shorted out and blew a circuit breaker. There goes my $20.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"This product worked fine for about an hour.

This tool seemed like it might be the right one for the job! That is until it snapped in half almost immediately and the dangling hot wire bit burned into my styrofoam. Probably would have been more effective to warm up a paperclip with a Zippo and use that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Broken","review":"I just recently bought this and, ever since I took it out of the package, I have used it a total of three times. I handled it with care as per instructions: don't get it near water, do not force through the styrofoam, etc. However, for whatever reason, it just stopped heating up when I tried to turn it on. It's completely ridiculous! It feels pretty flimsy, too, and not very high quality. At this price, I would be better off buying an electric jigsaw at about the same price to cut through my foam sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was junk","review":"Got one of these, I plugged it in the metal part sticking out never got hot at the end.Heat built up near the handle and it began sagging and melting the plastic case.Never worked, even if it had, it was flimsy and I would not have trusted it to do anything useful.I went with a blade and paid more money, but at least it is a solid trustable tool.When dealing with high temperatures you like to feel that you are \\"safe\\" in using something like this.The styro wonder is a hazard and I don't recommend anyone buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jagged cutting","review":"This did not look as shown above, different shape and color but essentially the same thing. The wire did not heat up very well and the cuts were very jagged. I tried allowing it to heat up longer and cutting slower with no improvement. If you plan on using this a lot or for anything requiring perfect lines pay extra money for something that heats up a great deal more."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good text","review":"Systematic, structured grammar-based approach with neuter nouns only for the first 10 lessons.

On the other hand, there is a lot a mediocre-at-best filler in this 2-cd collection, most of which certainly cannot be called \\"greatest hits\\". Thus, the title \\"History of....\\". In fact there are at least 20 songs which are tough to listen to even once! The true greatest hits, of which there are about 8, should have been put onto a one-cd release. With the money you would have saved, you could buy the Searcher's greatest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM/","review":"Just got these. The disc surfaces are flawless.

Another song called \\"Hurting Inside\\" has a great melody to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all right.","review":"This is a good collection of 50 hits, b-sides and album tracks by The Dave Clark Five. The only US hit that is missing is \\"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby\\". There are a few UK hits missing, but that is understandable, since this collection was designed for the US market. The songs are in mono, with the exception of the last three songs which are in stereo. Most of the songs here are great, so I highly recommend getting this collection (if you can find it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Makes Me Glad All Over!","review":"The DC-5 charged onto the music scene in 1964 on the heels of the Beatles' first U.S. tour. The DC-5 gave the Beatles a run for their money and, as one of the pioneer groups during the British Invasion, the Beatles and DC-5 were considered top contenders in the music scene. (I still think the Beatles are the top band).Still, the DC-5 do not disappoint. Standard classics like 1964's \\"Glad All Over,\\" \\"Bits & Pieces,\\" are sure to delight as are more obscure gems such as 1964's \\"No Time to Lose\\" and the early 1966 treasure, \\"Try Too Hard.\\" I just love \\"Somebody Find a New Love,\\" which is my favorite DC5 song. The opening of \\"At the Scene\\" sounds a lot like Paul Revere & the Raiders' \\"Just Like Me.\\" Still, I love the Raiders and I love the DC5, so the whole thing works for me!Don't try too hard to get this - just order it now and enjoy it. Gear up your cooooooool 1963 Ford Falcon and enjoy those Cool Classics! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for content not the sound","review":"Too bad such an incredible group and great songs have to be in boring MONO. There are fantastic stereo versions of Glad all over And Any way you want it,out there, with echoes and special effects,etc. But it looks like we will never hear them. Buy at your own risk, but be warned-it gets dull listening to so much great music on your headphones without stereo after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I discovered that this long-awaited collection was released, I grabbed it.What a disppointment. Every selection is in one-dimensional mono.WHY WEREN'T ANY STEREO MIXES INCLUDED???By the way, most, if not all the selections were recorded in full stereo. The 1967 LP \\"You Got What It Takes\\" was released in stereo and sounded great (not like those \\"electronically reprocessed\\" which decieved and ripped off audiophiles).One of the long out of print Greatest Hits compliations included true stereo recordings of original recordings.Dave Clark learned one lesson: how to rip off and disappoint fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC5 cd","review":"This is the only DC5 cd that was released in the u.s. that i know and is out of print. Has all the singles. Shame that it is hard to find any cd by them. Many hits from 1964-1967."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD. Terrible contract","review":"Dave Clark Five were one of the biggest groups of the 1960s next to the Beatles. Their work was and now is very tough to find on CD. This CD, if you can find it, is a CD filled with 50 gem hits of one of the best groups in the British Invasion. Dave Clark lost his contract with Hollywood Records causing this CD to go out of print, and from other websites it sounds like Dave values his privacy so much that no one knows if he will have another CD made or not. It's stupid if you ask me, to not get recordings or albums made for an outstanding group such as the Dave Clark Five if the task rests in your hands. Oh well. If you can find this CD, get it because it will be worth every cent and dollar for that matter, guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"missing hits...","review":"Although this 2-cd sets have a lot of their hits, for Filipino DC5 fans, there's quite a few hits that were not included. To name a few: Your Turn to Cry, Forever & a Day, Sometimes, etc. Also the song Till the Right One Comes Along is an edited version & does not include the piano part in the adlib. Anyway CONGRATS to the DC5 for being inducted in the R&R Hall of Fame & sympathies for the passing away of Mike Smith & Dennis Peyton."},{"rating":"2","title":"wanted- 2 c.d.'s of history of dave clark five","review":"When my sister and I were young we listened to this group many a nights while we lived in the country.

I bought it from their old book rack, and what a bargain it was. It is an excellent and detailed analysis of the history of the US Navy's rigid airship program. From the nascent post-WWI programs that focused on failed British designs (and the fatalities of several US service members) to the German Zeppelin designs of the USS Los Angeles, the program that saved the Zeppelin company and was essentially a prototype for the Graf Zeppelin that followed.

The first one died after a reasonable amount of time and I replaced it with a second. This one lasted about 2 years then the keypad/electronics would stop working after about 4 to 6 uses. If I pull a battery and then reinsert it, the lock will beep once then work for another 4 to 6 uses. I can do this over and over and get the same result. I tried customer service and never got to a \\"real\\" person after holding about 20 minutes. Not very happy with this and would recommend another electronic lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten stars if I could","review":"This thing works! I've had one for 8 years and is still going strong.

No wear or etching on face plate. Have bought 4 more for other doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Ties These Three Stories Together?","review":"Not much, it is way too subtle for me to understand what these 3 women's lives and stories have in common. This is one of those films where you appreciate the magnitude of your problems compared to the characters' as theirs are 100 times worse than yours. I might have appreciated this film more if it had focused on one of the women and only told her story.Why does Kyra Sedgwick's Delia stay with a man who despises her and have 3 kids with him? How about Parker Posey's Great going from also ran editor to superstar - is it really that easy? Why is Fairuza Balk's Paula out in a club and interested in the Norwegian dude? Each one of these could have used more backstory.Ron Leibman's Avram Herskowitz is an obvious ripoff of Alan Dershowitz.Rebecca Miller directed and wrote the film based on her book. This movie looks like it was shot on tape in an eternally smoky haze - was that the only way to \\"soften\\" these characters?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It penetrates with warm sun light after the rain","review":"I can relate to all of the three main characters in this movie. I think that we (at least I) sometimes forget what we really want in our lives or the purpose of our lives just by \\"living\\" date to date surrounded by others' needs, priorities, or virtues. At some level, we all struggle to find a way to regain \\"real\\" self. This movie reminded me of the beauty of finding it again with our own \\"personal velocity\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful X 3","review":"I bought this DVD before seeing it because I love the three actresses who are the main characters in the three stories. They are all awful. This unfortunate as all three of these actresses have shown their talent in other films.The main problem with this film is the narration that continues over the entire film. The purpose of narration is to tell the viewer something that isn't already obvious, but this film uses narration to tell the most minute of details which is already obvious.If you must see this, rent it, don't buy. Anyone who actually likes this film is welcome to my copy. I tried to sell it on ebay but no one wanted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"super women","review":"This is an extraordinarily intimate and moving film about three women each at a crucial axis in their lives. It's beautifly shot with a great style that completely puts you in the heads of these totally real and original characters. This is a film ultimately about courage. This film is so much better then The Hours, which shares many of same themes and a similar structure to this film but Person Velocity isn't maudlin and manipulative like The Hours. Parker Posse is absolutely great as Greta, absolutely one of the best performances of the last year. She deserves way more recognition for this performance then she received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salmon Trout","review":"What is 'Salmon Trout' ? Salmon and trout are two different fish.

The scenes are choppy, the acting is second rate at best; I can see why this movie never went to the theatres, it would have lost the company millions. What was the budget of this thing, a $1.00? The plot is synonymous with a 1960 black and white sci-fi monster flick. If that's your objective for some random violent and blood/sex flick, I'd recommend Starship Troopers II. Otherwise save your money on the rental or purchase and let the original be the measurement of what Starship Troopers is."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, I don't like this 'countdown to No 1' stuff, could have been better","review":"Not a good 3D movie, no wonder it is on sale. would not recommend it. it is not even a good documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T","review":"Low budget 3D movie.

I agree with other's assessments regarding this 3d blu ray. I have a high end 3d TV. Viewing this 3D blu ray wasn't eye popping high that I had expected. I bought the 3D video based on other's reviews, which was a mistake. Maybe others don't need to be WOWed by 3d to consider something decent, but for me, it was typical History Channel production, converted to 3D. IMHO, I'd rent this in 3D before deciding to buy.

In reality its probably only about 26 minutes long, but they repeat segments to stretch it out to 47 minutes. Its worth about $2.99 like any other TV show you can download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this, hoping to update my knowledge and to open the eyes of my young grandsons to some of the wonders of our universe. What I dislike so much about this film is its failure to differentiate between what is pretty solidly backed by evidence and what is far more speculative. This struck me as more entertainment than science, and I was not entertained. I had to force myself to watch it through to the end. Last night I watched the first of four episodes of the new PBS/Nova series, Fabric of the Cosmos, which will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray November 22, 2011.

That's what I was expecting for this disc. However when I popped it into the player and picked 3D from the PLAY menu, NO 3D. Usually on this TV when you hit PLAY you get a momentary box in the upper right hand corner of the screen that says PLAY and under it FULL 3D. This time only says PLAY. Tried all the options in the 3D setup menu to no avail. Last resort figured maybe the PLAY menu was mislabeled so picked 2D. No matter whether I picked 2D or 3D, the picture was EXACTLY the same.

It would be much better without it.Also they overdid computer graphics of asteroid belt. In an interview a scientist says that the distance between asteroids is so large that when you stand on one of them others would appear to be dots. And yet computer generated graphics shows a part of asteriod belt crowded with large rocks where each rock is clearly visible.

The DVD consists of a warm-up, 4 step sections, and a cool-down/stretch. The cueing is spot on. One dancer sticks with the basic moves, and everyone else follows Seasun through the advanced moves.

Sure, I loved this show when I was a kid, but no one who is a true fan of the comics really wants to see this. It's bad enough that you can't mention Batman without someone humming that theme song from the sixties. This series offered no dark image of a driven and obsessed Bruce Wayne (I believe he only mentions his parents murder once in passing), the \\"Rogues Gallery\\" wasn't in the least truely threatening, and most of the action takes place in broad daylight.

Jenny has a decent voice, and the backing tracks are professional, but Jenny is still lacking her own voice. Listen closely: There's a little Natalie Merchant there, a bit of Alanis there, and a sprinkle of Counting Crows over there.

If you want all the details, though, you may feel frustrated. For example, Holzner says that Dell obsessively tracks the profit and loss of every business unit. However, he does not explain how. Which metrics does the company use, other than the often-cited ROIC, and how did it develop them? Similarly, Holzner notes that Dell analyzes markets and moves into them at just the right time. But how is it able to judge them so accurately? The book plateaus at the level of reportage, rather than rising to the level of inside analysis.

If you need real secrets with lots of examples, they are in the text and on the CD for you to use them, if you need VBScript and WSHost reference it's on CD too. And not only that: you'll learn a lot about Windows in general. At least I did. It is a very practical book. One warning though: it is VBScript (not JScript) oriented. Although this fact is mentioned in the Publisher overview I think it should have been emphasized more - to avoid the disappointment one of the reviewers had. I think a listing of Contents would be nice, or did I miss it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"This book covers WSH 2.0. However, there was no subject matter on the XML format (wsf files) of WSH 2.0, covering includes, multiple scripting language support, etc. This book covered nothing but the Windows Scripting Host in VBScript format (vbs files) only. JScript was not included at all! JScript is easily translated from VBScript, however, this was still a setback of the book. A lot of emphasis was put on using COM objects, and calling these objects' data members via script. This is fine, but most of the functionality was written in Visual Basic -- again not what I expected. Scripting was made to write short, quick automated tasks, not to fire up Visual Basic and create a DLL every time you want to write a new script. The book is a decent reference, but not as good as Microsoft's free download. I would suggest getting this first. It does demonstate some examples of automating certain tasks, and shows some helpful tips and tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice change purse","review":"I really like this change purse.

I just listened to it again after many years of it sitting in my closet, believe me time has not been kind to this band.

It's just an imitation of OldBoy. A very bad imitation at that. It's one thing to remake a movie but to copy every single scene is ridiculous. The CGI was bad(the knife in the back. Yup they copied that), the action scenes were bad(they copied the narrow hallway scene but in a wider area);I mean seriously. Who put punching noises in a fight scene. What is the 60s-704? Plus, I heard the director off this movie Is notorious for ripping off other movies and claiming that they're original.

I had \\"Bustin' Out\\" and \\"Two Lane Highway\\" back when they came out in the 70s and loved them both, but the band's debut had someone escaped my attention over the years. My loss. That first album, as I now realize, was very, very good; a tight collection of country-rock gems such as \\"Tears\\" and \\"Brand New Harmony Songs.\\" Anyone who liked \\"Bustin' Out\\" should find the first album enjoyable also. As for \\"If the Shoe Fits,\\" it's pretty darn good too. This album came after Craig Fuller left the band, and was also released after \\"Two Lane Highway\\" (which I personally think is one of this band's masterpieces). I could do without the cover of Buddy Holly's \\"That'll Be the Day,\\" but most of the material on here is quite nice, following the same melodic country-rock groove found on their previous albums. Very listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took Me All Summer to Read........","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a Clinton supporter, I voted for him twice and thought I would really enjoy this book. It started out great--nice down-to-earth writing style, interesting anecdotes, really enjoyable read. But then it degenerated into....politics, which I suppose I should have been prepared for. In that sense, it is a great book for historians. I wanted to read about the personal side of the man, not about who he appointed to every post and who did every last job on each and every one of his campaigns. I won't be reading The Presidential Years--this one actually did take me all summer to read because it was so boring. Two stars is a little harsh, but at least I can say that I finished it. Sorry, Bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Even though I had the chance to live through the years that Bill Clinton was president, I cannot believe how much of the Clinton years I had forgotten.

It made me want to know more about his early years growing up in Arkansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"frank, funny, thoughtful","review":"History will obviously be the most accurate Clinton biographer but for those of us who want to hear the man in his own words, this is quite a treat. Bill Clinton is a political animal--for better and for worse.

His voice has impacted American politics and culture; to understand the how and why, pick this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better.","review":"I have always been a guy who has liked Clinton, faults and all.

I won't read Hillary's book, even the one written from the right winger because I have no respect for her. Both she and her husband are terrible representatives for the Democrats, who are on the whole, a nice bunch of people. I have to give it one star because there are no options for no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accidentally accurate","review":"I believe this book almost perfectly captures the essence of the Clinton administration.It is full of lies and half truths, lazy in its lack of organization, self indulgent, self serving- a perfect recap. Clinton took the advance money, and then didn't bother to write the book. How typical of his presidency, where he won the election then didn't bother to be president.Of course, what could Bill talk about if forced to discuss his presidency? After the first few months, it was 7 years of illegal fund raisers and skirt chasing. He's not going to write about that! Or should he write about how Newt Gingrich took his presidency from him? Or, about staffing the White House with prostitutes at tax payer expense?With so many things off limits, the 1100 pages are divided up about like this:300 pages about his weight700 pages of fact free filler100 pages of feeling sorry for himself.BTW: any reviewer who says they liked this did not actually read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"most overrated film of last year","review":"This movie is garbage. Pure unadulterated garbage. Nothing original or groundbreaking here. This is just another attempt by Hollywood to dumb down a far superior foreign film for American audiences. This movie is neither scary nor suspenseful. Ringing telephones and shots from behind just does'nt cut it. Quick edits of so called \\"disturbing\\" images does not make up for the lack of plot or character development. Verbinski's talents were much better displayed in Mouse Hunt. The five minute dream sequence, with images by Salvador Dali, in Hitchcock's Spellbound were better than anything in this 90-minute movie. If you like Naomi Watts in scream mode watch Mulholland Drive by David Lynch instead. Then watch Roman Polanski's Repulsion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no sense","review":"Perhaps I am biased because I have never seen a horror movie that I thought was worthwhile, but I found this movie to be a complete waste of time.

Everyone told me this movie was better than most horror films, but at least others have a plot that sort of makes sense. Nothing in this movie makes sense...at all.

The idea for the movie was pretty good - a video that, if you watched it, you would die in 7 days. However, that is all you get here. The movie never elaborates on the original premise or makes sense of anything it tries to explain. I wish someone had told me to watch only the first five minutes of the movie, then shut it off - it is honestly the best part of the film. Anything after that is a waste of your time.

The highlight of the film is a fine (however brief) performance by a pre-Bonanza Pernell Roberts whose portrayal of a spirited brother lifts some of the oppression that runs throughtout this tale. I've watched this film more than once for it's cinematic beauty and the quality of acting...but this is not a love story, rather a story about love at it's darkest. If I were a fan of Eugene O'Neill I probably would have given this 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Loren, Perkins, and company reduce one of the American Theatre's masterworks to overwrought trivia in this lifeless adaptation of the Eugene O'Neil classic. Given the obvious talent of the cast, one expects considerably more--and although the basic story of a wife who betrays her much older husband with her step-son remains more or less intact, the film version entirely misses the spirit of the original.

The biographer is both tone-deaf and condescending towards his subject. Maybe growing up in New York City is a handicap when it comes to understanding the European fin-de-siecle spirit.Example: on p. 19 Meyers writes that the child was not 'cunning' enough to avoid mockery and humiliation an King's School. Pardon me: Willie Maugham had a strong French accent, was small for his age and very shy and to top it off was afflicted with a very bad stammer. Understandably, Maugham suffered from this experience for the rest of his life. What a sad story.And why describe his mother's guests as \\"lady friends invited for tea and gossip\\"?

Sadly, now I am a bit more disturbed about the human being behind the writer. But since I am a reader, it is the writer whom I can judge.Why four instead of five stars?

Setup is a breeze on OS X.2.7 and it works really well with iChat AV. The picture quality is pretty good and the Firewire makes a big difference in frame rate. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the form factor is a little bit clunky. The Firewire cable is heavy and thick and makes it a bit tough to position sometimes. Also, the foot thing, though cool looking, is pretty impractical for setting the camera up on anything smaller than a desktop.

With fiml noir, just utter \\"Hollywood\\" and there is no need to explain betrayal, hypocrisy, seediness, injustice or pretence.The screenplay is classic Raymond Chandler, sharply brilliant with rat-a-tat fire exchange. But the plot fails -- it's too simple, too linear, and not convuluted enough to darken the shadows and reflect the torn morals noir characters have to face. Veronica Lake as the femme fatale isn't quite vicious enough, and her own private agenda is boring enough to bleach white into the noir.

Once Brian told in the interview that \\"Smile\\" was an amateur band after all.However, I like this CD because I can enjoy Freddie's young and fresh voice. This CD is rare and \\"Going back\\" is beautiful melody.

Wow, I wish I hadn't. It has a few good points, such as a cover of Dusty Springfeild's \\"Going Back\\", \\"Mad the Swine, which was the first song they recorded together as Queen, and the very popish and catchy \\"Step on Me.\\" But the rest is blah. It sounds like it was tape recorded straight from an already scratchy LP. And I don't even have to mention the overall mix of the recording flat out stinks. So if you're a person trying to get into Queen, avoid this like the plague. If you're already a Queen fan, but not very big, I wouldn't suggest it to you either, just because it lacks that Queen essence. If you're a Queen maniac, and a completionist, get it.

Still, I got hooked in his voice. \\"Exercises in Free Love\\" can match many world famous sopranos' work. At \\"Time\\", he is Broadway singer. And finally \\"The Great Pretender\\": I wish it was Queen track. My advice will be the following one: It is a really good pop album.

Triplett deftly weaves the complex issues of communism, weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, terrorism, the U.N. and political theory into a single work with clear prose and cogent reduction. This book is an excellent choice for those who would like to become well informed on the crises and controversies surrounding Kim Jung Il and his father Kim Il Sung. Likewise, the thorough analyses of political missteps and contemporary hypotheses for future engagement, make this a must read for any who wish to remain abreast of the latest political theory on communist Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarot","review":"Thus far, I have recommended this product to family members and friends who have since purchased this Kit.

However, they are printed on mediocre stock and are quite small. This can be useful for an on the go, not easily missed deck should the cards be damaged but it also makes the symbolism of the cards themselves difficult to appreciate. The backs of the cards are also a disappointment, made easy to tell if a face down card is reversed or not. This destroys the sense of overall discovery when one has some idea of what to expect on that alone.Additionally, the book is highly misleading. This oversimplifies Tarot and gives horrible advice- such as ignoring reversed cards. Susan Levitt may have meant well, but her advice runs completely counter to trying to learn to truly use the cards.Final advice: save your money. For what this will cost you, you can buy two full sized decks- one waite, one crowley- and get a more sensible book in the little pamphlet types they put in for basic divination."},{"rating":"1","title":"cards very poor print quality","review":"Cards not worth buying, some were missing name, some missing numbers.

I'd rather read it on Google Books free of charge. The publisher, General Books, has clearly just taken the text from a public domain source, copied and pasted it into a Word processing program, and then pressed \\"Print.\\" The text has no delineation between original publishing information, prologue, or text. It all follows line after line. That was not excusable for something that costs money, but it is tolerable. What isn't tolerable is the lack of apostrophes, so that \\"isn't\\" reads as \\"isnt.\\" Also frustrating to the point of distraction is that lines break arbitrarily (probably where the original text's page ended) so that a sentence may stop and then continue in a new paragraph.

The result? Mike & The Mechanics. In other words, an unchallenging, generic 80's pop sound from a collaboration that looked better on paper. (All that talent, and there's a song called \\"Alright Tonight\\"?!) Maybe Andrew and Graham were being mutually gracious to the point of cancelling each other out. There are a few moments where the potential is realized (\\"Only A Visitor\\", \\"Ready Or Not\\") and only one tune that hints at past glories (the whitebread faux-reggae of \\"Rise Up\\" recalls \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\", but without the sense of irony).

So, if you were expecting a remastered widescreen super duper special edition, you'll be disappointed. Also, if anyone's interested, the only extra feature is the same Full Moon behind the scenes featurette from the original release.

He could have added some needed humor to the story, instead they accentuate his bizarreness without mining Murray's comedic talents.All in all a very disappointing film that I could not watch to the very end, and even after reading all these glowing reviews the only way I see this movie again is if I'm in a film class and they dissect it for teaching purposes - not for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Ed Wood (Johnny Depp), is a positive film enthusiast without strong skills in story telling, yet driven to tell the audience his story. Ed's stories display little interest in perfection as they openly display imperfections which eliminate the magically believable moment. However, it is these imperfections that Tim Burton highlights in Ed Wood where he displays Ed's imperfections and peculiarities to bring out the human side of Ed, which is what makes him lovable. In filmmaking Ed might have received an F as he was awarded \\"worst director ever\\", but as a human he should get an A. Tim Burton decided to film Ed Wood in black and white which vividly enhances the contrast in Ed's character. In addition, the performance by the cast is outstanding as they add phony mood to the film, but it works like magic in this brilliant story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't right to delay this again!!!!","review":"Can't believe this studio is stopping the release on DVD AGAIN!

Landau found in this challenging script, the golden opportunity to display all his immense powers as actor to shine as he did it with this extremely complex and difficult role.Perfection is perhaps a term that nearly would describe that overwhelming performance. But to be honest Landau became by himself the 95% of the film, more than to represent Lugosi he was a model, far beyond an actor. He achieved with the role of his lifetime that coveted \\"State of art.\\"In what concerns to Depp we will have to remind how he grew up under this underground filmmaker; I don' t think it may sound the artistic couple Depp-Burton be reminded in the future at the same level that De Niro- Scorsesse or Wayne-Ford, for instance.And kudos too for the most artistic achievement made by Tim Burton."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOHNNY EXCELLS - AGAIN","review":"The reason I saw ED WOOD was because of Johnny Depp. I like his careerchoices(Benny and Joon, Dead Man, Nick of Time, Don Juan deMarco - though not from 1997 and on).

This is the kind of movie that I like to see Tim Burton make: small budget, artsy, dark, hilarious. Ed Wood is one of my favorite Johnny Depp characters, followed probably by his role as Hunter S. Thompson. Bill Murray also has a very entertaining small role. And, of course, who can forget Martin Landau's chilling performance as the opiate-addicted Bela Legosi, winning an Oscar in 1994 for Best Supporting Actor.This is the movie that lead up to Burton's attempt at his own sci-fi 'B' movie \\"Mars Attacks\\", although I thought Mars was a bit of a letdown.The humor is very dark and dry, but that's how I like it served. Definitely not a movie for everyone.Buy this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it's good","review":"This strange but charming movie combines the unique talents of director Tim Burton, star Johnny Depp and co-star Martin Landau to tell the story of Ed Wood, the 50's B-movie director of such now cult classics as \\"Glen or Glenda\\" and \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", both considered to be among the worst movies of all time. Depp stars as Wood, an eternal optimist with a penchant for cross-dressing. Landau does an amazing turn as Bela Lugosi, whom Wood \\"rescued\\" off the scrap heap to star in his low-budget productions, all the time being a true friend in every sense of the word. Burton contributes his singular surrealistic style--the world of the movie seems to be set in one of Wood's productions. Not many people saw this movie on its first release, but like Wood's pictures, it's become a cult classic, but because it's so good, not because it's so bad it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, and so much more","review":"Ed Wood was the worst filmmaker ever and I recommend buyin a few of his films to see what I'm talking about.

Yes it is a very comical reflection of Mr. Wood's life, but there is also a real sense of tragedy involved so it's a drama as well. Still, because of the sci-fi/horror motifs that Mr. Wood's film centered on, it could easily fall into a sci-fi/horror classification. It definitely has the feel of \\"film noir\\" though because of being shot in black and white. I think this movie succeeds since it strikes a balance of all the former mentioned aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"A very offbeat movie indeed. Johnny Depp is quite adept at portraying this astonishingly talentless film director. The oddball characters that Martin Landau and Bill Murray play are quite entertaining as well.

Depp is great as Ed Wood, the B-movie director who exclaims \\"Perfect! That's a cut!\\" at the end of every first take. Depp pulls off a dumb perky earnestness that makes the viewer believe that Ed Wood really believes his takes are perfect. He keeps making horrible movies, but somehow he keeps getting chances to make more movies; it's almost a modern day Candide.Martin Landau is utterly convincing as Bela Lugosi, the rest of the cast is perfect, and there's a gigantic rubber octopus as well as Bill Murray as the ruler of the galaxy. A movie as funny and charming as this one should've been released on DVD long ago, but it looks like the studio keeps setting a date and pulling it.

Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated.

He starts you out with realistic problems and drills. He covers various aspects of the program that you need to produce actual designs and drawings. Your confidence is immediate because you are immediatly PRODUCING.CATIA V5 is a gigantic program that has many, many commands and abilities. So you must not expect to be an expert when you finish Kelley's book. The book has only about 210 pages. You will need a more comprehensive reference manual at hand such as Sham Tickoo's many-hundred pages book. Tickoo's book is a good reference manual, but not as good as Kelly's for getting you up and running with real, American engineering problems and drills.Kelley's book comes with a number of errors and typos; so you must often figure out what is wrong.

After researching online, I came across this book. I figured, why not buy it. The rigid schedule was intimidating but I was desperate for my son to get the sleep I know he needed. After reading it, I realized my son was a \\"snacker\\". At 4 &1/2 months he would still only drink 2-3 ounces every 2 hours throughout the day so he was still hungry through the night. As soon as I regulated his feedings, everything else fell into place.He loves predictability so the routine works. I don't follow it to the letter. I use it as a guide. He gets thrown off with parties or visitors but he's learning to adjust. He's now 7 months old and sleeps from 6:15 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. with no night feedings. He has the occassional bad night, but who doesn't?I think each parent needs to decide what works for each child.

By the 11th week my daughter was sleeping through the night (I dropped the 10pm feed a little early b/c my daughter couldn't stay awake long enough for the feed to be worth waking her for). I highly recommend this book to use as guide and make modifications where you deem necessary. Putting my daughter down around 7pm each night and having her sleep until around 6am when I get her up for daycare now that I am back to work is a Godsend! Like all books regarding your child, you must make the necessary tweaks here and there for your child's personality or situation.

The list of items needed for the baby is also very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait a minute...!","review":"Gina Ford has been pilloried for her approach on child-management, but think about what her books are: they are guides for people who need guides to parenting.When I was alone in London with my first child, my husband and I had no local grandparents or friends to give us advice. Gina Ford's basic routines gave me an idea of how much sleep a baby needs, how much food they require and how often they eat, etc. She goes to great detail, is indeed a bit fascist, and doesn't say a word about the (very important) emotional needs of children. She is, after all, writing as a maternity nurse, not a parent.There is nothing better for parents than to ignore books and just use common sense. That said, I still use her basic routines for naps and mealtimes now that I am a comfortable, relaxed, Mother of four. Many of my friends have a copy of The Contented Little Baby on their shelves to use as a reference.

I followed Gina's schedule for 6 weeks after my son was born. It was the darkest 6 weeks of my life. Both my son and I couldn't get any rest at all. Followed Gina's book, I fed and tried to put my son to sleep, it took longer than the book says. My son finally went to sleep after a long period of rocking, 20 minutes later, it's time to feed again. I was over-exhausted all the time, thus it affected my milk supply. Please follow your heart, as a mom, you know when your baby needs to be fed; Gina doesn't know because it's not her baby! In addition, every baby is different. The book won't tell you what to do if you don't have milk when it's time to feed, and it won't tell you what to do if your baby doesn't go to sleep. If you follow Gina's advice, you'll get lost.

Im 14 weeks pregnant and have been freaking out about coming home from the hospital with my new baby and not being prepared. I've been told by so many people its a huge lifestyle change so then when i started reading this book it really help to calm my fears and make me excited about being a first time mum. Ford runs through everything step by step and also repeats the advice through out the book so you dont have to keep look back through the pages to fully grasp what she is saying. Her advice is sound and confident and she includes routines to how to care for your baby from newborn to a few months old so your child does not become a sleepless nightmare. It has even changed my mind about breastfeeding because ive been told what a nightmare it was! Anyway, such a good investment. If you have questions and queries about impending motherhood this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book!","review":"I used the Gina Ford method five years ago with success. The routines early on shaped my little restful well-fed baby to blossom into a confident little boy enabling him to shine with his own personality. Even though the routines take effort, especially the first few months, the rewards are absolutely worth it. Our son was sleeping from 11pm - 7am by 7 weeks (while we were traveling away from home) and 7am to 7pm by 4 months. Gina's routines are structured but not rigid. She provides clear advice on how to deal with a baby who may get hungry or tired between feedings or sleep time. I still use the basic tenets of her book to ensure my child is rested and well-fed. When he is not, he is not a pleasure to be around! Even today, five years later, neighbors, teachers, other parents comment on how contented and confident my child is and how much of a pleasure he is to have around."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Only Gave Me Stress","review":"I tried to follow the recommendations in this book but it just didn't work for me. I spent more time crying out of frustration than anything else. I breastfed my baby, and he definitely could not adapt to any schedule. With my second baby, I just went with the flow--nursing her whenever she wanted--and it ended up being so much better and easier. Sure, she didn't sleep thru the night until she was over a year old, but because I didn't stress it, the nursing was easier and quicker--and I hardly minded being woken up at night.This is pretty much the worst baby book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Sad...","review":"I am the happy mother of a happy, sleeping-through-the-night from 8 pm to 7:30 am 15 month old.

I would recommend The Baby Book by Sears and The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Pantley instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this woman have a child of her own?","review":"Following the advice in this book left me, my husband and my daughter unhappy, frustrated and exhausted. It assumes that all babies are the same and should be treated as such. This author has little compassion, and leaves no room to compromise for babies who don't fit the cookie cutter mold that she endorses. Her method is cold and unfeeling, and tries to mold a baby by ignoring distress, rather trying to first understand the cause of the distress and how to minimise it. I don't agree that she is creating contented babies, rather programmed ones. I would recommend staying away from this book if you are having sleep or feeding difficulties with your infant."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bad advice.

The author has a wealth of knowledge from years of experience as a maternity nurse. Ford explains the need for regular feeding/sleeping patterns for all infants as well as other practical information. The routines are pretty strict and rigid, however she does acknowledge that not all children will fit into the schedules illustrated. Refer to this book, take from it what you need and adapt it to suit your child. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"This author makes claims that are not realistic. She has a routine that you need to stick to but doesn't touch on scenarios that differ from her program. As if babies don't cry or fuss during their waking hours; then what do you do? The author keeps reminding the reader that her way is the best because she has worked with hundreds of babies. In other words, doctors, behavioral researchers etc. all have it wrong if their recommendations don't tie in to hers. I think the routines in this book are too rigid and do not reflect real situations. I also don't like her weaning timetables; she will have your baby eating fish and chicken by the time he's six months old.A waste of my money this book was. My three-month old is thriving on a much looser routine, based on many different sources of information that I'm open to. This one I will not use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Bible !!!!","review":"As you can tell from previous reviews of this book, you either love it or hate it. If you feel confident that you understand what your childs needs are from the word go then you probably dont need advice - especially books telling you what to do. How ever, if you are like my wife and I, with little support from family due to our work location and this is your first baby this book is a life saver. It was recommended to us by several couples who have had a fantastic experience with the book - I therefore feel obliged to pass on this good review (the first I have written for Amazon) since we have found bringing up a baby for the first time a pleasure. The idea is that the baby is happy, smiling and sleeps well regularly.

I couldn't do anything to get her to sleep more and she was up a lot at night and very crabby during the day. Although the schedule in this book is rigid and she has some odd ideas like giving your baby water, with modifications, it has been a lifesaver for me. Now my baby sleeps 14-15 hours a day like she should and I can get some much needed rest. I do still feel it is best to let your baby try to develop a natural sleeping and eating cycle.

This is just what society needs... another book to tell us what is good for someone else and neglect the truth that we are social beings who need to be loved and understood! It is what we need as adults, so do we feel it neccessary to abandon that need in infants who only expect to be loved and nothing else?

As a nurse who worked in a high dependency paediatric unit where demand feeding was the norm, i find this book very harsh. This book is flawed for various reasons, a) the author has no children, b) it is going to cause problem for children later on. My Aunt followed the type of regime suugested by Ford on her first born, he was the most difficult baby ever; and is a very insecure adult. Her other children were allowed to set their own agenda , and were much more contented babies, and adults. My 2 year old was allowed to set his own agenda, and now at 6pm he comes and asks to go to bed.To leave a child to cry its self to sleep is cruel.Buy a book written by a parent, someone who has been there,done that,and worn the teeshirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for propping up a wonky table","review":"....buy it if you need a half-inch prop under a table leg - don;t even try to use the advice though as in my opinion this is seriously not for parents who value a calm, relaxed, social child....or even their own sanity.It will make you feel a failure to follow this, and anyone who has given birth will know that you need to follow your instincts and that every child is different rather than sending a 1 day old to 'boot camp'"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this less than one star if I could","review":"This method totally did not work for our baby. Trying it made me sob into my pillow every night as my baby screamed. We shoehorned him into the routines during the day with absolutely no benefit to be seen at all at night. The advice in this book is overly preachy on many points and completely vague on others. For example: \\"baby must be in his cot and asleep by 7pm\\" but there's no real mention of HOW to get the baby asleep by 7 when he's not tired, other than you shouldn't let him fall asleep with a pacifier in his mouth.

I find that\\", whilst at other times she will say \\"Studies show that...\\" and use the information to support her view.I guess if you are (un)lucky enough not to have any fussy relatives around to tell you how to bring up your baby, this book will make sure you don't miss out on that joyful experience.I'm sure she knows what's worked for her, but we found a lot of her advice to be impractical to our personal situation.Worth a read though - so head to the library... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too rigid","review":"Fine for you if your idea of fun is staying home all day, eyes on the clock, adhering to strict feeding, sleeping and waking schedules. It doesn't allow for parents that have other children that need to be taken to pre-school or whatever. You are never going to succeed with this rigid plan if you have to run around each day. Besides, anyone who advocates waking a sleeping baby has obviously never had one of their own and in my opinion, their methods are always going to lack a parent's wisdom....as is the case with the author of this book...enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"adventurers harold robbins","review":"i send as a gift.im waiting on refund ?i dn't hate it i send as agift,but prison's can only accept amazon books only,no other seller's : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book","review":"The book is very good, very easy to read and easy to follow.

She even gave a car to every studio audience member once!I don't always enjoy her show- sometimes it is too much for the \\"ladies\\" or it is just to promote Tom Cruise or such. But other times, she celebrates her good friend and sister Dr. Maya Angelou or some other notable figure, and Oprah really shines.I also enjoy Dr. Phil's advice.

This book gave a VERY one-sided view which portrayed anyone that is convicted of a crime to be the actual victim; all the way from investigation to parole. This view would have been fine if it had been countered with the other side as well. I was very disappointed. I read it from from front to cover, and it was brutal.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the scenery stole the show. The house and surrounding countryside are both beautiful and unnerving. The story itself, twins returning to mother russia to figure out what happened to thier murdered mother and what secrets lie in the house, never quite reached a level of clarity and i found myself quite bored with its momentum.To tell a horror story right, even without a clear ending, you have to be able to spin its details in a way where the viewer cant tear thier eyes away and where the characters at least are interesting.

(It is the same director who gave us \\"Aftermath\\"/\\"Genesis\\" after all!)The woman inherits a property in Russia, and goes there from America to find out about it, but all is not as it seems and she gets enmeshed in a kind of tme warp trap, involving a twin brother she never knew she had and their doppelgangers, all entangled in the circular time trap.The photography and atmosphere is superb and is used very effectively.

Evolution explains and fits the available fact, has been tested rigoursly by many branches of science, is falsifiable and thus a subject for science (creationism is not), and is now considered a unifying biological principal, accepted as fact by almost all practicing biologists.There is not much usable science in a multi-translated Bronze Age book, the bible, and I would argue very little philosophical value. It requires faith to be believed.Peter Jennings and his co-author have done a disservice to the truth.

Whether or not they believe as we do, this people's history is integral and closely entwined to this country's. My hope that those who read this realize that the information listed (regarding the basic beliefs of the Mormon religion) is false and distorted. And while I cede this book was not written for those seeking to know more of this Church, I am disappointed because I know some will close this book and it will become all they've ever learned of it.

If you're looking to learn some good Salsa dance moves, this movie is not for you because the dancing wasn't very good. That being said, I still love this movie. It was a cheesy love story with amazing music. For me, there's something awesome about this movie. Maybe it's Rosa and Harvey (who was real awful)?

I did not like this movie and would not recommend it. I like dancing. But I don't see masturbating against a car engine as dancing. The \\"dancing\\" in this movie is all sexually suggestive/explicit. The director, producers, and choreographers came up with the idea to put hormone crazed teens and 20-somethings in a movie where they gyrate, rub their bodies against another's, then label it dancing. The protagonist was full of ego and machismo. If I'm not mistaken, Rico (the lead character) had sex with an underaged friend of his sister's. Then \\"dissed\\" her in the next scene.

I am very disappointed and bummed out as I really wanted to store all my protectors in one storage unit.I have not contacted customer service because unless they have old cases in storage, a replacement won't fix the problem. If you're starting with all new products or don't plan to store individual protectors in the Photo Case, you'll probably be quite satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Bad","review":"I ordered 4 of these and three of them came broken....however the product is nice. Know though that you can get a lot of pictures in if you store them loose, if you want to put them in photo sleeves or little boxes they do fit, but you can only get two into each section limiting your storage space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, great price!","review":"These are great for storing programs. This particular brand is a lot less pricey than other brands as well, and the quality appears to be just as high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"When I order this product I wasn't totally sure it was what I was looking for. The sheet protectors fit in the binder I will be using them. They are not flimsy but not too thick either. They will work perfectly. My order also arrived in a timely matter. I would definitely order them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable as described!","review":"These protectors stand up to a lot of my abuse.

We had been unable to find them in the store so we turned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome design- Poor quality.","review":"Handsome bag with some great convenient features such as the built in tool & patch kit, the integral rear light attachment, nighttime reflective strip and quick release fixer. The fixer however is the problem. It broke with almost no load on it 4 separate times. I had to keep replacing the fixer. It got to the point where I needed to keep a spare on me to repair on the road along with a philips head screw driver to remove the broken one and attach the new one. The guy at my bike shop told me they are constantly replacing fixers for this bag and recommends only using it in the warmest summer months when the plastic is not so brittle.The zipper pull also broke off on its own, but I can still open and close the bag with my fingernail. If Topeak ever addresses the fixer problem or offers it with a Velcro strap option I would definitely recommend this bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Theory!!!","review":"I purchased this bike bag a few months ago along with a few friends. We quickly noticed issues with the zipper in the tool part of the bag. When riding moderately technical trails we noticed that each of our bags half way through the ride started dumping tools. So everytime we stopped you'd have to zip the bag up as the zipper would start to creep open. At this point, we've all lost about half our tools and the bag is now a running joke between us all. I would not buy this bag unless you are doing road or very lite trail riding. I engaged Topeak since we all had this problem and figured it was a known issue and got the response of \\"Thats a bit strange. I have never heard this issue before.\\" with no action taken so far. So on top of the issue with the bag, questionable customer service by the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I've had this saddle bag for a little over a month and have ridden pretty hard off road trails and the bag has stood up to wipeouts and bumps. Tools are included and are great. I can fit an extra tube, keys, wallet and cell phone in second pocket. Reflective tape makes for good rear indicator for on coming cars as well. A+ product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor mounting design","review":"Nice tools, but the mounting design is poor. Not made for all bike seats.Fits neither of my bikes because the mount (fixer) is not adjustable toseat rails. It will only fit one configuration. How many seat designs arethere? Hundreds? Come on guys, even a WOMAN (me!) could have madea better design! I'm now carrying the thing around in my bike basket!Patooooy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pack, may not fit your seat","review":"This is a good pack and a good set of tools. The only problem I ran into was that the bracket would not fit my seat. When I contacted the company they had 'No solution'. I ended up using two wire ties, which in conjunction with the velcro seat post strap works OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out for me","review":"After about a year the bag kept falling off the mount and down onto the back wheel. Not useful for mountain biking! I'm now going to have to buy a different pack and throw this one away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Very disappointed in the design of this bag. Seeing that it's a \\"universal\\" bag, it should be made to fit any saddle. I have tried it on 4 different saddles and the clip on the bag is too far forward. My boyfriend even went so far as to move the clip assembly further back to accomodate the saddle and it still does not work. Guess I'll keep the tools and trash the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I have a mountain bike that I've been needing to get a toolkit for. When I found this I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I'm so glad I did. The quick-release rail didn't quite fit on my seat but I was able to zip tie it on fast and easy like. Rides perfect and holds the tools great. My Co2 flat fixer fits in the bottom compartment great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect all in one","review":"Bought this because I had to walk 3 miles home when I was stranded. Well haven't needed the tools for changing a tire yet, but the screwdriver kit, allen wrench set and chain link remover all seem durable. Plenty of room left over for my cell phone and wallet. I'm happy with this purchase.

The author's presentation of Quaker life is informative and accurate, and her style encourages the reader to keep reading. Benjamin West's childhood is well represented as he works, plays, and grows up in colonial America. His strength of character is revealed as he struggles with his desire to paint and draw while living in a culture that views pictures as frivolous and unnecessary. I have read this book with elementary students several times and they are always delighted with the story and learn a great deal about this American artist. Anyone who loves Marguerite Henry's horse stories will enjoy this biography as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Although the book is entertaining the quality is terrible.

I found this to be one more CD where a one hit wonder (she comes in colors) led me to believe that maybe I would find something more on the CD. Would I buy it again knowing what I know now - yes. It was worth buying just for listening even if I didn't find anything else to compare to \\"she comes in colors\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Depths","review":"David & Ed Harrell remind us of the true definition of courage. It is not the absence of fear, but not allowing fear to overtake you. Ed Harrell's honest, first hand account of the events surrounding the sinking of the Indianapolis and the days, years and decades that follow is harrowing, heroic, and heartbreaking. Mr. Harrell vividly describes the unthinkable cost of deception and the affects of unwavering compassion. He shows us the providence of God and His great provision. For Mr. Harrell memories live on, but for me it was a great read of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK","review":"WE BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR OUR SON TO DO HIS RESEARCH EXPO ON. IT WAS SO INTERESTING THAT I READ IT ALSO. IT EXPLAINS THE SITUATION SO CLEAR. THIS IS A STORY I HAD NEVER KNOWN ABOUT UNTIL NOW. IT IS WRITTEN FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE BUT NEVER THROWS THAT IN YOUR FACE. IT IS WRITTEN VERY WELL. I ENCOURAGE ALL HISTORY BUFFS TO BUY AND READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly Detailed and Fascinating","review":"This volume, one of many in Norman Friedman's naval design histories, is amazingly thorough in its coverage of U.S. aircraft carrier design from the 1930s-era Saratoga and Lexington through the nuclear-powered Nimitz-class, as well as the offshoot amphibious assault carriers.The book is filled with design schematics, ships' specifications and more esoteric naval information than you could possibly absorb in a lifetime. The rich wealth of information is the consistent strength of this series that makes it a bit overwhelming for the casual reader looking for a narrative history of U.S. carrier.The emphaisis here is on ship design, its impact on operations and little else. If there is any shortcoming to be found within the book, it is that it is rather old, having been last updated in 1983, when the Nimitz class was just hitting its stride and long before the design innovations fueled by the Navy's growth in the waning years of the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Knife Set","review":"I've only owned the set for a short time but have really enjoyed how much better the knives work than my previous set. Because there are six steak knives we find that these knives get used a lot more than the other knives in the set. Even though they feel lighter than the other knives in the set they work very well. I would recomment this product to anyone looking for a reasonably prices 16-piece knife set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the real deal","review":"Rust spots, rust spots, rust spot, all the time. I got these for a Christmas present and so fired up to get a set of Henckels. Only problem is they arent real. They are made in China and its like getting a Chiniese made Craftsman tool. I dont put them in the dishwasher and I barely use them them. I wash them lightly and can actually see rust form and IT DOES NOT come off easily. When I try to get the rust off it scrathces the hell out of the knife. Total JUNK. I have Chicago Cultlery and they dont rust at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust issues","review":"I bought this set a couple of months ago the knives developed rust spots almost immediately. When I exchanged them, the second set had the same problem: RUST! The steak knives are very cheaply made and will dent easily, but more importantly, if you leave any of the knives in the sink overnight, by the next morning you'll find rust spots all over them. This is truly an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an embarrassment","review":"I purchased this knife set as a Christmas gift for my sister and I have to say...I should have listen to the reviews. My sister is so nice and she did not say anything but as I visited her place the other night I saw it. Rust on the knives!! And, in less than a 2 weeks!! Please, do not waste your money. Look for other sets. I should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT DROP!!!","review":"I've had my set for three years now. If left in water more than five minutes they discolor. They say they're German knives but on the metal it says Made in China. Tonight one of the long blade knives fell out of my dish draining rack to the floor and when it hit the floor, the blade broke. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone under any circumstances. Especially not since they weren't cheap to buy but are obviously cheap made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of knives","review":"I have always owned cheap cheap Walmart knives and I always told myself that one day I'll go get a good set of knives. FINALLY, I did and I DON'T regret it. These are super sharp out of the box and they look great. The steak knives are of slightly lesser quality than the rest and have a soft feel to the handle. But they are still great. I recommend purchasing Henckles Knife Sharpener too, in order to keep them in good shape. Also, DO NOT put these in the dishwasher. You should always hand wash quality knives. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these knives","review":"I have wanted a good set of knives for a long time. I bought one set (will not mention brand) and was so disappointed with it, I ended up selling it in a garage sale.

I would definitely recommend these knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got the rust too, never run through dishwasher :(","review":"I have had these for 6 months and they are all rusting.

They never sold at the initial value- very deceiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Knives","review":"Don't buy these knives! They are the worst knives we have ever owned. First off, it says they won't rust. They lie. Even if you wash them and put them in a dish dryer with the tips down to dry, they rust. The rust is almost impossible to get off too. Also within a few uses they are beyond dull. Even using a sharpener they don't seem to be sharp again. Save your money and buy ceremic knives or go to Walmart and buy something cheaper, they will probably work better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two different style knives in the set.

I paid about two-thirds of the retail price, and got about two-thirds of a box of fully-usable sheet protectors.I can still use these remaining defective-seam sheet protectors for items that are not 8.5 by 11 inches in size.If you are ordering a box of 100 of these sheet protectors because you need 100 of them for a special project, be wary that not all of them may fit regular sheets or paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Inexpensive Solution - tough to open the top!","review":"These are a great product except for one small flaw.

These are early recordings and I like the heavy sound. \\"Son & Daughter\\" is the reason I bought the disc. When I first heard it, my immediate thought was Black Sabbath's \\"Warning\\" from their debut album. If you are a fan of heavy metal, this CD will not disappoint and this version of \\"Son & Daughter\\" makes it well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay full price for this one","review":"This provides fans with alternate takes on the classic album versions, re-recorded for the BBC.A more elaborate guitar solo in \\"Son & Daughter\\" and Roger singing lead for a verse in \\"Doin' Alright\\" highlight this mini-album (though you were charged full price at your local record store.)Why all of their BBC sessions haven't been officially released is strange. There are almost 30 tracks in all and has the only known studio recording of \\"We Will Rock You\\" (Fast Version). One can only hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"The early essence of Queen music caught on CD.","review":"I am an avid Queen fan and the first time I heard this album, I was blown away! Queen shows us all why they are considered one of the greatest rock bands of all time. From sheer hard rocking power to light and tranquil melodies, they embody what music should be. This album contains 8 songs recorded for BBC radio in 1973, the same year Queen released their self-titled debut. The first 4 songs were recorded even before their record was put out. After hearing them on the radio, I am sure record companies were impressed and the album was released. This shows Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon in their early brilliance. Upon hearing this, who wouldn't think that Queen would become a world power? I give it a 10!

An excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Queen Heads\\" will love it!","review":"This is quite an interesting release. Two sessions at the BBC, recorded in Feb 73 and Dec 73. With the exception of \\"Ogre Battle\\" all the songs are off the first album. The good news, is the Feb sessions (the first 4 tracks) sound much better than the originals. Thank God. I always thought that album sounded bad. The Dec sessions differ in that the sound is much more stripped down sound, almost live sounding, with few overdubs (for Queen anyway). At just over 7 minutes, \\"Son and Daughter\\" rocks like hell. This collection will impress the die hard fan because you get different and in most cases much better versions of classic Queen tunes.* No \\"HITS\\" so the casual fan may not be right for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent live vocal harmonies and precision musicianship.","review":"This early live Queen recording captures the group's lyrical and musical power better than any other live Queen record.

Also, this unlocked version will NOT allow you to receive or SEND picture messages.Stay away from this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an expensive throw away!!","review":"I have now bought three V3i RAZR's in 6 months time and will never buy another one. I let my dad try out my first one and he gave it back damaged. I thought he just handled it rough because the paint rubbed off of the mouth piece area and the screen has a small crack in it. I found out that this phone is just waaaay too flimsy for every day use. My second one was crushed by my daughter and my third one already has a cracked front screen. I have no idea how the third one got cracked, but I tried to protect it with a leather case. I liked the features and function of the phone, but ended up spending close to $600 and still don't have a presentable phone. I recently bought a Samsung Blast because I have had much better luck with Samung (I still have Samsung flip I bought 4 years ago and it still works great, just no bluetooth). If you want a phone sturdy enough for everyday use, look for another phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is a non US phone","review":"It works in US, but the charger comes as European charger; with a US adapter. It's strange that Amazon is selling this phone only to the USA when it's a non USA phone...The most important feature it is missing for me is the Autoupdate Date/Time from the network or service provider. According to Motorola it because it's not a US phone. It's frustrating if you travel and the clock does not update."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"Giovanni, everything you said about this phone is true. The setting up of the Contacts is the most idiotic set up I have ever seen. There is a way to search for contact with out having to go through all of them individually, but it is so complicated and the manual is of no help and I already forgot how I managed to set it up.

The speed dial buttons continued to say they were empty when pushed despite the fact that the entries in the address book clearly listed the speed dials as assigned. Some of the network features did not work - I suspect someone with ability to hack the phone may get this to work. Charger that came was Large and bulky European version with and adaptor.

However, there are issues with the battery charging. When tried to charge directly with included charger, the battery never reached fully charged status even after 24 hrs of continuous charging. I have replaced the battery but the problem remains the same. I took out the battery from phone and tried charging with a desktop charger and this time it worked.

The battery, fully charged overnight, lasted about 8 hours, with about 1.5 hours of talk time.The phone is set up for some asian country. It was a nightmare to program for web access and multimedia messaging. The voice interface is horrendous! The accent of the voice is very thick, and it is very difficult to get it to recogize names in the phonebook.Additionally, the call quality is poor. It constantly sounded like it was on the fringes of a reception area even when showing 5 bars of signal strength. I am an amateur radio operator, and am thoroughly familiar with the vagaries of radio operation, and this problem was definitely with the phone.I have had a RAZR V3 for some time now, and the interface is similar enough to be able to figure out, but the phone is going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!

There are no BT profiles on the unit I purchased.3. Since the phone hasn't been released in the US yet, Motorola won't give US owners support on the phone.Other than that I'm happy with it.

In the end, he realizes that it's not the love for a better life that the children want, but it is the love of their father. This movie made me think about my own family and made me thankful for what I have and at ease about the things that I don't have.

The author's candid honesty and open heart make for some very thought-provoking and touching sentiments. The feelings one gets while reading this book range from somber sadness and sorrow to hope and a sense of rebirth. Also it makes one realize just how fickle fate's hand really is. I definitly recommend this book to anyone who is doing a little soul searching. If nothing else, it lets you know you're not the only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong short story collection","review":"As usual, Rob Thomas is dead-on with the voice of his YA characters.

I found this book very clarifying, because Ms Solter allowed me to see simple things that were just in front of my eyes.

When I got this in the mail I was shocked. It is so lightweight, it's like something you could have made yourself. There is static as the other reviewer stated, but that only happens to my hair when it's really straight after I've flat ironed it. When it's real straight my hair is more thin, and this brush will stir up cradle cap. However, when my hair is thick in it's natural state, this nylon brush does not go through to the scalp like they say it will.I have a $5 Goody nylon brush that works better than this. The only difference is that the teeth on this brush are closer together, whereas the Goody's teeth are a little wider. But the Goody is heavier and appears more durable. Also, it is a pain trying to keep this clean. They give you a smaller cleaning brush that works quite well, but you can't get this brush wet or have natural hair oils left in it. I won't purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static electricity","review":"This Mason Pearson brush has so much static electricity it renders it impossible to use.

Very troubling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading!","review":"For those of us who have despaired of ever seeing a balanced account of Whitewater in the media, this book is fantastic. Buy it, read it, show it to your friends, and keep it handy whenever the NY Times, your local paper or even (yes) NPR start spouting off about Whitewater.

I can't even remember the last time I had seen so many white people up on the Hill District where the movie took place- they're actually terrified to go up there. The only good thing about the movie was Mario Van Peebles. He was totally hot with those bulging biceps and those tight jeans.OOOO WEEEEE!

Give a listen and you will see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase their earlier material","review":"If you can actually manage to get a copy, DON'T BOTHER. The classic Seaweed sound just isn't here, nothing like on the self-titled album, Weak and somewhat apparent on Four.It's not a coincidence they didn't stick with Hollywood records for more than this album.The more recent releases on Superchunk's label are advisable. They've started to gear in more of that classic sound. Sadly, I doubt they'll ever revisit the heavy dual-vocalist insanity they had going on the older releases that truly made me fall in love with this band from the start.I highly recommend picking up a copy of Weak so you can get a true feel for the heart of this band. Jack Endino did a hella job producing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre metal","review":"Another band that came out of the Pacific Northwest in the 90's, Tacoma, Washington to be exact.

After repeated listenings I'm still scratching my head. There is rarely anything to hang your hat on with this poorly recorded album. The worst live recording I've heard since Robert Palmer's \\"Live at the Apollo\\". The first track sounds like an orchestra tuning up and I'm just waiting for it to take off. No such luck. Just more meandering and noodling. Then there is a track set to a woman's phone call. In theory it's an interesting concept (like a John Cage composition) but in reality it just sounds like an annoying woman talking too loud during a concert.Just skip this frustrating disc if you are looking for melody and rhythm. If you like avant guard jazz then give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tigertail Val's Gingerbread","review":"This book is worth it for one recipe alone - Tigertail Val's Gingerbread.

Amazing track, that, and probably the best thing on here. If the others were close behind we'd still be in luck, but unfortunately much of the rest of Empty Rooms is disappointingly mundane. The songs are well written, well executed, and well recorded, but sadly they're just not very good. Exceptions are \\"Mansion on the Mountain,\\" \\"Blankets and Shields,\\" and possibly \\"Sleepwalker,\\" but three or four enjoyable tracks don't make an album worth keeping (not for me, anyway).

I can't say that any CD is better-- he poured his love and talent into each one, this no exception.I am six months pregnant and my BABY loves this. If I move to the music, he doesn't and if I don't move, he rocks! The music is great to dance to and improves coordination because it is easy to pick up the beat.

To me, it looked ugly and beginner-ish. I mean, what's so attractive about giving yourself a hole on d5, a backward d-pawn, allowing White to double your f-pawns and then castling kingside? The thing is, though: Who cares what it looks like if it works? I couldn't refute it, but I was nobody. Fischer never faced it, but today all sorts of Super-GMs play it and love it. And it's no harder to play than any other line of the Sicilian. Now I rarely play anything else.Now that I have Rogozenko's excellent book, I have the confidence to play the Sveshnikov in correspondence chess, which is the only serious chess I play nowadays. It's going to be a while before this book is superseded by a superior. By the way, it makes a good companion volume to the author's book on the Anti-Sicilians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvellous Book, NOT on the Kindle","review":"Outstanding book. But the inability to search easily renders it useless on the kindle platform. For example I challenge anyone to find the entry on Beethoven in under 5 minutes.

I had never seen the movie and I bought the soundtrack because it was by Elmer Bernstein. Its great!!!! The first 2 tracks lay out the main theme which has a stirring almost Coplandesque quality. The next 3 tracks are fairly quiet until the 6th track which repeats a variant of the opening theme and mixes in a few strains of Beer Barrel Polka towards the end. The rest of the soundtrack consists of mostly short tracks of less than 2 minutes. It wraps up with a repetition of the main theme and a 1 minute raucus rendition of Beer Barrel Polka. My favorite tracks are 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,16,21,25,26,27,28. I recommend this to all soundtrack and Elmer Bernstein fans.

However, the author's gripes about the USDA Food Pyramid are worth checking out. Additionally, there is valuable information about vitamins and minerals which I did not know - such as which ones I likely already get enough in my diet, and which ones it may be smart to take as a supplement. If you've found that diets don't work and are looking for substantive information about how to eat in order to be healthy (not just to lose weight), I would begin with reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap book","review":"Book came in pretty timely and it's in fairly good shape. It looked like there was some bacteria on the back cover though which is a little gross. Either way, the book cost half a dollar and I can easily read all of the words. I'd buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cookbook","review":"This is an OK type of cookbook but it is one among hundreds most of which contradict each other. Thus, the poor consumer has a difficult time making any sense of it all. There should be many fewer but much better cookbooks/diet plans/nutritional schemes, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, drink and be healthy","review":"Felt the material it was printed on was cheap, print small and blurred. I would not buy this book either for myself or as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague Book","review":"Having the word 'Harvard' would make some people think that this book might have something interesting in it, when it does not. 70% of the content of this book only tells you about how outdated and unreliable the USAD nutrition pyramid. The other 30% is hard to understand, especially the graphs. I wish I had never bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I thought It Would Be","review":"[[ASIN:B001W5AM28 Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating] I had a copy of a book with this same title. I must have lent it to someone anyhow I can't find it. I purchased this one from Amazon it seems to be a different printing. I don't remember it in this format. There seemed to be more useful information, my other copy was a paperback also. I suspect this copy is an older printing. Look for the Paperback version I believe it is better, more up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and informative book.","review":"I found this book to be quite enjoyable. It was informative, well written, and \\"to the point\\". I would recommend this book to anyone hoping to improve their eating habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Informative and Reliable","review":"This book gives great information not only on how to eat and be healthy, but also shows how the USDA's Mypyramid doesn't have our health in it's best interest. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in living a healthier lifestyle, and also to see how big companies have their hands in everyones pockets and plates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy","review":"This book does a wonderful job of taking the scientific information available regarding nutrition and puts it a format the lay public can easily understand. Very professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nutrition book written by an authentic expert","review":"The majority of books written on nutrition are written by people who have no credentials. Willett is a respected Harvard Professor. He also writes articles in peer reviewed journals. Much of this book is based on Willett;s own research. The book is short, well written, and easy to read.I learned a lot from it. It has much useful information on nutrition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on nutrition.","review":"I loved this book. It revolutionized the way I eat. Full of information and a pleasant reading. I am very picky about books, but for this one, I want to tell you: READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice","review":"Finally! A book with some real information I can use to make my diet healthier and remain easy to follow. I only take off a star because a lot of the information was repeated over and over and over. The book could have easily been slimmed down 100 pages without losing any content. I also appreciate the sample menus and recipes in the back. Overall, I think everyone should be forced to read this book- our collective health would be much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Everyone!","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the effects of nutrition on health. Unlike many health or nutrition books, this one offers the actual science behind its recommendations. It is not a fad diet, not a quick fix, but a way to eat for life while reducing risk of disease. I have personally bought five copies of this book to share with friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science is the answer","review":"Dr. Willett explains the link between good nutrition and health in an extremely clear manner. In addition, he accurately describes what good nutrition is - based on decades of scientific research. This book has the answers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best guide to healthy eating","review":"Willett's book isn't a fad diet book, but explains food and what it does for your body. I thought this book was very informative. It set some diet myths straight. There was a good overview of the food groups, the pros and cons of each, and what diseases or illnesses they helped or hurt. I thought the vitamin section was very good and surprisingly brief for that sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be rich to buy Epson 4000","review":"FACTSWhen the ink jets are not clogged in works great.I spend more money on head cleanings that I do prints.Buy a few extra maintence tanks, you'll need them.Eight of the the big cartrages will cost you only 800 dollers !The printer cloggs overnight so If you dont print every day you will have to clean the heads at least five times. and as you know cleaning uses lots of ink.For conveince just send Epson the # to your bank account."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLOGS CLOGS CLOGS AND MORE CLOGS - NO END","review":"What a costly frustrating mess.

Problems arise when the General's wife reappears and tries to interest Marcel in romance. Marcel is attracted to her friend, Crickets lover. Cricket is attracted to Marcel's mother, Roslin. Only Peggy Herring could take this mixed up affair and create an interesting and delightful book. My only regret is that I will have to wait a long time for another of Peggy's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, good moments","review":"I read some of the previous reviews and agree with a few criticisms- but I did find the book pretty entertaining. It IS a very quick read, and the story starts with the Colonel retiring- so don't think you're going to get a lesbian military story here. No ma'am. But I liked the dialogue- which is really the only way you get to know the characters. And they come to life in their exchanges. I'd recommend this book as a quick, light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy!","review":"The plot was ok in this book but she never went anywhere with it. It was cheesy in my opinion. If you can buy it used, it would make a good quick read I guess...don't pay full price tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book was a waste of time. The synopsis on the back cover has very little to do with the actual plot of the book. I expected to read a story of a lesbian's battle with the armed forces, what I got was a love story. A love story that had nothing to do with the character talked about in the synopsis. It also was too quick and not very substantial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation reflects the greatness of the poem","review":"While I'm not able to comment on other translations with any expertise, I found this translation to be excellent. The story still carries all the power with some moving verse (not too mention, of course, the plot line). This will be a translation I return to again and again as the beauty of the language makes this worth lingering over."},{"rating":"1","title":"surface level only","review":"I was rather disappointed by the actual amount of \\"in-depth\\" footage and information. May be very helpful for fans of Dutch masters but offers very little for a true cigar smoker."},{"rating":"2","title":"+Beautiful Boxer is a beautiful film+","review":"This Thai film about the famous transgendered fighter, Nong Toom is an excellent film. It moves incredibly slow at times, but it was not shot in Hollywood, so don't go into this one expecting alot of eye candy. The film is rudimentary at best, but also scathingly open and honest. The fight scenes are good, the build-up to each fight done well...Beautiful Boxer is definitely worth watching, especially if you like import films or fighting. Half of this movie would be labeled a \\"chick flick\\" by most Americans...but the drawn out story of the transition is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the right formatted DVD","review":"Before selling a disk to someone in the US when the product is sold from outside the US, it might be helpful to inform the buyer about different settings/formats for DVD players. I can't access the DVD because it was coded or designed for a different country's DVD player. I realize experience is the greatest teacher, but it's annoying to spend money on a product I can't use.My advice: don't buy DVDs from a foreign source or read the fine print. I'd love to watch this movie, but alas, I have to find the right formatted one to be able to view it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think you'll enjoy","review":"It's basically a story of a person trying to find his/her happiness in the world, as well as be able to take care of the family. Kickboxing was means to achieve her dreams.The fight scenes were well done, and it's always interesting to me to see other cultures. The actor playing Toom Parinya is quite believable, and overall the film has a nice charm to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie!","review":"This movie is breathtaking in its beautiful scenes of Thailand and the Thai people.But even more amazing is that this film is based upon a true story!A courageous person who finally finds the strength and courage within to be who she truly is. A wonderful story and film for your collection- esp if you appreciate Trans people."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"This is a very unique movie, maybe not for everyone, but extremely well acted & filmed. It is one of my favorite movies ever. And wow are the actors beautiful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Work!","review":"I was debating whether or not to rent this DVD at the rent store. I finally decided to rent it and give it a try. I was amazed at the great acting with all the actors and actresses. I was very moved at the end of the video. This video also contain some beautiful scenries. Now let me be frank and say that don't be scare about renting this video especially if you are a guy, because there are no funny business in this movie, only a few hints here and there. Overall, I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the book, good reference material, sound strategy","review":"The book gives an excellent assessment tool for determining TQ readiness. The step-by-step process of implementing TQ is well documented. Problem-solving using the improvement method is excellent.

I tried to write customer service to find out what was lacking, but got no help."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This work depicts the reality of the latest Iraq war, rather than the hyperbole often used to sell and maintain the conflict. It would be worth reading if only as a vaccination against media that enthusiastically markets simple slogans in lieu of lethal reality. It stands as a prudent warning to those who think poly-sci term papers can painlessly remake the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a daily summary of a reporter","review":"Nice detailed description of a city crippled by fear and danger and how it runs into chaos afterwards. Good descritpion how the US replaced the tyranny of Saddam with the Tranny of their own"},{"rating":"2","title":"A View from a Different Place","review":"I must admit to being confused about Iraq. While it is a story still unfolding it is just now that the books are beginning to come out. You have to wait for the books because the news programs are so bad, the expression 'if it bleeds it leads' seems true.Jon Lee Anderson had a different view of the war. He was in Baghdad before the war started and stayed there through the American takeover. This perspective is quite diffferent than those of the embedded reporters covering the war from the viewpoint of the military units. He knew and indeed was friends with a number of Iraqi citizens. He wrote a series of stories for the New Yorker magazine which became the foundation for this book. His stories and more important his analysis provides a stabalizing viewpoint in a situation that is certainly confusing to those of us looking at it from have a world away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iraq's Upheaval","review":"A well-crafted report of the unique milieu of totalitarian Baghdad. Anderson expresses a deep humanity in the stories he tells. Without grasping for explanations or theories, he writes about the people he met and befriended and his own experiences as a journalist. His eye for the richness of the particular lives he encounters makes the bleakness of Saddam's cruel and absurd system all the more clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"The manufacturers do not reply to your email.

The plot is pretty dumb, but there are plenty of dumb-plot movies that are well made. This one is not one of them. From the very beginning you'll find yourself disappointed by the acting and the editing. This is one of the films where things just don't flow. There are very few truly funny moments. Even the bathroom scene where JE dances to the camera-in-the-mirror feels trite and stupid, not funny. Maybe as a big Mr. Bean fan I was expecting something half decent, and as a huge James Bond fan I was expecting a comedy that properly insults the real 007 series. On both counts, I was let down tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atkinson Did It Right!","review":"Despite what many people have said, this movie is extremely funny and original. It is true that spy movies have been done before, for example Austin Powers. Just because it has been done before, doesn't mean it has been done right. Rowan Atkinson got it right. From start to finish I was laughing at his quirky humor. He can do both physical comedy and at the same time act the part of a bumbling agent to perfection. This is a must have DVD if you like comedies!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get your hopes up","review":"The best part of this movie had to be the Aston Martin Vantage. I will admit the chase scene with the car was unique.I had high expectations after learning of the involvement of the writers of the last two Bond movies. I had expected a lot more subtle humor than slapstick.The movie is ok and certainly acceptable for a family evening film. Oh yeah, and Natalie would make a good Bond girl too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaser Trailer Review","review":"This was an extra on the \\"Bourne Identity\\" rental DVD. It may be the best bits but it whetted my appettite to see the rest. Rowan Atkinson dryly shakes and not stirs Mr. Bean and James Bond and it's a happy marriage. \\"I can assure you sir, that this is the most secure location in all of England\\" is going to be one of those bar reunion replay scenes, when everyone is doubled over in drunken laughter thinking of the look on Rowan's face. \\"Airplane\\" meets \\"Goldfinger\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just silly fun","review":"I took my kids, ages 12, 10, and 8, and got my money's worth just watching them laugh hysterically. It is a very cute movie and innocent (potty jokes aside)--won't have to mute or fast forward this one to watch it with the kids like so many other movies. Rowan Atkinson's slapstick is a real pleasure, and I swear the man's face is made of rubber! I appreciate something I can show to my 8 year old and my 75 year old mom at the same time--and so completely enjoy it myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"Rowan Atkinson as Johnny English is an absolutely incredible combination. The movie is hilarious, and has most of the spectators in hysterics by the end. After swallowing the overdramatic \\"Die Another Day\\", this spy movie is a funny relief.The sense of humor is not obscene or vulgar. It is more refined than \\"Meet the Parents\\" and hence I recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh.The characters are fantastic, the music is great, and the plot is the best of them all. Have fun watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowan Atkinson:Comic genius","review":"Do not confuse this intelligent movie with the James Bond spoofs like Austin Powers. The subject matter seems similar but the comic genious of Mr. Atkinson demonstrates that a movie can be funny without using [physical]inuendo and [stuff]. If you followed the Blackadder series you already know that Atkinson's character acting is beyond Mr. Bean. Too bad that this movie has been advertised as \\"Bean meets Bond for American audiences. Unfortunately he is stuck with that image of Bean. His wit and vocal characterizations are in the same class with the finest comic and dramatic actors. If you want to see a clean movie for the whole family this is for you. Even there is some harmless bath room humor. If you want to explore the intelligent comedy of Rowan Atkinson go beyond Mr. Bean and see his hilarous Blackadder series. You would also have the opportunity to learn some British history."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was disappointing.","review":"Rowan Atkinson is hilarous as Mr. Bean. I could not stop laughing when I watched \\"The Rat Race\\". I was in the mood to laugh so I rented this movie. After 20 minutes, I stopped watching it. I found it to stupid. The scene at the gravesight was to ridiculous for words. After seeing the scene with Rowan trying to investigate how the thieves got away with the jewelry was just plain dumb. I could not waste any more of my time watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"This was listed as used but very good condition. Unfortunately, about 30 minutes into the movie it became unwatchable as the disc was clearly damaged. Amazon were excellent in their customer service refunding me the cost of the movie and giving me a shipping label, but it cost me almost the price of the movie to buy a new padded envelope to return it even though postage was paid (I hadn't kept the packaging it came in - too trusting I guess!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly British Humor","review":"This movie is ok. It probably would be more funny if I were British, since they have such a dry wit. It kept me interested, not laughing, by interested in seeing how it ended. Probably never watch it again but at least I don't feel as though I've wasted a few hours of my life watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"I loved Mr.Bean but Johnny English is just not funny. Even my 8 year old was unimpressed. My husband a huge fan of British comedy was very disappointed.Poorly acted and scripted. I am glad it was a rental. Only received a 1 because the rating system won't allow anything lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly British Humor","review":"The British try to hard to be funny in this movie. While the storyline kept my interest, the humor was too juvenile for me. I would not recommend purchasing this movie unless you get it for $4.00 or less. When the movie is over with you just feel like it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy wrapped in a slick spy package","review":"I've always enjoyed the world of suave spies and all of their gadgets. Giving Rowan Atkinson access to this world sets the stage for many laughs. I was struck by how creatively he can get himself into a variety of messes. The best mess of the movie is when is Aston Martin is towed and he highjacks the truck. His physical \\"Mr. Bean\\" humor tied to his \\"spy-ish\\" good looks makes his character one of the best that I've seen in a long time. Three cheers for a great, clean comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to love this guy","review":"I don't think I have anything new to add here, but I did really enjoy the movie. I like movies that I can trust to not be offensive, skanky or disgusting, which doesn't happen all that often these days. This is a funny movie, fairly predictable but in a charming way, with a hero that is not always so heroic. He gets himself into embarrassing situations and needs help getting out, almost hitting the top of the \\"cool\\" scale but having life stop him before he gets there. His sidekick and leading lady are well acted and supportive. I appreciated being able to see Rowan Atkinson in a truly likeable role, whereas with Mr Bean you kind of feel he deserves some of the crud he gets and Black Adder was just a bit too wicked to be friendly. :D Give it a shot; if you're bored, turn it off. I think you'll enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and not funny","review":"I like Rowan Atkinson and have enjoyed him in various movies, Bean, Rat Race and in his series The Black Adder but this movie is really bad. I didnt laugh during the entire movie but I did fall asleep three times while watching it (rewatched the parts that I missed when I awoke). He's trying to be another Peter Sellers but is nowhere is good as Sellers was (who in my opinion wasnt all that funny either.) I definitely wouldnt recommend this movie Rowan has been much funnier then this in the past (bad script)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just good Fun","review":"I just thoroughly enjoyed watching this - reminded me of Leslie Nielson and the spoofs of Airplane and Police Squad. Totally silly, I missed a lot of stuff the first time due to extreme laughter. The second viewing was just as enjoyable as the first even tho' I knew what was coming up. I highly recommend for a fun evening of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother - 1 star because negative stars not available","review":"This movie is not worth the time spent to watch it. If you wish to see why then watch it and you will understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen...","review":"I saw this movie with a bunch of family and friends at a theater in Brandon, Florida. I like lots of different kinds of movies and can find something redeeming in most. This wasn't one of them. Unless you really get into toilet humor (no pun intended) or are a pre-teen (see toilet humor), or maybe like torturing small animals (and this movie made me feel like the animal), it is a total waste of time. There is nothing creative or unique...and little that is funny. To compare it to Austin Powers is a farce. The trailer was funny and promising. Unfortunately, that's all she wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen.","review":"I loved Black Adder for the wit and Mr. Bean for the innocence. So what we have here is a film where we mix the BAD points of both characters (Blackadder's willingness to lie, cheat and otherwise be a complete bounder; and Mr. Bean's utter stupidity) for laughs. No laughs erupt, however, and soon this film begins to feel like an embarressing exercise in making a quick buck. First \\"Mr. Bean - The Movie\\" (which died an ignominious film death) and now this! Rowan, dear heart, stick with television."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is GAY","review":"The plot sucks. Mr.bean sucks. The movie sucks. The actors suck. The villan sucks. The DVD sucks. The sountrack sucks. The credits suck. you suck. The title sucks. The story line sucks. The jokes suck. The best part was at the end of the movie where i shut the damn trash off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny English - Blasphemy scene","review":"I found this movie very offensive, they wrote in \\"Jesus is coming, look busy\\" with black marker over the dirty buttcrack of some guy. I couldn't watch this movie after that, and I turned it off. I wouldn't recommend it for any Christian to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST","review":"There's a reason this movie bombed at the box office. It stinks. Mr. Bean has a go at playing Bond in this mildly amusing spy spoof. After having (...)erotic dreams about being Agent One, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) indirectly kills Agent One by providing faulty entry codes for one of his missions. Later, at Agent One's funeral, the rest of the agents are blown into oblivion when Bean allows a bomb to slip into the funeral in Agent One's coffin.From there the film deteriorates into Bean's bumbling attempts to recover the stolen Royal Crown Jewels. Few laughs and if you're watching too late at night you'll be fighting the impulse to fall asleep. Not too offensive for the kiddies, though.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hillarias film","review":"Johnny English is one of my favorite movies of all time.This Movie is hillarias.To compare this movie to any others I would have to say it would be down the line of, The Stupids, Top Secret,and the Master of Disguise.If you have seen those movies and you don't like that kind of humor this movie is not for you, even though this movie is better than all of those.Also you never know whats going to happen next.So if you like Stupid Humor this Movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Mr Bean plays Leslie Nielsen's type of humour","review":"I love MR BEAN and I was impatient to get this movie. Okay it's not a masterpiece and you will not laugh all the time but you will have a good time wathcing it.Malkovitch is the funny nasty French (By the way it's French accent is quite poor :) and Imbruglia is the MR Bean Girl. Influenced by James Bond of course, the story has been already seen quite often and the jokes are more into those Leslie Nielsen could have done ! I just hope Rowan Atkinson in Mr BEan role for his next movie.It's still watchable !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"A lot of the comedy was predictable. A lot of it was tedious.The funniest scene was the fast-paced car and truck chase scene which unfortunately turned into the tedious and painful funeral scene.I watched it as an Amazon Instant Video which doesn't provide any extras or subtitles. I find subtitles useful for undertanding heavy accents and whispered speech. You get more bang for the buck by buying a used DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"very FUNNY","review":"I had been laughing at the movie since the beginning to the very end.It entertained me so much. You dont need to think of anything, just watch and enjoy it! It's very entertaining and enjoyable at the same time.Johnny looks so genuine and stupid..no poor and dirty humor such as in hollywood movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficulties with DVD playback","review":"Tried playing this DVD on an older Hitachi DVD player and on my computer. It was a 'no go' right from the start. Playback froze up on the DVD player and jumped around on the computer. I suppose this is the result of some brain-dead anti-piracy feature. Rowan Atkinson could play the role of the Universal exec who thought that up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is this supposed to be hilarious?","review":"there were only a few parts that were funny. utterly disappointing, even with Rowan Atkinson in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"Not a single laugh!

This is a model of poor film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy but Funny","review":"I didn't think I would like this movie, but I do. It is really very funny and entertaining. Something both my husband and I can watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh a minute","review":"The funniest movie I have seen in years. Even better that the original Johnny English. Rowan Atkinson is brilliant. Unfortunately the best scene of the movie was relegated to the credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable and Funny","review":"This is a much finer film than \\"Bean -- The Movie,\\" Rowan Atkinson's earlier film. Atkinson is hilarious here and Ben Miller as his sidekick is also very funny in a subdued way, dutifully putting up with and attempting to gloss over Atkinson's absurdities. Natali Imbruglia is the lovely heroine constantly managing to get Atkinson out of one jam after another. I'm not completely convinced of John Malkovich's playing a Frenchman, but he was OK and funny at times. Although you might not think it, the picture greatly benefits from being in Blu-ray having some, but not quite enough for me, beautiful shots of London. An exceptionally enjoyable picture as an updated Pink Panther type of movie but with really fresh ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of laughs","review":"Any fan of Mr. bean or for that matter, Rowan Atkins, will love this movie. A delightful departure from the usual stupid comedies that are so common these days. I enjoyed this movie in the theater and now enjoy it at home. A movie full of laughs and enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny English!","review":"I will be truthful I had my doubts on this movie. So I passed it up in the theaters! BIG MISTAKE! Johnny English is what english comedy is. If you thought Austin Powers was a brillant spoof on spy action flicks, you haven't met the one true class act of comedic spy action, Johnny English! Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean, Rat Race) delves deep into his already huge portfolio of comedic appearances and brings out the best of what a spy comedy is. Other credible talents are Natalie Imbruglia (singer, actress), John Malcovich (Con Air, Being John Malcovich) etc. Johnny English is a perefect comedy.. and just to note, my favorite scene is when he has his partner Bough play the contents of the DVD he confiscated! You wanna know what is on it... well, watch the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"A hilarious movie that one can watch with a family and not worry about the profanity or vulgarity so common these days. Rowan Atkinson did a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny English is NOT a spoof!","review":"I'm getting very tired of great movies being marketed incorrectly. Super Troopers is another great example of the idiocy of movie promoters. Johnny English is a great spy movie. It's got everything including a very sympathetic hero. Rowan Atkinson is NOT Mr. Bean or Blackadder. He is an actor and a darn good one as this movie very ably proves. The movie is not over the top spoof like Austin Powers nor is it a serious spy movie like James Bond. It's just a spy movie with a great plot, an evil bad guy, some pretty cool action scenes, some great comic moments, and a flawed hero. The bad reviews and negative comments must be from people who were expecting an entirely different sort of movie. Watch with an open mind because I very highly recommend this movie to everyone, young and old, who likes an action movie with some laughs. I hope that producers take note of its success and give us more Johnny English in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly hilarious if a bit repetitive...........","review":"Ah.......... reminds me of the good 'oll Mr. Bean shorts Mr. Atkinson used to do........Atkinson makes a great Austin Powers meets James Bond meets Mr. Bean-type character. Add all those characters up and what do you get? Johnny English. English is completely inept and is most of all, clumsy. In one scene, he reaches over a desk to pick up a pen and in the act he accidently shoots the poor lady in the neck with a tranquilizer dart........... clumsiness at its best......John Malkovich's French accent is utterly hilarious. Another villain with a large ego........ Malkovich plans to dispose of the British monarchy and make the UK into one huge prison where all the ultra-criminals are sent to.The movie was so funny that I was laughing to the point of tears and at that point I had to get a drink of water because my throat was dry. The funny scenes get a little repetive but with Rowan Atkinson acting, they just add a new plate to the already bountiful meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This book is for elitist bench racers. There is almost no (read ZERO) math. It is all narration and supposition from a very non-technical standpoint. It is really a HISTORY of competition car suspension as the better part of the book is spent describing outdated suspension designs in very general terms. If you think you are going to come away with any kind of working knowledge or any knowledge period, don't bother. It is stuffily written and poorly organized. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"theatre games for rehersal","review":"This is a MUST for any director... I LOVED and use it constantly.... I bought it cheaper at a bookstore... but it is great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me !","review":"I had no luck getting this to pick up digital signals. I tried everything. A pair of old rabbit ears lying on the entertainment center picked up 4 digital stations. When I held them up I got 6. This thing with both UHF & VHF -- and amplification -- picked up only 1 station intermittently. I returned it. Yes, it's made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"We live within a 10-25 mile radius of all broadcast towers in our metro region. After reading so many positive reviews for this product, we decided to give it a try.Our results were nowhere near what others have experienced. The only time either analog or digital broadcast signals were available for viewing was with the unit turned off. It was only able to pick up about half of the stations, which is significantly worse performance than traditional \\"rabbit ears.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Broadcast TV reception in my area is admittedly very difficult: only two channels are available using cheap rabbit ears. Unfortunately, the Philips amplified antenna produced no improvement. In fact the weaker of the two available channels was slightly worse with the Philips model. I'd hoped it would bring in a couple more local broadcast channels, but no such luck. The cable installer comes tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I live about 20 miles SW of the Empire State Building transmitters. I thought this item might improve analog reception and maybe also pick up some hdtv broadcasts. No such luck. I'm sticking with my 13-yr old Recoton amplified antenna. I'm not picking up hdtv stuff but at least the old Recoton makes analog broadcasts decently watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit DOA","review":"I can't really say whether this unit was good or not. It did not work on either of the two TV's that I tried it on. My first clue should have been the arc that kept sparking every time I connected the power jack to the unit. NOT a happy customer here... Unit promptly returned to vendor... I will not order another of this brand..."},{"rating":"1","title":"manufactures defective design flaw","review":"the connector on the back of this entenna to hook up your t.v. to has either a big design flaw or philips is just to cheep to add a 1/2 cent part to fix the problem. the problem lies inside where the cable connector is sauldered to the board. there is no support for the connector other than the connector itself and the solder holding it in place. over time and normal ware and tear the solder joint break free from the circuit board hence causing an open circit between the entenna and your t.v.. I have already had to repair 4 of these in thwe period of as many months. the easy and quick fix of course would be to use the mounting nut, (which in many cases is included with the coax cable plug/connector) to the plastic case once the unit is assembled... this entenna can be fixed at home siply by resoldering the connector to the circuit bord and getting a mounting nut from radio shack..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips antenna","review":"The antenna I received was not the product number I ordered, so maybe the opinion is skewed. One tech support call said it was probably the wrong antenna; the second said the number had been changed but the antenna was the same. In any case, it was totally useless. The TV would pick up only one or two channels when the antenna was plugged into the wall, even if it wasn't connected to the TV itself. Furthermore, tech support said I needed to aim the antenna directly at the broadcast tower for each channel (within 10 degrees), and that I had to rescan the full channel range every time I changed channels. I said that was ridiculous, the response was \\"That's what HD is like.\\" I've gone back to the cheap antenna that gets everything but 6 and 12, and am considering a roof antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Connector - Who knows if it works???","review":"I picked this antenna because of the overall good reviews regarding DTV reception. Unfortunately the coaxial connector on the back broke off while I was (VERY gently because it felt fragile) screwing on the coaxial cable. Exactly as KoolBreeze described in an earlier review. I am glad I purchased through Amazon since returns are easy, and I'll shop for another brand. Stay away from this one due to the shoddy construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap!! (manufacturing)","review":"I bought 1 of these and it seems to work well. One antenna was loose in its socket and wobbles, but I figured, well... this thing never moves. So I bought #2. The coax connection on the back fell off when I was spinning on the cable. I tried to pull it back into place which twisted it off the thin (thinner than a paper clip) wire that connects to it inside. With some soldering and glue I got it fixed to a point of kinda working. I don't understand the gain, both of them automatically go up to full gain when left alone. They get channels on low gain levels, but I come back later and all 5 lights are on. I'll have to check the manual, or buy a different antenna. I'd suggest the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get it out of the box without it breaking","review":"I bought this product the other day & as I was extending the antenna arm for the first time, it broke off at the base. Thinking it was a fluke, I exchanged it for another. As I was removing the plastic packaging protector from the cable connection to attach the cable, the entire connector broke off with the plastic.You've got to wonder how well the parts you can't see are put together...maybe this is why it seems not to work for a lot of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as others have said;","review":"Perhaps it's hit or miss; however the unit, in my opinion, is overpriced. I'd be willing to pay $20 for it tops. The unit feels cheap and does not perform as great as one would expect given the price tag.The reception is not acceptable; I receive 3 HD channels out of about a dozen."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Performance not seen.","review":"I bought the Philips to replace an older powered indoor antenna. I expected some improvement in reception. The older powered antenna is 10 years old and was rated at less than half the db gain. I saw no difference in reception on all channels from 2 to 66 and this was running the Philips at full amplification. I also had to run the Philips at full amplification to match to match the older antenna. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Choice for VHF","review":"Bought one of these antennas for DTV use about a year ago. Had a lot of trouble picking up stations that my older (broken) rabbit ears got just fine. The UHF section worked great - it was the VHF part that didn't work well. Quit using it after about a month and bought a Terk HDTVi unamplified antenna (cheaper, too) that works great.I work at a local TV station and after the analog shutoff we got a lot of calls from people with problems. At least 10 viewers I personally talked to that had bought this antenna were having problems. When we talked them into getting something else their issues went away. (All were related to pickup of VHF stations.)So if you only need to pick up UHF stations, it would be OK. If you need to see VHF stations I would NOT RECOMMEND this antenna. There are cheaper units on the market that perform much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than old rabbit ears","review":"Recently purchased this product to see if it would provide my dad with better reception on his older analog TV. He had some old rabbit ears taped to the TV and couldn't get some stations. He is in an urban situation with TV stations no more than 25 miles at best, most closer. The Phillips product was actually worse than the rabbit ears at both UHF and VHF channels. Amplification did not help at all. Definetly useless and returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amplify what?","review":"Take a look at that antenna. It measures approximately 7x5 inches. That's not much of a signal gatherer. Once gathered, amplifying it does no good. Multiply (amplify) 0 by ten and you get 0! Also, this antenna boasts a 50 db gain from amplification. This is not true. It only gives about 30.Save yourself time, money, and frustration by buying the Eagle Aspen DTV2Buhf antenna. The DTV2Buhf antenna works great, and is actually smaller than the Phillips because you don't need to extend di-poles. The reception is much better with the DTV2Buhf, and believe it or don't, the 19\\" x 13\\" DTV2Buhf is quite attractive right out in the open. It looks good, and works great. This Phillips antenna disappoints in both respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amplification does not help","review":"I live 25 miles away from the Chicago area TV towers. From what I read, that is as far as \\"rabbit ears\\" should be able to pull in a TV signal very well. I was using an unamplified antenna and was having trouble receiving several channels. I was hoping that this unit would pulling in signals be better because of the amplification designed in. It looked good from the box. SAVE YOUR MONEY. It worked worse than my old antenna that did not have amplification. It might work well if you live near towers but when you live on the reception edge don't expect to make this product work. Sent it back and the merchant and Amazon have been excellent to work with returning and refunding my money. Thank you both. That is why I shop through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phillips antenna","review":"It didn't work very wellI ended up giving it away to someone else.I bought an old RCA ANT 1250 which I usedto have.

I returned and continue use my old antenna but have to keep turn it to get better reception.

I seldom have to turn it to for most station even without use amplified antenna anymore. I found this model SCP030 selling at Amazon with cheaper price than Fry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amplifier gain decreases over time","review":"I'm currently on my second iteration of this model. The first one worked very well, pulling in about 16 channels in the N/E Philly area, about 10 miles away from the towers. Unfortunately, the variable gain controls and LED's would decrease over time, for example, after about 24 hours, if it were set at 40 DB, the next day it dropped to 30 DB, 48 hours to 20 DB etc. I went to Circuit city, and bought another, and this one was worse, with the gain dropping back to zero after 12 hours. I called the Philips customer support line, and after 32 minutes of long distance hold, I was told that this (these) units are defective and I should return them.The real shame of it all, is that when it worked, it worked well.

The 'old' antenna picks up 21 channels but the Philips one on pulls in 4. I live in town within 7 miles and clear shot of all the local stations. The amplified power boost did absolutely nothing to improve the signal on any channel. From the description on this antenna, I thought it would really improve my reception for digital and HD channels, but proved very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better amplified antennas","review":"I'm surprised at the fairly low rating this antenna has gotten. I have gone through a myriad of \\"rabbit ears\\" and this antenna is the best I have found so far. I actually have two now for a TV in the living room and one in the bedroom. What I like is that you don't need to re-tune every time you switch to a channel on a different band. No, it doesn't come close to an outdoor antenna mounted high up, but it does pull in all my local channels. Now that there are digital channels available, it also does quite good at pulling them in. I would certainly recommend this antenna to someone who is looking for a indoor solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor VHF reception","review":"Purchased the Philips high performance indoor UHF/VHF HDTV Antenna, it works great for our UHF transmitted channels, but our Fox network Ch. 10 WALA which is much closer to my residence will not come in at all.

With this antenna, I could get a maximum of 2 HD channels (actually both were from CBS so really 1 channel).

This product only can get one VHF (NBC) and another UHF(ABC) for me. Terk was able to get two UHF (ABC and CBS) station. My TV lives in the valley and second floor of three story townhouse. I was very dispointed. I purchased RCA Indoor/outdoor Antenna (18dB) from local W-Mart store. RCA was able to get all the UHF and VHF channels. I am very happy.

Needs adjusting for almost every channel, which sort of renders the TV's remote useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor construction - poor reception","review":"This antenna offered only marginal improvement over the cheap-o $9 basic antenna I purchased at Radio Shack. Worse, the cable port, or whatever you call it in the back where you plug in the cable to the tv, becomes easily unscrewed from the housing when you connect the cable or move the antenna around to get better reception. In short, it falls apart easily. I bought two antennas at the same time. Both have this problem. This is a low quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"I was very dissatisfied with the performance of this antenna.

I was hoping that the antenna would work well making the local channels have a great picture... the picture looked amazing... when the antenna worked. If you like to flip through channels this is not the right antenna for you. The ABC channel rarely worked, the CW was was hit and miss and a few other channels were hit and miss. The only channel that worked well was Fox. I read a review that said that it depends on the location of your residence so the antenna doesn't work where I live. My $5 radio shack antenna works better than this. The picture is not perfect but at least I can flip through channels with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible!!!","review":"UPS delivered this to me today. I intended to use it in my condo to pick up a few basic channels that my RCA rabbit ears wouldn't (FOX, CBS, MYTV, CW)I got two out of those four channels to pick up.

I was very gentle, and it still broke off...I want my $40 back. Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"First let me point out that I do have a HDTV converter box. After one of the stations switched to digital in my area I was no longer able to receive it so I decided to try this antenna. What a major disappointed, 4 channels are unwatchable compared to the old Radio Shack Model: 15-1892 Catalog #: 15-1892 I've been using. The antenna feels very flimsy and fragile. I have tried 2 of theses antennas because the first one was broken in the box and I exchanged.
