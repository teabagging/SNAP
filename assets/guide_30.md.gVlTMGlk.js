I watched this because I wanted to watch real streetball, not some overproduced, trying-to-make-it-seem-cool camera/effects tricks.

The Green Monkeys' comic strip speaks to the sublime, existential person in us all without catering to a lofty audience. The humor comes from a simple, \\"I know exactly what you mean\\", appeal peppered sometimes with an enigmatic twist that makes you stop and wonder for a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD INTRO TO GIVENS STRATEGIES---VERY MOTIVATING!","review":"This cassette is a good introduction to Givens famous strategies. Some very good power packed strategies. I highly recommend the book of the same name and of course More Wealth Without Risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Charles Givens does an excellent job in explaining where people really lose money in life...in the red tape of taxes, banking, insurance and investments. I was broke and bought the book for $16. I couldn't put it down. I drove down the street and cut my vehicle insurance in half, after reading a few chapters. The saleman was mad, just like the book said he'd be. He had me overinsured. I can't say enough good about it. One drawback though, Charles Givens isn't for everyone. Read the book, \\"The millionaire next door\\". If you are an \\"Under Accumulator of Wealth\\" (UAW) then MR. Givens isn't for you. If you are a \\"Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth\\" (PAW) then Givens is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal relationship and Forever Friend...","review":"This book wonderfully presents God's personal interest in every part of our lives. For whatever reason, the book may not speak the same to every individual. I found myself excited to see such a profound book written to help searchers looking for a more personal relationship with God and to aid in getting beyond several walls that certain practice of religion has built. It further illustrates the true power and freedom found within a continual and personal walk with our Creator and Redeemer that just attending church or schooling at a seminary cannot provide. I can personally testify, with many stories in my life, to the fact that God does care about the minute details of our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's not get carried away...","review":"I wasn't nearly as impressed with this book as the other reviewers seemed to be. I liked Hohnberger's attitude of thankfulness and humility. But, I think he's getting carried away when he claims that God is telling him not to forget his gloves, or tells him to check one part of the car engine and not another, and so on. (I think it's stuff like this that actually turns off a lot of people to God. And, yes, I am a Christian too, so don't try and tell me that I don't have faith...) I think books like \\"Escape to God\\" should be categorized, not as a \\"christian\\" book, but simply as personal opinion (like \\"Why I like Chocolate Ice Cream Better than Vanilla\\"). Then, I think I could recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential volume in any balanced WWII library","review":"Fussell has given us a breath of fresh air in the plethora of World War II literature. Anyone seeking a balanced view of that most important period would be well served by reading this book, which, inter alia, emphasizes the horrors not just of war itself, but of the ineptitude at all levels of society. A good tonic for the all the \\"feel good\\" writing about the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wildly uneven and entertaining book ...","review":"I have no sense of what the organizing concept of this book is. A chapter on soldier's personal reading lists lies beside a piece on the dangers of injury from the dismemberment of nearby soldiers. Bits on the cynical use of the war in advertising are juxtaposed with the inaccuracy of strategic bombing.All that said, this book delves into pieces of WWII history that are near forgotten and gives a vivid sense of what it might have been like. Some reviewers have said that the book is cynical and negative. I wasn't there, but it rings true to me and seems parallel what my father told me.If you want more on the 2nd Brigade overran 3rd Hitler Youth Jugend outside Walla Walla, stay away. If you want a more personal sense of what we were thinking, pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book.","review":"I certainly agree with the two previous reviews. I think the main problem is that Fussell went into World War II as a young man with his head full of youthful misconceptions (nothing unusual there), and then, when those misconceptions were rudely contradicted, decided that the fault lay not with himself for his lack of realism, but rather with the world (or the U.S. government) instead. \\"Confused\\" truly is the accurate summary for this book, which, when you consider that Fussel also wrote the first rate \\"The Great War and Modern Memory\\", is very disappointing. For a wartime memoir of a young man who went into battle with a minimum of fantasies, I would recommend George MacDonald Fraser's \\"Quartered Safely Out Here\\". Or if one wants to read about the soldier as victim (but without the self-pity), Guy Sajer's \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" or Vaino Linna's \\"The Unknown Soldier\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fussell goes to war himself and does not approve.","review":"I had read Fussell's The Great War prior to reading this one, and found chunks of it of real interest. I then read Wartime and found it unhappily stupid, except around the fringes. That we sided with Joe Stalin was one of those historical entanglements that are an obscene adjunct of the obscenity of war, but that we reacted to Hitler's unspeakable atrocities was not an obscenity but a necessity. Fussell had to serve in the war and did not like it, and who would blame him for that? But he spreads his dissatisfactions all around, with no apparent real sense of the times he lived in, and he does dishonor to any of the members of that war by his book. Of course he has every right to have written it; that's part of what was at stake in those battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"War ain't no picnic.","review":"Fussell attempts to capture what it was like being a combat soldier during WW II. He stresses the horror of the real thing as compared to the heroic, sanitized version that most people like to talk about. His tone is bitter, though, and also pro-British at the expense of the American soldiers. All of this, I think, is meant to shock us, but it's so heavy-handed that it doesn't, really. Fussell is a good writer, however, and this book is well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scholarly essays more than memoir","review":"I enjoyed listening to Mr. Fussell's commentary in Ken Burn's \\"The War\\" documentary and thought I might benefit from reading this book. This book consists mostly of essays, but I found it rather tedious to read at times----perhaps those who share his literary scholarship would appreciate this format more than a general audience. I did appreciate his sentiments about the absurd romanticism and the lack of shared sacrafice surrounding WW2---and am sympathetic to his obvious anger and resentment as a result. I would have preferred reading a memoir that was more of a straightforward, revealing narrative (omitting esoteric literary references) about his combat experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"human servitudes","review":"Well, as I think what the author want to say is that in WW II when any soldier of the Allied band confronted with Germans or Japanese he tried to shot the enemy, but a true pity! The uniform is made from onepiece and he can't resist the necessity of urinating and... These things don't happened to John Wayne, we agree, but it's that real war can't be repeated and his scenes essayed as cinema. Moreover, WW II was an entire unknown unrepeatable class of war form the beginning until the end. So Fussel joints a collection of misadventures very little heroical but I think unavoidable and necessary and over all, humane. At last Hitler perhaps had a private WC all time but he committed the highest mistake. Perhaps he was not humane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Time is Wartime When You're a Cranky Bitter Old Man","review":"A book that lies, Fussell presents his book as scholarly, when in fact it is a thinly veiled political manifesto rife with shoddy research, obvious bias, and evidence of no historical value (His habit of using fiction as evidence of historical truth is apalling and irritating). All in all, the book can be safely described as utter trash. Currently a doorstop to my dorm room."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe they sound good, but...","review":"for the most part, the 4 Seasons did not have hits with these cover versions of others hits; I will stick to their originals, thank you, like Sherry, Walk Like a Man, and of course, Dawn, go away, I'm no good for youuuuuu.....!!!! Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away","review":"This is a strong addition to face to face's highly influential history. I listened to this album, and I couldn't believe this band could be associated with the common opinion that punk is three chord garbage. I have not even owned it for more than 24 hours and I have listened to it over and over again. I can't get enough of the melodies. The songs are so catchy.Since last year, I have been starving for good music, and I am no longer hungry. Reactionary met all my ridiculously high expectations (not that they mean much, but still...) Thank you, face to face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reactionary to what? Quality?","review":"For a band that has earned a reputation as one of the best and most-respected punk rock bands in the genre, Face to Face's 2000 imprint, Reactionary, seems like a misstep. I'm in agreement with allmusic.com - it does take more than pissed off vocals and fast tempos to make a good punk album. Face to Face has unfortunately made an album here that is very average - ordinary message, weak lyrics, simple song structure - clearly not the benchmarks of one of punk's best and most respected bands. Check out self-titled or How to Ruin Everything to hear the band in top form. NOT ESSENTIAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Recovery","review":"Face to Face has successfully re-emerged from the disastrous \\"Ignorance is Bliss.\\" An excellent album, the tone is very similar to that of their self-titled album. For those who enjoyed that album, this one is definitely what you're looking for.The only thing that keeps critics from rating F2F's newer albums (minus Ignorance, of course) with \\"Don't turn away\\" is nostalgia. Get over it.The album is strong all the way through--the highlights, though, are \\"Hollow\\" \\"Just Like You Said\\" and \\"Solitaire.\\" And what else can you say about \\"Disappointed?\\" It's KROQ's third most requested song right now, seemingly their highest approval since \\"Disconnected.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Your Hopes Up","review":"After the disaster known as Ignorance Is Bliss, F2F rushes this ablum out a year later. Coincidence? I think not. Everything about this album is standard, from the adolescent lyrics and mediocre vocals to the annoyingly catchy choruses. F2F breaks no new ground. Although F2F attempted to recapture their old fans with their old style, this album still has some of the elements that made IIB one of the worst albums of last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try harder, guys.","review":"We all know that F2F can do better than this. Coming from the same band that did DTA, this is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as good as can be expected....","review":"F2F stopped making good music about 4 years ago, but this is one of their better albums since then. It's not as abysmal as their previous ablum, yet it's no where near Don't Turn Away. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from a punk band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Trash","review":"If there was any doubt after Ignorance is Bliss whether or not the band has sold out, there isn't anymore. F2F are basically puppets to their fans right now. The made this album to sound more like their old style after their fans rejected their new one. The problem is that they've lost that sound. This album sounds like a F2F cover band, not like the real thing. It's sad that it has come to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than IIB, but really nothing special.","review":"If you're expecting DTA or Big Choice, you're going to be a little disappointed. This album still has some of the elements of IIB that made many of their fans dump them. Mixed with this is the energy that the band had 7 years ago. Overall it's not a bad album, but F2F with never regain their former glory. This is no surprise considering that it's a completely different band now. If Amazon.com allowed half stars, I might be tempted to give this album 2 1/2 stars. My suggestion is not to buy this album if you are not a fan already. If you are new to F2F, start with Don't Turn Away. It's been a slow, but steady decline since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back In Full Force","review":"This cd is great. It comes with some old f2f and some new mellow f2f. This cd really made my day when i bought it, not like their last one, when i bough it and it has been sitting in the back of my cd case for a year. Long live the real face to face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to what they do best","review":"If you liked face to face's last cd, Ignorance Is Bliss, chances are you won't like this. F2F is back to what they do best playing high quality energetic punk rock. I highly recommend this cd to punk fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to F2F?","review":"Face to Face is and will always be one of my favorite bands, but I have to say this cd was a great disappointment. When I first bought Ingnorence is bliss, I thought that was an experimental album. If I were you I wouldn't waste my money on this album, but if you are a true fan like I am go get the used cd. If you want to spend alot of money on a good F2F album, find a Japanese import called, standards and practices. It is a complilation of cover songs of bands like The Smiths, Ramones, Fugazi, and the Pixies. Spend your money wisely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"This is a great album, and their rendition of Talk Talk is fantastic. Face to Face never disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"More pop trash from a dead punk band.","review":"F2F may have wet dreams about being Blink 182, but it just isn't going to happen.

If I had noticed the shipping charge was larger than the price, I might have found something that looked better at Walmart for less.The only good thing I can say about it, is the pieces were cut and fitted well. It's very poorly sanded, parts of it were sprayed with black primer before coating the whole thing in a flat white paint that looks like plaster. The paint has blobs and bits of wood debris embedded in it. Then it was scraped in various places to expose the black primer to look \\"distressed\\". The design scratched into the doors is very ugly. The wooden pegs on the knobs weren't glued, and pulled off as soon as I opened the doors.With some sanding and semi-gloss paint, it might be a nice little cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!","review":"This is a very cute cabinet and from the picture it looks pretty big right?

The \\"Burglar\\" series actually is an unrealistic joke or farce, similar to the once-so-great Lawrence Sanders' alcholic, drunken \\"McNally's\\" series, cashed in by both authors with their old fames. Detour from these authors and save some money for those who still could write with enthusiasm and a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time read of author","review":"I just finished Michael Connelly's fabulous Harry Bosch series and purchased Lawrence Block's Everbody Dies. This book is not a winner. It ambles through the plot becoming very difficult to follow. Hopefully Mr. Block's Matt Scudder character fairs better in earlier outings; this one is plain bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful mystery writer","review":"This is my first Laurence Block mystery and I am quite impressed. Block writes exceptionally well. He does not use many more words than necessary to convey the story. His characters are very believable. Matthew Scudder (the private detective and main character) is both likeable and vulnerable. The book not only made me think about who did the awful deed but also made me think about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Block's 'less than best' is better than most","review":"There are no bad Matthew Scudder books. While I agree thatEverybody Dies is not as good as some of the previous Scudder books,Lawrence Block on any bad day can out write almost anyone else doing this kind of thing. There is a familiarity of place, character and action about these books that always satisfies. The writing is spare and evocative and seems perfectly tuned to the violence and the moral ambiguity of the world that Scudder inhabits.I don't know what others sense as lacking in this book, and I doubt that I can put my own impressions clearly, but it seems that as Scudder's domestic scene has become more stable, some edge has been lost from the character. I think I liked it better when his woman was still turning tricks and he seemed more lost and unhappy. It added a dimension to the stories that I miss.Nevertheless, I will continue to read Block's Scudder series as long as he wants to turn them out. They are a fine way to pass a few hours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawrence Block's best effort","review":"I am a big Robert Parker fan. I think he writes the best dialog of any of todays active mystery writers, but LB's latest two novels seriously challenge Parker's preeminence. What truly amazes me is that LB somehow manages to convey to the reader that a character is lying or suspicious without presenting obvious contradictions. It is as if you are in the mind of the protagonist wondering \\"Why did he say that? Why would he want to know that? What else is going on here?\\" And LB does this with a brevity of words that should make Robert Parker jealous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value, Value, Value","review":"I am am very pleased with these speakers.

That is, until I got to the last page or so. As an educator of children with autism I found the ending quite disturbing. The sister in the story explains autism very sweetly to the girl, then takes the girl away from her brother to play with her herself. The book seemed to me to indirectly teach children that if you come across a child with autism it is best to ignore them because they have no interest in you. A much more appropriate ending would in fact be to have the sister teach the girl how to interact with her brother appropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stereotypical view of autism","review":"As a parent of an autistic son, I was very disappointed that this book was an example of one face of autism only; that of an aloof, non-verbal child who spins.

This book is not it. I was extremely disappointed that there were next to none pictures or diagrams of the workings of a sumarines innards. I wanted to learn how a submarine is designed, the mechanics of it. This offered little tidbits, and some interesting first person experiences, but nothing that would have made me purchase this book had I the chance to have a look at it in a store before purchasing it.I often felt that it skirted the real subject because of security issues as it spends most of its explinations on nuclear submarines.

Sure enough, electric guitars jangle, acoustic guitars shimmer, and descending scale \\"Strawberry Fields\\" mellotron flourishes hum merrily all the way through Ken Sharp's \\"Happy Accidents\\". While the music is somewhat derivative, Sharp's upfront admission of influences and his obvious enthusiasm in recreating a late 60's-mid 70's British pop-rock sound wins you over. I should mention that Sharp's singing voice, while quite adequate, may take a certain period of adjustment for the listener (that's just my opinion...I could be wrong!). A perfect \\"summer album\\" for those who hanker for the halcyon days of 20/20 and the Three O'Clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!!!","review":"I was searching for a book to give my niece and came across this one. I picked it up and before wrapping it up and handing it over I decided to give it a quick read. I am so glad I did! This book is absolutely wonderful! The author has captured the voice and world of children impeccably. This is an incredibly funny and touching story about a group of kids in the Rebel Rescue Squad who set out to solve the mystery of a missing boy, Matthew. To say anymore would spoil the fun.

This album is a compilation of some of his best solo work live. From the the wham bam slammin'rockin' cover version of The Velvet UnderGround's White light/White Heat to the very tender, beautifilly played instrumental Sweet Dreamer, this album showcases his many talents as a player, singer and arranger. I think Ronson ranks right up there with all of those classic \\"Guitar Gods\\" like Clapton, Hendrix, Beck and Page. And this Live album proves it.

Provided that one affirms that position, he or she may find this book useful. Perhaps my principal concern is that this book was written for the newer Christian who may not be aware of other positions. Bilezikian often argues in such a manner that the reader would assume his perspective is unassailable, when in fact he simply fails to note arguments to the contrary. This tendency is particularly noticeable in his dealings with eschatology. In this regard, the widely held conservative envangelical position is dealt with in an almost disdainful manner.In sum, there are other books available which are more academically neutral (and, I would say, honest)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christianity101","review":"Was very disappointed in the condition of the book.

I think most of these people would be better served watching a \\"Two and Half Men\\" marathon on FX. Roger Ebert gave this a half star? Well, no kidding, he is 120 years old. But, if your sense of humor is a little on the deviant side, well, this movie was made with you in mind. Deadpan insanity and lots of insanely funny cameos by guys like Will Ferrel and Will Forte (among others). I have to admit that I was not blown away by the first viewing, but now find it more amusing after each viewing. If you like \\"Workaholics\\" and early \\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\" episodes, you will like this. If you are easily offended or somewhat square, you will be offended and put off.

I think it could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. It isn't just bad, but even in the weird and bizarre scenes it amazingly fails to be interesting.

I don't know what Amazon's protocols are for these reviews. Is one allowed to use obscene language? I will not, but this movie has gratuitous obscenity, violence and vomit-inducing attempts at humor involving human excrement. Did someone actually make money doing this?

The constant, insistent, nudge-nudge, \\"ain't we ironic and witty comic geniuses\\" elbows finally did their damage, or ...2) Appearances by Zach Galifianakis, Jeff Goldblum, Will Ferrell and (not) Johnny Depp depressed me so much I needed to lie down and think of the good work that they have done - in any movie except this one. (Actually the scenes by Galifianakis, Goldblum and Ferrell were the high points of the movie - from there on it wasn't just downhill it was Olympic downhill with rockets strapped to your back.)Save your money and skip this drivel, or, if you're like me watching it 'free' as part of Amazon Prime, your time.P.S. Robert Loggia still says that eleven-letter word better than anyone this side of Chris Rock. And yes, he is better than the rest of the film as well.P.P.S.

Yes, the male penis is a funny instrumentality, but I stopped laughing hysterically at it when I was 13. If you are going to go for the crotch, make it funnier.

You've seen the show, the movie's not much different. As for the disc though, the Blu-Ray version is packed full of deleted scenes, extended scenes, interviews, commercials... it's fairly exhaustive, and makes for a pretty decent value.Packed full of Awesome Show favorites, fans of the show are destined to love this. One weird thing though: there are some almost intentional cutscenes that look like placeholders for commercials. An Adult Swim: After Dark kind of presentation seems almost inevitable, but in any case, I thought it detracted from the production value a bit. Also, David Liebe Hart fans will undoubtedly find themselves under-served. So, those are holding me back from the five-star treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.

Of her four remarkable discs, my very favorite is whichever one I am playing at the time. She probes rich Spiritual Truth and everyday personal life events in clear, common language. The variations she establishes with her voice and the musical layers she puts down on each track means that her music never seems to get old, even with repeated listening.

This book is a great fast reminder of the main points.For the reviewer that called it a downer/sexist, maybe she doesn't realize that after the birth, you won't have the time nor the inclination to take care of yourself (even showers!), much less get a pedicure, etc. Your priorities change, so now is the time to indulge yourself in whatever will make you feel good. Also, being fat and bloated can make you feel yucky even if you have a great excuse to be so, especially after the novelty has worn off (2nd and 3rd times).

It looks cool and good quality. I'm 5'7\\" and on the chubby side, so I got a size large and the muscle chest is really big and makes me look fat. Also, the cape is attached to the mask so it's a little confusing to put on. Besides that, this is a good costume and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freakin' hot (not the good hot)","review":"Costume is hot. Like all polyester costumes, this is already uncomfortable, but the muscle chest really traps the heat and makes it too hot to wear at room temperature for any length of time. The cowl and cape are one piece so if you plan on using a different mask plan on buying a separate cape as well. The belt is jus fabric that ties in the back.

I wanted it because the picture shows a nice white LED at the tip that could be used for fun effects. The wand came, and the LED is RED, not WHITE. It doesn't turn on while you are holding the button, and off when you release it, but instead it flashes a few times and turns back off, while making a ghastly noise. I am not pleased with this at all.I'm hoping I can open the wand up, cut the wires to the speaker, and replace the red LED for a white one.I should have just built one myself to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"Cheap, fun, and does the job.

Beyone the content, the book consists of many multiple idea sentences and paragraphs, which make the reader repeatedly stop and ask, \\"what?\\"All in all, I would have quit after the 3rd chapter (figured i had to give it a chance) if i wasn't required to write a book report on the ENTIRE book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent product","review":"I have owned Alpine estereos before.

That's not a joke either. it's like watching someone self-destruct. A train wreck of a brain-damaged punch drunk \\"stunt man.\\"Stories of coke binges, morhpine injections (not to mention injecting alcohol) and careless sexual encounters leave Steve-o looking less like a comedic fool as MTV portrays him and more like a plain-ol jerk.I hope this guy doesn't pro-create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!!","review":"I was very disappointed with this dvd.

I was reading the reviews on the Steve-o videos that this site sells. A lot of them amde me sick to my stomach. These videos are extreme. Do people not know how to read the back of the cover and look at the cover art? I respect Steve-o very much for doing what he does. Sure, everything he does may not be the best idea but he is entertaining. He is out doing something that noone else would so. Thats his style. His videos keep you in your seat and make you wanna watch it. I have all 3 of the Don't try this at home videos and I plan on buying \\"The Early Years\\" when it comes on in August 25th, 2004 (sorry if the date is wrong, but its somewhere around that speculated area).

I know I wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a HUGE fan of CKY series and even of the \\"tamer\\" Jackass stuff. This one was terrible and just went too far. Most of the time Steveo was totally tanked or burnt and could barely speak on camera. There was absolutely NO production value in this. If you like watching drunken frat boys get nude and do the pseduo-homesexual male rampage act we're all used to seeing at college keggers, then this is for you. Even the girls in these (who normally provide some sort of jiggly entertainment) came off as cheap drunk tarts better left as scenery.Otherwise, don't expect nearly the quality of the CKY series. I'll take Bam's stuff over Stevo anyday. Dude this [was bad].

It's crude, it's disgusting, it's completely sophomoric and bad. Therefore, it is the PERFECT DVD to slap into your system and play with the sound down and your stereo crankin' tunes. Despite the initial \\"shock and disgust\\" that my friends attempt to display, it's amazing how mesmerized they become as Steve-O snorts hot curry, lights himself on fire and staples himself to himself. I'm an intelligent sensitve guy and I'm trying my hardest to find the right woman.. Steve-O straps a urinal to himself and he's getting more tail than Sinatra. Go figure. You like Jackass? This is Jackass without the fuzzed out genitals and TV guidelines.

It is interesting but I was very disapointed on the length of it. Not long at all. It wasn't worth what I spent on it but I love Steve-O so whatever I will get over it. It is basically him just doing stupid thing that really I have already seen him do. If you have seen any of the shows or the movies Jackass he does some of the same things on this. Also there is some stuff that he has done on Steve-O Out On Bail and also some from the Wildboyz. I would say though if you like Steve-O and the [...] he does buy it.

Items that would seem like no-brainers are not included in the package (including a power adapter, audio/data cables, or even batteries). Basically, the failure to include a power supply renders the product inoperable out-of-the-box. These items would have been inexpensive to include and would have paid for themselves many times over in terms of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This is one of those movies that has great potential but fell well short largely due to the constraints of trying to tell a complex story within a short period of time etc...

This vibrantly colorful biographical depiction of the life of a woman (the 'picture bride') is beautifully pictured too.

This was an overview of a life of a man who should be honored by all the world as an icon for justice, for all men. It was a great let down that the author didn't follow the reporting that had been done previously and refrain from writing in such a mean spirited manner.

Granted, Garfield isn't alone in his distaste for the more recent versions of his chosen genre (I have seen similar criticism in horror films, although a few with actual merit). His dislike for modern, post 1950 Westerns is evident, and he continually drives home that fact over and over. Since this book was published in the early 80's, he may have never seen restored versions of Italian Westerns, whose butchered prints were so prevalent then. Not that it would matter, as he likely would hate them regardless. There is some good analysis, if you weed through the constant grouching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit from Big Idea!","review":"My son (age 2) loves this book!

They are comfortable out of the box. The waterproof works for awhile, but they do not take a beating. The soles are not solid rubber. They are hollow and quickly fall apart with any type of extended wear - mine lasted a few weeks of serious hiking and now 5 weeks into hiking they are completely un-useable. The only thing between my heels and the ground is the waterproof lining and the piece of paper they have for insoles. If you are going on vacation and need some boots that need no working in to feel comfortable these are worth it. Do consider them disposable however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review ... in the 3rd Dimension","review":"This collection is just too cool for words. If you are an adult who is still drawn to the quirky offerings of Adult Swim on Comedy Central, this collection might just be for you. It's got the same quirky, non-mainstream feel. Don Hertzfeldt's simply drawn stick figure cartoons, for example, bring out the best in absurd humor. Cuts like \\"Billy's Balloon\\" and \\"Intermission in the 3rd Dimension\\" literally had me laughing until I cried.As a whole, the DVD is a bit uneven. \\"Cathedral,\\" in particular, didn't seem to fit quite right. I'd say the split is about 75 percent humor and 25 percent drama. If you are a fan of \\"adult\\" animation, I would definitely add this collection to your wish list. If you are more of a passing fan, I'd try and find it at a movie rental place first. Good luck, it might be pretty hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not as brilliant as i expected it to be","review":"some shorts were nice,but i expected somehow more,according to the ratings of other reviewers,so if you choose this dvd,it's not a must,it's ok,but not more."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near as good as the theatre","review":"I would like to voice my disipointment. There were quite a few clips I would have definately rather seen then what was displayed.

Apart from the story of the Emancipation Proclamtion painting that was altered to show Lincoln and not Seward as the central character Mr. Taylor adds nothing new to the story. He could have reassessed the Lincoln/Seward relationship on the grounds that he knew when he wrote his book that Lincoln never sent the letter in reply to the \\"April Fools\\" memo, a fact that Van Deusen was unaware of. His failure to do so and to invent a meeting between the two men labels him a poor historian.Alan Lowe. Manchester Metropolitan University. England."},{"rating":"2","title":"a careful detailed a retelling of a complex man's life","review":"This book is fascinating in that it describes Seward as a complex mix of idealism and political ambition. He dearly wanted to be president but served Lincoln and Johnson faithfully. He had a vision of what America could be, was always interested in inmproving the young nation's infrastructure, reformed prisons as NY's governor, as Lincoln's Secretary of State, he kept France and England from supporting the confederacy, and almost single handedly arranged the purchase of Alaska.

I could not find one redeeming feature in it. None of the characters were at all likable, believable, intelligent (the constant use of \`big words' was off-putting), or individuals you cared anything about. The dialogue was as predictable as it was hum-drum. The story line was a cross between far-fetched and science fiction which morphed into a convoluted, jumbled mess. We were left to believe that had only the people of this small community in South Carolina listened to this crazed Wingo family all would have turned out for the best.Some excuse it as mere southern gothic, I think not.

The only two drawbacks we've seen so far is that the tunnel cannot be secured to the tent so it typically comes loose a few times aday depending on the direction our son crawls through it. But he thinks it's fun to \\"repair\\" so not a deal braker. The other less good thing is that the straps to secure the opening open are placed pretty low so they don't work very well.

He loves the tunnel and tent and gets pretty rambuncious with it. He stands outside and jumps on the sides when not rolling around the ground inside the tunnel. It seems to go with him and spring right back. No tearing, no poles breaking. I was surprised. I especially love to recieve pictures of my grandson still playing in his tent every day.

It begins with the Roman period & continues until the \\"present\\". Depending on which edition of the book you have, this could be 2002/3 [before the US invasion of Iraq] or 2005.A drawback to the book is that there is no overall index, just an index of names.

It is marred however by a week and contrived ending (almost like he had to hurry up and get it to his publisher or something)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I wish there were more books as funny as this one. I can still quote a few passages from it, and it has been a few years since i last read it. Especially if you've been involved in any large corporation, you will especially appreciate the absurdities, but it's just an incredibly funny book. I used to read Stanly Bing in Esquire and I just love his writing. I wish there were more like this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SATIRE OR REALITY?","review":"\\"LLOYD: WHAT HAPPENED\\" IS BILLED AS A FICTIONAL SATIRE OF THE CORPORATE WORLD IN THE 90'S.

IF YOU HAVE EVER WONDERED WHY MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND LOWER LEVEL CORPORATE JOBS DISAPPEAR OVER NIGHT, READ LLOYD. IT'S A VERY FUNNY AND INSIGHTFUL BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close for comfort","review":"This book describes corporate life in a way that is too close for comfort. Although the scenarios are stretched just beyond belief there is a kernel of reality. Very funny in places, easy to relate. The ending is wierd, however, and knocks off a star from my rating. A worthwhile recreational read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"The author spends to much time on telling us about Lloyds family, shopping trips and his affair.

Both their creation and their application throughout the ages. A fun book to read and easy to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for enthusiasts and reference","review":"Good: maximum information, well-organized, well-written (easy to read and concise), great picturesBad: not for mobile use (paperback version would be better/lighter)I am a rock/gem/mineral/metal enthusiast, and this is the best reference book I have found. I may get the paperback version because the hardcover version is too heavy to take with me to museums."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!!!","review":"Not only does this book have full color pictures and GREAT information, it goes into detail about every single rock and mineral, many of which I have never heard of. I have been checking this book out from my school library for a long time and actually tried to buy it from my school library. Now I have one of my own! I am a scientist and I love to read books like this in leisure! I gather lots of information in it to write my many articles!

I know I did. It's not at all the vibrant orange shown... more like the color of an orange flavored Sweet Tart or maybe a vitamin C chewable... They should take a new picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I thought this video was super cute and I think a few of the negative reviews are being too harsh. It is corky and not a perfect video but it's supposed to be educational with a funny twist. Noone out there expecting should just depend on just one source for information. If you want to laugh and smile and still learn a lot about pregnancy period...than get it! It's worth. Although, it doesn't serve much purpose after the baby because there's really no information on how to take care your baby for years to come. This is strictly a pregnancy tape. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you ONLY want an Epidural","review":"Although I like \\"Wendy\\" and a lot of the information presented for the prenatal and postpartum sections of the video I found L&D; the information lacking. It lacked a since of empowerment of the mother and father. This is after all their birth! It didn't show any ideas for comfort measures. It didn't give the risk of the hospital procedures or options to avoid them.It gives ALL the responsibility and credit to the doctors. I found that sad. A real education goes much deeper than teaching you how to be a good patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally for dummies","review":"Don't waste your money on this series. If you are really interested, get it from your library instead. You won't want to watch it more than once, if that. It tries to be cute but ends up being tedious and dumbed down. Most of the info contained in the videos is obvious and they take waaay too long to say it. You could learn much more from a couple of good texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good overview of pregnancy and childbirth","review":"My husband and I watched these DVDs at the beginning of my pregnancy and enjoyed them very much. I had been doing lots of reading so I knew most of the information but my husband felt like it gave a good overview of the crucial information you need to know. It is also presented in a clear and relaxed manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a [money], don't buy it !!","review":"It's a shame that a very good movie like this, it's been sold with such a lousy quality. The transfer looks like it's been done from a positive worn out print-ultra contrasted, scratched, dirty image. I'm no talking about a few spots on the frame, I'm talking about that it's virtually impossible to even look the entire film. I even feel like asking for a refund. I had the chance to enjoy this film in its theatrical release and the cinematography out of Emmanuel Lubezki was stunning, there's nothing left of it in this DVD. The people at vanguard-cinema should be embarrased for distributing something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I dug this out of the closet at the radio station I used to work at, and it is REALLY good. All, except one, of the tunes are originals. Of course, it was free, so I'm a little biased. But if I took the chance, I think it is well worth the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding blend of fact and fiction...","review":"This is a truly unique book. In 1987, a cache of letters, albums and clippings was discovered in the attic of a house in Kingston, Ontario, the bits and pieces of an unknown woman's life. Among the overflowing boxes and stuffed sugar sacks was a collection of letters from the months immediately after the First World War, a one-way correspondence written in pencil on flimsy paper. From this careless jumble of papers, there emerged unforgettable characters and an extraordinary story: a convict, a village girl, a penitentiary, and the town that lived in its shadow. The Convict Lover is a dazzling blend of historical detective work and imaginative recreation. You'll be spellbound by the relationship that unfolds through the very secretive, unconventional contacts made between one Joseph Cleroux and his link to the outside world, Phyllis Halliday. This book is an extraordinary stroke of literary good fortune. A wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Much!","review":"It never did hold my attention. The description of the film made it more interesting than it actually was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"The only parts I enjoyed were views of Shanghai, The Bund, Pudong as it reminded me of my trip there. If the idea of the film was to convey that there's an element of lawlessness and aimlessness in Shanghai, then yes, that was achieved. You can always sense some danger in Shanghai. But I mean, you can't even feel sorry for these people!! I judge a film by how much it keeps me awake...unfortunately, both my husband and I nodded off a few times during the film. Sad, as most indi films have been well worth my time...and don't mistake my \\"name\\" to think I don't watch serious films - I've seen my fair share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick and durable","review":"This tape is very thick and durable.

The rest of the record is acceptable but all the same style. They could change it up a little I think. I am impressed with the talent of the gentleman who plays the vibes and drums, well done. All in all a decent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bike Rack","review":"I like the flexibility of this rack. I bought to carry bikes with my SUV. I had the option of putting them on a roof rack (too much work), inside the cabin (goodbye camping gear) or out back off of the hitch. I was worried about a hitch-mount because I thought it would be too much hassle to get the rear door opened when the rack was mounted to the hitch. This hitch easily (removing a pin) leans back about 45 degrees and hits a solid stop, allowing the rear door to be opened. Depending on how many bikes you're toting, it can be a bit of a struggle to tilt back up to lock, but all in all I'll take that disadvantage given the ability to get in the back if I absolutely need to. Also, the arms drop down and lock when you're not carrying a bike. Great flexibility and I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I\`am not very good to english so what do you meen?","review":"I like the video bacause you here something about the band and I think that is fun.

It's a disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zapp and Capone-e on the dance floor...","review":"I was a bit skeptical about how a whole album Mr.Capone-e and Zapp would sound. It seemed like too stark of a contrast, Chicano gangster and the classic funk of Zapp Troutman. However, the result is a great album. This is Capone-e's album, but it wouldn't have sounded nearly as good without Zapp's contribution. Almost all of the beats are new. The song 'Hatevine' uses the beat from Zapp & Roger's version of Grapevine, also the song 'I'm a player' uses the beat from 'slow & easy'. I like the the beats on 'Beware of my crew' and 'Lowrider' the most. Capone-e's style is flawless as always. He flips spanish & english perfectly and crosses genres several times during the album. Zapp's talkbox is the chorus in many songs and Capone-e always picks up where zapp leaves off. Both artists sound well together in each song, neither one really stands out in many songs.I rate this album 5 out 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW YOU'LL FIND OUT STEVE ALLEN'S REAL TALENT!","review":"Our friend Steve Allen recently sent us a copy of this album of his jazz compositions performed by the unbelievable Tom Kubis Big Band.

We bought it in 2002 when our 1st born came. We've been using it through 3 kids. It was great until the chair didn't swivel one day. When we took it apart we found out it was because the rubber liner in the ball-bearing mechanism is cheaply made and comes out. The ball-bearing mechanism is what makes it swivel - without it, you have a wobbly glider. Our problem now is trying to get in touch with Jardine so we can replace the ball-bearing mechanism. Easier said than done. We've been searching for 5 months and we're SOL on this one. Bummer because the chair is comfortalbe, beautiful and is something you want to keep for years and years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, freshest food that I've ever tasted!","review":"I have used this book more than any other cookbook in my home.

I, for one, have started asking myself What Would Jesus Do? Unfortunately, looking aesethically, the writing style isn't all that great. Sure, it's got a wonderful, relevent message, but a few literary niceties wouldn't. Still, this is a book all Christians should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Classic","review":"I'd recommend reading Charles Sheldon's \\"In His Steps\\" before reading this. Then you decide who is the better writer and has a real handle on the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the historic presentation of ethics","review":"The current \\"WWJD\\" (What Would Jesus Do\\") phenomenon is not the Biblical understanding of how we are to determine right and wrong. While this book did not start that pop phenomenon, some may read this mistakenly. What Jesus would do would be different that you or I because He was fully man AND fully God, second Person of the Trinity. He was sinless, and although tempted in every way as we are, He did not sin. His purpose was to fulfill the Law in order to be the spotless sacrificial lamb of God, the atonement and substitute for our sins. He was the omniscient God incarnate, so He knew what was in each heart and what was the perfectly appropriate thing to say and do in each situation in order to accomplish His mission. In that sense, what He would do in a situation as God is a hypothetical we cannot know as finite creatures. What He might have done is a speculation. We are, however, TOLD in Scripture what we are to do, how as Christians we are to act and live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my first choice....","review":"This book is not a good one for \\"Introduction\\" to Programming using VB. My opinion obviously, but I find the book to draw way too many assumptions about what the reader already knows about VB. Reading this text I find myself re-reading over and over again the concepts that I am supposed to learn. The author throws out several concepts, definitions and terms all within one sentence. It is difficult to digest. Have a pen ready with lots of ink- you will have to make your own notes to make sense of it. I have only read 130 pages and was forced to buy another text to fill in the gaps. Too bad- the other text is quite good (Murach's Beginning VB) but this is not the book used for my class. There are a billion examples- for me the approach that works best is type out every example and just study it with the help the other text, websites and online help.

I am an MIS major, and must admit my serious weakness is in programming. This book has done nothing to help me ! If you are a programming person, pickup this book and you'll enjoy.

I found this book to be very easy to read and to understand. The code Samples are very simple and the books provides a reasonable ammount of exercise to work on. One Downside to this book is that the autor explanation to some topics in tha latter chapters of the book tends to be incomplete but is a pretty good book up to chapter 8.

Some took theirs to a jeweler(I guess they have gnat sized screwdrivers), but why should I pay even more to own this watch? So, I have no choice but to return it.

We don't feed her or put her on the potty anymore, it's too much trouble. Also she is HARD plastic. Moving her arms and legs into different positions takes some muscle, and she's kind of ugly too.

I did so and attached photos of the spontaneous damage and received no reply. Follow-up week and a half later, same result. Phone call to their \\"helpful customer service\\" resulted in one ring, then silence. Tried four times, last one waited over five minutes, same result.

I'm also A DJ and I'm from the ATL; I tend to grade hard but I try my best to be honest and fair on my evaluations.The reason I'm calling this an artist rip-off CD; it's typical of an artist like Pharrell, to ride the coattail of pass successes. They'll come in, produce an album while the fire is hot and take the money and run! This is the type of CD that causes people to revert to illegal downloading of MP3's.Two artists in the past year has released albums that does just the opposite of what Pharrell's album has done.

If it is, every copy sold is a handout to this hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book is not only shallow and vacuous, it is also abysmally poorly written and edited.

I've struggled through one additional chapter, the one on Augustus, and it doesn't seem to be getting better. It's uncertain whether I'll be able to finish a book that no longer seems to be printed in English.

I was very excited, therefore, by the title of the book and the delights which it promised to offer. I was dissappointed, unfortunately. The author does state that he is not doing anything original, which is fine, but he should at least have found an original way to make this history seem fresh in its retelling. The repetition of many of the anecdotes sometimes could make it seem that one was at faculty dinner party with a professor telling you the same story he had just told in class. Also the longest chapter in the book, on Roman food, was neither scandolous nor about the Roman emperors but, even worse, was not particulary captivating. There were interesting elements to the book as the subject is so fascinating but it was not as well put together as I had antipacited based on its mouth watering title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I am not often moved to write reviews, however after squandering a portion of my meager income on this travesty, I feel I must take action. So seldom have I read a book so poorly written and so heavily lacking both in charm and entertainment. Mr. Blond, in a single consecutive abortion of pages, has managed to condense a fascinating and thoroughly entertaining subject into a seething mass of pampas and indecipherable thoughts. The \\"author\\" of this work seldom sees fit to elaborate on any of the facts presented in the \\"book\\", much less confine himself to merely one thought per sentence, and instead skips from subject to the next, much like a hyperactive teenager after overdosing on caffeine. Perhaps Blond would be well-served by taking a community-college English course, where the teachers could scold his lack of respect for the readers of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subject ruined by poor writing","review":"This book and subject matter could have been a lot more enjoyable if it were not for the horrible writing style of the author.This book is proof that anyone can get published if you 'know someone in the biz'.If you can get past the bad writing, the subject is entertaining. The first chapter, on sex, is not for the easily offended! Straight from the hip talk about something the Romans apparently enjoyed very much!I don't get the need to write an 'apology' chapter. After all, isn't anything historical going to be a rehash of what others have already written, but from a different point of view??The map was cool. So was the glossary.If you want info on the Roman Emperors, you'd find better luck with a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempting but . . . .","review":"At the beginning of the book Blond apologizes for its simplicity and lack of novelty, however, what he did write he should have written well.

Questions in the practice tests (Measure Up and Transcender)make reference to material nowhere in the book. I have always relied on a couple of good Practice tests and a good third part book to research in order to prep. It has been a successful process that has enabled me to pass every test on the first try and really know the material.

They almost grasp what they are reaching for with \\"Snowman,\\" \\"Highwire,\\" and \\"Butterflies and Airplanes,\\" but the rest of the cd does not justify the price. \\"Born Too Late\\" sounds much better on the WXDX compilation cd from last year, and the band played \\"If Memory Serves\\" on a DVE acoustic performance a few months ago that blows the album version away. Songs like \\"Flame\\" and \\"Chasin' Girls\\" are just plain bad; I don't understand how the latter was chosen as a single. Bottom line: if you don't have \\"Someday Maybe,\\" buy it instead.

There is a great mixture of songs ranging from rock to pop and even a couple of ballads. Scotts vocals on songs such as \\"Better off Without You\\" and \\"Let it Go\\" are simply amazing.

That's the reason why the Clarks are so good. They connect with the audience, almost as if speaking directly to YOU. I think that the single, \\"Chasin' Girls\\" (another highly relatable song, I'm sure) is now getting spins on rock/alt. radio.

To be fair, when the author focuses on stay-at-home strategies the book seems ok, although she veers off the subject so frequently to express her opinions about what constitutes a good mother that it's difficult to get through.

Still haven't been able to locate much info about Bugskull except that they are (apparently) a trio made of of three talented musicians - being Sean Byrne (wasn't he a member of the '60's one-hit wonder San Jose sensation, the Count Five?), James Yu and Brendan Bill.

I am a pitcher so I \\"touch\\" the ball often. I wanted a larger glove to field more of the line drives hit near the mound. I used this glove in four, seven inning games and during the fourth game the metal piece that the strap slides through and tightens the glove around your hand snapped off. It is a design error with the flimsy metal piece to pull on and tighten your glove. I loved this glove while I was able to use it but I have since returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"great glove","review":"It has been a long time since I had a new baseball glove.

I did, however, have problems breaking it in at first and thought that the ball tended to bounce out of the glove a little too much; the glove appeared stiff. I thought that it would break in with time but after 1 year it is still pretty stiff. Someone told me that \\"Genuine\\" Leather was one of the worst materials for a glove and I can confirm that after not being able to break the glove in after a year of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glove and It didn't Break the Bank","review":"37 years old and just started playing softball with co-workers. All I had was the glove I used in little league. I wanted a much bigger glove but I wasn't going to pay a lot for it. Saw this same glove at KMart for about the same price but being that I'm left handed they didn't have any for me. Ordered from Amazon. The glove came quick. It was still in the box when I got to the ballpark. Used it right away and it felt great. No break-in required, plenty of padding in the palm, and just a great fit. Some reviewers complained about the straps ring breaking but I have adjusted my glove once and have never had to fidget with it again. I've played about 7 games with it now and have had about 4 practices with no problems at all.

The title and the author tell it all: it's the exciting story of one the most incredible stuntmen in movie history! The book is written in a style that is engaging and very often hilarious. It is, however, somewhat confusing, because Jackie's narration does jump around in time quite a bit, so you might lose track (a little) of what happened before what. Also, it would have been helpful if he had told us how old he was at the different stages of his life; that would have helped to better keep track of his story. Nonetheless, the single most important fact remains; this book is about Jackie Chan. And that's more than enough reason to keep you entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book Ever.","review":"This is simply the best book ever written. I never ever read.

Great for anyone even if they don't know who Jackie Chan is. It reads smoothly from one page to the next. My husband, myself, and our 10 year old son has read it. It was worth the money and more.

I believe most Asian people grow up with Jackie. When he was hurted during filming, we felt for him. When he striked gold in America, we were happy for him. In a way, he represented what we Asians aspire to be, going all the way. His portrayal of an average Joe Blogg, the guy who lives across the street stick with us for as long as I can remember. I just hope that his success doesn't make him feel invincible so that he could do as he wish. He should be aware of the Greek tragedy that if you fly too close to the sun, you will get burnt irrespective of who you are. It would be good if the 2nd edition of the book addresses his rationality behind his affair providing that his wife has been supportive of him through his whole career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A autobiography good enough to be Jackie Chan's.","review":"This autobiography is superb. Almost everyone knows of his humble beginnings at the Peking Opera school, but this details the stories behind the life of the man.

A definite purchase, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book that I have read in a long time.","review":"This book makes you feel as if you went through the life of Jackie Chan right along aside him.

He has always pleased and thrilled his audience. This book explains why he is so driven and what his life was like before stardom. It's difficult to believe that anyone can go through what he has and still come out with such a positive attitude toward life.

With exhaustive (and exhausting!) descriptions of Jackie's brutal Peking opera training and early days as a stuntman and actor, almost everything you want to know about Jackie is here.Not that there aren't omissions - his illegitimate son Jaycee, now trying to make a name for himself as an actor, is never mentioned. Jackie is also quick to take credit (he claims 'Half a Loaf of Kung Fu' and 'Snake in the Eagle's Shadow' were the first kung fu comedies, which they weren't) and slow to give it out (he describes his opera brothers' film 'The Prodigal Son,' arguably the best kung fu movie ever made, as \\"solid\\"). But Jackie's charisma and determination shine through on every page, and you can't help but admire the guy. A must read for Jackie fans and aficionados of Hong Kong cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"kuranda doggie beds","review":"easy to assemble.....and i was so worried about being able to put this product together. i have no tool skills! fast shipping.LG Kuranda Bed, Cordura (40x25)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, but...run big","review":"I had a pair of these when I was a child, I remember loving them dearly.

The size is perfect for our needs. Unfortunately, if you buckle it upside down (which is so easy to do, the strap is huge), it jams and has to be taken apart with pliers. We showed her how to watch when she buckles it so that doesn't happen again and that has worked. Then, one side of the strap came completely apart from the fanny pack. She isn't doing anything rough with it so not sure why that would happen. We used a sewing machine to get it back together but I wonder how long until it breaks again.

The programmatic nature of the symphony is never too strident to overshadow the pure musicality of each movement. The first movement has a solidly massed quality to it-- not too tuneful or transparent. By the conclusion of the symphony however the opaque, tough sound to this composition wins one over and the overall effect of tragedy and foreboding hits home. I recommend this synphony if you enjoy early 20th c. composers like Martinu, Eduard Tubin (think of his 3rd, 6th or 8th symphonies), or Shostakovich's 7th or 8th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth having in your collection!","review":"I love this pan!

I suppose that their earlier Rudolph taught them a lesson which is why the appearance of the classic characters can be seen here. But computer animation? And a pink hippo? Haven't these execs learned anything?!? You want us to buy this garbage? Fine.

Like other users remarked there is no texture to the images, the graphics look like something out of a cheap children's video game, in which the paper thin plot would have been more suitable for. Gosh, the 30 second AFLAC commercial that spoofed Rudolph had more production value than this 90 minutes of gutter trash!

Just about a tear-jerker.In addition, the movie includes Rudolph & the other characters from the original movie from 1964, & with the same voices.The key to enjoying this sequel, & the reason for my 5 star rating, is simple: I viewed it through the eyes of my 3 year old son, rather than through my now jaded & critical adult eyes. The only adult criteria was whether the story was good, and was it easy to follow for children, and it definitely is both.IF I were a child today, would I love this film?

I like the whole misfit theme of these unloved toys and these people that just don't fit into the mold. I think it's a good children's movie that teaches them that it's okay to be different and to accept others that are different. It's just a fun adventure movie.

The only thing I liked about it was the Snowman. I also didn't like the idea of they had for one character wanting to change their looks.

I really loved their animated feature musical from 1998 in spite of the reviews on that as well. It was great to see the original cast back in this feature and the voicing was very convincing. How will this feature attract kids? I can't answer that. As an adult, I really liked it.

Many of the songs were very good. The storyline is decent and kept my daughter entertained. The mystery of the villain at the end of the movie was a big disappointment.

This book, however, comes awfully close. The author shows little knowledge of the source material. The whole plot makes no sense for those who know quite a bit about the L5R world. (Why would Bayushi Yojiro openly authorize an entire army to kill Akoda Kaneka? Why would Naseru also be so open about it? Why would an Iuchi shugenja work for a scorpion daimyo? This Lion shugenja seems to be the most powerful magic-user alive, with no explanation or wonderment from the charectors.) Magic is also used a deus ex machina to solve all kinds of things. All the charectors and plot are shamelessly borrowed from Kurosawa movies. The book itself is quite boring, and the fight scenes(of which there are dozens)go on for WAY to long.

I just went to Toys R Us and got something 10X better and BIGGER... dont waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great model poor ride","review":"I love having a model car this size. I bought this one for family and friends to experience. Once I opened the box, batteries purchase is separate, the car remote control experience was very slow and even sluggish at times.

It is what it is, a model toy, back in a box collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast for a kindergartner","review":"This was easy to set up right from the box--pop in some batteries and it's good to go. It's super easy for small children to use as the remote has 2 buttons for it to go and a steering wheel that's pretty much it. It's very easy to use for a little kid, I would even imagine 3 year-olds wouldn't have problems handling it. It goes pretty fast and seems durable. It needs to be used on a flat surface--my son took it outside and it didn't go over little pebbles or cracks in the road--so stick to flat surfaces. The color is nice and for $20 it's a great buy. My son and nephew had a great time playing with it for a full hour after he got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, durable and fast!","review":"This rc car is really cool. It has really nice detail. The wheels, the paint job and the car itself are real nice. It is pretty durable. My 1 1/2 year old son uses it. He will pick it up and play with and sometimes throw it across the room. The car still works and it hasn't broken. It takes 3 aa and 1 9volt. The batteries last a long time. It has been two weeks since I have changed them using it about 5 to 10 minutes through out each day. The remote control is pretty durable too. Usually the antennas break or snap off. Not this one. This one doesn't seem like it will break off. It is very flexible and pops straight back up when it is bent. It is pretty fast that you can use it at home without crashing everywhere. It is not too slow where it gets boring. It is a pretty decent speed that you can control and maneuver the car. Overall a great rc toy that is cool, durable and fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Appearance & Speed But Flimsy Steering","review":"'Ordered this car for a young male relative. It looks sharp in a compact, peppy package BUT...the wheel alignment knob came off & was lost within the first 2 hours of use and the car then would not go in a straight line, only in circles. I returned it to Amazon and ordered another one - and the SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. This time, the knob was found and I put it back on the car, but the car still won't go in a straight line, only hard left or hard right. This is a flimsy design.

Many of the suggested wildflowers are in fact invasive weeds in North America. Even the style of meadow design lacks imagination.

He attempts to duplicate the object orientedness of java with straight c (no c plus plus). So instead of using a standard parse tree and symbol table, he invents this cockamamie type of tree structure using very java-esque structures.

I spent a lot of time traveling the US and Europe yearsago and made it a point to stop and talk with people doing what might seem menial jobs. I talked with a gardner in Madrid near the Pardo Museum who had worked a rose garden all of his life, he was then eighty years old. Ben Lilly brings to life a person who lived in a time of interesting characters of this country. He reminds me of the early market hunters found on the east coast of this country.

She crafted the tragedy into a story of the Blackfeet plight through time.No other work is as extensive as this regarding the Blackfeet Indian Reservation during, before, and after Flood of 1964, and the rupture of Swift Dam and Two Medicine Dam.Sid Gustafson, novelist"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Opera Fans Everywhere...","review":"This is the only children's book I have found that introduces them to the wonders of the opera at a level that they can comprehend. In this world of insane pop stars with loose morals, it is so refreshing to see farm animals on a quest for a higher form of entertainment.It is so appropriate that the author chose the hog as the main character, an animal who is both extremely intelligent and well-padded, like most successful opera singers. Seeing these fat porkers with their oversized grins and popped-out eyes prepares the young child for what they will see at a real opera.My husband Earl of course totally disagrees with me. HE thinks this is a book meant to prepare boys for getting their first Harley motorcycle, and the fact that they MISS the opera is \\"the whole dang point of the book, Martha. None of those hogs wanted to make it on time\\". He thinks the plot is how to AVOID the opera, but what does he know? He can't even find his underpants in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADORABLE!!!","review":"This is the cutest book! Very funny too. The kids loved it.

I read this book and The Ark rather secretly, because my family and schoolteacher were of the penchant that the \\"Germans got what they deserved\\" and that German refugees weren't deserving of sympathy. I loved the book then, but was unable to find anything else that this author had written. Many years later I came across Rowan Farm in a used bookstore. Coincidentally, I ended up married to a German man from Berlin, whose grandparents had suffered terribly during the war and afterwards....I had also become an amateur historian, specializing in the first half of the 20th century. Reading Rowan Farm now was a delight, since I could better understand what was transpiring, and didn't have to read it secretly! It should be required reading of schoolchildren, so they can get a more balanced view of war--that there are no winners or losers, just people who suffer and endure, and in this case, find love no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovation viewed through a social lens","review":"A short book, written from the perspective of a research interested in the links between \\"Technology\\" and \\"Society\\". To me the book was worth reading if only for its focus on two insights.a) Innovation is about social change. A new product, a new technology, that does not provoke changes of behaviour will end up just being a foot note in some academic record. Socially irrelevant.b) Radical innovations tend to appear in the intersection between disciplines. Specialized organizations produce incremental innovations. Radical innovations require a more open environment. The history of the development of Internet, covered in the book, is a good example.A quick read, non academical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree with the moral in this story...","review":"I seriously question the moral of this story, which seems to be that people should be content with their station in life, and not aspire to anything better. Really? It's never specifically mentioned what is so terrible about being a bird. Freedom and abundance on a tropical isle is supposed to be a bad thing in the story, and Al should rather find contentment by struggling to make ends meet as a low paid and under-appreciated janitor in the inner city. As far as children's books go, I would rather encourage my children to dream and strive, not settle for discontentment and a low paying job.

Should they work, they pull the ink ribbon along when they print, they have no middle-cut peel outs for ease of use, and they usually don't work. Something happens that the printing roll is badly coiled and when you insert it, it won't advance.One of the ribbons I actually had to break in order to make it work and about 30% of the printing roll was wasted, because the ink ribbon ran out due to the modification I had to make to see it work.I don't recommend you buy these, not to mention the fact that they are so expensive.

The ideas in the book are timeless, and, I expect, it will be a great book for decades to come. It is very strong on both scores. And it is beautifully written: It is all there,- the history, themotivation, the philosophical points, the applications, the guided tours with friendly author-explainations of what it is all about. For me, this book was a page-turner. I read it ona long plane flight,- on my way to a wavelet conference in Guangzhou, China. -- And I didn't have jet-lag when I arrivedmore than a day later.

This one is said to be suitable for undergraduates, but I don't think so. I have a master's degree in electrical engineering, and several of the mathematical concepts they mention were just vaguely familiar names to me. That would be OK if I were persuaded that those concepts were essential to an understanding of wavelets, but I'm not.

I would recommend this book for high school children, or those who are interested in learning the basic facts about Nat Turner and the events that surrounded the insurrection.

I have decided to give this one star to hopefully dissuade anyone else from believing this is a movie deserving of 5 stars.Aside from the shallow Christian proselytizing that interfered with a potentially promising plot the downside is slow pacing, hackneyed dialogue and PAINFULLY transparent exposition.None of the characters were likeable and the only thing the film possibly had going for it was a good twist at the end that was however POORLY executed.This movie is great for those who cannot think for themselves but rather choose to see the world in a good versus evil prism where ambition is evil and sacrifice is good.

But if you are like me and you want to use this as a reference and find certain chapters, do not purchase this book because there is no table of contents - no matter what it says. Unless of course they fixed it since I made my purchase on 8-10-2011. Download the sample first and if there is no table of contents than don't purchase.

The clasp is a hidden clasp, so all you see is the band, and no locks or clasps are visable. It kind of folds into itself locking in the middle. The face is curved and not flat across the dial, but it has a sort of convex appearance that seems to blend seemlessly into the band.

A retelling of the Arthurian legend, but not one that I find riveting. Most of the characters are a little TOO flawed for my taste. I'm just not buying Guinevere as a worshipper of Isis. I do like Nimue, though. Singularly unattractive, but believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy of God","review":"Excellent continuation to \\"The Winter King.\\" Cornwell has done a really good job creating the characters for this series. They, in combination with the adventure and romance, make this book thoroughly enjoyable. I am not the fastest reader in the world and work quite a number of hours per day, but I finished this book in less than a week.This book, as the first, is narrated by Derfel Cadarn (a forgotten personage in Arthurian legend) as a very old monk. He tells his stories of battle as one of Arthur's warlords in Arthurs quest to achieve a peaceful Britain. At the same time he tells the story of the other characters and their life goals, which aren't necessarily the same as Arthurs.I loved the book. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I liked the other two even better. This is the best series I have ever read. If you are reading this review means that you are interested in this subject -- so go ahead and buy this series, you'll really enjoy it, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Perhaps not as good as Winter King, Enemy of God does a great job of connecting the first and third tomes of the triology. About halfway it can get a little slow but if one manages to soldier on it is a rewarding book. Very eventful and manages to deliver what you'd expect from the triology and from Bernard Cornwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbeilvable book!!","review":"I love this triogy it is much more beilvable than any arthur movie that I have seen. I dont know about other books this is the only arthur book that ive read but I cant see how any other book can get any better than The Warlord Chronicles. the only down side of these books is each chapter was at least 40pages long a little to long for my taste but still great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THE ARTHURIAN LEGEND","review":"Per my review of WINTER KING, this is a different take on Arthur, focusing on the legend and the times. And those times were when Briton was desperately fighting itself and trying to hold back the Saxon invasions. The ruins of Roman occupation still remain.In the second novel there is a great deal of more focus in how the Saxon problem will be solved. Lancelot shows his true colors to other people. Guinievere betrays Arthur. Merlin is questing for relics that will bring the Old Gods to Britain, push out the Christian God and help Britain against the many invaders. The main character, Derfel, achieves more status, fights in more battles, discovers his father is a Saxon leader and creates a rift with his childhood female friend, Merlin's apprentice.Evocative, bittersweet and even thought provoking.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good. (NEW)","review":"I was not happy with the condition of the book. It was suppose to be new but I dont think so. The cover was dog eared and so were some of the pages. The book was not in very good shape for a NEW BOOK. I purchased two other books at the same time and they were perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book series I've ever read!!!","review":"Very refreshing, believable story with many unique twists. I particulary enjoyed the author's portrayal of the strong women in Arthur's and Derfel's life. Guinevere was so real, and not at all unworthy in the end, and Derfel's lifetime princess lover so beautiful and brave! I was also quite enthralled by the plot's raising of Christianity in a Pagan world and the country peoples resistance to the change in their gods. I liked this series far, far better than the Mary Stewart series, and I really liked Ms. Stewart's! Vol #1 is very good, but Vol's #2 & #3 are the best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 2 - As captivating as Book 1","review":"It is great to pick up a piece of fiction that was very close to what actually happened during that time.Cornwell takes history as it is written and develops characters that fit right in to the factual information.Trust me, this is much better than reading the actual history accounts of the period.I prefer audio books and this as well as the other two books in the series are available in cassette format.That said despite the lesser quality of the audio the readers are very good and will keep you wanting more.Buy all three and listen to them in order you will be glad you did.If you can't find at amazon try half.com they have a fairly good selection of the older material"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist on the Arthurian legend","review":"I was intrigued about this alternate version of the Tales of Arthur. This well-crafted book (the third of 3 books in this series) fleshes out many of the legendary characters in very believable ways. I liked the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I picked this up since it was one of only two guy-oriented wedding books I could find at the bookstore. There are a few helpful pages in here, especially for those of us that haven't been to a lot of weddings and need a refresher on the different traditions and customs of weddings. So, you get some helpful reminders (who to thank, etc.), but I think the author's attitude is pretty old-fashioned and to some people, could indeed be offensive. His \\"right of first refusal\\" theory -- let your fiance do all the work, but retain a right of \\"first refusal\\" where you can override her decisions seems like a recipe for disaster. At least, when I jokingly read those passages to my fiance, she was NOT amused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off!","review":"I thought this would be a full season - got it for my daughter for Christmas.

This install CD will setup your hard-drive, do the partitioning and the dual boot for you, so you don't have to be advanced. So that was great. I am still running this version, but the shell is missing so many typically 'traditional' Linux utilities that I now need, such as LaTeX compilation or a FORTRAN compiler. So, I looked into upgrading it, but you cannot upgrade. You can upgrade to v9.1, but the current version is 10 and there is no upgrade to v10, which is now supported by Novell.

The reason why I don't like is because that these tapes are bilingal, that is it reads one english sentence/word, followed an italian one, or vice versa. And also it pauses for quite a long time between each word or sentence. So I think it wastes time though I find that the grammer part of it is quite systematic and easy to follow. Anyway, it may be a good supplement for other italian course with more details and some exercises, but I do not believe it should be used alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"I bought this watch on special sale on Amazon for only $$149....a steal for this watch.

The dial size is very decent..not big for my average size wrist..overall looks killer on wrist.I'd recommend this watch strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class that gets noticed","review":"To start off with this watch is very nice once you open the box. One thing you will realize is that size of the dial is smaller then expected. Plus the dial part already has a few light scratches on it just from one wear. Overall, besides these two issues the watches is great and people really do notice it when you wear it. Looks like a $1k+ watch. The diamonds are not that big and the silver part under it does most of the shining.Weight is nice not too heavy and not light by any means. Feels solid. Keeps time perfectly as you would expect from a watch like this. If you can buy this watch for $210 right now thats a steal given it MSRP's for $525 which I know regular store fronts ask MSRP.

Produced largely by Giorgio Morodor of Donna Summer Fame. The album probably is best known for the title track \\"What A Feelin'\\" which was the theme to the movie Flashdance but this album includes so many other great songs. One of my favorites is \\"Romance 83\\" which is an ode to how technology can interupt ones love life. The dance tracks \\"Why Me\\" and \\"Breakdance\\" are awesome as are the slow pop tracks \\"Recieving\\" and \\"Cue Me Up.\\" The ballads are typical 80's big drama numbers like \\"You Took My Life Away\\" and \\"You Were Made For Me.\\" I can listen to this album over and over. My only hope is that it is remastered and re-released. This is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the 12\\" for Why Me?????????????","review":"Any particular reason the idiots at this record label slapped a 12 inch remix of Why Me on this cd instead of the 3 1/2 minute radio version that was a hit???

The small size of this Guide makes it easy to carry in just about any pocket. That's a big deal. Learning a language requires persistence and quick access to a collection of key words and phrases at random moments.

This is their college album. As such, it is not poppy, it is not happy. Often wistful and reflective about the strangeness of the college experience, the lyrics range from cerebral to nonsense and back. Musically, the album is under-produced, but don't let that stop you. If you can get past the guitars that actually sound like a guitar might sound if you were to pick one up, the chords are silly, and the solos are melodramatic, but in the best ways. This is DBS playing in a band because they were having fun. Overall, a much more complex album than Home, and far more cohesive than Byzantium.

First of all, I did not appreciate the author telling me to think of myself as a crone because I am going through/ in menopause. The writing style was silly-with each chapter beginning with an older voice telling you how you should feel about all the changes going on. It was like a fairy tale. I can not say how accurate the information she gave for vitamins and herbs was but I didn't like when she said never have your ovaries removed and then didn't follow up about what would happen once they are removed. She is very anti hormone and while they may not help some women, they may be the right thing for others. The book goes overboard on natural remedies and does not supply any scientific or medical information to back up her claims. I'm glad I didn't buy this book-instead I took it out from the library.

It's interesting but I don't believe everything in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must to Read!","review":"This book is the most exciting text I've read.

It has helped me learn what techniques or herbs will deal with a problem before it gets out of hand. I've also learned to how to avoid problems-i.e. Susun helped me figure out that taking aspirin for a PMS headache was the probable cause of an unusually heavy period.

I have 3 Galvan reels and all of them have eventually begun to have the same problem: You put the spool on the shaft and feel the positive click engagement -- indicating the spool is set, then later on (often times when fighting a big fish) the spool comes off: sinking in the river a few times. I kept kind of \\"quiet\\" about this for sometime, since Galvan are such high end reels, thinking it must be something I am doing wrong. However, after cleaning, trying different lubricants, no lubricant, this problem still exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better alternative","review":"I bought this supplement recently as i was tired of the fish supplements (Omega 3).

I have been taking Hemp oil for over a year with only good results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ted Turners whoops on history again","review":"While the film looks good the biggest problem I have is that the producers put German machine gunners fighting on the side of the Spanish!!!!!!! How ludicrous. The American expedition to Cuba was accompanied by a German military observer. In any case being a student of the Spanish-American war if the Spanish had had machine guns operated by Germans or other wise the US ground war in Cuba would have failed.God only knows why the producers couldn't follow reality but it killed an otherwise \\"watchable\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Baby, says Whaa?","review":"I just wanted to cry some.

But thank someone, for not letting the idiots market some upscale version we all know is nothing more than the upscaling any $20 machine does today, goo goo goo. But it still is available in VHS for the little bit of 3rd world in all of us I guess.Why not redirect the whole movie with HD cameras and give some of these new actors a chance? This time no more Batman effects to cheat with the fuzzy technology.I can remember this movie as good, but the above made it boring. Why did god or nature give us eyes if not to see?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bully!","review":"I only have a few minor complaints about an otherwise largely accurate and entertaining movie. First, the cheesey music soundtrack played over the battle scenes could have been left off, which in my mind would have made them more starkly realistic (witness \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", if you dare). Also, the overly melodramatic soliloquy given by one of the journalists as he watches the charge up San Juan Hill is laughable, if not excruciating. Still, the producers took pains to be accurate, and the movie has excellent performances by several fine actors, particularly Tom Berenger who gives an uncanny rendition of the enthusiastic and fearless young T.R. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shaping of a President","review":"This presentation of Theodore Roosevelt's action during the Spanish War is quite accurate historically and omits most of the \\"Hollywood\\" found in other allegedly historic epics such as \\"The Patriot\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\". Tom Beringer does a great job as the future President, both in appearance and speech patterns. The film shows the initial excitement of war, followed by its stark reality and ending with the bonds of the men forged as no other experience can in one's lifetime. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish American War historical mini series","review":"I enjoyed this movie having little knowledge of the Spanish American War. I can't speak to the historical accuracy or any artistic license taken, but I found that the plot flowed well and showed a variety of technologies or war from that period and the \\"fog of war\\" at a time when communication was difficult if not impossible in war. I particularly thought Tom Beringer's portrayal of Teddy Roosevelt to be well done and hardly recognized the actor although I enjoy a number of Beringer's other movies. If you enjoy various historical period war movies this is one to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"History and Patroitism in Action Movie","review":"Great action movie with many characters real historical figures. Viewers who love their country will feel a sense of pride and patroitism as they view this film. A footnote is that the firearms used in the movie are authenic to era and some to include the machine guns were probably actually used in the actual battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Bully!","review":"This has to be one of the greatest movies in history. The actors make it so real as if you are experiencing it yourself! Tom Berenger has to be one of my favorite actors. The difference between his role in Gettysburg and his role as TR is outstanding! Gary Busey makes Joe Wheeler hilarious. The music is great and fits the movie so well. My personal favorites, beside TR, are Bucky O'Neill, Henry Nash, Nenry Bardshar, Willian Tiffany, and Hamilton Fish. This movie is unforgetable and can be watched on end without getting tiring. If TR were alive today and saw it he would say,\\"Bully!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish this film could have been in the theaters. GREAT!","review":"This is my favorite WAR movie, right next to Platoon and Gettysburg. These three movies share the same actors. Nothing wrong with that. Its great to see Berenger take a role as a Vietnam soldier, then a Southern Confederate General, then the leader of the Rough Riders. Great film, with great action and drama and comedy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best War Movie I've Seen Yet","review":"Rough Riders is one of those movies that you can't watch and put away. I must have watched it at least 20 times and I still love it. Not to mention, you will always find something new. The movie inspired me to study the Spanish American War and the era. If you like war movies, you're gonna love this one. You'll feel that feeling in your American soul. You'll experience nearly 2 hours of ultimate American Imperialism at its birth. The movie is as Theodore would say \\"just Bully!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, a must for collectors of this genre","review":"Finally a war movie about the Spanish American War. The acting was great and it looked very accurate in detail. Especially, Tom Berenger did a good Teddy Roosevelt. I never really knew how the Rough Riders really got started, the movie showed how. I really liked how Gary Busey as General Joe Wheeler, who was a Confederate general during the Civil War, still called the troops \\"blue bellies\\". He gave a good performance. Also this was Brian Keith's last performance. If you like war movies or even westerns, this is one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting piece of history","review":"If the main character has been portrayed accurately, then I find it very interesting as presidential history. The battle not withstanding, the movie was entertaining regardless of historical accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, But What Moron......","review":"printed the segment of Spanish troops backwards!! All of their rifles have the bolt handle on the left side and the machine gun that Roosevelt so vehemently states the he knows \\"it loads from the right\\" is loaded from the left in the backwards segment.

The more contemporary sound of this album does her no favors (I thought she was ideally suited to the more nostalgic style of \\"Thank Heavens for Dale Evans\\").

I assume that means that the wood was cut and finished in that country. Which leads to the next question: Beechwood is native to Eastern US. Did someone import this wood out of the US all the way to Thailand and then re import it back to the US as a finished product? I really doubt this stuff is Beechwood. But, whatever it is, it is not particle board covered with a wood veneer.The top drawer section is really crudely made and the screw holes were missing. The wood screws supplied are of such cheap quality that the phillips head on them literally disintegrates after 3 turns of a screwdriver. The big bolts used for the legs are okay.I paid $122 for this item and it is shown listed as $195.

Now he rhymes slower than he use to and his voiceand his catch phrases is annoying. Therefore, Wayne didn't always rap like this.

Then they turned around and made him president of Cash Money cause they know if he leaves, they r s**t out of luck. No artists left, no talent left, just stop puttin' out records, please.

On some of these songs, you really miss Mannie's fresh beats, but some of the production is good. Cool and Dre's song is alright, but Tmix and Batman do the best job of replacing Mannie.New production aside, Lil Wayne still has it. A few of these cuts standout: Best Rapper Alive (with an Iron Maiden sample?!) is cocky, but it is solid and the background chants are cool. Hustler Musik is a classic track, and Shooter is a much better single than Fireman was. I'm a D-boy is probably my favorite song on this CD. The birdman's verse is good because he has a different style than Wayne and it seperates Waynes verses.Weezy Baby is a good song, and I like Feel Me, too.

With 19 songs, more than half are definitely worth checking out (#'s 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22).

Each manufacturer has a section with tidbits and trivia about their successes and failures. The heroics of the employees of these various companies is highlighted and credit is given to shop foremen, designers, ordnance officials, and the average worker who made the whole system work.

Lots of interesting ideas but not much practical application that I can see.However my biggest gripe is the font used in the book: a script font that is an attempt to make the book look like a hand written journal. I just found it very hard to read large amount of text with that font. They should have stuck with a normal typeface instead of trying to get cute.Hard to recommend unless you can handle the typeface and don't mind that the book has no real practical information.

Rob claims that you can build the structure of a 40'x40' house for around 10,000 dollars. I learned from Rob that my area is probably not prime for an underground house because with the blazingly hot summers and very mild winters I won't be able to store up enough \\"capacitance\\" in the soil to give me extra \\"cooleth\\" in the summer, the time I really need it.

Ms. East seems to have forsaken the novelists' creed \\"show don't tell.\\" Perhaps the author couldn't decide if she were writing a romance novel or a history text. Dialog is almost non-existent. Most of the book is a simple recitation of events. There are quite a few instances of unwieldily repetition.

This book is interesting and not one of those bodice rippers I always associate with time travel. Miranda is the kind of heroine I admire-- she is strong, with a mind of her own. The book ends well, with just enough of a tease to make me hope for a sequel. As a matter of fact, I went to Rebecca East's website and e-mailed her to set my mind at rest about one little item she had not accounted for at the end of the book. She wrote back and assured me the item was still around--- so I am pretty sure she is going to continue the story. If not, it is enough to stand as is, but I sure hope she brings Miranda back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Grant is more interesting","review":"It's no wonder this book is through a vanity press.

Not everyone is a classicist but please. . .This book needs a good editor and an injection of style. There were so many points I felt like I was reading a term paper I was going to quit reading. Or it was like I was reading a bad splice of Pliny's letters,Cena Trimalchionis, and my text from my Roman Law class a couple of semesters back.Though I will say that this author did her homework.

This story is of the same caliber as the Little House books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at all","review":"My particular opinion of the book is that the content is really light, the software is for beginners, but it is not even a business plan guide software, it is an introduction to the office programs, to learn how to use word and excel. The Spanish translation is really poor, it seems to be translated from Babelfish. It does hardly speak about the aim of a business plan and has nothing to do with my expectations.

However I am a history buff and like the unique parallels to the real world infused into the book. I think it is a pretty unique story and am thouroughly enjoying the series.

In order to inflate the floor, you have to pump faster than it deflates and then plug it quickly. The one-way valves on the side tubes make the boat nearly impossible to deflate (I put a chopstick in it to hold it open).The included paddle bites, so the thirty bucks you save over the Tahiti is totally NOT worth it. The boat may be based on the same design, but it's far from the same boat. Mine's going back before it ever sees water."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT like the time tested Tahiti","review":"It is NOT comparable to the Tahiti. This kayak DOES NOT HAVE BOSTON VALVES.

This fact is not apparent in Amazon's product description and is unclear even on Belkin's own web site. I purchased two cards and only then saw they do not work on Macs. When I called Belkin to suggest they should make this compatibility information easier to locate on their website, I was greeted with unbelievable arrogance and a total lack of interest. If you use a PC, these cards may be very good, but as far as I am concerned, after experiencing their horrible customer service attitude, that's the last Belkin purchase for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"hopeless","review":"First off, there is no cards slot for the iMac.

They knew less than I did and deflected reponsibility at every turn.The seller, Shopila, was also unresponsive at their \\"customer support\\" email and phone number.

I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re-installing drivers again and again. Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement. I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs.

The book fills in the gaps and expands not only on the personalities, but on several key events in the criminals spree that couldn't be included in the 1967 film. While the '67 film tended to humanize Barrow and Parker, this book cuts straight to core of the unbalanced and unsocial behavior of the two.If you're a fan of the film, or at all interested in the history behind Barrow and Parker, this is the book to read.I really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great record","review":"This album is kick ass, and so is Darkness Comes Alive.

At one point she writes in the ship's log, \\"This sounds empty and silly as I write it, but it made sense.\\" No, the passage was empty and silly and there are hundreds just like it in the book. What's even worse is Bird subjects the reader to her poetry, as if her expository writing weren't bad enough. If you're looking for a book about sailing, this isn't it.

Dickens perfectly unfolds his characters and gets the reader into the Christmas mood. He also does the unthinkable by making us sympathize with the moody, unfestive Scrooge. The original version is the one to get, though, as the abridged version makes Scrooge's exciting encounters with the spirits (especially his meeting with Marley) far too short. This book is certainly affordable and will get you into the Christmas spirit, as well as help you rediscover the true meaning of the holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evans EMAD2 Bass Drum Batter","review":"this head give my bass drum (PDP maple) a solid thump that you can feel in your chest.

I also added the emad resonant head. It also has a small foam rubber ring round the vent hole. With both heads,and assuming you know how to tune, you can get a perfect bass drum sound without any pillows or blankets in the bass drum.

This ill-conceived band attempted to ride the faltering wave of success that once supported \\"Desert Rain\\", the eastern tinged hit by Sting. Inaudible monotone vocals coupled with psuedo-spanish guitar stylings, left urban club crowds scratching their heads. My fondest memory of this awful band was a show they played at the Elbo Room (a popular jumping off point for many local acts). It was late '99 or early '00. Baddigo had just delivered another painful set to an unswayed audience. The poor fellas milled about the club trying to get people to sign-up on their mailing list when the next band took the stage. They were barely teenagers and called themselves \\"Sleeping at Last\\". Suddenly the entire club woke up as these youngsters rocked the F'n house! Everyone took notice.

Such a cheesy movie I couldn't watch it for more than 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Sexy Outfits, So Little Time","review":"\`Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber' is an '05 made-for-television feature promoted as a \\"social satire\\" (an attempt at relvance I guess). Unfortunately it's nothing more than an excuse to film Jennifer Love Hewitt in as many revealing outfits as possible within a limited amount of time.Plot: Katya Livingston (Jennifer) is a beautiful but obnoxious, self-centered ad executive who lies, cheats and sleeps her way up the social ladder. Aided by her flamboyant best friend Ferguson (Joey Lawrence) she worms her way through the film reeking havoc wherever she goes.Jennifer is unquestionably a very attractive young lady and I'll be the first to admit that just knowing she's in a film is enough to peek my interest, however even the lovely Jennifer cannot save this one. This movie is shallow, silly and predictable. It receives -2 Stars- instead of -1- simply because she's sooo easy on the eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and too predictable","review":"Really low budget, predictable, bad acting.

It is somewhat different than a lot of her roles, as she plays sort of a manipulative sort, primarily interested in her own gain, even if at the expense of everyone else. Most of this is done in comedic style. There is a more serious underlying plot, which comes out later, and you see a more human side of her character, Katya (AKA Katie). There are a lot of funny bits in this, some of them perhaps a bit silly, but if you like comedy, this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Love Hewitt is adorable in this","review":"fun, silly, watchable film. You know an actor has talent whena character they portray has few redeemable traits, but yet, you still root for them.Katya is a social climber and will do most anything to get to an invitation only ball.The best part of this film for me was JLH character's narration. She has to keep track of all herexpenses for her tax man. While doing so she pretty much ends up witha daily diary of her life. Naughty, silly, charming fun. I rented it and plan to buy it for a pick meup sometime when I am blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Weak","review":"The only reason I rented this DVD was for Jennifer Love Hewitt. I'm a big fan of her, both as an actress and as a singer. But even she couldn't save this film from sub par status. Jennifer plays a very self centered employee of an advertising agency (she lies about her credentials to get the job), whose number one goal is to become a popular socialite. She falls in love with an attorney who likes her but is turned off by her stuck up persona. She eventually dumps the fake attitude to win the guy over. Jennifer is too sweet of an actress to do a credible job playing a \\"bad girl.\\" But even despite that fact, the film is slow moving, very predictable, and just plain boring. Unless you are a diehard Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, I wouldn't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THERE A PLACE FOR MINUS STARS?","review":"If \\"Love\\" continues to do movies like this, and even have the gall to help produce them, she'll forever remain irrelevant and trite as a movie star.

There was no sticking nor was there any plastic smell. I think the key is the non-stick spray. I believe that the bad reviews related to those not using a non-stick spray - with or without flour.I cooked Brownies and decided to remove the Brownies from the Cake Pan before cutting.

[We are using an under-mounted Kohler sink such as Kohler K-2319-55 Bancroft undercounter lavatory, Innocent Blush, with faucet holes drilled through the granite as close to the sink as possible per Kohler's sink diagram.] We also added a matching Danze Fairmont undermounted soap dispenser, similar toDanze D495940RBD Accessories Fairmont Soap and Lotion Dispenser, Distressed Bronze.Quality of the Danze fixtures seems very good and we would buy them again.

These plates are for an olympic bar but I was able to make them work on a standard bar with screw on collard without any problem. This dropped the weight down to just 40lbs which was just right for my daughter.These plates work great for what they are. My son's deadlifts look A LOT better with these plates instead of the smaller plated he was using. I am not sure how much banging around they could take but if you are using these plates you should not be hitting the floor very hard anyway but be concentrating on technique.Bottom line if you are going to do deadlifts, and I think everyone should, and you can not do 135lbs (olympic bar) or 120lbs (standard bar) you need these plates. I am glad I spent the money on them after seeing the difference with my sons deadlifts.The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because I can't help but to think that for a rubber plate they should cost a little less."},{"rating":"1","title":"tre","review":"I was buying this as a gift.

I didn't find the range to be any worse than my Motorola FRS radios. I like the beep that it provides when you stop talking, so the other party knows you are done.The potential downside for some users is the 4 AAA batteries that it uses, but I use rechargables that I find last long enough for my useage, and helps cut down the cost as compared to alkaline batteries.

If you enjoyed any of the Fatback Band's music over the years --- and we're talking mostly early 1970s to early 80s --- or like 70s soul/funk/dance music, you'll find a lot to like on this generous 2-CD collection. Some great instrumental jams and funky vocal tunes (both male and female vocalist) are included, but there are also a few weaker, repititious dance tunes that haven't stood the test of time very well.

This little Iowa town of 4006 souls is in fact a microcosm to showcase all the peccadillos (not to mention outright crimes), public and private, that you can imagine. The talented clowns turn this into a riot that I believe is well-nigh impossible not to guffaw at.

My votes for the best parts in the movie go to Bob & Ray, then Bob Newhart and then Edward Everett Horton - but everyone is great. The attack on tobacco is so PC these days that now maybe we can have more appreciation for the satire on the media - the arrival of Nixon at the final town meeting is simply hilarious - as is Walter Chronic in the operating room.

You should not have to read a review to understand a movie, but I did keep returning to the DVD case to reread what it said about it. Unfortunately, the liner notes were of no use in unravelling the pointless plot.

I agree with the previous reviewer that there is some great cinematography here and some intriguing aspects to the film but the characters make so little sense that it moves beyond absurdist or surreal to meaningless. In Marienbad, it was clear that one would never get to the truth but here some similiar threads just seem forced and pointless. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is not interesting enough, but the cinematography is beautiful","review":"The cinematography is really really beautiful, so I am sad to say that the story lags far behind in quality. You don't know where the story is going so it does keep you interested for a while. Ultimately I found the story a let-down.After watching the film I read the NYT review and the following statement made me think: \\"To put it baldly, it is a dialogue between the ego and the rampaging id, without the attachment of moral or psychoanalytic baggage.\\" Had I watched the film with this framing it would have been a bit more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and useful!","review":"This is a great product.

This was terrible","review":"I was so happy to get this book, take it home, tell my family to leave me alone, sit down and read with that silly smile on my face, that only SEP can bring, and BAM! my face fell. This book had no substance, it was down right stupid. What happened to my favorite Author? I love all of her books, but this must have been written by someone else. I want the magic of Hearbreak Mountain and Texas, and even dare I say it...... Golf. Not this dribble. The children were great, but I think that they were a draw back. Mat was amazing and I wanted to hear about him a lot more, I don't think that his story evolved like it should have. But Nealy should just have never happened. I still though can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal and corny story","review":"This was the first book I've read by this author and it will probably be the last.

The storyline was unreal and I found the First Lady, Nealy, quite silly. Not much happens in this book to keep that emotional intensity found in Dream a Little Dream.

Except for \\"Honey Moon\\" and \\"Hot Shot\\" if you've read one Susan Elizabeth Phillips novel you've read them all. \\"First Lady\\" is no different. Sexually repressed woman meets macho man, and macho man liberates repressed woman fulfilling all her sexual fantasies. Please! I will say that Ms Phillips is a very polished writer, but like the man says \\"she's got her story and she's sticking to it\\". And we're informed on the inside cover that she's writing another macho football player versus repressed young woman in her next novel. This will be the fourth time she's told this story. Give us a break Ms. Phillips. You're fans deserve more than the same trite story over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Up to Standards","review":"I had this book ordered for a month as I anxiously waited for it to ship. As soon as I got it, I sat down to read it. Unfortunately, the story just never grabbed me the way her other books have. I still get teary eyed re-reading parts of Dream a Little Dream and Nobody's Baby but Mine - but First Lady didn't move me the way those books did. Of course, Susan Elizabeth Phillips being OK still surpasses a lot of other writers being great, so buy it, read it, just don't expect to fall in love with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Lady","review":"I have loved SEP forever and couldn't wait for this book to come out. I will admit that I was greatly disappointed.This hero will never leave your heart fluttering. The story was long with little interest and unbelievable and boring scenes. I couln't believe that this was a SEP book. Even Copeland Bride was better than this book and it was one of her earlier titles.Our great first lady wants to be just normal like the rest of us... She dresses like an old woman to escape and then like a pregant lady traveling in a camper trailer. Sure, we all live like this... The hero cant stand being around girls as he raised all of his sisters and is cruel and rude to the children and often disrespectful. I do not find this funny at all.I read page by page as a troubled teen took the show. This book should have been titled \\"Lucy, the girl who met the First Lady\\".Sorry to all SEP lovers around. If you are looking for a good and fun read - this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expectations were too high","review":"I just finished First Lady and I did enjoy it but I had psyched myself up for it for so many months that there was no way it was going to live up to expectations. I have read all of SEP's books and usually the book pulls me inside and I'm lost until I read the last page. Matt and Neally's story didn't do that. It still is a great book and far outshines most books I have read except other SEP's books like Heaven Texas, Kiss and Angel and It Had to be You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, satisfying romance","review":"First Lady is an enjoyable, entertaining read. I really liked the main characters, and the kids were great. Read this if you enjoy romance with real characters and a sense of humor.

I began reading it right away. I kept reading hoping it would pick up. It didn't. I usually love SEP's work. The characters are usually so compelling that you can picture them,laugh, and cry with them. Not so in First lady. SEP has another book coming out in 2000 hopefully that one will be much better. I just found this book flat. Definitely not a book that I would reread unless I was stuck in an airport with nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Lady","review":"This was my third SEP's novel I have read and I considered it a great disappointment. The heroine is very unbelieveable and dumb, while the ending completely lacks quality.

I have read every book by SEPs and she is by far my favorite romance author of all time--but this was very different from her other books--her other books usually have a story line and the characters aren't dull but interesting and usually keep you up till 3 a.m. wanting to finish it....this one made you want to go to bed and try to figure out in the morning how to try to return it to the book store..... Can't wait for next book though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've enjoyed several of Ms. Phillips' books and expected to enjoy this one. Sadly, the best part of the book was the endnote indicating that her next book would be about return characters Kevin the football player and Molly, from \\"It Had to Be You\\". I'd give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Having enjoyed other books by SEP, I couldn't wait to read \\"First Lady\\". Unfortunately this book is not in the same league as others by this author.The lead characters aren't very compelling or particularly well drawn. Something about their relationship didn't ring true. It somehow seemed \\"flat\\". The best characters in this book are the kids. I was completely charmed by Lucy and Button.If you want to read a good book by SEP, skip \\"First Lady\\" and pick up \\"Heaven, Texas\\", \\"It Had to be You\\" or \\"Dream a Little Dream\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYOND FIVE STARS","review":"What can I say about a book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips that hasn't already been said? She is one of those rare individuals who have talent beyond belief. I only discovered her two years ago, but since then have read (and re-read) all of her books. FIRST LADY is everything and more I have come to anticipate and expect from Susan E. Phillips. Make sure you have several hours free when you start reading because if you are like me, once you start, you won't be able to put it down. Another incredible story! Five stars are not high enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilling AT ALL!","review":"OK, review no 83, nobody's gonna read this, but I just had to, if only to express my profound disappointment that one of the greatest authors in romance is losing her touch. Really, the storyline was borderline believable and the end was ridiculous, sorry. Also, the characters were lacking the warmth of earlier characters. Nealy's just so indecisive, does she want to be free or trapped, picky or loosened up. And honestly, for a woman who wants a normal life, she certainly is right up the wrong path of life... Sadly, I hated this book, it didn't give me goose bumps (except for the kid episodes, which were great. The kids are really the book's stars) and that is so unusual for an SEP book. Thank God the book she is promising for next year sounds like a pure winner! Two very much loved characters hitting it off sounds like a lot of fun, sort of \\"Heaven Texas\\" meets \\"Lady be Good\\" although hopefully at last with an original storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, if a little far-fetched.","review":"The characters were very interesting, Nealy and Mat were wonderful, as were the kids, especially the teenage girl. The ending was very sweet.The political part of this book is not believable, simply because it will probably never happen. I was very proud of the way Mat handled Nealy's fame, however. What a great guy he was!Not quite as much romance as others I've read, but this is definitely a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of her best","review":"Having enjoyed most of SEP's book, I was disapointed in this latest book. While the plot was original, the book failed to interest me on the whole..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Beliveable","review":"I'm a big fan of Ms. Phillips, and looked forward to this book, only to be greatly disappointed.I thought the premise was great, but you can't take a smart savy lady, make her dumb and then smart and savy agian, all within a 2 week period.The other problem with believability was the heroine kept talking about how she hated politics and wanted away from it, and then turns around and goes right back into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, buy something else","review":"I was happy to start in on a new Phillips but was very disappointed, very soon. The book starts out good but fizzles soon thereafter.Nealy/Nell, the lead character just isn't believable a third of the way through. The teenage character got on my nerves. If you like fine dialogue like \\"I'm gonna hurl\\" or \\"This blows\\" maybe you'll disagree.It seems like there was a good outline for the book but the pressures of a deadline or maybe just plain apathy resulted in shortcuts in character development and plot.I wouldn't spend any money on this one. Reread \\"Lady Be Good\\" or \\"Heaven, Texas\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUNNY AND TOUCHING BOOK** SEP delivers again !","review":"Just as in every other Susan Elizabeth Phillips book I've read (and I have read them all), I came away from this book with such an appreciation for this author. Not only is this book touching and very funny, but you truly become immersed in the lives of all 4 of the major characters, Nealy, Mat, Lucy, and the cute as a button <g> Button on their road trip to a new life. Unlike most romances these kids don't annoy the reader but are instead, integral and enjoyable. Ms. Phillips is such a great author it is so hard to wait a year in between each book, but I guess it is not quantity, but QUALITY and this book has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long awaited, much rewarding SEP book","review":"(Cornelia) Nealy Litchfield, widowed First Lady of the United States and daughter of an assassinated politician, has spent her whole life in the glare of the media and under the protection of the Secret Service.

With many secrets being kept and the Secret Service after Nealy, they are bound for an adventure the likes of which Nealy never imagined.And poor Butt, spending most of the book without anyone knowing her real name :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"SEP makes it work!","review":"When I read the back cover of this book, I thought the story was quite unbelievable but SEP manages to make it work in her own way. With her usual crisp dialogues and witty style, she makes the reader not only believe in the story but also that we were reading about a normal family instead of the first lady. Although some parts in the middle felt like a drag, this highly entertaining and fun book definitly deserves 4 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointed","review":"First Lady was a disappointment to me. Some of the plotdevicesto move it along were too incredible. The sex was extremely tepid.It was an easy read and was interesting in stretches, particularly the descriptions of life at the White House. Coming after some really great SEP romances, it definitely was a disappointment. I love to re-read my favorites, but First Lady will not get one. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Holiday Rewritten","review":"In First Lady, Susan Elizabeth Phillips does a fine job of retelling the classic Audrey Hepburn movie Roman Holiday. As with all the more recent SEP books, there is snappy dialogue and wonderful secondary characters. However, I must agree with some other reviewers that this novel does lack some of the sparkle of her other novels. I think it is perhaps because the time frame is too short. Most of the action in the book takes place in a week, and I can't really believe that the lead characters truly fall in love in that time. It is, however, still a delightful read. I must admit though, I did think the best thing about the book was the advertisement for SEP's next novel where she brings Molly Somerville (It Had To Be You) and Kevin Tucker (Nobody's Baby But Mine) together. I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, touching story of family life.","review":"The characters in this story are believable, although I had trouble identifying with the First Lady of the U.S. The kids are wonderful, funny well developed characters and the story seemed more about them than about the hero and heroine. Although the book is a great read, I didn't feel quite as much emotion in the love story as I did in SEP's previous books. Still highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Lady Be Good\\"","review":"This book has a fun premise: a presidential widow wants a break from living her life in the public eye. After \\"escaping\\" from the White House, she winds up travelling cross country with a hunk, a teenager and a baby. I don't think the ending measures up to the author's usual standard, but it was definitely an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from SEP","review":"I was up until 1:30 this morning finishing FIRST LADY. Wow, it left me awed. The characters were something else--three dimensional, very very real characters with dialogue and emotions true to life. There were very funny moments--the kids, the heroine's \\"pregnancy,\\" the hero's thoughts on life with females. Yep, very funny. But there was also a very clear view of what life is like for America's First Lady. My respect for each of those ladies and all to come has definitely rose to a high level--especially for Hillary, poor woman. It's a tough, very thankless job. Thanks, Susan, for making me laugh, for making me cry, and for making me think."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"With great anticipation I bought this as we were heading to Florida on vacation. Because I was so certain it would be as wonderful as all of SEPs novels, I saved it for last.How sad that I should've read it first, just to get finished with it. I found Mat and Nealy to be not only underdeveloped, but lacking any of the sympathetic qualities I have come to expect from this author. They were, sadly, flat and annoying. The notable exceptions were the children, Lucy and Button who, like most children in SEPs novels, were delightful.While I certainly applaud the attempt to try a new kind of character, I look forward to Phillips' next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"not awful, but not her best","review":"This book was by no means her best work. The romance wasn't believeable nor were many of Ms. Phillips' political ideas. I usually love her novels (especially Dream a Little Dream and Heaven, Texas) but this was not even in the same league. The most excited I got about the book was the ad for her next book in the back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Romance Not Nonfiction","review":"I'm amazed at the number of reviews that say the story isn't believeable... I say its romance not nonfiction for crying out loud. SEP makes me laugh out loud and I read her books for entertainment not hard hitting facts. I especially enjoyed Nealy's contact with former First Ladies. (Talk about an exclusive club) I absolutely love SEP's depiction of Button/Demon and Mat's frustration dealing with her. Living off of I-270 I could easily picture Nealy's getaway. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think Ms. Phillips could pull it off","review":"I couldn't see how this book could be good, but it was. Very entertaining and I loved Button and Lucy. Ms Phillips is one of my all time favorites - But I'm giving this book 4 stars because I didn't believe Nealy's character was consistant in the end. The Nealy at the beginning was very much not the Nealy at the end. I very much loved Mat and his sisters, I wish they had been in the book more often rather than just before the end. I would recommend this book to SOME people, but with some reservations. Doesn't come close to her football heros. I am very much looking forward to the story of Molly and Kevin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, poor epilogue","review":"SEP offers nice escapism and fun. This implausible story is fun and sparks the reader's imagination. Nealy and Mat were great, but I especially enjoyed Lucy; SEP did a good job of getting the sullen, but loving, teen \\"just right.\\" The epilogue wasn't believable at all. I doubt a person who ran from the \\"fish bowl\\" existence of First Lady would actively pursue the office of President later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"I was surprised, but I really liked this book (I listened to it). I've been looking for some escapism and I enjoyed the characters (generally) and the adventure. But I really like the author, so I'm probably biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK GOODNESS! --AN ENJOYABLE BOOK!","review":"I haven't come across too many books I would give 5 stars but this one fit the bill. It was entertaining, humorous, believable, and not too drawn out. I've only read three books from this author so far and I place this one a bit above LADY BE GOOD, but not quite as enjoyable as AIN'T SHE SWEET?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming, happy, fullfilling. Those were my feelings as I finished this book.","review":"This is a charming ,witty, funny, romantic story. So enjoyable, it kept me up past my desired bedtime. She is one of my favorite authors.

Although not as baked into romance as much as self discovery and family, it is enjoyable. I thought Mat and Nealy were a great couple and would have loved more time with them alone together as opposed to dealing with and raising an instant family. The family is Lucy and Button, two girls they find themselves looking after due to a series of strange events. SEP does not disappoint if you're looking for a fast light and funny read with a bit of romance wrapped into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of SEP's best books since \\"Kiss an Angel\\"","review":"This book was entertaining and kept me interested frombeginning to end. I liked the way that the author worked inhistorical information about the performances of past presidents. She also touched on interesting dilemnas, such as an individual's right to privacy vs. the public's desire to know as much as possible about a beloved public figure like First Lady Cornelia. The constant name-dropping, though got tiresome after a while. Cornelia got make up tips from Sandra Bullock, and called former first ladies Reagan, Bush and Clinton for advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ESCAPE!","review":"What a wonderful novel. A perfect \\"bathtub\\" book. Very good plotting, and the characters are first rate. Suspenseful but never scary and a happy ending. What a delight.

I picked it up because I thought it would be a good story and while there was a plot to it it just didn't grab my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate! Heartwarming","review":"I truly appreciated the character development. Nealy from a dependent child and spouse to an independent, knowledgeable woman. Mat from a loner to a loving, family man. Lucy from a typical defensive abused child to an intelligent, giving young girl. The path for Nealy and Mat to find in each other the qualities that make a good relationship is rough. Trust and truth finally led them to the love they were searching for. Mat finally accepting that his life would be empty without a family and Nealy reaching out to Lucy to fulfil each other's dreams of a family was touching. The epilogue was the crowning touch to a fulfilment of all the characters. I actually hugged this book to my heart for all the warmth that was portrayed. I would like to see how Lucy fairs in the future. Any chance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic SF","review":"This story went a bit all over the map. Not as good as some of his later work. Not recommended. Instead read Blood Music or Eon, both wonderfully imaginative stories by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Very difficult to get into. Throughout the book, but particularly in the first section (53 pages,) the author shows how divergent language has become between groups. The difficulty of trying to figure out what the characters are saying may help us understand how the main character feels, but did not allow me to immerse myself in the story.That alone might have set the tone for me and I never got into the story. Part of the problem was developing a whole new world, covering hundreds of years of new history and tying it together with new scientific advancements all in fewer than 300 pages. New characters and concepts are introduced and developed only in the most superficial way. Great ideas, poor development."},{"rating":"1","title":"How mistaken identities go bad.","review":"This book would be one of the best works on Adventist history, if it wasn't for the fact that he never tells you he is actually talking about an organization called the International Missionary Society SDARM (IMS) based in Germany and not the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement based in the USA. His experiences, probably all true, relate to that German group, but he gives the impression, that the reader might also get, that he is talking about the US-based group. A very bad rhetorical flaw which he should correct in any future works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book with every thing.","review":"The best book I have ever read.It had suspence,love,mistery,and the will to do what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger.com- Be Careful Where You Surf!","review":"Danger.com \\"Most Wanted\\" is a well-written story with characters that its teenage audience should be easily able to relate to. There's Andy, a somewhat troubled teenage guy, who's life crashes around him. There's Andy's Mom, a single business-woman who tried to hide from Andy that he was adopted. There's also Syd, who's deep and intelligent, but also sometimes annoying with her name-calling and eating of health food. Therefore, even those are not adopted should be able to relate to something in this story. I gave it four stars because it seems to drag at times, and I didn't think much of the ending, but overall it's a pretty good read. Of course, there's also the Internet aspect, the idea that a story like this could really happen to someone who's not careful with what they do on the Internet.

What sets the book apart from the rest of British crime is the fact that it has no real idea about Britain. There aren't any \\"elevators\\" for instance, nor do job centres have spikes to put notes on. And not everyone who's unemployed is an inveterate gambler.Smalltime falls into too many deeply dubious stereotypes to be of any worth. That's not to say it's not well-written, because it is. Unfortunately, the plot is wafer-thin and the characters sketchy at best. Our main protagonist, Chris, is supposedly some sort of chick-magnet, three girls on the go at the same time, but his appeal is never explained. Dashy's bad homelife is straight out of a bad Ken Loach film. As for Kevin... Well, he's really nothing more than a bad guy.All in all, it sounds like an American trying to write for a British audience. And it falls flat...Bloodlines should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste of My Money","review":"I thought this release of Hit 'N' Run Lover 2006 was going to be great.

Although this does seem odd when reaching for ones wallet, it is very noticeable when sitting in a car seat and your wallet protrudes from the side.

Many facts are left out. One particular one is how the Japanese survivors of Midway were treated after they got back home.

I figured that since it was on David Chastain's Leviathan label that it ought to be at least halfway decent and should have the kind of guitar shredding Chastain loves so much.More often than not, these cutout bin gambles pay off, but this time I struck out. Simple Aggression's sound seems to be a jumbled mix of thrash, grunge and nu-metal, none of which are my preferred musical genres. To make matters worse, it's bad thrash, bad grunge, and bad nu-metal. Gravity is also totally devoid of melody, which kills it for me right there.I'll give the band credit for maintaining a metal sound at a time when metal was a dirty word (hence the 2-star rating), but Gravity just isn't doing anything for me, and I'm pretty open-minded. It was a struggle to make it all the way through this album, and I'm not at all surprised that this was Simple Aggression's final album."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received","review":"Never received this product.

Please. And the Independence Day track is great, because it really features Carrie in her element, but it is the same track as on the \\"Showstoppers\\" CD.

Bo made that song into something else and i am not even a Bo fan nor the song. I love it when Carrie sang Independence Day on American Idol and on the Showstopper CD; however, the fact that it's been sang so many times and been played she really didn't bring something new to the song. She lacks emotion to make both Inside your Heaven and Independence Day work.

I sort of exepected more from her since she CAN put heart into her performances i.e. Love Is A Battlefield, Trouble. But listening to the CD leaves you cold. Listening to \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" doesn't do anything for me, because the song itself is already poor enough with the lyrics. \\"Independence Day\\" just seems like a fake-trying-to-be Martina McBride. She did not put heart into this single and I do not like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Done!","review":"Carrie sounds so amazing with Inside Your Heaven.

Independence Day was more average than Inside your heaven. Although on both songs she just yelled her lungs out but failed to interpret the lyrics of the song. Interpreting the lyrics is what makes a song what is is, she'll never succeed with such frail and nonexistant emotions. Waste of money, a computer could sing for me, would it be worth buying?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another American Idol Miscalculation","review":"There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie Underwood / Inside Your Heaven","review":"With her powerful but unskillful voice and pretty face, it's no question she got votes to become an American Idol, \\"country versoin\\". However, her talent is very limited in just one field. (Check AI's stage performance) \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" might please some people who really fond of country music. I bebelive she can do just fine in country music. It's nice to be a American Country Idol anyway. Get some vocal lessons, listen more kinds of mucsic, try out some different tunes, perhpas she will have staying power in real world someday instead of few months of fame. We would like a new fresh and unique voice, not just sound like Trisha Yearwood or Martina McBride beacuse you can't out sing them. Prove me wrong and try to have your own voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the Volume Down on This One","review":"Carrie starts out sounding really pretty in \\"Inside Your Heaven,\\" but she soon transitions into her flaw of oversinging - it seems sharp and is really kind of unpleasant to listen to. \\"Independence Day\\" is pretty solid, but Carrie's cover of it simply is not as good as the original version of the song. Plus, I have heard her sing it so much (including on the AI Showstoppers cd) that the single isn't worth buying for that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"bEST CHOICE FOR AMERICA 1995!!!!!!

I found this duplification a DUD. A bad choice to put on your single Carrie.

This girl definitely has a good voice. But its a different matter altogether when its comes to whether if this single is worth buying. First off, one is paying for half the value of a single because the track 'Independece Day' was already recorded in the 'AI Showstopper' CD. So, one is only paying for the track 'Inside your heaven'. Is it worth the money? Here's my take after listening to her single. Her rendition of IYH does showcase her vocal, but not in anyway close to 'Independence day'. Its not a soulful enough rendition to withstand repeated listening. It gets real boring after few spin, esp with the so frequent radio play.So, my advice is wait for the full album."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is decent, but 1 star for complete lack of effort","review":"I hope that she improves her personality and voice tone. She sounds the same in every song... committing only a dry, emotionless and unoriginal vocal performance. She sings nicely, if only she would convey some sort of emotion in her music. The single is worth 2 stars, but i don't really feel obligated to give her 2 stars since she didn't feel obliged to sing with feelings, and give us our money's worth.. She is one of the most boring singers I've EVER had the displeasure of listening to.. Not even worth 4 dollars"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I LOVE this single. Carrie is an awesome singer. I think she delivers on Inside Your Heaven and Independence Day. My only complaint is that Angels Brought Me Here should have been included on the single.

NO GOOD AT ALL","review":"When I bought Carrie's single I was hopeful for a fresh talent in the single. Although it only has two songs, I looked for something with effort and heart. Sadly, even with Carrie's good voice I was disappointed to see that it had little effort, and no heart into the single. It felt like it was thrown together in two days, and just something to make money.

There were a couple of notes in Inside your Heavan that she seemed to struggle with. Independence Day now she makes that song rock. She is a great Country Singer trying to make her into something other that is like trying to turn a frog purple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a good song, poorly rewritten","review":"I must say I hated this song when it was first played on American Idol. I'm not sure why, it may have been listening to Bo's version, but at any rate it grew on me greatly. I think Carrie does an awesome job, and of course her performance is even better with a studio recording. The one problem I have with it is that the song was changed to do the studio version without the key change, and with Carrie's powerhouse voice, that was the best part of the song. It's like watching Titanic and having them cut the sinking part. Bad analogy, but the point is they did the song a great injustice with that cut, and it makes it somewhat disappointing at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO CARRIE!!!

You won't regret buying this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No heart","review":"When Martina McBride sung \\"Independence Day\\", she had heart in her voice, and she sang it with pride. She meant what she said, and it seems like Carrie Underwood just doesn't care, and doesn't really have heart in what she means...you can't feel her expressions.And in \\"Inside Your Heaven\\", Bo Bice was a little better for that song. Carrie does it okay, but still, barely any heart in her singing.In my opinion, Vonzell should have been in the top 2, Carrie didn't deserve it...it makes me feel that she got there from her body possibly."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is lucky to have two songs on the CD","review":"IYH is awful and Carrie sounds horrible on it.

This girl needs to learn she can't face up to Martina, what was she thinking embarrising herself yet again on the single. YUCK. Inside your heaven is a crappy original song, obviously was rushed, and the lyrics are ok. She sings it well for what it is.. credit for that. Overall, 2.3 stars... not very good Carrie; I expected more from the Idol that was to \\"sell more than any other idol winner\\" --Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!","review":"The songs are very passionless and leave much to be desired!

She doesn't connect with the lyrics and has a few a few tuning problems. I think that again this year like in Season 2 the wrong person won. Although I also believe that Carrie is probably the weakest link off all the Idols. I used to think Ruben was but then came Carrie Underwood. I recommend you buy Bo's instead he has a great talent and is a Rock legend in the making.P.S. Carrie is pretty much a lesser version of great country singers like Shania, and Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie WHO????????","review":"Don't waste your money!!! Their is really nothing special about this girl. She is simply a bland and boring karoke singer. I doubt she'll last long, a year from now we'll all be going Carrie Who???

It's really just a waste of your money, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not What To Expect From an American Idol Winner","review":"Very sad that this is the best that American Idol can put out as a \\"first\\" album.

However, she strains so hard to try to nail each note that you just can't relax and listen to her sing. I could only stand one time and I had to take the CD out! Just not for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from an American Idol","review":"I really did like Carrie when she was on American Idol, but this is a very mediocre single. Its just nothing special, she is no different than all the other country singers out there. Infact shes nowhere near as good as Martina McBride, Faith Hill, Leann Rimes, Shania Twain, Reba etc. She'll be around for a few years, and that'll be it. I think America got it wrong for the first time in all 4 seasons. The recording is VERY bland and emotionless.

What a great artist...I predict she will be huge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't listen to this often","review":"With all due respect, this single is not worth a buy. Not to critisize Carrie Underwood herself, but the writers of the song. \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" for one, is not a great song itself and it is not Carrie's style. \\"Independence Day\\" can just seem like a karaoke performance since she never put anything original into it. So do not buy the single, because, think, how many times will you listen to it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this girl is okay, but I would not reccommend the purchase","review":"I must admit that Carrie did a decent job on Independence Day, but all of her yapping on Inside your heaven just destroyed it for me.

So just let it blow over and pass on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Carrie comes off sounding very boring on this single!!!! Although her vocals seem good she completly seems disattached with the lyrics at times coming off as though she has no clue what she's singing about. If this is any sign of what her album will be like I'm not looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I enjoyed Carrie on American Idol because she has the wholesome-girl-next-door appeal and a powerful voice. However, this CD is just so incredibly disappointing. \\"Independence Day\\" has just been sung way too many times, and \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" is just a poorly written song. Somehow, Carrie's voice doesn't connect with the music on this CD. It does almost seem like she is singing Karaoke. A different producer and better song writers would help tremendously. If the full-length album is anything like the single, I'm afraid Carrie won't have a long lasting career. Hopefully, she'll have the good sense to go her own way once she's free from her restrictive Idol contract."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL SINGER!!","review":"Carrie Underwood is the best singer i have seen in a while.

I think some people want this overly powerful performance from Carrie, but I love how she sings on this single. It is subtle, subdued and it really builds into an amazing crescendo.Carrie now has a number one single, the best-selling one this year so far, so obviously people like it. Why they are pitting Bo and Carrie against each other with the exact same song, I have no idea.While I know both winner and runner-up will do great, this song is Carrie's; it's her time to shine, and just a tiny glimmer of what is to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced","review":"honestly i bought mine for 20 to 30 dollors so if i were u i would not buy any thing from theses sellers cause thay are way over priced but i lost mine and now im looking for 1 so juststay away from the sellers that are trying to sell for more than 30"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Great product and I would recommend it to anyone.The only drawback is that if you put codes in and save them to your memory card it does take some extra space."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Choice for Hard Ps2 users.","review":"I'm using hard drive in PS2 and noticed thatNO OTHER CHEAT PROGRAM WORKS ON HARD PS2 BUT THIS!!So, I did not really have option and had to buy it.After couple games I played with this Great(spoiling) product,I found out,1.

The problem was the support. There are 3 step directions on the packaging but other than that...NADA! If the code you need is not already on the disc then you need to go to \\"their\\" official website for additional codes. The moderators are pompous and surly. They make it clear that they do not work for Pelican. They are simply \\"contracting\\" for Pelican to develope cheat codes. They state repeatedly that they are not a support for Pelican. It took me over a week to figure it all out because I was terrified to ask for instructions! Plus, even though to sign up is free, they do not accept a lot of various email addresses. Mine is AOL... it was on the list of the banned. This does not put Pelican in a good light in my opinion.

This makes him easy sport, albeit tiresome to continually hunt long after you've pock-marked his face and further augmented its lunar qualities.

We too had to return our first unit after leaking all over the counter creating electronic water hazards, and the help desk told us to switch the back resevoir rubber piece so the hole faces down (no more leaks). Mr. Coffee was very nice and sent us a new unit right away telling us to cut the cord on the damaged unit. Apparently the units are assembled with the hole facing up instead of down. We loved the coffee (using the Strong setting, paper filter and Mr. Coffee filter), but now 6 months later it suddenly broke. Water leaked, the electronic display steamed up and blacked out, coffee slowly dripped through then burned on the bottom. If you don't mind spending this much $$ for 6 months, get it. I'm giving up since it will cost much more to replace our counters. We've since been very happy with the Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different coffee maker","review":"I purchased this coffee maker about 6 months ago, and have had nothing but problems with it. The water filter caused the water to only drip in one spot of the filter basket, so only part of the coffee grounds were used. This problem was fixed by removing the water filter. Everything else seemed okay for awhile... Then the pause to pour failed to work. \\"Okay, I'll just wait until the pot is finished brewing.\\" Two days ago, it just went berserk by over filling the filter area while brewing and overflowing. That's it! I purchased a new coffee maker. This is the 2nd Mr. Coffee that I have purchased in the past year. I refuse to purchase this brand in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks every time","review":"I purchased the FX-23 Mr. Coffee over a year ago, hoping I finally found a reliable coffee pot. It took a little longer than some of the other consumers, but it has been leaking for over a month now. A slow leak that leaves just enough water to cover the counter under the pot. Every other brand I've purchased over the years, malfunctioned eventually, but I thought I could count on Mr. Coffee...what a dissapointent. This morning it started making loud crackling sounds as it brewed, now I'm concerned about it being a fire hazard...I give up, I will be going back to a perculator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine leaks also!!","review":"Add me to the unfortunate lot that got a bad model.

I make 6 cups of coffee each morning so it should not an issue of overflowing because of too much water in the resevoir. The counter floods with brewed coffee randomly 5 out of 7 times...what a mess.

Then it became completely clogged and non-functional due to all the \\"special\\" parts that boiled off the water and condensed minerals inside the tubing.

Otherwise it's a nifty looking peice of junk.0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw mine away","review":"Owned this coffee maker for about 6 months when water started to leak regularly from the reservoir while it was making coffee.

But this so called coffee maker has leaked too many times that it's going to the trash.The internal plastic basket has to be locked into position just right to avoid leaks. I've managed to get a decent pot of coffee half the time with the other attempts ending up as a wet surprise on my counter and wood floor.The validation group for this company should be terminated.Let's face it folks. A coffee maker is not rocket science. Its function is to drip hot water over a filtered basket of coffee grounds with the end result of having liquid in a pot. This model has failed at that simplistic endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful tasting coffee - bad plastic","review":"I would rate this coffee maker higher for the styling and brew control features, but if it doesn't make a good cup of coffee it does not rate any stars.

I was very disspointed with this Mr. Coffee product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"Do not buy one of these. I bought this thinking I was buying a great machine. Boy, was I wrong! This pot always overflows spilling onto on the counter and making a terrible mess and leaving you with about 4 cups of coffee....after having filled it for 10. I have tried and tried to make sure I was doing everything right, but the problem isn't me, it's the machine....a design flaw. I have to sit it on a towel to try to help making the mess a bit less.....which helps some....but the overflow is just not acceptible. IF I can find the box I am going to try to return it even without a receipt.

I'm in my 40's.Mine made coffee OK, maybe a bit chemical tasting. I didn't have any trouble with the timer. However, this morning when the coffeemaker turned on, it ran through a cycle and only made 2 out of 12 cups of coffee. It just gurgled without delivering any water to the shower head. I tried turning it off and back on, and it just finished the cycle. I had to put water from the microwave through the basket to get my coffee. I think some check valve got stuck.Also, I don't like the way the basket is placed over the water reservoir. If it ever overflowed, it would contaminate the reservoir with coffee and grounds, which would be very bad for the works of the coffeemaker, as the coffee would burn on the interior surfaces of the boiler and the grounds could clog things up.This is going back to the store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looking but it's a LEAKER!","review":"I bought the first one and it leaked badly, I just figured it was a bad coffee maker.

We have friends who bought this same machine repeatedly, with the same results we had. I have gone so far as to catch someone in Wal-Mart who had this in their cart, and warn them about it.

I was very disappointed from the start. First off, it took forever to brew a pot of coffee. While brewing, coffee would leak under the pot itself...not sure how. The biggest problem we had though....the sides of the coffee machine started to melt after one year of use! THe red paint was black, like it was burnt and was peeling off, the actual sides of the coffee machine looked as if they coming off.We threw this away and bought a new machine...needless to say NOT a Mr. Coffee...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away fast....","review":"I wrote off our problems with the first one as bad luck. It's a cool looking coffee maker and the coffee isn't too bad. However, it kept thinking it was out of water and would stop brewing after 2 cups had been brewed with 10 cups left in the reservoir. As luck would have it, the replacement maker (the exact same one) worked for about 2 weeks before the same thing happened again. Not sure if Mr. Coffee has a Quality Assurance department, but they might start by reading these reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Coffeemaker","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker and it leaked profusely after only 2 months.

It worked fine for a month or two, then it would leak coffee all over the counter if I didn't stand there and reseat the filter as it started to brew. So no more using the timer. Very upsetting to find a mess first thing in the morning. Then last week it just started pouring coffee everywhere no matter how carefully you put everything in place.

Anyway, the water leaks down the back, over the cord, and onto the counter.Fire hazard anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Mess","review":"After a few months of pretty good use, this machine starts leaking everywhere.

It worked great right out of the box but by June it was leaking water all over the counter. I sent it back and they replaced it with a new machine at no cost to me. I figured ok that was just a bad one in the bunch. The second machine now has steamed up the clock which is no longer usable therfore making the programmable feture useless.

They were WONDERFUL said no problem I will send you a new one and they did. Great. Put that one away they did not ask for it back.Coffee Pot number two. Better decanter design gave me the stainless steel upgrade. Green clock fills up with moisture and the top on brew design this time over heats and afraid this one will burn the house down.

After the 1st return, I repurchased the same pot. Within one month, the entire clock faded to black and would not work, which meant NO timer functioning. I thought that this was a fluke, so I returned the pot (again!) and got another one. After 3 months, the clock still worked, but the option to set the clock or turn on the timer just STOPPED working. Out of the blue! So, it too was returned. I don't think I'll be buying any Mr. Coffee products again.

All the sudden a week ago wanted to make coffee and nothing happened. No power to the pot. Called Mr. Coffee and gave them required info and they sent a new one at no charge. My complaint is in the last few years we have gone through 4 Mr. Coffee pots. They may have been good at one time, but these China made pots are a waste of money.

I solved the overflow problem out the back and could even live with a few drips of water on the counter due to the condensation on the interior of the lid. Loved the brew strength feature and the design of the carafe. However, what I simply WILL NOT live with is a fire hazard. Twice now, I've shut the machine off and either the warming plate didn't disengage itself or it came back on. I'm also old enough to remember that Mr. Coffee was the appliance that caused many a housefire and was under a huge recall in the mid 70s for just that reason.Item will be returned and a different brand purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying coffeemaker!","review":"I bought this coffeemaker @ Costco. It's a brand name and was a good price. However, it turned out to be an annoying alarm clock! After bubbling and hissing as it brewed coffee, the maker beeps to let you know it's done! My husband gets up at dark-thirty to commute to his job. He already has an alarm clock so doesn't need a beeping coffeepot to wake him (and me who does not need to get up so early). About 2 hours later, the machine beeps again to let you know it's turning off.I took it back, bought a different model w/o beeping and it too has mechanical difficulties.

We have had periodic, unexplained issues with coffee overflow on the counter. Last week, the hot plate stopped working so the coffee does not stay hot after brewing. I tried cleaning the machine, but the successive 'rinse' cycles have been difficult as the machine will not go through the brewing necessary to recycle the clean water.

It just keeps comming loose. Even if it worked, the device is designed so that a pool of coffee sits in this plastic part, waiting to start driping a teaspoonfull of coffee when ever you remove the container.Not only that but the only way to pore the coffee is by removing the contaner top, or pressing the buttion on the container handle, and that broke two.This looks good but, is junk. We have not one, but TWO defective parts that have broken, or or come loose. Even if they all worked, it would still drip because of the way it's made.JUNK! JUNK!

I think we owned it for about 3 months. Whoever designed this thing was an idiot. The basket doesn't always sit correctly and results in coffee pouring out everywhere but in the pot. Coffee ends up all over the counter...and this resulted in the burner plate rusting out and losing it's protective coating. The coffee was NEVER hot, no matter how high you turned up the burner control.It is a nice looking coffee pot...so it you want to just use it for decorative purposes...this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnnymac","review":"This coffee maker is a piece of junk.

Wrong! Unless you put the filter and the pot in the exactly precise way in the exactly precise order, the flipping coffee maker spews coffee all over the place except in the pot or worse, backs up into the fresh water container. I ordered a Braun off Amazon so this is going in my storage closet in the basement. I'll review that item after I used it for a while. I have to admit the coffee tasted great, but I couldn't trust it, I couldn't leave it unattended. I was nervous when I heard it go on in the morning for fear I had set it up incorrectly. It just wasn't worth it. Its the closet for Mr. Coffee cause I'm just not into coffee sports on my kitchen counter.

When the coffee is brewing and the basket fills with water, instead of tripping the control to let the coffee flow into the pot, it instead fills to the top of the basket and flows over and then all over the counter. Only half of the coffee gets into the pot. My husband took a plastic spoon and broke it in half and stuck the straight end in the front of the basket which fixed it in some way. Unfortunately, I do not have the receipt so, I am now stuck with this sorry thing that has had to be rigged in order to work correctly.

Unfortunately that wasn't me. The day after I purchased it, the caraffe started leaking uncontrollably when poured, so when we brewed 12 cups of coffee we were lucky to get 10. Also, there is soem sort of \\"gasket\\" on the back- has anyone seen this thing? Water leaks out of it during the brew cycle and onto the cord, so when your pot of coffee is finally ready you have a puddle all over the counter. Another flaw is the condensation. Yes, I realize that all coffeemakers will have some sort of condensation inside the lid but when we would lift the lid four hours after making the coffee, the condensation would drip down the sides of the machine and (again) all over the counter.

So have had a bad exprience all the way around.I am now using the 2nd one (same model). Hope I get more then 6 weeks out of it. It has nice features, too bad its not quality. Does make pretty good coffee. I would not buy it again even though it is inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kicked the bucket after 5 months of moderate use","review":"I loved the look of this coffeemaker and thought it would go great with my shiny, modern appliances in my new-to-me home. This thing died after 5 months of moderate use. The crazy thing is, I didn't even brew coffee in it, Everyone in my family likes something different so I just heat water up twice a day for coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. So, no grounds to gunk up the works and it still died. I didn't notice any buildup in the carafe.There could have been tons in the machine itself but, with the crazy way it was designed, I couldn't get in it to see. I couldn't even take it apart to try to fix it. All in all---pretty to look at, pretty disappointing to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse coffee pot ever","review":"I've had this coffee pot for almost two years now, and once in awhile a hose decides to pop off and then all the water just run's out. And like every review I read I have coffee all the time under my coffee pot all the time don't know where it's coming from but it's driving me crazy. I paid over 60 dollars for this coffee pot thinking it would be worth the money big joke it is the worse coffee pot I think ever made. Spend the extra money and buy the bunn it's worth every penny. Don't waste your time with this coffee pot. It should have a recall by now. And I'm so sick of putting to much water in it and having the water run all over the cord isn't that going to case a fire. If you just go a little past the 12 mark will have water pouring out of the back of this. This coffee pot shouldn't get any stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kicking myself!","review":"This coffeemaker was very cool to look at and makes one delicious cup of coffee with the strong setting. BUT after 2 weeks I went to take a shower and while I was gone my kitchen counter got a shower!!! IN COFFEE!!! I was sorely dissappointed, but rather than take it back to Walmart without the box and stand in line for an hour, I decided to give it a few more trys. Don't give it another try!!! Just take it back the new filter design is horrible and if basket is slightly ajar then PRESTO! A fresh coffee smell and one gigantic mess to clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"My own Exxon Valdez... but with coffee.","review":"I got this machine because it looked great and had all the features I was looking for. However, about a month after I bought it, it started to leak coffee while brewing. Dribbling it down the side of the carafe, and burning on the warmer (which makes an awful sound, and odor). This was just the beginning. Now it leaks water out of the bottom in alarming amounts. Came out to see that it was sitting in a large puddle of water, and that my 8 cups of water brewed only 2 cups of coffee.Don't do what I did. Avoid this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful looks, bad mechanical design","review":"I returned this coffee maker for a full refund today after owning it for just three weeks. I was taken in by the beautiful design, but what use is looks if it doesn't work as it should? And this certainly doesn't. After a week, coffee started leaking all over the countertop during every brewing cycle. Then, it suddenly beeped \\"finished\\" after brewing just a cup or two, and had to be manually reset. There's also a small hole in the back which spouts steaming hot water for some unknown reason.Fazit: Don't buy this. It is full of design flaws that they need to take care of."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems","review":"This is the first coffee pot I have used that I have not had a problem with. We have been using ours for 6 months and never had it leak. I wonder if some of the problems are usere related, I only say this because at my job I have 6 different coffee makers that are used and some tend to leak when certain users are making coffee. I suggest maybe using a reusable basket, instead of disposable filters, that is what I use. I definately recommend this pot to anyone.I only rate it 4 stars because the replacement water filter disks are expensive and hard to find, however it can be used without them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker ever! Complete waste of money!","review":"I saw this in the stores and thought (as many people did) that it was an attractive looking coffee brewer. I also thought Mr. Coffee was a trusted brand. Wow, I was way wrong on that. This thing is nice to look at, but really no better than a clock that looks like a coffee maker. Do not waste your money on this thing like I did. I feel like such a sucker. The coffee that does make it into the container tastes like cra*. But for the most part all the coffee it tries to brew winds up all over my counter top. Mr. Coffee manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves for this rip-off/practical joke on people. I only hope that at least somebody got fired for making this piece of junk. I give this product 0 stars, at least I would if I could. If you bought this recently, save your receipt and take it back ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a MISTAKE!","review":"Cool beeps and timing features don't make up for leaks & bad tasting coffee.I could not bare to look at the machine after about two days. I would curse at this machine out loud, while forced to use it until I found time to RETURN IT.The looks suckered me in, but that happiness wore off quickly. My first brew I knew I made a bad purchase. My cup of coffee tasted worse than some gas station coffee. Shortly after, it leaked all over the place, and it was not just me, because it happen to my girlfriend also. The pot would weld to the burner, plus water would be on the counter.Now you can understand why I cursed everytime I had to used it.Major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER","review":"Without going through all the details...this coffee maker is the worst I have ever seen. I thought paying a little more for it would mean a better coffee maker? Hmmm....should have known better. I swore off Mr Coffee years ago and should have continued to do so. If I could have rated it a \\"0\\" I would have.If you like lots of coffee on your counter and constantly pressing the filter basket down when you set up a new pot go ahead and buy it. If you would rather walk away and know your coffee is brewing in the pot and not the counter...buy another brand. Trust these reviews...the majority are against the coffee maker. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"This coffeemaker should be recalled. It often leaks coffee. Mine is two months old and I'm going to heave it.

Well even if you are standing there, it will pour all your counter. I studied what was going on, thinking it must be me and found, that the basket is the problem. Something that should have been fixed. I am now going to buy another coffee machine, but it won't be Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived","review":"Until a week ago, I'd have given this coffee maker four stars because it has brew-strength control. Last week, though, the clock face turned entirely black and this morning the unit completely malfunctioned. The shut off alarm sounded after only an hour but when I went into the kitchen to salvage the last of the coffee, I discovered the unit was still on. Draining the pot, I attempted to shut the unit off manually and it kept coming back on. I finally got it shut off and 10 minutes later it turned itself back on again. After unplugging it, the unit went into the trash. I strongly suspect steam was able to get into the mechanism causing the electronics to short circuit. Obviously, it is a fatal design flaw--or a clever ploy to force people to buy more coffee makers. In all, it lasted about eight months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible coffee maker!","review":"We have had this coffee maker for 1 year and 9 months. The first year it seemed to work fine and I loved the look. However, it has the leaking problem that other users have described. It is horrible. Coffee constantly is leaking onto the burner and then all onto the counter and staining my tile grout. I have resorted to keeping a paper towel under the coffee maker and then standing there while the coffee brews to wipe up the mess. It use to only happen once in awhile but now it is happening daily. Now it is time to shop for a new machine. Everything else was great with this machine before this started happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud","review":"It makes coffee ok. At the end there is a very loud beeping that will wake up others that are still sleeping. I can get around it by momentarily unplugging it at the end of the cycle. I'll probably take it apart to stick a fork in the beeper at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring it back before you use it!!!","review":"This Coffe pot was very disappointing to me. I recieved it as a gift, it worked great the first time it was used. After that it was game on, it overflowed constantly, not to mention the fact that coffee and water ended up in the electronics part. The best use for this Mr. Coffee Coffee Pot is for target practice. I am surprised that no one has had a fire due to this pot or had a decent cup of coffee for that matter. Mr. Coffee, really needs to pull it off of the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Machine","review":"I bought this coffee maker because it seemed that would do all that I required of a coffee maker. Unfortunately, this machine is one of the worse coffee makers I have ever used. It leaks coffee when caraff is removed to pour a cup. It will brew a whole pot of coffee only 4 out of 7 tries. The other times it will just stop halfway through. Very frustrating early in the morning. To top it off the caraff requires pouring over the sink since it is trerribly easy to spill. If my french press had not broke, I would toss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've had this coffee maker less than a month & it's falling apart.The top of the coffee maker came apart it's now in 3 pieces.

As I said earlier I was told that I would receive a refund on my S&H, that has been a week ago with no credit or refund shown to my account. I attempted to contact the seller by phone three times and left a message once. No return call. I have just sent an email this morning, but I am not counting on a reply.

The stories illustrate ways people have coped with death through the use of creativity -- crafting commemorative art, personal rituals and stories.Although you can, of course, read the book cover to cover,you can also just pick it up and browse through it and read a story here and there.

This movie lacked everthing the original was. The animation was better than the origianl in some aspects. What was up with the music. Surely better music could have been dug up. (How about a hyped up version of the NES game music)What was with the story? Anyone could have created a better script than that. If this movie did not contain Golgo 13, it would have gotten no stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"This had to be one of the worst anime films I have seen.

I highly recommed you don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Long Enough","review":"This movie left a lot to be desired. The music was funny stuff (although I'm sure that wasn't intentional) and the animation was so-so. Although I have to say in all fairness my first few animé films were Akira, Ninja Scroll and Wings Of Honnemaise which isn't a fair comparison.I thought the plot was alright. I've seen sillier plots in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie but it really didn't excite me much. I really found the technique of stopping the action for a comic book style drawing annoying. I like my action straight forward and this seemed a little too artsy. I also found the sex needlessly over done. I know this is animé so you need gratuitious sex and violence but cartoon sex has never been that exciting to me and it kind of brought the action to a halt.Golgo 13 was just okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the Duke go?","review":"This movie was a disaster. I only enjoyed it because I have watched The Professional: Golgo 13 a hundred times, but Queen Bee is a bad movie that does not give Duke the credit he deserves. This movie also has a ridiculous amount of sex and violence in it. The first movie was classy-violence, while Queen Bee is just silliness. If you are a fan of the Duke, then watch this movie. I only bought it because I am a faithful fan of Mr. Toga. If you like James Bond, then you might like this but PLEASE WATCH THE FIRST MOVIE BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your money!","review":"This movie was just plain bad. If you have seen the first movie, The Professional: Golgo 13, and expect more of the same, think again. The first movie was put out by Orion Home Video: Steamline Pictures, but Queen Bee was put out by Urban Vision. What a disappointment for Urban Vision, who has produced some decent anime. The plot of this movie is as weak as the animation itself. Save your money. If your looking for a winner try the movie Kite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"Definitely a new all time low for anime. I can't believe that I actually bought this.The animation is very poorly done. The action scenes are the worst I have ever seen in anime.

However the show moves along quickly, keeping you interested with the plot twists and combat and of course the love scenes which are always overboard. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low For Anime","review":"Giving this inept film even one star is being generous. Where do I even begin to start on why this is one of the worst anime titles to date. First the plot is laughable at best. All there is to the plot is senseless violence and sex, that includes the murder of women and childen plus the implied rape of a child. TThe voice cast sounds like there reading off of cue cards! I swear no emotion what so ever. Those of you whom are expecting any type of a hero prepare for a huge disapointment! No one in this waste of animated cells has any shread of morality or even a basic sense of right or wrong. Unless you fell the need to punish your self for about an hour I suggest you avoid this film like the plauge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I enjoyed the Professional:Golgo 13 enough to buy this on DVD. Please be aware of the fact that this film is only 60 minutes long if you are considering buying it. I stupidly did not check that detail before my purchase. This film is decent enough. If you are a fan of the first film it is not a complete waste of time. But, it is not nearly as interesting as the first in my opinion, in that it seems more like a watered down version of the Professional. The interaction between the Queen Bee and Golgo is similar enough to his assignment on the rich heiress of the first one to not feel that new, and the psychotic ex marine killer is not nearly as fun to watch as Silver&Gold or Snake from the first. Definately not worth the $..., maybe if it sold for cheaper and you had to complete your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT GROWS ON YOU","review":"On first listen, it is too close to many other offerings in this genre, but after repeated listens, this grows on you. The qualities of this musik are not apparent at first and only reveal themselves after some intense listening.

It was extremely difficult to zip once the items were packed.I did not overfill the bag or try to stuff it shut and it was still hard to zip. I needed to use a pair of pliers. The plastic is brittle even in moderate temperatures (50degrees). The configuration of the strap/net is difficult with only 2 horizontal roof racks (racks running the width of the roof). I had to use extra lashings. It did rain all night on the bag left atop the car in a hotel parking lot. Rained the entire 1/2 trip home from PA to RI. The result was that several items were wet. It works great for extra space for things like kids plastic toys or items that can be bagged inside the carrier. My trip was a great test of the bag...highway speeds with constant rain and lots of wind. Still, it's pretty good for the price besides the brittle zipper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT for Cold Weather","review":"Loaded and secured nicely, stayed very secure for 500 miles thru a very cold snowstorm, kept snow out and contents dry. Unloading was a nightmare as all parts became brittle in bitter cold. Zipper, flaps and strap loops all broke and snapped off.

The bag, as others note, is stiff, but what's worse is that the zippers are made of VERY pliable metal. They bent like a spoon in Uri Geller's hands. I noticed after the first leg of the trip (about 500 miles) that small holes had worn through where the roof rack met the bag. The noise from the bag (not the straps, which I tightened and taped) hitting the roof was like listening to a speedbag, for hours. By the time we returned, there was a 4-inch failure of the front seam, and another 2-inch gap in the rear.I can't recommend this product to anyone. I've put photos of the zippers and seams so you can see for yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great!","review":"Just came back from a 300 mile trip where we used a car top carrier for the first time.Once we got the straps adjusted for our roof rack and tightened it down we never had to touch ituntil we arrived at our destination.

Tough, durable, waterproof, easy to install. We used it with the straps that came with it, and once they are installed the first time and adjusted to fit the rails on your car, they are super easy to attach the next time. We have four children, so our GMC Envoy is left with little cargo space for a road trip when the whole family goes along. This bag provided great extra storage space for our annual camping trip to the Oregon Coast. We checked the straps several times, but never had to readjust them. The zipper was a little stiff, as others have mentioned, but I really think this is due to the thick, durable fabric and the heat-sealed seams that make it waterproof. It's a trade-off that's well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Received defective","review":"After extensive research for roof top storage, I selected this one. When I received it, the seam b/t the zipper & the bag itself was defective & already ripping.

Thank you Amazon for refunding return shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but zipper broke","review":"The zipper broke the first time I tried to zip it shut on the car. It was not even totally full of stuff. It was just so hard to zip shut that, while pulling on the zipper, it broke in half. Good thing it has two zippers, but still, not cool. It did hold up with the one zipper, but would be nice to have two. It also did not hold as much as I thought it would. My recommendation would be to zip it up and unzip it several times in your warm home before ever putting it on a car. It has a rubber-ish material all over the zipper (that makes it waterproof) and after opening and closing it a few times becomes easier and easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, but not as roomy as other hard top carriers...","review":"This is a durable, well made carrier. The major down side is that it is not has large as many hard-case carriers. I was only able to fit one large suitcase, two very small suitcases and some pillows in my last trip. The other thing that you also must consider is that unlike hard carriers that rest on your crossbars, the weight of your items is resting directly on the roof of your vehicle. The tie downs to the roof rack are only to keep the carrier on your vehicle, but if you put something too heavy in the carrier it may dent or damage your roof. But it is very sturdy, and very weather resistant, and a great price. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper broke","review":"We used the bag for our 180 mile trip over Christmas. Temperatures were below freezing the full duration of the trip. The first time I tried to open the bag at our destination one of the zipper pull tabs broke, and the last remaining pull broke while trying to reclose the bag. Even after I was as carefull as possible to align the zippers and use minimal force to close the zipper, the bag was simply too stiff to allow the zipper to properly close. The bag didn't even make it through one trip. Very disappointing and frustrating. I do not recommend this bag to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper Issues","review":"I purchased the product new and was happy to find out how thick and durable the material was. I also appreciated the velcro flaps covering the zipper. Unfortunately during the install my favorable review changed quickly. The zipper which closed the unit is cheap and broke rather easily without pressure on the seems. The pull key ripped the plastic teeth and separated from the zipper quickly on the second pull. There is no way to repair without replacing the zippper. I now must try and return the product..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"You might be able to fit one suitcase in this bag, not what I expected.

But as many other reviews here and elsewhere reveal, the metal in the zipper pulls is cheap. Bendy in hot weather and brittle in cold, they won't last.Our first one broke on the second trip. But I blamed myself, and carried pliers for the 3rd and 4th trip, so I could still get all of the great value out of my beloved (and cool looking!) RainX. Then the second pull broke. And, illustrating more commitment to the product than made sense, I *continued* using it for another half dozen trips, diligently packing the pliers for every trip. Just so that I could open the damned thing?Then it started ripping, even without being full, as discussed in other reviews, and shown in pictures posted on Amazon. I blame its relatively long life with us, on mostly fair weather and shaded parking. For mountains, heavy winds, heavy rains, snow, desert, beach, etc.? Can't recommend you do anything but find another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain-X Cargo bag sucks","review":"The vinyl bag was extremely difficult to unzip. Vinyl gets stiff when its cool, but temps were in the 70's and I had to use pliers to move the zipper. It also killed my gas mileage. The straps to secure it to the luggage rack were also extremely difficult to tighten down. We stopped over night after a 700 mile drive and I went to sear's and bought a hardcase carrier. It was $200 vs the $47 I paid for this one, but I was able to fit more in it, it took just 15 min to mount securely and my gas mileage immediately increased. Don't waste your money on a soft vinyl bag like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any idea how to get 4 27 inch suitcases in this like advertised?","review":"Appears to be nice, but no diagram, and no clue how to even get close to 4 27 inch suitcases as advertised.

It took longer to rig up all the straps than it would have to install a regular hard carrier. There are no retainers for the remaining end of the straps and when opening for a single item everything basically must be dismantled. When packing, one has to be sure they'll fill the whole compartment or the straps won't be long enough to keep the bag from flapping. I would not reccomend this thing to anyone but a lawyer...(don't like those guys).

I simply installed it according to the instruction. It worked pretty well. I had a big suitcase and some small bags and packages in it. I actually got rain on my trip. Everything in it was safe and dry.

We had it on top of the car and drove through some pretty bad rains and everything stayed completely dry. After you set the lenght of the straps, it was easy loading and unloading. We recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Had to set it up in the pouring rain at 4 AM which was no fun, loaded it inside and muscled it on to the car with much help. Adjusting in the pouring rain and by flashlight was difficult at best, then drove 10 hours to OBX, NC in hellacious downpour for the first 5 hours. I was a bit concerned upon arriving but everything was bone dry when we opened it up. As far as closing the zippers is concerned, it is a bit difficult when it is mounted on the roof and filled to capacity but a needle nosed pliers pulled the zippers tight and sealed for the drenching downpour but it is well worthe the 50 bucks, and it can be removed easily and stored anywhere. A hard top carrier may have been easier on the loading but storage when not in use is a big problem for most so this is an excellent alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Money","review":"This past December I found myself in need of a cargo bag for a one time, 2000 mile drive. After researching different options (all with price tags in the $100's of dollars) I stumbled across the rain ex. I thought I would give it a try. I was shocked at how much baggage it held and how easy it was to attach and detach from my Blazer. (Although it held so much cargo that once it was off it was hard to manage due to the fact that its a bag not a shell) We went through a few rain storms and not a drop got inside. I was more than pleased with its performance and anyone who isn't simply isn't being realistic for the money. I would recommend it to anyone for one or two time use on a major trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware.","review":"The product looked real nice BUT, You do not find out untill you open the box from Amazon that you NEED TO HAVE THE ROOF RACK WITH THE 4 RAILS NOT THE ROOF RACK WITH THE 2 RAILS."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAIN-X","review":"It held what it was suppose to hold, keeping it pretty water-tight. But some very serious false advertising. Does NOT use any RAIN-X product just uses the name. It says it is water proof on the package but the info inside says that it is only water resistant. I am glad it didn't rain to test it. The straps were okay. a pain to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Weak Zipper Handle","review":"This bag seems like a very good quality thick, hard material inside and out. I loosely packed the bag with some clothing, tried to zip it before putting it on my cartop, but the zipper handle thingy came loose from the zipper. I tried to pull the other zipper to close the bag thinking I can just use one zipper handle to zip it, but that one came loose from the zipper also. Upon inspection, I noticed that the zipper handle opened, releasing it from the zipper. That thing is so thin and weak that when I pressed it closed and lightly opened it back up to put it back in the zipper line, it literally broke like a piece of cake. I don't think it's even made of metal. Maybe I got a bad batch, but it is what it is. Returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"Pros: low price, kept all my stuff dry while on top of my SUV during hurricane Irene, the web system of straps keeps everything secure, Fits a fair amount of stuff.Cons:things in the bag may rattle during transit, (I had some fishing poles and sporting equipment up there) The first time setting up can take a while. (once the webbing was secured to the bag I just re-coupled the clips in loops once opened for faster set up).

Any book which tries to pass itself off as a spiritual guide and offers the beings which dwell below as models must have alot to answer. All spirits were originally created good, some rebelled against their creator and decieve humans with a false \\"light\\". Could these be the dwellers beneath? What make us so more advanced than the medieval European theologians who also agreed that the earth is hollow, and not filled with cities of light, but rather with cities of the damned and the apostate angels?

The work area is like viewing the world through a soda straw. You can't resize the windows (too hard for the developer, I guess).I think a lot of the effects provided here can be done better within newer versions of Photoshop.There are a lot of Photoshop plugins that mainly make your original look worse.

The one negative I have with it so far is that after taking it off / putting it on several times starts to wear on the O-ring at the end of the barrel, it has to pass through the site rail shrowd (sp?) and it can rip up that O-ring. Not really fair to say that's a flaw in the barrel, just when using it with the Salvo (or anything with that type of site rail attachment).Sends paint further & straighter, although I had problems with paint breaking but I'm sure it was because I was using cheap paint. Cleaning it in the middle of a game is more time consuming than the stock barrel because you have to take care when taking it off and putting it back on (back to the O-ring issue).

It doesn't say this but if you are wondering if it has a time/date stamp for the photos, it does and you can turn it on/off. She was very concerned with this because she wanted a time/date stamp. I took a picture of my fan on FASTEST SPEED and it looked like the fan wasn't even moving in the picture. This camera is amazing. It is also soooo fast. It turns on in like less than a second and it takes pictures fast without delay. Great quality pictures and good video too. Also you will NEED to get a bigger memory stick than the one it comes with because it will only hold 9 pictures with the one it comes with. Also if you are concerned it does not have enough zoom, don't be. Because of the high MP, you can just crop the picture and it will look like it is zoomed and still be a big picture. The battery has a very long charge, too! This is just an all-around great camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems to get good pics","review":"I had the hardest time trying to get clear pictures with too much light or at night.

I called Sony and they said that it was a common problem. The camera all had an \\"access error\\" displayed on the LCD while it tried to retract the lens. It would repeat over and over and the only course of action was to remove the battery. Rather than deal with another lemon, I asked for a refund from the store I bought it from and traded up to a Canon S70. I should get that camera next week. This camera has been recalled in China. The camera store I bought it from (Digitalfotoclub.com) seemed to know exactly what the issue was as soon as I mentioned the model number. They indicated that 85% of their stock was returned and they have stopped selling this and other Sony models."},{"rating":"1","title":"warranty and support terrible","review":"I bought this sony to take picture for my insurance company of destruction caused to my home by Katrina. After using the camera at my parents home before going to the disaster area the lens kept going in and out and wouldn't take pictures. I had not even had the camera for 2 weeks and would not even be able to use it for what I needed it for. Sony gave me an address to send it to since I had only had it for 2 weeks and was still under warranty. The camera repair place said it had corrosive damage. NO WAY! Camera went from Target to my parents home. They want $386 to fix it. More than I paid for the camera. I have since learned that many people have problems with the shutter lens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"50% Handy, 50% Junk","review":"I bought this camera to take photos of my paintings to print off. I had read reviews about the camera being blurry at times, but I never thought it'd be a problem since I don't have very shaky hands. Yet even standing still, I had problems with getting crisp pictures with accurate colors. I skimmed through several of the different settings, but the camera still produced inconsistent results. Some of the photos looked great while others I immediately deleted. In the end, I went back to my old reliable digital camera.The camera does have some fantastic features, though. It has wonderful battery-life and charges up quickly. The movie features are pretty nice too for a digital camera. The mpegs are not DVD quality, but they are fun to pass around the internet. It also is small, but has a huge LCD screen for its size. It would be the perfect camera if it didn't have such a big problem with blurred pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Present","review":"I just got this camera for Christmas and I love it.

One of the other reviewers set up myblurrycamera.com to document his experience with this camera, and he captures what you can expect quite accurately.One other thing - the box it came in seems cleverly designed to be impossible to close properly once it's been opened, making returns more difficult. That's just annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie","review":"just thought I'd review one of our gadgets we've held onto through the years. We've had this camera for over 6 years now and over 4000 shots and it is still working like a champ. The battery lasts and lasts and the shots are always crisp, clear, and colorful. It has been thrown easily into many pockets throughout the years. It's a simple point and shoot with a great lens. It even has one of those viewfinders you can't find in cameras these days. Sure, there are lots of new cameras on the scene lately, usually with lots of useless fluff, but this unit is tried and true. I'm sure we'll upgrade to a new camera someday soon, but Sony created a wonderful camera in this quick and easy gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Pictures. Prone to lens problems.","review":"This camera has excellent picture quality. However, this model is prone to having the lens get stuck or misaligned. This has happened to me twice - - once under warranty, once not. Unfortunately the cost to repair actually equated to a new camera. Look on the net and auction sites and you will find plenty of this cameras sold as is because of the lens having some kind of problem. Its a shame - I really liked this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camera","review":"I bought this camera to replace my Canon Powershot 5MP that seemed to have constant red-eye problems, and I am so sorry I bought it. I have the exact same problem with this camera that other people have described in their reviews. The flash is often out of synch, so pictures are either over exposed, or else totally dark. Also, the slightest movement causes the pictures to blur, and hence, otherwise picture perfect moments are totally ruined. This is my third digital camera and I've never had these problems with any other camera. If you want to take pictures of still objects outdoors in daylight, the pictures are fabulous, but otherwise, this camera is just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony DSC-P200 Cyber-Shot Camera","review":"I am very pleas4ed with this camera.

I had been so happy with it, that I went out and bought the upgrade of this model - the DSC-P200. I've never been more disappointed with a Sony product. The pictures come out great when taken outside in ideal light when the object/person you're shooting is holding still. If you attempt to use the zoom, or take pictures in not-so-perfect lighting, you get a fuzzy picture, one that is completely white or black (from the flash not working right), or strangely, one that is all red. I have played with the settings, but the problem only gets worse. If you're shooting only still, outdoor objects in the daytime, then maybe this camera is for you, but my 9-month-old doesn't hold still for anything, and I'm going to look into returning this camera and getting something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I have had this camera for about 9 months.

Please Buy a different brand of camrea you will be much happier. the parts and acc. are more as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"spots + blur","review":"This camera has just been banned from the Chinese market because it was found to be defective. Sony even bribed Chinese journalists to hush the issue.I've had mine for nearly a year now. I've had to get it fixed twice for dark spots. This is because dirt/dust gets into the camera and onto the CCD. In short, this camera is not airtight. You need to keep it in a sealed pouch at all times. Once the camera came back from being service, it was not even properly cleaned (check comments here for someone to who the same thing happened). So they changed the whole optical unit.Now the camera gives blurry pictures when using the zoom. This is systematic, even if the camera is on a tripod, even if the object photographed is very far and you manually set the focus on infinity.This camera is a piece of junk. Don't buy it, and seeing the long list of cameras that were banned along with it, don't buy Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish this camera was build to LAST!","review":"This camera was an awesome little camera. I loved the features. But it broke on me after 250 pictures. I had to take it back. The flash was not working on it. It either took all black pictures or all white pictures. I wanted to buy another one, but apparently that was a common problem. So while the features worked great, easy to use good size and shape...I will not be getting another one due to all the problems it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy to use and blurry pics","review":"I have had this camera for six months to a year and at first when the pictures were bad (blurry, blue or orange tinted) I thought it was just because I had to learn how to use all the features. However, this camera seems to be impossible. At least 3/4 of my pictures are blurry. It has a very hard time if not in perfect conditions with a still subject. Even then it has problems. I think I have given it enough opportunity to take good pictures and its the worst camera I've ever had.The aspects I liked (which really don't matter if the pictures are awful) were that it is rechargeable and has a decent battery life, and it is compact and a good size. Its also pretty sturdy.I recommend not buying this camera.

The Kirov Orchestra is apparently a small ensemble usual to the ballet theater. The small size of the orchestra allows the music to be wonderfully defined and precise. The orchestra is disciplined and the tempo is always perfect. Yet the music is performed in so lively a manner and so beautifully played by accomplished instrumentalists one becomes immersed in the ebb, flow and drama of the score. Nothing else impinges on your enjoyment. The CD is well recorded and of exceptional clarity. Get this CD. You will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in the highest","review":"This recording of Tchaikovsky beloved seasonal ballet, 'The Nutcracker' has got to be one of the best ever recorded for the Digital era. Music performed by the Kirov Orchestra under the superb guidance of conductor Valery Gergiev in no doubt is superflous and eventhough the tempo is of the music is a bit fast, nevertheless it serves its purpose, for the concert hall. You don't have to watch the ballet to appreciate the vivid display of Tchaikovsky brilliant composition. just listen to the music and be transported to a land of magic and childhood fantasies.

Yes, I read the reviews and was warned about the brisk tempo, but bought it anyway. Now, a year later, I am still breathless from exhaustion when I listen to it. The tempo is more than brisk, with no breaks between sections. Lyricism is sadly lacking in this recording. I'll be looking for a better interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality, but rushed and mechanical","review":"The sound quality of this is just superb. However, it sounds like it was recorded by a computer with hardly any tempo variation, nuance, or pausing; just an exact metronome beat. And that beat is Roadrunner-fast. If you're impressed that it all fit on one CD, the reason is that it is played unusually fast. If you think people who don't like it that fast were all born in the '40s - well I was born in the '70s and my favorite music is rock, R&B; and jazz. But I also love classical music. This rendition is \\"lively\\" but robotic. True, you can't really go too far wrong with great music, and the Nutcracker is great, but I prefer a more organic, emotive performance which sounds like it's played by human beings.I have been listening to several recordings of Tchaikovsky's complete ballets recently, and by FAR the best one isTchaikovsky: The 3 Ballets. It blows all the other recordings away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is hard to give 4 stars or below","review":"excellent!young as Gergiev is,he gave us the best enjoyment of the nutcrack.Seiji Ozawa and Rodzinski disappointed me.And the Finale is as good as Ormandy's.By the way,Gergiev made good use of the celesta.The recording technik is good enough to show us the details of the ballet.Thanks to Gergiev and Phillips"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"No one could take this seriously. If you are at all familiar with the material you'll notice that it sounds like the whole orchestra is late for a hot date and can't wait to get out of the recording studio.

It is technically unsound because the tempi are so fast in many places that the notes do not speak on even the violins, much less on the viole and celli. The brass sound (especially in the trumpets) is so coarse that it hurts. I have played this piece many times with good conductors and bad ones, but I have never encountered a situation in which the music and the orchestra were so utterly degraded by an \\"interpretation.\\" Gergiev made what is obviously a GREAT orchestra sound at best mediocre, and most of the way through, just bad. You would have to pay me in seven figures to put this atrocity in my library of recorded music. I had to put one star in the rating to publish this review, but it surely doesn't deserve even that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nutcracker Complete Ballet CD","review":"@ age 5 I was a dancer in the Nutcracker (obviously not a big part).

I find myself playing Gergiev work here and having a difficult time to draw myself away from it. This recording flows from one piece to the next. There is continuity, cohesiveness, balance between instrumental sections and between the different pieces. The sound is crisp, extremely clear, and not harsh. Play it through a good system and you will hear every single detail Tchaikovsky wrote with extreme clarity. This recording brings you to the front section of the hall where the sound is solid and not far away an distant, yet you still have the sense of the strings being upfront and the winds in the back. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I enjoyed the cd very much. I had an older cd but it was in 2 parts with the last 3 parts of the dance on the other cd.

I've never owned or used a skinning knife before. For a low priced knife, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a nice look to it and the handle is very comfortable. The case is very functional as well. It's nice that you can put it on your belt, but I just throw it in a zippered pocket in my harness pack. This knife is not just good for skinning! I used it to quarter my whole elk this year(I was too lazy to go back to camp to get the rest of my knives). It worked amazingly! Cutting out the backstraps and tenderloins- not a problem! The gut hook is a nice addition too. It works very well, just isn't as easy to sharpen when needed. All in all, you can't go wrong with this knife.

I thought the design was fairly intuitive and seems to lend itself to some skinning and fleshing out of game. The T-handle gives you a fair amount of push and pull strength, which is where the stars come from in my review. The knife sits nicely in its shealth - much like a handcuff case in size and weight.

Perhaps his most interesting idea is that most of them, including the Knights of the Golden Circle (supposed to be a model for the later KKK) never really existed outside the over-active imaginations of its founder and the professional conspiracy-hunters of the day.Is he right? I don't know. Certain people calling themselves Knights of the Gold Circle WERE active in Texas during the early days of the War. (See, for instance, Donald S. Frazier's BLOOD & TREASURE.) So, some organization calling itself the KGC really did exist.But was it the Fifth Column that it was said to be at the time? Clearly not, and Klement's take was right on that score.All in all an interesting book. Perhaps not to be read without some quibbles. But an excellent read just the same.mjt"},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be a best seller for kids - I loved it!","review":"I love this book, it's funny.

I couldn't agree more with all the comments of the other reviewers, but my impulse got the best of me. I was just browsing in the store and I saw \\"Iron Monkey 2\\" with Donnie Yen. I had to buy it. What a mistake. Usually, the kung-fu movie plots are not so great, but this one was really terrible. I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be a comedy or an action film. The DVD version of this film was the worst I've seen. It was like sitting in the front row in the theater with binoculars. I couldn't follow and see the details of the fight scenes. As far as I'm concern, the lead actor could have been David Carradine and it would have made no difference.I've learned my lesson. I will read reviews before making any purchases of DVDs and not judge a movie by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this!","review":"Do NOT get suckered into buying this!I loved Iron Monkey, and the new DVD just released (3/02) is fantastic. So when I saw Iron Monkey 2 at Wal-Mart, I snatched it up. BIG MISTAKE! Iron Monkey 2 looks nothing like Iron Monkey 1, the cinematography is terrible, the color is terrible, the sound is terrible, and the fight scenes are mediocre and vague.

The look and feel of the movie, in fact, make you feel the movie was made BEFORE the original. There are numerous intense, very good fight sequences throughout, though the plot flounders and is choppy in the middle reels. More \\"classic\\" and less \\"wired\\" than the orginal, the movie contains some distracting elements, such as modern backdrops (a nightclub?...with showgirls?...and patrons in tuxedos?) and WAY TOO MUCH gun-play (handguns and the like) for the kung-fu purist (do we allow ANY?). If you liked the 1993 original, you will most certainly appreciate this second offering (but also treat yourself to the 1977 classic!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Sequel To Iron Monkey!","review":"This is a run of the mill Hong Kong Actioner, and if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it, although not much. Donnie Yen is good, the action and fighting sequences are good, Yuen Wo Ping did design the fights. But the filming, editing, and overall quality are mediocre (fans expect this sort of low budget quality in most HK action films). I really believe this is Tai Seng's attempt to cash in on the popularity of Iron Monkey. Frankly, they've done a poor job, as any serious fan will detect absolutely no connection to that story and this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"I felt so sorry for Mr. Yen being in this so called sequel.

I coerced my martial arts resistant wife to watch it as well (she loved the first Iron Monkey).Awful. There is no other word for this pseudo sequel. The story is uncompelling (and virtually unrelated to the first film); the fight scenes don't hold a candle to the original; the production values are bargain basement.And the pan-and-scan! It's impossible to tell what's going on!

The production quality is no where near the Quentin Tarantino presentation of \\"Iron Monkey.\\" Feels like they took an old movie and repacked it for IM fans. Yuen Wo Ping is credited with the fight direction which is good. Acting directing is poor to mediocre at best... It is good to see more of Donny Yen, but I'd like to see more of him in some higher quality films, like a CTHD follow-up, Matrix-style or Jet Li film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second release from the shred-lord","review":"This album was Joe's second solo release.

The album features two tributes to Joe's heroes - \\"The Jimi Stomp\\" (Jimi Hendrix) and \\"Texas Chainsaw Boogie\\" (SRV). Through it all, Joe simply blazes like few others can.

Aside from the MAX interface and toolbar explanations, this book did not do much in explaining key functions.

I found the tutorials that come shipped with the 3ds MAX software to be much more user friendly and in-depth. In fact, I learned how to use the program mostly through the software tutorials than any reference books.

Then again it's not a good 'reference' either as a successful reference makes no pretenses of being boring or not because it must function as a kind of a matrix style index that describes in detail the specific functions of the program. Unfortunately such a book does not exist so I had to settle for this title that sits so awkwardly between being a tutorial and a reference. By the way, don't use this as a tutorial because it gives you examples of objects that are already constructed (on the CD) while only barely hinting at how to actually construct them. If you know that purchasing this title (I'd get it used) is merely a provisional purchase for intermediate users, then it would be worth getting to fill out your already existing prowess in the program."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really nice bit of film","review":"I grew up watching these films and really enjoyed them.

Ellie's boyfriend is a creep who steals her ideas, monopolizes her time, makes fun of her friends, and tries to take advantage of her and yet she still stays with him?

I haven't read the other books in the series, but I think I will.

Back then, I thought this was bad, but after my next one, a Linksys, went down during its first week, I recognized that three months is a quite decent life span for this wireless technology, though \`wireless' is not really an accurate description as my Dell notebook was not able to connect with either the CompUSA nor the Linksys router.The pre N router worked just fine from the start, and now that my notebook's finally gone wireless, I've gone crazy from happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"System installer has to speak up.","review":"I have to tell you that I have configured 5 of these in the last 2 months.

Not much better than other wireless routers I've owned (NetGear, D-Link, LinkSys). The main reason I am unhappy with this router is that it crashes very frequently. Usually at least once per day, and sometimes more. It has this bad habit of handing out mismatched addresses, thus no internet connectivity. The fix is unplugging everything and reseting, but it is annoying and a pain. I only occasionally had this problem with my other routers. For the price, this router is NOT worth it.

Everybody has heard the new single \\"You Dont Want Drama\\" which is the best song out now in my opinion. Other strong songs on the album are The Streets feat Bun-B, Shot Off feat Ludacris, Look At The Grillz feat TI and Twista, and Gangsta. The entire album is good.

The duo 8 Ball & MJG from Memphis Tennesse showed the South the're still Kings with their first album under Bad Boy. Every track on this CD is amazing, from the first to the last track, Fat Boy & MJ display their lyrical talent along with guest appearances from T.I, Twista, Poo Bear, Shannon Jones, Lloyd, 112, P. Diddy, Ludacris, and Bun B from UGK. Their first single, You Don't Want Drama is the first song on the CD followed by Straight Cadillac Pimpin and We Do It which are great songs, but The Streets with Bun B and Shot Off with Luda really take the CD to another level. Don't Make, Forever, and Look At The Grillz are probably the best tracks on the CD. The duo finishes the CD with three tracks that displays their experience in the streets. Overall this CD shows the skills of Fat Boy and MJ.

It was not fancy, but clean and pleasant, just as the book said.(I refer to the hotel they recommend in Malcesina, on lake Garda).All in all - I'm very glad to have bought this book.

One brand I found is Marinex, it is made of what Pyrex USED to be made of-- borosilicate glass. This is the highest quality glass you can get for bakeware. Pyrex may not stand up to freezer to oven use. I have also read many accounts of lime silicate glass developing micro cracks you can't see. These then fill with liquid in the oven, and POW, they shatter, injuring people at worst or ruining dinner at best.

Although a CB handheld's range is not equal to a GMRS radio, but greater than an FRS unit, more people use CB than GMRS and FRS combined, especially while on the road, so assistance is within easy reach. And no license is required like a GMRS. To boost your range while in a car, use an external antenna. This will make your range equal to a mobile CB, plus make recieving signals far easier; making this radio a viable alternative to a permenant mount mobile that is difficult to move from car-to-car.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.'Simpson's wrongly attributes the quote to Kennedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Solid & Fun R&B From the Vaults","review":"A nice roundup of solid, professional and mostly fun R&B tracks from Sue Records back in the day when there were still regional labels.

It contains its fair shair of magic and sword fighting action.Story: Record has a very strong story, although for some reason I didn't like how they suddenly had a huge flashback sequence after the first episode. Aside from that, it has a easy to follow plot line.Sound: Music is great! It has an awesome soundtrack. I didn't like the sound effects too much though. Alot of the effects sounded synthesised, like the thunder.Animation: Old school cell animation.

Maybe it's because I'm not such a big fantasy person myself, but in my opinion, you have to like D&D (or something like that) to like this anime. I see no other good qualities. If you are not fond or simply never really got attached to rpg's such as D&D, skip this anime.I had heard alot of this anime before I watched it and heard from a friend that it was very good. I read the reviews on amazon.com and thought that one bad review out of 4 or 5 wasn't bad. So I rented the first dvd first. It was horrible! I was so bored I took about 3 breaks in the middle of the first episode! Its truly just for the D&D fans. So in my opinion...I didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy fans should love this series","review":"After the first episode, things tend to slow down a bit on the next couple of episodes. However, the pace begins to pick up again soon after. All in all, this anime series was an enjoyable one for me.Granted that some fight scenes/animation were reused on a few episodes, don't let this be a deterent to you to pick up this title. The animation in general was ok in places, while great in others. For example, while Parn's facial features could have been better animated, Deedlit & co were well animated.

The plot is understandable, but has many different layers. The characters are delightfully round, and you are able to see them grow and learn as the story progresses. I've heard Lodoss War described as \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" in a movie - that's not too far off. The same epic feel of fate hinging on the actions of a few individuals is present throughout. The most endearing thing about the tale is the interaction between the characters. The gruff dwarven warrior harassing the slim elven beauty, who in turn flirts with the young man aspiring to knighthood...the personal side of the characters really shines through. The entire series can be a bit expensive, but I think it well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATGREATGREATGREATGREAT oh did i mention GREAT","review":"a great mix of story and wonderful art, this is one of the best none mecha anime i've seen very close to ninja scroll in quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime at it's Best","review":"This anime is for the those that love fantasy, it has knights, dragons, elfs, witches, wizards, dwarves, heros and vilians.

It has a very good story, with several factions moving to conquer Lodoss, with the heroes caught up in the middle. It sounds quite vanilla, but it keeps you at the edge of your seat from the beginning until the very end. The artwork is beautiful: the characters are very well drawn, the scenery is lovely, and the scenes are well-directed - the shots enhance the story-line and keep the pace of the movie going. The music is wonderful - not a simple ditty on a synthesizer, but a full orchestra for the battle scenes, and chamber music for the quieter moments. The themes are well-done. The subtitling is good - English colloquial is used instead of academic translations, which is exactly the thing you expect the characters to say.If you like fantasy and anime - get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantasy adventure Tolkien would have loved!","review":"If you like RPG games or fantasy, this is an anime for you.

English subtitles are also available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Esoteric","review":"This book is not for the average person to refresh his or her understanding of English grammar. This book investigates grammar from a perspective that demands far too much effort for anyone looking to review rules of grammar. Often the standard terminology for grammar is replaced by the author's own vocabulary. Perhaps the book would be helpful for someone who is an aspiring linguist searching for a multiplicity of esoteric investigations of the English language. This book could be one of those investigations. Or maybe a college student could use this book as part of his/her background material in writing a paper.

The dying rich lady that favored her who's rich uncle died too? The spirit/ghost to the rescue?? The only time the author took time to be descriptive is when it came to Tessa's wardrobe and after reading about the first couple of outfits, I skipped the remaining outfit descriptions unless it had something to do with the regurgitated plot.

It got two stars just for that aspect only, otherwise, it would have received one. I found myself skipping large parts of the day to day life and nearly all the descriptions of her dresses. How many times do you need to be told EVERY detail about them?Several times the same information would be repeated later in the story. At about the halfway point on the Kindle Fire the story appeared to be nearly over and I wondered if something was wrong with the Fire. Nothing. The book took on a whole other life of its own from then on.Character development was slim to none. The whole story just seemed mixed up or confusing or I can't think of a good word for it, but definitely a different method of writing. The ending was abrupt and felt just thrown together.There were also a number of discrepancies with the historical aspect. If I didn't get it for free, I would not have been happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple authors?","review":"This story started out fine but transitioned into what seemed to be a second author somewhere in the middle. There were also several implausible scenarios - a doting grandmother turning the only child of her only child over to someone she barely knew instead of keeping him herself despite having the space and means to do so and an extremely sprightly 70+ store owner moving in and out of retirement (did folks live that long in the late 1700s?) as two examples. In addition, there were numerous typos/errors. The book did contain ample detail on various aspects of daily life during that time period - gardening, preserving food, etc. - but most of the dialog and underlying assumptions in the story seemed current. I got this book during a free day. If I had paid the current $14.69 price, I'd be really unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Necklace","review":"This is a stunning necklace!

I purchased a tennis gemstone necklace from another company. It was pretty and had a lot of gem carats, but so uncomfortable, I had to return it.This necklace has awesome beauty.

My first experience started with Elegant Seduction, which was great. The songs were to the point, had great melodies and great shred. However, on Next Planet Please it seemed Dave was trying out an effects processor. Sure, some of the riffs are pretty cool, although very simplistic, and he gets a pretty nice glassy sound on his cleans but there are no real song structures and the solos are endless. I wouldn't mind if they were good solos but he just noodles the night away as he tries to find his way back to the main melody/riff. I would recommend Elegant Seduction as a first album if you're just getting into Chastain. If you're looking for fusion go with Tribal Tech, Weather Report, Allan Holdsworth, Gambale/Hamm/Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporate level switch for home","review":"To keep it short, after trying a number of networking devices.

Sometimes emotions and thoughts seem to be interjected where there would be no way for the author to know such a thing, but they fit the text well and it's hard to fault that. I enjoyed the clear writing style and the references are well documented; this book must have taken a long time to write.

I was pleased with the detail (there are about 1,000 pages for the two volumes), although I sometimes got lost a bit with the places and people names."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon lite","review":"This is a well-written biography of Napoleon that hits the highlights of the first part of his career. It appears to cover just about all of the events of his life to the battle of Austerlitz, and it does so in a fairly breezy style that doesn't spend a lot of time discussing the boring, mundane details. Even the military sections are rather quickly written, and you don't get bogged down in the intricate details of strategy, which to me is a definite plus. There were a few typos in the book, and my copy did not have the endpaper maps (which annoyed me), but I didn't hold that against the author. I'm looking forward to the second part of this biography, and will definitely buy it when it is published."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"Lots of Who's and where's, very little to generate interest in the book. It also stops abruptly at the battle of austerlitz leaving one wondering what happens next. I found it difficult to stay interested in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dull Read","review":"This book is a mostly adulatory review of Napoleon's rise to power. For instance Mr. Asprey's speculates about what a cozy future Europe might have had had Napoleon only managed to compete his vision and unit all Europe under one banner. One might recall that other leaders had the same vision (e.g.: the Kaiser, Hitler et al). Although Mr. Asprey is billed as a former marine the book frequently reads as if written by someone with a narrow grasp of English. One example suffices. \\"Desaix who held the right formed his divisions into battalion squares about 300 yards across the front and 50 yards down the sides.\\" This leaves one with the speculation that perhaps battalion squares are different from ordinary ones. If your ambition is to know more about Napoleon than you started with this book fits the bill, but it's a hard slog."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are too many books on Napoleon's biography","review":"This is yet another rehash of Napoleon's life.

But when a compelling, beautifully written biography like Edmund Morris's \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" or Antonia Fraser's \\"Marie Antoniette\\" comes along, I devour it happily. I did not find Robert Asprey's \\"The Rise of Napoleon\\" to be that kind of book at all. This is a military history, first and foremost. If you want to know (and can keep track of) every move of every division of every army in which Napoleon ever fought, or fought against, this book is for you. I wanted much more personal information, much more about the inner thoughts of the man and what might have made him tick. Nor does Asprey do much towards explaining the world in which Napoleon lived or the political forces that made him what he became. Honestly, I couldn't finish this first volume, and will certainly not go on to read the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"it is not the size of the truck's mirror its a pice of crap. i dont recomend buying this mirror at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Start a great tool","review":"The color star is a great tool for anyone wanting to understand color and various color schemes"},{"rating":"1","title":"The color star","review":"The black cut outs aren't cut acurately.

Something that one would wish to read again.The writing structure WAS quite nicely done, but the story itself was more seemingly \\"fantasized\\" for young readers. The way the story seemed to lead went showed more \\"imagination of the author\\" than what may have really happened. Ms. Newcomb showed her writing style in this book, but seemed to show more of her linguistic ways than Leonardo da Vinci's lifestyle. She did try to capture the reader by using her novel-ish ways, but if it was written like a biography (instead of a novel), things may have had a brighter side.But... This is only in my opinion.

This particular book I had a difficult time wanting to finish. The perspective of the stories were grossly limited by both the recurrent theme of being a new/first time diver and by the fact that few were written after the mid 1970's. There are a few gems amongst the chapters, Dave Berry's lobstering for instance, but the wade through the rest of the book was tiresome. My advise is do not purchase, visit the Library and be willing to skip large portions."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful source for architects!","review":"I was given this book as a gift, and thought I would enjoy seeing conventions used by other architects in a organized fashion. I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED with this book. The book is mostly boring text, littered with poor graphics and inaccurate information. While reading the book, it became quite obvious that the author is not from The United States - conventions were definitely foreign to this architect's eyes. Drawings have been reduced to fit the book such that they are now illegible blurs on a page (with annoying text right over top of them). Code information is wrong (the Texas plan reviewers will be thrilled to hear that Texas has no governing building code according to this text).

She sings out of key, and with a really fake accent. Her husband is a producer so I think that is why they get made. Her music may sound like what you want to hear, but is actually derivatitve, and self-aware, and as such represents the problem with alt country sometimes. So if this sounds good to you check out The Be Good Tanyas, Tara Nevins, Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, Gillian Welch, Loretta Lynn, Emmylou Harris, Michelle Shocked, Cowboy Junkies, etc., instead.\\"Not the tremblin kind\\" sounds like a suburban girl's, art-school dropout view of a noble redneck woman or something- ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"I really love country, if it's bluegrass or modern country or hillybilly or honkeytonkstyle, but lord this Cd is not country not a bit of it, maybe independent or what ever, a terrible voice and the sound , well who like it, might like it, but forme it is one of my worst buys I ever did, well I could only say leave your hands off it and buy other country Cd's"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the real thing","review":"I learned about Cantrell several years ago from the Radio Thrift Shop program she used to host on independent radio (google it, the shows are still available) but it took me a while to listen to her records and still longer to post a short review.Cantrell is a fantastic singer and songwriter whose understanding and appreciation of her musical heritage is evident in every song on this record. She writes great melodies, hooks and lyrics:For the next ten years she rode around on the bus.She did washin' and ironin' and pickin' up.She had a place to stand at the back of the stage.She was there every night, lookin' her age.That's from Queen of the Coast.

Every song is special - from the title track (my favourite) to the last one, and what a voice! Sends a chill down my spine. And the backing musicians are something else as well! I have played this CD more times in one day than any other in my collection.

He points out that it is nosurprise that the apostles in Jesus' day were sowilling to accept Jesus as the Son of God. They wereused to thinking about plural persons from readingtheir Scriptures. Yoel Natan shows that the Greek andHebrew words used in the Old Testament Scriptures atJesus' time clearly testify about the Father, Son andSpirit--three persons, one God.Be sure to visit Yoel Natan's website. It gives moreinformation on his books: The Jewish Trinity, TheJewish Trinity Sourcebook, and Moon-o-theism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an honest inquiry","review":"This book does not pretend to be an investigation into linguistics or history. It is a religious tract written by a person of deep beliefs, asserting opinions to forcefully argue his beliefs. It is worthwhile visiting the author's website, easily googled, which describes his goals and covers his arguments on other \\"scientific\\" matters, like creationism.If you have already decided that Jewish scriptures refer to the trinity, and want to argue the point, you will find this book handy as ammunition. If you want to find out _whether_ there is a factual basis for finding the trinity in Jewish scripture, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed response","review":"With United Pentecostalism and so many anti-Trinitarian groups on the rise, this book is needed now more than ever. It is always assumed by such groups that the Trinity was a creation by councils beginning in the third century and then adopted. Mr. Natan shows convincingly from the Hebrew the truthfulness of Jesus' words in John 5:39. As a Lutheran pastor I would recommend this book to all Christian clergy and laity alike who desire a deeper understanding of the Trinity. This book would also be a great gift to someone who has bought into the anti-Trinitarian arguments thinking that it was a creation of the post-apostolic church. Although I have numerous books in my library that show the doctrine of the Trinity to be faithful to Scripture this is the first book that actually examines this belief on the basis of the Old Testament. This is a MUST READ! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very thought provoking read","review":"I was not sure what to expect when I sat down to read this book, but I was blown away with what I read.

Absolutely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written, shoddily researched","review":"The writing level of this book is junior-high to put it kindly. Not to mention the various stories are thinly researched. In the Douglas/Bendict case, much of what was known to be rumour is stated as fact, and some factual events were mis-interpreted. If you want to know about the murder of Robin Benedict (and it is a fascinating case), \\"Missing Beauty\\" is much more well-written and thoroughly researched.I dont know as much about the other cases reported in this book, but the poor writing style coupled with the errors and gaps in the Benedict story make them very suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias-Cut Dressmaking","review":"I waited three months for this book to be published - paid FULL price for it and was I DISAPPOINTED in the lack of sewing information for bias dressmaking.Yes, I agree that it is a VERY misleading title.Don't waste your money........."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be....for first time sewers","review":"This book gave me the wrong impression....I really though that I was going to find all the secrets on \\"Bias Cut\\" sewing.....No, not at all.

The film itself suffers from having no idea where it wants to go...Maybe this was the intent of the director and for it's lead character. But, it just doesn't work. This was a film trying too many techniques on how to look and be hip...like the indie crowd..tsk tsk. Sorry. it doesn't work at all. This film is pure trash. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If It Sounds Too Good To Be True......","review":".....then it usually is. This product simply does not work. It moisturizes your lips for a while (but you can't use it under your long-lasting lipsticks), but does not plump lips at all. Not one itty bit.Save your money for a botox injection. . . I'm sorry I fell for the \\"big mouth\\" hype of this product. There ought to be a law against false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"This product is definitely not a good first time philosophy purchase. Good thing my sister uses many of the philosophy products or I would never consider another purchase. The description is clever and if you really want that \\"bee stung look\\" go for it. The nude shade was beautiful but within a minute of applying the gloss my lips started to feel warm and burny. I thought \\"Ok, how bad can it be....\\" After two minutes I couldn't tolerate the so called tingling and had to wash the gloss off. Before I did, I went to a mirror to take a look and my lips were red like I ate raspberries. Not a look desired by an adult female, unless I was really eating raspberries. Needless to say since I really liked the color of the gloss and the fact of how much I paid for it, I was disappionted. Hopefully the Birthday Cake body wash/shampoo and the facial cleanser will be more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and fuzzy","review":"I purchased this warm and snuggly for my new grandson, and his mother loves using it. She has a double \\"Bob\\" stroller, the other side for her toddler. This has allowed her to take a lot of walks with both of them, feeling that my grandson is comfy and secure in his warm and fuzzy. He always falls asleep in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably overpriced.....","review":"I own and love the Revolution stroller. However, I bought an insert at TJ Maxx the other week for $7.00. It looks practically the same with the soft sherpa material and reversible. It may not line the ENTIRE seat but it does the job. It covers him where he sits and it's also longer for the legs as it drops down just a little in front. So, I'd have to say that this item must be overpriced for it's function. You can find something cheaper. Save your money. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Of course with all things \\"BOB\\" this is great. My dad says this stroller is turning out to be the million dollar stroller and it is, but this accessory is awesome. I wish I would have had it earlier because it really helps provide support for a smaller, younger baby and warmth for babies of all ages. I keep it in whether we are outside in the weather (quite variable here) or inside at the mall -- my hot natured baby does not seem to mind...but does appear to love the extra comfort. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers As Billed","review":"Those of us who are used to most soccer entertainment have the luxury of seeing this video in hindsight. I'll admit when I first viewed it I had mixed feelings. But, after watching a few videos of the older world cup highlights i realised this one was the best. It gives you the finest glimpses of goals from England's win in 66 to Argentina's downfall in 90. It does have a dated feel to it but, like I said before, having seen other VHSs it is the best. Compared to the very cheesy music and incredibly outdated feel of 101 Best Goals of the World Cup, you should definately choose this especially as far as whats offered on amazon. It achieves in expanding a basic knowledge of the cups in the viewing department in perfect chronological order. Lays it out nice and intelligently. Probably the best World Cup VHS document, and (though an overused statement) is a must for anyone wanting a watchable history of the glory days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chapman's Translation a Must","review":"I can't compare this edition to other editions of Chapman. Having read Pope and Rouse, I will say that neither is like Chapman. He lacks Pope's refinement of language, eschews the couplet, and is bluntly merciless in his views of earlier translators (expressed in copious translator's notes). Pope displays the mantle of civilization; Chapman reveals the gut and muscle that propels it. And Rouse is prose not poetry, so conveys the plot and the air of epic, but not the force that must have been evident in the original. So if you went to the trouble of finding this book here, and are not burdened with numerous other editions, you will enjoy it. At the price, it's real cheap entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad glossary makes this otherwise fine edition useless","review":"Chapman's 1611 translation of Homer is probably the best that's been done into English, and this edition is well designed and printed. BUT Chapman can't be read without a glossary -- he invented literally hundreds of words and has special meanings for hundreds more. The academic num-nums that put this stupid Bollingen edition together gave absolutely no indication in 600 pages of text as to which words are defined in the glossary -- not a footnote, not an asterisk, nothing. Your choice is to look up virtually every one of the hundreds of thousands of words of text to see if it's in the glossary, or just to read blindly on knowing that you're probably missing 50 percent of the meaning of the text. Someone should have lost their job over this piece of university nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect example of bearing false witness against ones neighbor.","review":"I am always amazed when someone of one faith purports to be an expert of another persons faith. And I am even more amazed when it is obvious that said person has not objectively studied the other faith at all. Most of the issues that Mr. White brings up have been asked and answered many, many times over the past 175 years. Also, the caricatures of LDS people that he portrays are insulting, and he has, without a doubt, born false witness against his neighbor (Exodus 20:16). If he were to apply his own methods of judgment that he uses against the LDS church against his own faith, he would find that it would not do well; no religion would. He should remember what the Savior said, \\"Judge not, that ye be not judged\\" (Matthew 7:1)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters to James White From a REAL Mormon Elder","review":"James White's book will receive a thorough review of how a Mormon Elder REALLY would answer his issues he raises. We will have our review in the next FARMS Review of Books (1999), where two of us REALLY do respond to White, instead of White being able to take the lead in ALL the supposed discussions with a Mormon. His chicancery knows no bounds as he unfrocks his witlessness about Mormons. His materials on the Joseph Smith papyri and the facsimiles in the Book of Abraham are a horse laugh!

His writing style was enveloping, but he simply lulls his readers into a sense of trust and comfort, later feeding them half-truths, biased conclusions, and absolute falsehoods. Anyone who reads the book should research the author's background and credentials first, then make an honest effort to prove or disprove at least the historical facts through outside resources. The book is an emotional mousetrap designed to maim the spirit of the average inquisitive christian. The FARMS review by Shirt should be studied with equal intensity and honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wicked attempt to destroy others faith","review":"I find it so hard to believe that others faith in life is so strong and well based that they no longer strengthen their faith by study and meditation, but by destroying the faith of others. Anyone who says this is a good book can be cast into the same category as the author in that I don't believe there is anything to be learned by destroying others' faith. There is nothing to be gained, and even satan lulls us to sleep by saying he cares about us, he almost got me once with the same line. Do not read this, you will be paying another to destroy others lives, hopes, faith and dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with the TV, plus a suggestion to fix volume issue mentioned below.","review":"I just purchased this TV myself and have been very pleased with it so far. The volume issue you talked about is the biggest problem that I have. If you forget to turn it down when going from a DVD back to TV, the volume will blow you away because there is so much difference between the two. But I recently signed up for digital cable (no HD yet in my area), and on the back of the cable box I noticed RCA-type output jacks in addition to the normal cable jack that I was using. I connected the RCA outputs to the TV and it seemed to slightly improve the picture, but most importantly the level of the audio signal is now about the same as the DVD player. I can now watch TV or a DVD at the same volume number. If you have a component (cable box, DVD player, etc.) that has other outputs, it would be worth a try to see if yours responds the same way mine did. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Westinghouse tv/dvd 40\\"","review":"Westinghouse is the worst tv I have ever purchased. I have 2 of this same model and both of them have problems. Both of them lock up. I can't change the channel to unlock it or use the remote to turn it off, I have to unplug the unit and let it set and then turn it back on. I also have problems with the sound, for unknown reasons, the sound will go off. I have to change the channel and then the sound will start working again. It might do this all day and it might do this 2 times a week. Customer service for Westnghouse is a joke. they will not work with you and do not care if you are unsatisfied with their product, especially if it is out of warranty.

Sean Michael Lambrecht is nice to look at, and Jeff Dylan Graham is a pretty good actor, but Jerod Howard is either a terrible actor or a good actor playing the worst character ever written. Secondary players are okay at best. It badly needed an editor, and a writer, and a director who knows how to make movies. Great movies can be made for pennies (ever seenMala Noche?), but this isn't one of them. I made it through to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Intentioned But Poorly Executed","review":"I bought the movie expecting something else, I guess, say a serious drama dealing with real life problems of gay men. But this film has little more to offer than cliched ideas (e.g., gays are the products of homes with dominant mothers and weak or absent fathers - an idea that has long been discredited) and actions that didn't seem to follow from any form of rational motivation. The actors were earnest amateurs at best and the budget was minimal but those are things I could accept if the writing had been better and if it had more accurately presented gay people. I would not recommend the film to anyone other than maybe students at a film school studying how not to make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because zero isn't an option.","review":"Implausible, unbelievable, unrealistic garbage. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Amazing, how infantile writing and riduculous character actions can ruin what could have otherwise been a decent story.

We get enough of this kind of \\"music\\" from pop-puppets like Britney, Jessica Simpson and the PussyCat Dolls. Not surprisingly, Paris Hilton seems to be in cahoots with these fellow \\"music\\"-producers.Why is she even famous in the first place? Her talent? Her skills? Her intellect? Her \\"beauty\\"? Her hardwork? Her contribution to something worth being aware of? Is she a prodigy? What do you think the answer is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a fun cd","review":"if you just like to dance and have fun, this cd is great. i guess some people think they are real music critics and can therefore judge this cd as being shallow and full of pro-tools, or whatever. But my bottom line is, when i go out and dance and want to be the cutest, i listen to this when i get ready. or danity kane. so good job paris."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's very entertaining","review":"It's upbeat. It's got great beats. Very good production. Paris is not the best vocalist in the world but she's better than Britney Spears and her music is not boring like Jessica's. Christina is probably going to get a bunch of Grammies and deservedly so but her album is more Starbucks music than fun pop.I admit that my expectations were very low (I was expecting the female William Hung). Probably nobody will be listening to this CD in a few months. It's not the pop of the decade or even close. But how many times can you listen to Kelly Clarkson?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise!!","review":"Okay, so I must admit, when I first heard Paris was going to have an album out, I laughed and thought yeah ok. I was surprised when I heard \\"Stars are Blind\\" it was actually pretty good. So, I purchased the album today and I must say it is a good POP album. The songs have a catchy dance beat. Some of the lyrics are funny and catchy as well. I am not to fond of \\"Heartbeat\\" though. It may take that one a while to grow on me. Her version of Rod Stewarts \\"Do ya think I'm Sexy\\" just makes ya laugh. That song is so perfect for her!!! Overall, good debut album. A definate surprise. If the Paris haters actually take a moment to listen to the music, they would find it is not bad. Way to go Paris!!!My picks are: Stars are Blind, I want you, Jealousy, Screwed, Turn you On and Do ya think I'm sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yeah! ....What? It was good!","review":"I thought it would be a bomb... guess not! I really enjoyed it, Ok fine it took me some listens but after the third time I really learned to appreciate it! I don't like the single line up. 'Stars are blind' is a good 1st single but the song 'turn me up' should have been third. I think 'Nothing in this world' was a MUCH better song than that one. Anyway this cd is good. Its better than Jessica Simpsons' I can tell you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising debut from the celebutante","review":"yes. it's paris. singing.

Honestly who in their right minds gives Paris Hilton Porn Star a record deal. Wait I know money-grubbin' record producers who also give people like Britney Spears, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, and any rapper out there. Thanks to these kinds of producers and MTV music has been almost completely ruined. There are so many people out there who are into this stuff because they are into fads. Paris Hilton is a fad and someday people who buy this album are going to look back and say WHY?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good first effort","review":"Paris's debut album is a fine pop CD. Is her voice amazing? No. But it was never supposed to be. She's not aspiring to win American Idol or compete with the likes of Kelly Clarkson, Whitney Houston, or Christina Aguilera. She doesn't even rank with Britney Spears, who isn't a big belter like the aforementioned women, but can still emote with her voice and has that signature \\"Britney\\" sound. But all of that is O.K.!!For the most part, the songs are very enjoyable, singable, and fun to dance to. There are some great hooks on the album and the production is great. Scott Storch, JR Rotem, Shep Soloman...they all did a wonderful job crafting songs for Paris.This album is head-and-shoulders above anything Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff has ever released. I recommend giving it a chance and not being 'embarrassed' to buy it or whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"paris is a sweetheart!!","review":"i knew that paris' c/d was due to be released the end of august. so, i kept looking and looking for it. i finally found it. okay, so she's a bit breathy with her singing, but have you listened to song #7? i have ~~ over and over, and guess what? it's good! you'll like it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can buy a CD but even billions can't buy Paris talent!","review":"It's amazing how some fruitcakes can listen to even the samples here (trust me it's must worse trying to listen to the whole thing!) and defend the majority of bad revues claiming \\"people just down this because it's Paris Hilton\\". People don't say this is horrible because it's Paris, they say it's horrible because it is. You know...sometimes a cigar is just a cigar! If Paris really cared about the music angle she would have spent her money to have promoted a talented singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh-Out Loud Funny","review":"(Colg. Kid):That's right. This album is so horrible it's funny. Why does it have three stars on this website? C'mon. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a perfect example of how bad the music scene has gotten in recent years. Take for example the lyrics, how dumb can you be to write lyrics as stupid as these. Oh yeah, not to mention she can't sing to save her life. Her voice sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. I have never heard such untalented stuff in my life. Why again is she famous? It's ridiculous that record companies give contracts to people like Paris. Btw, I am a straight-as-it-gets guy and I am not the least bit turned on by her. I think she is ugly, immoral, and most definitely undeserving of her current status. Do us a favor Paris and stop trying to destroy music with your stupid lyrics and your idiotic personality. That'd be great. I wish I could rate this album 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"great guilty pleasure album","review":"If the Paris-Haters get the fact that this album is being sung by Paris Hilton, they would like it. But since people are stuck up and just decide to hate Paris, they don't give her a chance. It's a shame because this is such a fun record. The songs are catchy. Her voice isn't awesome, but it doesn't suck. It fits the songs perfectly. Does Britney Spears have a good singing voice? No. But does she still sell millions? Yes. It's just like that here.My favorite tracks: I Want You, Turn It Up, Screwed, Not Leaving Without You.Definately check this album out if you like catchy pop songs. This will definately be a guilty pleasure of many! Let Paris have fun!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris Is Burning ....","review":"Easy guys ... Everyone that hates Paris is obviously going to be looking for fault in her first CD venture, but if you come at it with an open mind, and a willingness to dance, This album is the perfect end to summer. I loved \\"Turn It Up\\" as a hot little dance track to shake it for your man to .... \\"Stars Are Blind\\" is a beautiful Labor Day Weekend song to drive down to the beach to. \\"Screwed\\" was a lot of fun. Listen, I am not going to just judge her for her actions in the past, her music was cool and worth the price. Enjoy and give the girl a break, how many CDS have YOU released?? THATS HOT"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pop, what else do you expect?","review":"Basically anybody can make music nowadays, talent or not. So along comes Paris Hilton (who I truly admire) who decided to do exactly that. Sure she may not have the pipes and/or experience for such a feat but nearly half of the artists out there dont either. Plus this music is pop, and really no pop artist can be the next Celine Dion or Mariah Carey am I right? Nonetheless this CD is a nice listen, the tracks \\"Jealously\\" \\"Heartbeat\\" \\"Nothing In This World\\" and \\"Turn It up\\" are good listens, and definetely are catchy. So, as an artist I've heard better, but as a catchy album this is one to not pass up. Agree?P.S. She will rock in Repo The Genetic Opera, she earned the role. Shove aside this CD for that film and see her use some hidden vocals! :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So Simple","review":"Please have criticized this album because they say it is \\"simple\\" music, while in the same review saying the music is addictive because of \\"powerhouse producers.\\"If so-called simple music was really so \\"simple,\\" then anyone could do it. Why would you need top-notch producers? By the way, most of the really great music out there has great producers behind it. That's the way it works.I'm surprised to say this is a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Paris!!!","review":"Many people don't like Paris Hilton, but her CD is great with fantasticmusic, and with the aid of backup and echo chambers, her songs are fine, and good. She really made a great CD, and I think \\"Paris\\" is the best of all of them, and she also sings \\"The Stars are Blind\\", which is a cool song. Thanks Paris for an entertaining CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris Hilton sucks! But her music really rocks!","review":"Well when you hear the name \\"PARIS HILTON\\" you think of some words I probably should not say! We know her past projects have been very bad like her movie \\"Nine Lives\\" and her movie \\"The Hillz\\" her latest movies have been better but not great. You also probably know her from her worldwide smash hit TV show\\"The Simple Life\\" which was such a hit it made 4 seasons plus making season 5 now! So even if you're like me and hated her last projects you will love this Music CD! The song is called\\"Turn It Up\\" and I guess she would say \\"THAT'S HOT\\" but even if you hate \\"Paris Hilton\\" trust me on this one you will walk away saying that song was \\"HOT\\".Buy this one, just remove the picture of her. Then you and your friends can listen to a great song. And pretend that it is not her singing it. This album rocks! My fav song is \\"Turn it up\\"By Jack Turnbull (Australia)"},{"rating":"2","title":"i mean did people buy this thinking she would sound like celine dion","review":"I like every single song on this cd, its fun to dance to, and listen to before you go out...

This is Paris Hilton, not Tom Waits. It's a DANCE/POP RECORD, nothing more, and it should be judged as such.Having said that, it's a good dance record IMHO, and a helluvalot fresher than I expected. Don't like pop at all? Then don't review it if you can't see something for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mills, Eggplant, and Snively are 100% correct!","review":"Just when you thought music was breathing it's last few breaths and is about to die (which it was), Paris came along, and as soon as the words \\"Daddy, I want a record deal\\" were spoken out of her spoiled mouth, BAM!!! Quality music had died.Anyway, this is THE worst album of 2006 and the second worst album ever (Limp Bizkit's \\"Results May Vary\\" is the worst). What Paris here doesn't realize is that no matter how much she tweaks her voice, she will still sound terrible. All tracks on this \\"album\\" get 0/10, but what do you expect? It's a pop album, and all pop sucks!For good 2006 releases, buy \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, and \\"Christ Illusion\\" by Slayer.To Paris: GET OUT OF OUR LIVES!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash from Trash!!!","review":"This has got to be the worst thing I have ever heard. This is not music. Stars are Blind? They should be deaf if they are forced to listen to this whispery garbage. Is this what the music world has come to? Sad, very sad.

And yours probably would be as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-bad pop music fronted by repugnant symbol...","review":"Recently listening to this album, I was fairly surprised to find that it is well-produced (if completely undistinguished) bubble-gum pop, that is no better or worse than most of what passes today for pop music.However, even if one enjoyed this CD for what it is (empty-calorie dance pop), it's hard to get past the fact that it is an album of music featuring Paris Hilton, the self-styled princess of all that is wrong with fame, fortune and capitalistic excess. One cannot fault me for this opinion, since the persona of Paris is clearly being pushed as the album's selling point.If you love her, you'll snap up the CD. Me, I find her witless, trashy, vapid, decadent and grossly repugnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make your very own paris hilton CD","review":"Ever sat there and wondered how it would be like to make a \\"COOL\\" record like Paris Hilton's? Wanna know, here1. STEAL some instrumentals2. Write some retarded lyrics e.g about how sexy you are or people fightin over you3. Breath them over the microphone for about 10 tracks. No need to sing4.

Her voice sounded so phony, synthesized and eerily similar to Britney Spears. This woman cannot sing. I am appalled that a no-talent individual like Paris Hilton is able to put out a CD while truly talented singers struggle to even get noticed. She, along with the likes of William Hung, represent a new low in pop music. It's amazing how no-talents like her and Britney Spears can make CDs just because of an image and/or name recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Because You Can Doesnt Make It Right","review":"Paris Hilton has absolutely no musical talent and this cd proves it. Scott Storch hand-crafted this entire cd. I really want to know how the people that are giving this cd 5 stars are coming to the conclusion that it actually deserves that rating. If you want to listen to a \\"fun\\" cd go listen to NSYNC, at least they can sing. Just because she has the ability to make a cd doesn't mean that it's a good idea for her to do so. 1 star and an extra two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The worst thing about this CD is that it took forever to end.

Upon first listen I was disappointed with my impulse buy; I put it away for a week. When I pulled it out again, I gave a few songs more of a listen: Nothing in this World, Screwed, and Not Leaving Without You, and to be honest, they have a lot of replay value, are catchy and fun, as well as a little predictable. Paris' voice, although certainly nothing to write home about, is seemingly pure, precise and feminine. At times she has a little bit of a Britney vibe. I think I'm going to enjoy this more than I thought...give it a listen - and give yourself over to PARIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris can sing!","review":"Hinted that I wanted this for Christmas and hubby listened!

Of course they aren't: Paris has the money to hire the best producers out there. I'm begging you not to buy this CD because it's a matter of principle: Paris thinks she can do anything when she can't. Buying her CD is just another nail in music's coffin and it's like admitting that we don't care that music has absolutely no substance. We like music that doesn't require us to think too hard, and of course, Paris is perfect for that, as her songs, just like everything else she does, is superficial and meaningless. If you really want some pop music, there's plenty of that here. Hell, you can even buy the Pussycat Dolls' album for all I care.

It is just trendy basically. It also shows you the horror that is the music buisness. Not only that they could sign a horrific atrocity like this, but that people are so desperate to make money that they would overlook talented unsigned bands for this trash. Now, I won't push the music I do love on you the reviewer, like most would (including myself) because no matter what you like, rock,jazz,blues, REAL rap, metal, folk, whatever. You will understand where I am coming from. Music is about passion and talent. The only thing paris has a passion for is money and her only talent is spending it. Don't support this. Support real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"teen pop gone awry - poor singing & production","review":"Having heard the whole album it's clear - this girl does not yet know how to sing - if that's your idea of unpretentious so be it. Were it up to me I would take \\"Stars are Blind\\" (which IS catchy, has an lazy, \\"island\\" feel which works well with her soft tease of a voice), \\"Screwed\\", and \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" and scrap the rest of this album. The latter cover of Rod Stewart needs to be redone, sounds too much like the original, please use a little imagination. Bottom line: except for \\"Stars are Blind\\" this is a forgettable album no matter what your tastes are.PS - if you think payola is dead in the music industry just try to fathom Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review for All Music Guide.

She can't sing, she trys to and fails miserably. She sounds absolutely ridiculous3. Even the bloody producers that she hired because no record deal would dream about singing Paris Hilton can't make her sound good.And you consider this rubbish a 5 star album, I see so I suppose you must think Beethoven is 1 star.

But does this make Paris Hilton's self-titled effort bad? Not at all.Do we actually care if the artist can sing and whether the lyrics are meaningful? Of course not. Take Britney, for example. In the world of pop music, shallowness is something that's counted on, if not mandatory. And who better than our favorite heiress? The beats are club-friendly, and with all that money she has, you bet it's gonna be greatly produced! Starting off with the club-friendly \\"Turn It Up\\" and a hip-hop influenced \\"Fighting Over Me\\", \\"Paris\\" is never dull. Sure, there are some lesser moments, like the slower \\"Jealousy\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\", but she manages to drop some killer hits, like the reggae-sounding \\"Stars Are Blind\\", generic-yet-cute \\"Nothing In This World\\" and the pop-rock wannabe, \\"Screwed\\". Britney never had this much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Paris ( city ) always catchy,....and forgettable","review":"i like city of Paris , same as I like Paris ( Hilton ) . In this album , she tried ( quite hard i think ) to show us , how is Paris' music ; catchy, soft, easy listening, and make your footstep lightly .

Paris has been a jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none, with her reality TV show and numerous other famous tabloid outings. But this is about the music and if you can't sing, hire someone to make it sound like you can sing. Scott Storch is a well-known hip-hop producer, but even he can't save Paris. Highlights are suggested to be, \\"Do You Think I'm Sexy\\" and \\"Stars Are Blind\\". The latter is literally true for Miss Hilton as her voice has a tepid mouse-like quality that Storch wraps into a slight dizzying reverb to give it, um, quality of sorts. The backing band is akin to karaoke quality, which makes sense, as you don't want your band to upstage you. Now think about it. You really didn't think Paris Hilton could sing now did you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"that's hot....NOT!","review":"this music is throwaway bubblegum pop that was handed to paris hilton just so she can once again pollute the media with her trash and freakshow headlines every other week that are beyond stupid.

I wouldn't even waste my time buying it at a used CD store for .99 cents. The good thing I'll say is that Paris looks beautiful on the cover, and that's pretty much it.

Anyone with an objective ear will agree with that assessment. My biggest problem with the album is that the songs are just plain bad. Hell, even Ashlee Simpson was able to put out a couple of albums with a few catchy tunes! There's not a single good song on this entire disc. Anyone who thinks that this album is good music is probably one of the mindless sheep that adores Paris simply because it's fashionable to do so(for some).

Horrible attempt for an hotel heiress.","review":"In regards of an attempt to become a rock artist, her lack of musician skills show here in this album. Most of the songs on this album sound the same, many of them are about herself in a very egotistical way. And did I mention all about sex.... wait..... WANTING sex with Paris, even girls too.Most of the songs have her moaning and almost whinning (lack of breath support as a singer). It is sad to see the recording industry going as low as this, hotel heiress gets an album only because of her name.Save your money on something worthwhile.Im bored now after listening to the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pretty bad","review":"I guess if I was a millionaire I can make an album too.Appernetly anyone who has money makes an album. It's the new cool thing to do. I think it's funny that Paris cried when she heard her album because she said it was was so good. I wonder what she was really listening to? well it has Good beats, good potential songs. but BAD VOICE!!! Scott Storch..YA! LOL Not my cup of tea! If Britney Spears had put out this album I think it would have been a better success surprisingly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Come on now this cd is a hot mess. It shows that if u have money u can be anything u want to be. You cant even hardly hear her singing the beat over shadows her terrible voice. If I could I would not even give her a star.

Just because she is ur hero which I dont understand why, you dont have to pump up her cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"How shallow are you?","review":"Ask yourself what kind of a person are you? Are you going to buy this garbage and align yourself with one of the medias most untalented socialites. Paris Hilton famous for absolutely nothing. Are you going to give this walking disaster your hard earned money? Think about it before you waste your time and money on this piece of junk. Don't send her a message that she can just buy her way into any industry and all of a sudden earn the record sales that it takes other artists years to earn.

I'm not blaming the song writer or the person who mixed the sounds. I'm blaming Paris. What the hell where you thinking? This sounds horrible. I'm sorry Paris but stick to what you do best. Overall the sounds sounded great and I give props to everyone who worked on the album. It's just that I feel like i'm hearing some doing karaoke and it just doesn't sounded like a professional singer is singing. It doesn't have that fire. sorry but 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap...Just plain crap","review":"This has to be the worst album/artist ever to be created and become somewhat popular. This cheep trash reflect how sleazy the music company is today. The album shows no signs of complexity, at least good singing (which is by the way dubbed to make it sound slightly better than her voice. Thank her rich family), and deep lyrics. If you want some good pop music, listen to the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, etc. THEY actually have some talent, mind you that these are just some examples. Dont waste your time and money on this crap. If you want to dance, workout, etc, there are many other new and fresh albums that came out this year that have at least SOME talent. She is the perfect example of a spoiled little princess who wouldnt be able to survive on her own for at least a week (total disconnection from her family). DONT SUPPORT HER."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just threw up a little in my mouth","review":"I do not own this CD nor would I ever, EVER waste my money on this trash.

I never thought she was that great of a singer or song writer and that is what you get on the cd. If you are a fan of hers then you are going to like it. It is full of her talking about how sexy she is and how sexy everybody thinks she is. You are also going to hear some songs about going out to party and boys. That is pretty much all it is. I would not recommend this cd to anyone who is a true music lover because you are not going to get your money's worth. What I do recommend to anyone who is curious is to go to AOL and hear it for free like I did.Screwed, Jealous, and Stars are Blind are pretty the much the only songs that make the album worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not believe the great revies this CD got...so I'm writing my own!","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Paris Hilton, but I don't hate her either, so when I heard she was coming out with a record I was curious. The CD starts out with the song Turn It Up, which is actually an OK song. It starts off with a nice beat and the song itself reminded me of Britney Spear's album In The Zone. Fightin' Over Me follows and the fact that I actually laughed should have been a cue for me to turn it off and not waste my time listening to the rest of the CD, but since Stars Are Blind, which I like, was next I gave it the benefit of the doubt... I shouldn't have! The rest of the CD goes on about how hot she is and how jealous (*hmm* Nicole Richie) people are of her. I gave this CD 2 stars because I do like 2 tracks out of the 14, but do yourself a favor and don't waste your money. This girl can not sing and her album pretty much sucks...sorry Paris, stick to your day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have GOT to be kidding","review":"To the kids who liked this CD: Someday you will mature to understand what real talented musicians do for a living. Not this absolute waste of plastic that Paris has put out. I tried to be open minded, but holly cow, this CD is just plain bad.

This one does.The band, in their photos, look like psychotics, hippies gone wrong. While some metal bands have cited Comus as an influence, in fact 'First Utterance' leaves a lot of metal for dead in the 'heaviness' stakes - although few metalheads would admit that due to the non-electric instrumentation. The album can't really be compared to anything else. It isn't folk. It isn't rock. It is unique. It makes you want to start jumping round the room and smashing things. It is Dionysian, violent, beautiful, timeless...Forty years after its release, 'First Utterance' makes most of today's music seem like mechanised sludge by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Jethro Tull...","review":"You will love this album.

If you go \\"All In\\", most of the other players will too... regardless of what they have in their hand. I beat the Atlantic City scenario (4th out of 5) in less than 15 minutes thanks to a few well-timed All In bets.Graphically, don't expect much. There are no player faces... just the cards on a table. The interface is easy to use as well. As far as the sound goes, the \\"announcer\\" is a neat touch- the first time you play through.

After playing this game, I'm still waiting for one.You have two types of Texas Hold 'Em Poker available in this game--limit poker cash games and a no-limit tournament version. There are zero no limit cash games or limit tournaments. The tournament isn't much of a tournament. If you win 5 consecutive tables, the tournament's done. There are no higher levels for better players.The computer players in this game are horrible. First, any time I went all in with a legit hand, almost every computer player called. You will never see 8 people at a table go all in unless all eight have very good hole cards. Also, the computer always went all in when it had two pair but it would never bet with a straight or a flush, even if it was the nuts (the best hand possible).Another downfall is that the game uses very long passwords, between 16 and 20 characters long.The low price might be tempting. However, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great time killer","review":"This game is only difficult if you've never played Texas Hold'em.Other than that it's nothing but a time killer. It's hard to be competitive when the computer never folds before the pre flop, regardless what is in their hands. The computer will call you about 85% of the time regardless if their hand is good or bad. Any good hold'em player will fold more hands than they actually play but this isn't the case with the computer. It rarely folds. I've also seen at times when the computer has a great hand instead of raising, they will constantly check. Other times they will raise an absurd amount with only two pair.

However, indie it is not. Don't kid yourself. Instead, the characters are overly shallow and annoying to say the least, and cannot act to save their lives: Empty-headed girl who poses for pedophiles, pot smoker, more pot smokers, a wannabe musician who looks like he never fully woke up, a stony artist with too much time on his hands, pervert, more perverts, and...that's about it. Plot was messy and ridiculous, cinematography non-existent, storyline quality was a hairline above the text on a Taco Bell hot sauce packet, and the rest, well, it seemed to gear itself towards perverts.

The pages are double spaced and the book has the appearance of being made on a copy machine. I was let down, given the astronomical price of the book. If you are new to the assessment center process it will give you a basic overview. I felt better prepared with materials and conversations I obtained from other folks in my agency that have already been through the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and pretty much useless","review":"I bought this book to prepare for an assesment center for promotion to police captain. The book is pretty much useless. Poorly written and overly redundant.

SAVE your time and money and stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited and better places to spend your $","review":"Purchased this book in preparation for a Captains assessment center. There were places in the book where the author says \\"the memo below says ....\\" The problem is there is no memo below. Very poorly edited and too expensive for what it provides. Another page had a paragraph that started in the middle of a sentence and did not even belong on the page itself?? Looks like an effort to make a quick $. I would not purchase it again for even a quarter of the price listed. For a Ph.D it is a poor writing example. Also , The sample assessment center exercise was for a SGT test not upper level. Choose a different author! Also the 2 positive reviews came after I posted this one and I bought the book only 10 days ago. I am trying to figure out how someone made Captain at a mid-western city in the last ten days and didn't post earlier unless it is the author trying to salvage a sale or two. stay away from this one. The Rowe book is excellent compared to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was a publisher?","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. Beyond the frequent misspellings and/or misuse of words, there were sentences that were cutoff, and references to diagrams that either did not exist or were mislabeled so as to make the reference pointless. While the topic does lend itself to referring back to previous points, the \\"author\\" shamelessly used the copy & paste method, to avoid taking a swing at it from another perspective. Fortunately, Amazon recommended a \\"bundle\\" that included three books, and so far, at least one of the others appears to have had a professional publisher (or at least an editor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE !!","review":"I felt very prepared after going through this process.

Generous portions of Charlie Parker, Lester Young and many of the other giants who strode the earth, including such underheard jazz greats as Mel Powell, Les Paul and Nat Cole, who leaves behind the vocals and plays straight ahead swinging piano. Like all Proper Boxes, the set is a real bargain, well over four hours of music for a very nominal sum."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price is too high","review":"I reviewed the manuscript for the first edition of Davies's book for Routledge & Kegan Paul and recommended it fairly enthusiastically. The book was limited, but what it did it did relatively well. It was brief but clear, well-written, did not introduce too much of the usual mythology in discussing 'wave-particle duality' (I liked the discussion of the two-slit experiment), and went on to present the introductory ideas and mathematics of quantum mechanics in an attractive way. I used it in the spring of 1998 to prepare several lectures for my junior-level modern physics class, and recommended that my students read sections of it.I can not recommend this new edition. At $42.95 the cost is probably about four times that of the original edition. For a book of this size and limitation, a bargain at $10, $40 is ridiculously overpriced. At $42.95 there are too many attractive alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I would get a good one","review":"Had this switch since early March. Resets about once or twice a day.

I assumed it was the network card which I then replaced but after getting the same connect/reconnect message all the time I bought a Netgear gigabit switch and now have no problems at all. This was the first time I bought D-Link so it's hard to say there is a pattern here but the switch is obviously of low quality and after reading other feedback I would say this is a fairly common problem with these switches.

The two lengthy pieces don't swing. There is none of the overt fury that normally characterizes free jazz. Instead, Brown and crew create an impressionistic soundscape that for me evokes early childhood memories of summer afternoons in rural northeast Texas (not quite Georgia, but close enough). The sound of the birds, insects, the breeze blowing on the leaves, the sultriness of the hot and humid summer afternoons -- it's all there. The social and political turmoil of the day is never too far away (and it's never gone away), but for the moment is suspended. This album is about the rhythm, the pulse of life itself. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"still fresh","review":"Still fresh, though performed quite a while ago.Chick Corea in a different role, hardly any latin goldframing and dancing notelines here.

I can get that for free by watching Fox News.Perhaps it's the years of looking at the world through the pin-hole of uppercrust right-wing living that has dulled his sensibilities and doomed his opinions to total irrelevence. In any case, if you want laughs, rent one of his old videos. If you want to just stew in the juices of the kind of ignorance that is destroying modern humanity, go ahead and watch this one twice.The thinking world has lost one of its prized jesters; the fanatically extreme right-wing has gained a new monger of thoughtless hate.

The intelligence of his jokes makes me wish that he wasn't so funny due to the fact people often times miss his fine line. The core of this isn't about whether your a fan of Dennis Miller or not because his show goes deeper and should be watched if you consider yourself to be a conservative while a liberal will certainly overlook the comedic aspect and bash his act. In short, sit down for an hour and really listen to what he's saying... you'll be amazed by how much you find yourself laughing but at the same time truly thinking about what he has said."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the Wayback machine (and not in a good way)","review":"Remember 2003?

Katherine is a San Francisco native, doing an internship in Wheatstone, England (as rural and remote as it may sound). Ostensibly there to learn a bit about small-town journalism, Katherine is also doing some sneaky research for a sitcom she's writing.Slow News Day smells of romantic wish-fulfillment: Katherine manages to be successful at everything she does (journalism, television writing, a weekly column for the Times...) except for romance. And even that comes eventually. Slow News Day, however, does this in a less painfully self-conscious way. Andi Watson is telling a good, self-contained story with amusing, empathetic characters. The art - although not packed with detail - is an interesting, indicative style that helps keep things moving at a good pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"tinkerbell floor mats","review":"High quality item that is standing up to the continual wear and tear it receives.

Murphy seems to either have had no artistic input or was very deliberately doing something as far from Bauhaus as possible. This was one of the most disappointing albums I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Curious Creation","review":"The premise of combining Mick Karn's virtuoso bass skills with the incomparable voice of Peter Murphy certainly sounds like an intriguing idea, but the results weren't as satisfying as many would have hoped or expected. The tracks are dominated more by Karn's expressive fretless bass work than by Murphy's baritone, which comes off a little thin here. Overall it comes off a bit like Murphy fronting \\"Tin Drum\\" era Japan (Karn's old band) and Murphy no doubt learned the benefits to be reaped by multi-tracking his vocals as demonstrated later on \\"Deep\\" and \\"Holy Smoke.\\" The resulting recording is mild bearing more passing resemblance to Japan than to the tensile goth rock of Bauhaus. It's hard to condemn the prowess of Karn and Murhpy, it's just that the results aren't as accessible as you'd hope. Fans of Bauhaus are likely to be disappointed but those of Murphy's subsequent solo work may enjoy this. Approach with an open mind and low expectations and you could be greatly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick Karn, yeah!","review":"I purchased this album strictly because of the bass playing on it.The albums sound is hard to describe.

The fact is that the quality of presentation of material is very poor, and the book reads like a collection of newsgroup replies and a few cut and paste web articles. So why this discussion ? It happens that Stephen Northcutt is an author and evaluator at GIAC and SANS, private organizations trying to hype up their brand name \\"certifications\\". It helps to be in the good looks of SANS when it comes to the \\"certification\\" and \\"advertising\\" arena. The bottom line: read between the lines (there is one proper review in the list before this one) and hope for a more objective approach when it comes to book reviews.

Can Carol Ann defeat him before he claims the lives and souls of her and her families?Overall, a boring film which could have been better.

It doesn't really bounce back fast enough to get a finger roll going on without modifications to the trigger.Overall, I like it cause you can use two fingers, and your trigger finger(s) won't get tired as fast sharing the work. It did what it was supposed to for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Please be aware that this trigger does not fit the Tipopmann 98 custom pro.

After you pull the trigger with the tank on, the trigger will not reset and catch the sear. without the tank on my gun and hand cocking it, it works every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Nothing wrong with this at all. I got it quick and it was very easy to install in my 98 custom. Nothing bad to say but i rated 4 stars just because i think its a little expensive for what is basically two chunks of plastic and a spring, but You gotta make money. I would get this as it is pretty durable and increses your fire rate to whatever you can do (Get a cyclone feeder for even more potential)"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a peice!@#$?!!","review":"if you get this youll only want to use the trigger guard then end up ordering a metal double trigger like techT's fang...This is NOT WORTH BUYING."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Calendar","review":"Every year I purchase this 12-month calendar, and every year I have not been disappointed.

I've gone through quite a few CD and tape sets. I've learned a lot from each source except for this set. This set is not for beginners and it is very frustrating and out of reach for the novice learner. I've tried to give it a chance so as to maybe change my opinion, but my opinion remains unchanged. The conversations are very difficult and hopelessly wordy. You want to provide the German learner with phrases and words that are most important and not a bunch of colloquial phrases that only native speakers use. That's for later, but a novice course should just stick to the basics and not go too deep. This set is a waste of time. You want to encourage the beginner, not discourage them. If you want a good start, try \\"Just Listen and Learn German,\\" or \\"Berlitz Basic German.\\" \\"Travelwise German\\" is a complete waste of time. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best PC Pocket Reference","review":"I bought this book because I found \\"PC PhD\\" so useful in understanding how the PC works and I wanted to get something smaller to help me with my work.This book has the same information as PC PhD, but it's in table format and is very easy to read through to find information.

Two toes off the tip trimming toward that shaking fringe, then carving high and, just as the whole wave lept forward, soaring along the breaking back. And, in that intant's tableau -- a telescopic view down a glimmering glass wall below a snocapped green mountain and a morning rainow -- I became airborne just as a truly enormous dolphin (perhaps nine feet long) exploded from the wave ahead, its shining gray body for a moment in flight. We both hung in the rising sun long enough for me to shout out loud in astonishment and lose all balance, tumble into the foam as the dolphin speared the surface and vanished. I bobbed about on my back, stared at the dark blue sky and tried to think of a God to whom I could give thanks.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"true to life","review":"Surfed all my life (doing it for 20 years). First in Hawaii then in California, most recently in Santa Cruz. Picked up the book two years ago totally related to Duane's experience. He captures the reality of surfing. In my opinion only weakness is historical references which sometimes get in the way of the flow of his story. Otherwise, excellent! P.S. Those who gave poor reviews were probably expecting Gidget. \\"Caught Inside\\" is not Gidget! Its REALITY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up and smell the surf!","review":"Caught Inside is one of the best books I have read in a long time.

The retelling of his first-hand experiences are sometimes confusing and always verbose.Cannot say I would recommend this book. Not sure if there is a point or purpose to this book or his stories.Also the entire book takes place in Santa Cruz area. I imagined with the title the stories would involve the actual California coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"The comment 'when you don't have anything nice to say....' comes to mind regarding doing a review of this book so I'll try to keep it brief. I think I disliked the book overall because I just didn't like the author. Subtle put downs, I surf therefore I am kind of thinking.Just irritated me. The writing is carefully crafted and the guy is obviously a thinker, but you can be a thinker and a prat and then the joy is lost for everyone.Didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proust Goes Surfing","review":"If you like dense poetic prose about seashore flora and fauna you will love this book.

I read, or should I say endured, about 60-pages of it before wanting to throw it out a closed window. No story-line, just some incoherent ramblings. He would have been better to take the year off and do a creative writing course."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda dull, sophomoric, self absorbed","review":"I grew up on the ocean, I know all too well of its power and allure, I am also a surfer.He seems too concerned about what a surfer should be and wear. Ex: hooded sweatshirts. And why the slap at mountain bikers? Are they really geeks? c'mon, grow up, Mr. Good Karma shortboarder! Go after jet skiers instead. They are the enemyI will say the history was damn good, he should focus his work on that, he shows a true knack for that.However his is description of the California coast reads like a Berkeley freshman's essay. My advice to those who gave this book 5 stars: lay off the bong hits and surf some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book on surfing","review":"Caught Inside is a great read about surfing and surf \\"culture\\", but it only scratches the surface of the beauty and magic of riding waves. Duane does an admirable job of detaling the \\"lifestyle\\" of serious surfers, and gives some insight to what surfing is about - no easy task. His writing is lucid and beautiful, romanticizing surfing while addressing the challenges of it. The only critcism I have is Duane's attempt at \\"de-mystifying\\" surfing, an effort at which he ultimately fails; words literally defy the magic of water and air and the sensation you get while surfing. Nonetheless its a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of a surfer, this is it.","review":"Duane takes \\"surf literature\\" to new level. And it is a level that all authors should look to. He is able to describe the events in his life as a surfer in a very simple, conversational fashion. It makes for a great work. This makes it fun and exciting. A wonderful book that shows the joys, and sorrows of loving the surf and coastal environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"two stars for vocabulary","review":"Duane seems preoccupied with the idea of \\"surfer.\\" How one dresses, speaks, acts. It seemes he woke up one day and decided to become one. Got a dark hooded sweatshirt (pulled it low over his eyes), a pair of flip flops, a custom board and viola! While there is a code of conduct in the water, there is no \\"surfer.\\" They're just a group of people driven by and obsessed with a common goal: the perfect wave. Most of them have left behind the notion of acting like the guy next to them by the time they are eighteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I was eager to read tis book when I got it as a gift, but found it to be hard to read more than a few pages at a time. The author uses so many references to other works that I felt I should have read them instead. Also he seems to get lost in very wordy discription of quite trivial things that have little to do with the story, which by the way was very weak at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"a surfing classic","review":"Caught Inside is the best book on surfing that I have read. Not only does Duane capture the challenges of mastering the wave, he also captures the challenges that face young men moving from the last days of youth into full adulthood. Duane is right up there with William Finnegan, a big kahuna in the world of surf literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomoric","review":"While entertaining, I found it read like a Creative Writing 101 project. He goes on and on (and on and on and on) describing the natural beauty, after a while I'd say \\"enough! How about the surfing?\\" The \\"poetic\\" parts were repetetive and frankly not all that inspiring.Don't get me wrong, being a surfer myself, I found it lovingly researched, and very interesting at parts, especially the history. Sadly, most of it reads like an article in \\"Surfer\\" or \\"Outside\\" magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical, literate, and funny","review":"George Plimpton used to tout his \\"small ball\\" theory of sports journalism: the smaller the ball, the better the writing. In his book \\"Caught Inside,\\" Daniel Duane skilfully demonstrates what happens when the ball shrinks down to nothing and is replaced by a 7-foot piece of fiberglass.But writing about surfing literately and with aplomb doesn't mean boring. There is no fustiness here, no stuffiness or sentimentality. Matter of fact, Duane is profane and funny.Examples: Duane tells wicked stories about Tom Wolfe and his over-hyped \\"Pumphouse Gang,\\" gives a media-savvy view of the Kato Kaelins of this world, and demonstrates wry humor in describing all surfers' over-attunement to things that go swish in the deeps.Buy it, read it, enjoy it. Duane is a Levi-Strauss of surfers and \\"Caught Inside\\" is a loving look inside that taciturn culture -- one that is simultaneously thriving and threatened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review by a surfer for other surfers","review":"I have just finished Caught Inside and I must say, this is pretty thin. I have been surfing the California coast for twenty two years in and around Santa Cruz and I haven't seen a fraction of the things that Mr. Duane has claimed to have seen. I think what we have here is someone who invested a year of his life surfing and still didn't have enough interesting material to put together much more than the same stories we all have about good days and bad in the water. In order to stretch his content he did some research and came up with some really good material about the history of the California coast, weather and wave dynamics and local flora and fauna. The rest seems pretty fictional with implausible conversations which occur while surfing breaking waves, stereotypical depictions of locals and main characters, forced wannabe guru-ism and a hyper alertness that notices and relates every detail of earth, sea, wind, plant and animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"This book is ok - not excellent - if you give it 5 stars you really need to read some more books. It is somewhat interesting in describing the life of a surfer but its extremely repetitive, it drags on and its lacking in any action and that certain something that seperates the wheat from the chafe.You can almost feel the editor saying we need to spice this up - what about sharks - so there are forays into sharks and surfers. It gets ridiculous when he writes about being scared to pee in the water because a great white will smell it and come in and chomp you. Yes - that is really a huge concern I think 100 surfers were eaten by great whites last after they peed in the ocean.If you are going to read this book - read the first few chapters and then put it down because the book, you won't miss anything later on - except for silly shark myths."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Fire","review":"I am sure Daniel Duane did his best... but this is the first book in a long while I find myself wanting to light on fire.

Unbelievable!!I guess most ordinary listeners can't see beyond the heaviness and the barrage of notes to appreciate the complex arrangements and the beautifully interwoven melodies.

I ordered the x-large, which is supposed to be size 14 - it's not!I'm a size 14 and I could barely fit into it- let alone wear it.

There was, however, an annoying paper sticker attached to one side of the protector, like one of those pricing stickers that simply refuses to peel off. I did manage eventually to scrape it all off, bit by bit (finger nail), but I also managed to damage the screen protector in the process.

It comes off overall like a children's theater piece, that would have been happier on an Irwin Allen show than OL.The saddest thing about \\"Eck\\" is comparing it to the series premiere, \\"The Galaxy Being,\\" which shows how far OL had degenerated from its original inception.

Good enough for me to take my time deciding which HD service to subscribe to. The set looks great, no problems, and the remote works fine. There are plenty of connections available. the satellite box is hooked up s video (no HDMI or component connections). I have a upscale dvd player (Sony) hooked up with HDMI and it is near HD....it upscales to 1080i and the picture is near HD.

Not the worst problem, but really irritating.Now, we've seen other reports of this on the internet saying that this is solved by a firmware upgrade. But calling Westinghouse Digital's support is pretty much a waste of time. They refuse to admit that there are firmware upgrades. Their only answer is to ship the unit back and they'll send us a different refurbished one.We keep calling, hoping to get someone who is a little more helpful. But alas, still no luck. The last time we called the person actually suggested that our remote control was \\"leaking\\" signals that the monitor was picking up, and suggested that we move the remote to the garage to see if the problem went away.

I chose to drive the thing to Tempe, AZ. A week later the service center tells me that Westinghouse will not send them the part (new LCD panel) and I need to pick up the TV and send it to California for repair. Excuse me? What is the purpose of a service center? Westinghouse also states it may be 6-8 weeks turnaround after they receive the unit.

The best songs would have to be Double Dare, Stigmata Martyr, which really scared me on first listen, and the live version of Bela Lugosi's Dead.

Jim's writing shows scholarship and deep insight, while at the same time exuding deep compassion and a child-like wonder for God and his design.

It is beyond the intermediate player's skill. Some of the song texts have been altered a bit from the original cast recording to make sense as a stand alone piece.

The songs on this album have the cerebral quality of the best be bop, and the swing of Duke Ellington. For those unfamiliar with Mingus, don't be put off by the fact that he was a bassist. He does solo, but he knew enough not to expect non-musicians to sit through extended bass passages. While the music is complex, layer upon layer of rich sounds, it is also extremely accesable to anyone who loves jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Vital As Anything Recorded In Its Day","review":"There are three albums that make up my introduction to jazz records.

In no time I'm so crazy over Mingus, I start buying everything I can find by him and shortly after that I caught him live at 2-Saints, a small...No, make that a tiny club on St Marks Place. During intermission I even found myself standing next to this jazz titan at the pizzaria on the corner of St Marks & 3rd...Having a slice with Mingus....Man, what a night that was!!!Back to Ah Um...It's a seminal jazz recording. In my opinion as vital as anything by Elington, Monk or Miles. Pork Pie Hat is at least as great as Round Midnight, Sophisticated Lady or Funny Valentine.

He is made of a durable cloth with attached wooden dowel to control one of the hands. I have average size adult hands and it fits just fine, but may be unable to fit a larger man's hand.

As other reviews have noted, the manual is way out of date and omits details. The setup was basic, but the assembly took longer than it should have because of the confusion. The fit and finish are crude..seems like paint slopped on pot metal. A lot of minor things such as lack of washers for bolt on painted surfaces connections, over tolerance collar ring which will not square itself to the column. Most aggravating thing is when you go out of oscillating mode you have to manually turn the oscilating pulley until the chuck reaches zero again at the head, otherwise, your depth adjustment will be off.

Then it is difficult to install on down spout, strike two. Also it will not fully roll out unless a down pour is happening. However in a down pour it doesn't release water fast enough so water shots up around the bend in the down spout. I would only recommend if you live some where it doesn't rain allot and the rain fall when it rains is a medium amount not to much or to little. To much trouble went with a hard plastic option from Lowes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless trash","review":"I purchased one of these at a big box retailer thinking it was a great idea at a low price. I was wrong. The first time and the last that I used it I found a bloated half open drain that was actually shooting water back at the house. I tried to help it open but to no avail. It must need a steady heavy downpour to work because light rain makes it do more harm than good. Do yourself a favor and just use a longer downspout that you can trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of your money!","review":"I purchased this raindrain to take the water away from my lanai and the foundation. It was simple to put on. Then it started to rain. I watched with anticipation as the rain got heavier. The drain unrolled as advertised. But the little sprinkling holes were inadequate for a heavy downpour. The rainwater then backed up into the downspout and started shooting out, with force, out of all the connections of the gutter. Needless to say it is a waste of money unless you have the \\"perfect rainfall\\" so it can unroll and roll back up without problems............I don't think we can predict that sort of thing. It has been removed and thrown out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one season","review":"This thing worked as advertised. It unrolled and a cute little shower effect occured. It shot three or four feet in the air during a heavy rain. Alas, the next spring the plastic had cracked and it worked no more. Also, the capacity to drain water was insufficient during a downpour and my gutters over flowed over my porch and ran into my basement anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"It really isn't long enough to push water away from the house because it has holes just a couple of feet from the down spout and that is where most of the water will leak out unless it is a heavy downpour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Product is not worth the money spent on it, the tie straps were so brittle the broke when putting them on the downspout. Fortunately I had tie straps of my own - put the product on the downspout as directed the day before a steady rain. Not once did they roll out during rain, ended up having to remove them because the water wouldn't extend the roll out of the product as advertised.

I had at least four of them and I don't think a single one worked right.

I thought a new one might be in order. While on that mission trip, I examined the tool belts of the other people we were working with and the Buckiet Boss brand seemed to be the most popular. So - with Christmas coming - I ordered it. He LOVES it -- particularly the clasp on the belt - so much easier to do up and un-do. He is sorting tools to carry permanently.

Come on, 1/2 amp can't even drill a simple hole? I then put a simple 1/4\\" bit in and it too would stop with some added pressure. This thing has NO muscle!!!

I have been doing carpentry for over 35 years and although this is not a professional drill press it does the job I need it for and the oscillating drum sander application is an added bonus. You cannot push this machine like you can a professional drill press but I have a tendency to let the tool work for me instead of me working the tool and if you do that you will have great success with this product. The shipping took a little longer than I was expecting but everything arrived in great shape.

I bought this small seemly nice drill press from them under the name of Shop Fox, thinking things would be different. I am very disappointed at the lack of quality control. The motor housing was bent to the point that the machine would not work. But worse, a switch wire was hanging out of the switch housing. The wire was pinched down to the bare wire between the switch housing and the drill case, which would have cause a short to the drill press causing a potential shock or fire or both. I replaced the wire myself, because I didn't want to haggle with Grizzly. It isn't worth the frustration. This will be the last time I will ever buy anything from Grizzly (Shop Fox).

The same thing happened the next day. The 3rd day, I used the OEM Olympus battery first and I went easily into the afternoon and only needed to swap in one Targus at the very end of the day. Now, 2008 one year later, the Targus battery (I lost one) didn't last 1/2 hour. The OEM went 3+ hours and still showing charged in the green zone. I'm going to buy another battery, it'll be an Olympus OEM. Yeah, its pricey, but if it works like the battery that came with the camera, it'll be worth it.

Plots became more interwoven and complicated, the character development became even deeper and Jennifer Garner's acting improved heaps since season one.Relationship development was the majour theme in this season, between all characters. JJ Abrams proved that he is a casting genius when he cast swedish actress Lena Olin as Sydney Bristow's Russian spy-mother Irina Derevko.Lena proved to be an outstanding addition to the show and within a few episodes had become everyone's favourite character.

If you are a Seinfeld fan, you will love it even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book; item not as described","review":"The book would probably be better for older children - my 2 1/2 year old was bored two pages into it. Item did not include cd as described by seller; unfortunately I didn't notice that until after the return deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Seinfeld's Bad Halloween","review":"For my review, I picked Jerry Seinfeld's Halloween because I really liked it and because it's a comedy about a kid who loves candy, candy, candy, candy. On Halloween he can't find a costume. One Halloween later he finds a Superman costume and he loves Superman. But when he goes trick-or-treating the mask breaks and everybody is giving him really bad candy so his Halloweens are really bad. Why don't you find out what happens?Oh, and I think if you're about 7 years old and up you will like it. I would give it four and a half stars if it were possible.By Isaac"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled. . .Simply NOT Appropriate for Children","review":"Ok. . .first off, I'm a HUGE Seinfeld fan, but I was sorely disappointed when I picked this up for my 6 year old. The book is good for a giggle from adults, but seems to promote ill manners and behaviors that I don't believe most people want to instill in their children (although who knows these days). Do yourself a favor and read through it at the bookstore before you purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be in the children's section","review":"I borrowed this book from the library b/c my children liked the pictures. When I sat down to read it to them I was appauled by the language and negative attitudes in the book. Words and phrases like, \\"shut up and give me the candy,\\" and \\"idiot.\\" If you want a child who enjoys the innocent thrills of Halloween this is not the book for you; but if you want a disrespectful and ungrateful child trick or treating then...actually I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars Would Be More Appropriate","review":"This would never have been published were it not for the Seinfeld name. This is not a book, but rather a transcription of a not-very-funny standup routine. Avoid this \\"book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween","review":"Though this book is artistically beautiful, the concept is not for children. I sat down to read it to my grandson last night, the night before he was to go out to \\"get his candy\\" and I was shocked. My mistake, I had just gotten the book in the mail and had failed to read it before I sat him down. This is not a book for children. I will not teach my grandson that if he does not get what he wants he can throw it back, or that he can talk in such a rude manner. Because of this I had to skip pages...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even my kids knew it was inappropriate","review":"Why is it that anyone famous in Hollywood thinks they can write a kids' book? Not only is the language low-class (fools, stupid, shut up, etc.), Seinfeld tries to use adult humor and bad grammar to entertain children, resulting in a poorly written piece of junk. The plot is about getting the perfect costume and getting candy above all, but in a rude and disrespectful manner. The story does not even flow well because of the occasional unrelated sidebars. The end states \\"I realized when you're a kid you don't need a costume, you ARE superman.\\" That was right after the kid woke up from eating the entire bowl of candy in one night. It is like Seinfeld felt the need to have SOME kind of a positive message in the book -- maybe he could have tried by writing a better book, or by not writing one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too happy Halloween","review":"I did enjoy reading the book it was funny, but I advise not downloading it to the Kindle because the print under the pictures was too small to read so I had to use a enlargening glass to see it. I tried making the print bigger but it didn't work, if you want to read this book, buy the hard copy you will enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"I'm surprised by the other reviews.I actually read the entire thing in a book store, so I couldn't say if I was dissapointed that I had purchased it. But, putting myself in the situation, I'd say I would be.I'm a HUGE Seinfeld fan, but this book was just NOT funny. It also reused a number of jokes I heard from Jerry before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids under 12","review":"I bought this book for my kids thinking - they love Halloween, they love being read to and I love Seinfeld - so I thought - perfect combination. My kids (6 and 7) didn't get most of the jokes and I hated having to read the bad examples, like the parts where he throws the peanut candy at the old lady and eats all his candy in one night. The story is pretty choppy, and not that funny, even when you do get the jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great.","review":"I was at a bookstore with my sister. We came across this book and sat down and read it together. I am 18 and she is 16. We sat down and I could not stop laughing. We both had tears streaming down our faces. It wasn't just funny. I thought it was cleverly written and very honest. We ended up buying the book and we read it together all the time and we still laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I read this book to my 6 year old and he loved it and so did I.I am a big fan of Seinfield and it is another example of his amazing ability make people laugh. I believe that the humor in the book is understood a little differently from an adult, than a child, but no matter what age it is just absolutely funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Met This Guy 30+ Years Ago . . . .","review":"I met Ken Wooden in the late 70's and put together a speaking gig for him at my university. At the time, I volunteered at a halfway house for troubled teens and intended to pursue an MSW and work in that field. To promote Wooden and his book, \\"Weeping in the Playtime of Others,\\" we did the typical wheat paste posters and booked an auditorium for his speech. The turnout was good. Much to my shock, the guy tried to hit on one of my friends, a female student who was all of 21 years old, and propositioned her for sex. I realized then that the guy was a fraud and liar, who was a total hypocrite about what he was preaching. I went on to get a law degree and left the field. I hope that people can see this scumbag for what he truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"only good for direct one source lighting","review":"Only good for one source direct lighting...

This is a very nice product if you can 1.) walk and stand where your subject is and then face the light source and then take the image and then set your white balance to use that last image.This you can imagine will be a pain but this is how the instructions state it to be used and not how others have posted videos of it's use.I find it to be much easier to use a grey card or just set my white balance right there.Please, write me if you have any issues setting your white balance and I will tell you are very easy trick for that.Wish everyone great white balance,kai"},{"rating":"1","title":"shows lack of understanding of the Christian Faith---","review":"Christians receive their salvation through Jesus Christ, not fasting as stated in the book. This is a major mistake about the fundamentals of Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. The chemistry between the two lead characters is great. Yes, some of the scifi elements are a bit stretched, but this movie is more labeled as a romance. I'm planning to buy the blu ray soom from Amazon, but can anyone tell me if the original ending of Henry visiting Claire as an old woman made it to the extras? Can't seem to find this info anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"This was a good mix of science fiction for me, and a love story for my wife and daughter that watched it with me. It was not hard to follow and actually almost believable from a sci-fi view.Great Winter entertainment if you get a chance to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man-beasts 1 rational creatures 0","review":"Just what we need. Excuse me, let me just before I get started, this is akin to finding out that your government has been employing a fake flu scare to administer a psychotropic calorie cure trial to the populace. So, great, now we have a film that glorifies deadbeat dads. Nothing better, I say. Why, it sounds more wholesome than a cooking show with teddy bears.So this guy cheats on his wife, living this whole double-marriage lifestyle, driving the women in his life to, out of some self-destructive Stockholm syndrome death urge, concoct these elaborate fairy-tale fantasies for why hubby's never home to take care of the kids and bear an equal share of this nonstop carousel of pain and sorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I read the book a few months before watching the movie. Alot of parts were not included in the movie, ALOT, but it was still a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Film I've Ever Seen","review":"While I respect others' opinions about this book/film, I have to admit that 1) I believe it was the most boring film I've ever seen; 2) they say \\"the book is much better than the movie\\"; yikes, I can't imagine that. If I was offered money to read the book I'd decline in a heartbeat. Since I seem to be in the minority, please ignore my comments.

If you get passed the inconsistencies as far as time travel, and all time travel movies have inconsistencies, it is well-acted, romantic, funny, witty and sad. I highly recommend the movie and seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible not to sleep","review":"Boring and confusing, cold and slow, and a character who suffers from a disease which sends him back and forth in time. Well, this so-called disease is treated like a genetic problem, but is not travel time related to physics?The guy should have looked for Stephen Hawking for help, not a geneticist...A time traveler would be a fantastic subject of scientic studies but in this slow-motion story Henry, the time traveler, is shown as a poor and unhappy guy, and his apparent gift is treated like a curse. Try not to sleep if you watch it after 9 pm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left out the most important scene","review":"I understand they shot this scene that's in the book but left it out of the movie where Clare is told by Henry he will see him one last time after his death. She sees Henry \\"one last time\\" as an old woman and man, that really was THE moment in the book for me. How romantic is that?! It was the moment I wanted to see most. To leave that out was criminal whatever idiotic reasons the director had for leaving it out and they were IDIOTIC. The director should have his Director's Guild card taken away for that. Dumb, dumb, dumb. And yeah, the book was waaaay better. Considering that major faux pas and missed opportunity modus operandi a more deft director probably could have made a much more amazing emotionally effecting film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it the acting?","review":"I just never bought into these characters on screen. I felt they had no chemistry at all and the acting was so disconnected. I didn't even cry when Henry died - I was just so unmoved through the entire movie. Maybe it was the acting - I don't know. I just wish I had never watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Excellent Acting","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, after not much press and mediocre reveiws, was pleasantly surprised. McAdams and Bana are both well-suited and talented for these roles. I didn't think it was hard to follow at all, you just have to pay attention. I own the DVD's that I feel are exceptional and will own this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"this book was so good. when i saw rachel mcadams was going to be in it i couldn't wait to see it. i love her. well, unfortunately this movie was quiet bad. the acting by the main male role was awful. i have no clue why it has 4 stars on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"It's a very touching story. One of my favorites out there. Glad to own the movie! Received it in a timely manor :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looked and sound very good","review":"Picture and audio quality were fine on \\"The Time Traveller's Wife;\\" I have no complaints on that score. As for the movie itself, it's good but not great(haven't read the book). Eric Bana seemed a little flat as the Time Traveller."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie, but...","review":"I read the book a few years ago and thought it was really good. I looked forward to seeing the movie version. I will have to admit I was a little disappointed. I guess the movie standing on its own was pretty good, but it deviated from the book in ways I thought took away from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw the theatrical release...","review":"and felt I wasted my movie on a cliche- ridden mediocre movie. Take your movie and buy something REALLY romantic. This will leave you cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck on a plane and wanted to open the door","review":"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Normal you can look past problems in the plot but when the movie is so disjointed as this one the rules of the movie has to be fallowed. A man who knows the future and lives in the past will change it just from being there so when one of the rules is you can't change the future that is very hard to pull off, and they don't. So it is really frustrating to watch him change certain things and then act like he can't fix stuff when he gets a chance. I watched this on a flight and by the end I was just frustrated and ready to walk out. The funny thing was that all the people around me felt the same way. The best part of the movie was how fun it was to make fun of it for the last hour of the flight.Just skip this one, it really is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TIME TRAVELERS WIFE","review":"We watched this movie for about 15 minutes and had to turn it off as we may have both died of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ???????????????????????????????????","review":"i hope the book was better, I could imagine so.the imagery was nice and picturesque... however, the disconnection really failed to tell a moving or gripping story.the dialogue was so stale and laughable...it failed to justify either the romance or the element of sci-fi.it was just a hot mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh..Seriously not worth it.","review":"Really not a romantic movie as the guy dies in the end. It is really a drama with a really worthless story line. I wouldn't recommend watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring and just plain horrible!!","review":"I only wish I could rate it at zero!! What a piece of junk and waste of my time and money!! I can't understand anyone rating it over a 1 star! Don't waste your time or money on this movie unless you want to be bored to death and bang your head against the wall when it ends! Garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"What a super crappy movie! Terrible ending, what a bummer. Don't buy if you value your emotional state at all. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Traveler Fashion Show","review":"An okay movie, but nothing really deep or emotional ever happened. The timer traveler's child acted pretty smug about being able to control her time traveling. Why can't you change past or future events? Most of the movie was the main character jumping from time period to time period and hunting for clothing. The movie should have been called \\"The Time Traveler's Fashion Party.\\" Perhaps the book is more in-depth and emotional, but the movie falls short in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I guess I am surprised by good reviews but I am always at odds with general population.Let's just say I expected something a bit interesting. The gist of the story is that main character has a genetic defect that allows him to travel in time(kind of like magic, I guess). The entire movie consists of him going and coming back from his travels. It never explained how or why he is able to do that. Poor girl that he falls in love with spends her time waiting for him to come back from his \\"travel\\" and then they get a daughter who is ..whoops, a \\"time traveler\\" also. That's the whole movie for you. I love Sci-fi but this is a pretty poor attempt(and a boring one at that). There is a love story in there but frankly I couldn't have cared less. I found all the characters rather annoying and superficial. I think if you like movies that don't explain anything and don't go anywhere, this one is for you. Otherwise, I suggest a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Got it quick and in perfect condition. Just what I needed at the end of a long week, more tears and crying out my ex's name in bed. No but really, amazing product and amazing business."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love Story","review":"From beginning to end you will absolutely love this movie. It's a real tear jerker. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams have really good chemistry in this movie and I hope to see them work together again.I think if you love the Notebook you will love this ...if not more. So grab your box of tissue and be prepared to cry at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tear-jerker","review":"This is a great movie to curl up on the couch and watch with your husband (or husbands, surprise your wife with a movie night). It is certainly a tear-jerker toward the end of the film. This proves that knowing the future is not what's best, even when it's what we often say it's what we want. Would definitely recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Good movie with some decent special features. Behind the scenes with actors and Audio commentary were interesting to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching Movie","review":"I just saw the DVD. Did not read the book. The movie brought out intensive spriritual emotions in me. It's all about love. Also reminds me of Jesus's resurrection when the time traveler returns after his own death. Inspires the viewer to make the most out of the limited time we have together and to feel the sense of loss when that time is over. The entering and exiting of the traveler causes no one to take life or persons for granted. This movie and the Titanic elicited great emotional reactions. I cried while watching both movies. Only the belief in Heaven can comfort the finality of earthly life."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"the dvd was in great condition. its a great movie and i enjoyed it very much. arrived quickly also. thank you so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can rum, but you can't hide!","review":"I'm not trying to ruin the movie, but the moral of the story is annoyingly repeated; even if you can see the future, you won't be able to do anything to change it. With a good actress like Rachel McAdams it was easy to allow this topic to pass, a drink might even help, but the annoying cheesiness was difficult for me. The other facts you should know about time travelers are: they are romantic, have money to buy a wedding ring even though they can't keep a job, and most importantly; they lose their clothes when they move in time so they have to stay in shape!You can swallow large doses of anti reality drugs but still can't miss the lameness and emptiness of this movie's pointless need to create some romance, what a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.... Hoped it would be better","review":"I thought it was very boring and at times a little hard to follow. There's no excitement and definitely no real romantic feel to it. I hear the book is so much better so I am definitely going to read it. It's just one of those things where you have to see it for yourself, everyone will have a different opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the book","review":"I was a huge fan of the book and I know they did their best to bring it to life, but let's face it the book is always better. But it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! The only this is ...","review":"I hadn't read the book, nor knew it existed, until years after I'd watched the movie. The movie, on its own merits, was riveting and I honestly can't remember a single thing I didn't like about it. If you've read the book, or hope to read the book before checking out the movie, you'll liikely find the book much more fulfilling (that's almost always true when comparing books with movies of the same story). The movie includes certain segments within its script that weren't in the book so...if you plan to read the book after the movie, do so - both are good - but they are significantly different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a great movie","review":"Suprisingly boring movie.
