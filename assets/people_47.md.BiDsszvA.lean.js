The scale is too small, leaving gaps and unnamed streets and , most annoyingly, landmarks are shown as isometric images superimposed on the plan of the city. Streets behind are necessarily hidden.

I happen to like maps... it's a guy thing. I spent over $40 on city maps before I went to Italy. I thought they would be better since I paid so much for them. Rick Steeves told me not to do it. Rick told me to get the hotel map. I should have listened to him. The limited amount of time (a few days) most of us will spend in any major city on our trip does NOT require anything more than the map your hotel will give you. Some of the maps they provided were actually better than the ones I paid $8 for.ONE MORE TIME - get a free map at the hotel or tourist information office. Do not spend a ridiculous $6 to $9 on a little map when you can get one for free. Trust me on this one. If the freebie doesn't work for you, any tobacco shop in Italy will be glad to sell you a very nice map for 8 or 9 Euro. Fell free to send me half the money you have saved following this advice.

Amuses them for a few minutes.The problem is Cranky's head falls of if it is knocked over. I have glued his head back on 3 times with super glue (each time scrapping off the old glue to get the best hold) Head still falls offMy 3 year old calls the toy \\"headless cranky\\" because I have said he can't play with him until his head dries, that he is headlessI am not sure why they designed it for his head to break off.

I have to admit that the magnet is very strong, my son can string Annie and Clarabel together and Cranky can hold them both up!My biggest complaint is that it should be attached to a small piece of track like many of the other Thomas additions are. When my son turns the crank, if he doesn't hold cranky down with his other hand, the whole thing topples over. If it had a wider base and was attached to the track, then it would be sturdier. Also, my son wants to put Cranky right next to the track! But Cranky works best if he is about 3 inches away from the track, then the magnet falls right directly over the trains on the track and can lift magnetic cargo up, so my son gets frustrated because the magnet does not fall over the trains. If Cranky were attached to track the way I suggest, then children would not be able to put him too close to the track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy but...","review":"My son loooooves Thomas, and loves Cranky. His favorite Thomas video of all time is Creaky Cranky. So we ordered it for Christmas, and it seems durable, and he loves playing with it. HOWEVER, if you're going to give this as a present to a very excited 3 year old, TAKE IT OUT OF THE PACKAGING BEFORE YOU WRAP IT! Cranky was screwed to two pieces of wood through the cardboard. Two of the screws were stripped, and required us to snap the pieces of wood (Cranky was okay, luckily) and use a pliers to turn the screws. The entire time my son was so excited and and upset we wouldn't give him Cranky, he was jumping up and down next to me. He's a very well behaved little boy, but on Christmas morning when you're three and want to play with your new toy, even the best kid looses patience.All the other Thomas wooden pieces haven't been this much trouble to open, so we just weren't expecting it. If not for the stress this added to our Christmas morning, this would get five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son really loves this toy. He loves to pick up the cargo with Cranky and then drop it in a basket or somewhere else. He also uses it to pick up his other trains since the magnet picks up the connections on the front and back of the trains. He doesn't have any trouble using it and it made a great addition to his Thomas train set. That being said, this is our second Cranky the Crane. We gave him one for Christmas and had to return it. The top part of the Crane disconnected from the base when my son picked it up. It was defective and our new Cranky doesn't seem to have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head DOES come off often!","review":"The only reason this even gets 2 stars is because my simply loves it! He is constantly bringing it to me because the head falls off. Now after pushing it back on so many times, its wore the plastic down.

I have restrung and hot glued Cranky so many times that I am ready to come unglued!! My son has pretty much given up on Cranky as Cranky seems to get real cranky if you even look at him.

My son loves playing with Cranky and he is fun to play with as long as you have several other Thomas trains that have cargo. The more the better!As for Cranky losing his head...his head is meant to fall off and then can be fitted easily back on (break-away). It is not as big a deal as the last reviewer made it. It definitely didn't stop us from keeping him.As for the 4 star rating...I think it is a little pricey for what you get.Two years later and Cranky is still crankin' it out at Sodor Island at our house.

There are probably dozens of encyclopedia-style texts out there dealing with magical creatures and mythical beings, but this one is easily one of the more enjoyable volumes I've had the pleasure of reading. As has been pointed out in another review, this is not a book for those who are longing for visuals over text. This is not one of Froud's Fairy books or one of the Gnome texts. As fun as those books are, there is a heavy if not predominate focus on their original illustrations. Carol Rose's book is focused instead on textual descriptions and summaries. There are plenty of great illustrations in the book, mostly woodcuts from Rose's own private collection, but these are not the key focus of the book. But I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good, searchable reference guide to creatures of myth and magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and Durable!","review":"I love this peg set, you can hang them together or individually for different looks.

While the skits in Faerie Tale Theatre were entertaining even to those who didn't recognize the celebrities, the cartoons offered in Bedtime Stories came up fairly short. The charm just wasn't there. She didn't want to watch all of the tape after viewing the first four cartoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A biography worthy of its subject","review":"No one writes about science--and scientists--with more insight, poetry and passion than Dennis Overbye. I loved his previous book, Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, and I love Einstein in Love. It succeeds gloriously both as scholarship and literature. By revealing the -all-too-human mortal behind the mythical genius, Overbye makes Einstein's achievements appear all the more miraculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring book, purchase experience was good","review":"This book starts off dry and doesn't really get anything going for about 100 pages. Boring book. The purchase experience was great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Einstein did his own mathematics","review":"The idea that Einstein's first wife Mileva checked his mathematics for the special theory of relativity is laughable. This issue has been put to rest by Einstein's biographer Abraham Pais in his 1994 book \\"Einstein Lived Here.\\" Here is why. First the special theory of relativity requires only elementary mathematics, the breakthrough is in the concepts. Second Mileva was unable to pass her final examination in mathematics in 1900 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Einstein passed). She failed again in 1901 and did not receive a degree. Third Einstein was able to master the advanced mathematics necessary for the general theory of relativity which came after his divorce from Mileva. It takes a very creative reading of the documents to ascribe any role to Mileva whatsoever in the special theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"I KNOW these people!!","review":"When I read the book, going from story to story, author to author, I got a real familiar feeling, like this is MY group of friends.The stories are interesting BECAUSE it feels as if a friend said, \\"Guess what happened to me today!\\" and then went on to describe a trip to the video store or some such thing.It is a very enjoyable book. If these people are indeed in the Editor's life, then he is lucky, as anyone with a diverse group of friends can appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"writers worth watching","review":"Although uneven at times, there is undeniable talent evident in this anthology. Insight, humor and the hunger of the undiscovered are the key ingredients in this concoction of fiction, poetry and essays.

We may be hearing from a few of them in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Horn doesn't sound anything like the sound clip.

He would definitely fall through the bottom if we didn't hold his shirt while we pushed him, so it *should* have a seatbelt. It will be several months before he's tall enough to move this on his own, but that's ok.Please do not buy this toy for a little one and expect them to be able to maneuver without assistance. In addition to the age range, I think this toy should have a minimum height requirement. A short 2 year old's legs might still be too small to reach the floor.Also, the hole in back is the gas tank for the Little Tykes gas pump, not a spot for a pole to push the car. This is not a push-style ride-on toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Toy Investment I've Ever Made!","review":"Last Christmas I ordered this car for my 2 year old, and was a tad bit skeptical that he would actually use it long term. However, since he has loved cars since 4 months of age, I figured I'd give it a try. At first, he only sat in it with a look of ecstasy on his face, then as he got older and more coordinated, he started \\"driving\\" around the house. Now, he zips around the house fast as can be, takes sharp corners without knocking anything over or dinging up the walls, and can even drive down the hall backwards. He has played with it every single day since it arrived under the Christmas tree. I was even able to put this car together by myself (and I am horrible with following instructions). My son is big (over forty pounds at almost 3, and tall too) but I predict he will actually fit into this car until age 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!!!","review":"My son received this for his 1st birthday and we had it stored until now (he is 16 months).

Well, they propell forward and smash their face or slide backward and get stuck between the steering wheel and the rough edges of the seat. My son is now nursing a back abrasion and welts on his belly because he got stuck - it took my husband and me to get the thing off him while he screamed. This is overpriced and dangerous.

I have seen some horrible toys, this one is down in the gutter with the worst! By the way, we LOVE the Wiggles!(added years later now that he is a preschooler; note that older kids can get in without the bruises.) *** if you have the small wiggles musical dolls; try removing the little noise maker and using it inside this steering wheel horn!

In fact, we have adopted this book for part of our hospital-wide critical care classes with the nursing staff. The detailed descriptions of what it is, why it is, and how to perform the many procedures that we use in critical care were accurately and simply written for even the earliest beginner to understand.

Well, first I can say that I would never call this release a masterpiece or even a great album, even if there are some good moments. In my opinion, Julie Miller isn't that great as a singer since her voice becomes rather boring and even whining in the long run - in small doses she's so much better. And as for the songs, there are a couple of high standard, like \\"That's just how she cries\\", but the overall material doesn't touch me the way I was hoping for. I guess the musical direction on this album can be described as alternative country but it's far from cutting edge. It's a decent effort - nothing more and nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T keep your distance","review":"I'd like to think I'm aware of all superb musicians out there, but Buddy & Julie were completely unknown to me before I caught Emmy Lou Harris last summer & Buddy was doin' her lead guitar work.

So of course I availed myself of the internet and scored this gem.This disc scores on all fronts --- superb musicianship (though I'll confess Buddy's brilliant fretwork is not as \\"in your face\\" as it is live), excellent songs (Julie pens amazing stuff) & VERY tasteful covers.

Mr Zimmermann is an incredibly intelligent musician with beautiful tone and phrasing. He was so unfortunate to do this recording for EMI during the same decade Perlman did his with Giulini for the same lable. I would not say Zimmermann's playing is any less good than Perlman's. Zimmermann tone is as sweet, but the direction of his phrases is even clearer than Perlman's. The English Chamber Orchestra under Mr Tate sounds extremely inspired and delivers very vivid and chamber music like accompaniment. There are a few trully great recordings of this concerto.

It rather a short book overall and its give a pretty good understanding basic values of locations in terms of Atlantic City to the boardgame.Of course, the Atlantic City that being described in this book no longer exist.

I do like how they work, they don't smell as strong like Sharpie's do and they seem to cover 90% as good as Sharpies too.

So the trade off is that Bic don't last as long but have more colors and are cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Colors and Good Value","review":"The colors are beautiful. The selection is much better than Sharpies. I do find that Sharpies are bolder though - these Bic markers feel more like water-colors if that makes sense. But for the colors and the number of markers you get, it's a great value. As someone else mentioned, they do have a nice rubberized grip. I've had this set for more than a year now, and they all still work wonderfully. I've used them for lots of little projects, but not for huge coloring projects like posters. They have a nice tip that seems to hold up. I'd probably be happy to buy a set of these each year to have around for all the smaller projects and things that come up during the school year for the kids, and at the holidays, etc. The pastels are very nice and not as easy to find in permanent markers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Was shipped fast....just what I need for a daycare project for lots of kids...,,,very bright colors and kids loved them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bic Mark it","review":"Although I am very pleased with the product as far as the color choice,the quality the packaging and the fact its a permanent marker set.

First, we liked the broad spectrum of colors. Second, the built-in storage case looked handy. We have been using the markers for several months now, and we LOVE them. The colors are true/accurate, the line is fine (but not too fine), and the quality of the markers is every bit of what we have found with Sharpie markers. The handy carrying case for the markers not only makes it easy to see all of your colors, but it makes storing the markers simple. We have 3 little ones at home, and we don't want permanent markers lying around. With this case, we just click it shut and toss it in the closet. Last, but not least, the value of this set is incredible. The Amazon price on a per-marker basis is much more economical than the cost of Sharpie markers. I don't think you can go wrong with this excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for such variety and amount of colors","review":"I do a lot arts and crafts and find this set very useful in those projects, so many bold and bright colors to pick from.

It has more colors than you can creatively think of, no odor (which is an annoyance for most permanent markers) and the tri-fold plastic carrying case is very useful.

Although it's odd to need a permanent marker in EVERY color, it could come in handy from time to time. Literally every color is included in this pack; and the container organizes the markers well - it's not just a throw-away package.The rubber grip is nice for extended use. The markers have nice fine tips, but I don't think they will stay that way for long. I wouldn't buy these for kids (besides the risk of walls being colored), I think the tips would wear down quickly.I've really enjoyed having them around for organizing bins, etc. I think they would be great for creating posters, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful colored markers.","review":"These permanent markers are beautiful and the rubber gripper makes them easy to use even with some arthritis in my fingers.

While I love Sharpies range of colors, I HATE using them because of their lack of archivalness, within a couple of years they begin fading and often get a ugly hue effect around the colors. Whereas Bic Mark-Its have an almost identical color scheme but are made with an acid free formula. I use these in my visual journals. If archivalness is important to you go with Bic. I must say though I do not like Bic Mark-It's Extra fine point. I bought two six packs and there were two dried out. On the other hand I have recent bought two 36 counts and one 24 count of the fine points and have had no issues with dried out markers with the fine points. I stocked up during a deal and opened each pack and tested each marker. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and truly hope they are around for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety of colors, comes in a fold out case, perfect for school projects","review":"This set contains 36 assorted colors. 12 of them are pastel colors like Pink Flamingo, Ocenview Blue and Lime Sorbet. 12 of them are bold and bright colors like Fandango Pink, Hot Aqua and Tranquil Teal. 12 of them are darker bold colors like Rambunctious Red, Tuxedo Black and Forest Green. All of the colors are unique but the Meadow Green and For-Ever Green seem to be almost identical. Other than that I would say this is a good variety of colors for school projects, labeling or various other tasks. They come in a plastic case for storage. Each marker has its own slot. Each marker has a rubber grip and comfortable to hold. I really like this set a lot. The price is also a lot better than buying the markers separately or in smaller packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made in America Markers","review":"This set is fantastic.

I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a hobby, so I gave these a shot. I've used Copic and Prismacolor markers in the past, and these really don't compare in my opinion. Maybe it's me, but I'm not able to get the same blendability(is that a word?) out of them.However, for the price there is a great variety of colors and they're bold and vibrant, definitely worth it. I like the fine point, it's good for precision but also for filling in larger areas of color. And the colors don't bleed on cardstock, I've used them for card making with just lovely results. Just keep in mind that you're not going to get the same quality out of these that you'll get out of markers that cost $5 to $10 each, and you'll be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice!!!","review":"Molto carini, sono un pò più scuri come già specificato da altri, ma son cmq molto belli!!

The color is a bit more diluted on fabrics, and I would NOT recommend coloring in big letters that require a lot of ink on a piece of fabric, then washing it.

I have not tried the other colors yet, but red and black work just fine even after several months of sitting in the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These Markers!!","review":"Copic markers are supposed to be the Rolls Royce when it comes to colouring, and that is fine if you can afford up to $9AU per marker, but if your like me and just new to this whole alcohol blending marker thing, these, the Bic Mark-Its are your best bet! I wish they had a colourless blender to really get the Copic experience, but I think I can get away without one for just now and have fun playing. I bought both sets, the Ultra Fine Tip and the Fine Tip, I find I am using the Fine Tip more, so if you can only afford one set of these or you don't want both, go the Fine Tip for your colouring, you will get way more use out of that set than the Ultra Fine Tip, unless you are into doing very detailed work.

That album was absolutely flawless, but I think hitomi puts out some really good music with Huma-Rhythm. There are a few highlight tracks that are so excellent they make the album seem better than it actually is. That, along with the fact that Huma-Rhythm was released in 2002 (with most of the singles being from 2001), a time when I thought J-Pop was truly at its best, but certainly beginning to decline in quality.Is It You? might be my favorite hitomi song of all time, and I feel like I enjoy this album even more because of it.

A worthless waste of money!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who gave it a one star on all counts. In fact it deserves zero stars!As I roll out the fondant the mat slides all over the place and curls up on me so I can't even see what I'm doing. It is very easy to get creases in and impossible to get them out, so when you roll the fondant it has big creases in it. There is no storage container for it so it gets dirty easily and doesn't clean up well.It's a good idea but what a shamefully cheep product by Wilton. There are other mats that do the same thing but stick to the counter and come in a storage container. I bought one by Epicura, a non-slip pastry mat. It's almost identical to the Wilton one but a tad smaller and way better quality. It was also less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP CRAP CRAP!","review":"This worked great for maybe three cakes, then it sucked. Every time I used the lines to cut fondant lines(I even used the Wilton PLASTIC rotary cutter thingy)it left dents/lines in the mat which, in turn, left lines/dents in the fondant, not good. maybe should just be called the roll mat, because roll AND cut, not so much.Not to mention it is flimsy as all get out and edges roll up. I still needed something with a grid for my fondant and I just can't work the $ of a silicone one right now so I went to my local fabric store and bought a 36\\" piece of vinyl(the thickest they had), put that over the top of the Wilton crapper and I actually have an ok workspace. Defiantly would not by another Wilton mat though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This mat is garbage and barely lasted a month. If you roll it up to store it, it stays rolled up and even taping down to a table after that is hard. It's cheap \\"table cloth\\" like material as another reviewer mentioned. Don't bother. One upside to this mat is that, if you can get it to stay down on a hard surface, it had a gridmark on it which allows a super easy way to cut straight lines of fondant along with a ruler. Other than that it's a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Wilton Product","review":"Wilton usually has awesome products. This is the exception to that rule. It wouldn't stay put while I tried to roll out my fondant. So I taped the corners down to the table.

Horrible, horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!! Buy a ruler and parchment paper!!!","review":"I read all of the bad reviews and thought I would still give it a try.

And while I love the classes and most Wilton products, this one is NO GOOD. I am now a cake decorator with many cake orders a week, and this thing is not cutting it. first of all, it's completely curled up and I have to use objects to weigh down the edges, which only get in the way of my rolling. Then, it slides allll over the place while I'm applying pressure with a roller, so it slides away and leaves indents on my fondant. It's junk. I love the measurements though, but that's it. I'm going to go look for a silicone one or something. anything that lays flat and sticks! this is a joke of a product. if they simply put weights in the corners and grips on the bottom, it would be a 4 or 5, but without that, it's useless :( I tried tape, but tape doesnt stick to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly gets old","review":"My son loved this toy for about a month.

Not only does brother J shine on the album but he also has some nice guest appearances (Krs-One, Chali 2na, Jr. Gong Marley).

I had finished a monster novel I love for the third time, and wasn't going to sleep, so I turned to this one. Pretty certain and nearly afraid that it couldn't possibly be as wonderful as I remembered it being. AND IT IS! What struck me particularly was how elegant the prose is. Nothing fancy, but clear and intelligent. Three chapters in, and still not sleeping I went on the web to see if anyone else cared about David and the Phoenix. Boy did I get my answer! Sweeter than sugar cookies."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-science and generally tedious","review":"The Phoenix was slightly endearing, with its pomposity and bluster, but only slightly.Our protagonist, David, did not win my sympathy at all. Almost the first thing he does is try to bribe the Phoenix, with cookies. Then he and the Phoenix find a sleeping creature and try to hit and kick it awake so it will tell them something. In the audio version, David's voice is annoying.The villain of the book is The Scientist. I'm offended by the portrait of \\"science\\" as hunting and killing for no good reason, and by the implication that science and magic are mutually exclusive with magic being cool and good and science being evil.The narrator of the audio version, who is also the author of the book, talks with a wide-eyed, overly explanatory inflection, like he is talking down to kids.I did not finish the book because I did not care about the set-up or the characters.

By that time he could and did read much else to himself, of course, but there was something about dad reading that book. Alas, he has passed away and it doesn't look like I'll have grandkids to read it to, but when I see that tattered book I simultaneously smile and shed a tear. I'm sure there will be more generations reading that book as long as it's in print.p.s. This is the hardback edition I'm reviewing, don't know how it got hooked up with the PB version.

Since the complete recording of this performance for sale here is no longer in print, this excerpted-version is the only one available, in which you get to hear the Bolshoi's own orchestra performing Spartacus with supreme mastery. Listening to this recording, one could see ancient Rome with its Colosseum and Circus Maximus vividly. My favorite number is the Phrygia/Spartacus adagio, in which Phrygia senses that Spartacus might die; it is most moving. There is a complete companion-video to this performance, which can also be purchased on Amazon.Com. The leading dancers are Mukhamedov and Semenyaka. It, too, is beautifully performed. And by the way, it is the only complete video of the ballet (the one starring Vasiliev is not complete). All in all, this recording of Spartacus featuring the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra is the definitive one. And don't forget to get the video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bridge!","review":"We surprised my son one morning with a re-done train table.

My only complaint is that I needed to repair it out of the box. One of the wooden supports was not fixed to the bridge properly - had to glue it myself. Minor issue but something that should not happen when paying a higher price for the Thomas brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not top notch.","review":"This book, really a novella, has an interesting story and premise. I won't get into these details as others already have. The two main characters have been developed fairly fully, but other primary characters, less so. There are other inconsistencies in the creation of this world and scenario which just leaves a science fiction reader scratching his head. Granted this is fiction, and a science fiction reader should be used to improbable scenarios, the fantastic, and the like, that's what ultimately makes it science fiction. Each world, however, should be internally consistent and sensical and this story does sometimes leave one a little perplexed. I paid twice the price than the going rate, which I think is more appropriate for the size of this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a strange and fascinating book!","review":"I really enjoyed this sci-fi story of humanity turned into little more than horses for aliens.

I think the idea and the research behind this story is interesting. The characters are interesting and well-written. However, I kept asking \\"how did things get this way?\\" and that was never answered in the book. Such a radical change in the human condition really needed a good explanation otherwise I just had to accept it and the questions of origins just wouldn't leave my mind. I was also disappointed that I didn't know what these Hoots are -- what exactly are they? How exactly does prey overcome predator? Are human beings so easily classified as predators? But if you don't have these sorts of questions then you should just enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saddle Up!","review":"The Mount is easily one of the best novels I've read this year. Charley, the novel's narrator, is a fascinating and wonderfully realized character who continues to deepen and grow more complex as his understanding of the world changes. The heart of the novel is in Charley's changing relationships: with his father, with his host, Little Master, with Lily, his first love, and finally, with his own sense of self. This is a heartfelt, warm, and very funny book, and I found it leaving an unexpected impression long after I had finished it. Like Charley, we all face a world with competing allegiances--one in which we all struggle to understand the ways in which we're bound, and the ways in which we're free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond heart pendant with chain","review":"My wife loved the necklace!

The Delta miter gauge has a little washer at the bottom of the guide that rides in the T-track and keeps the gauge from tipping out. It's a great feature if your saw supports it. Mine doesn't, so I needed to remove it. There's just a Phillips-head screw holding it in but unfortunately, as one of the other reviewers said, it's virtually impossible to remove. I ended up having to drill out the screw. Also, as mentioned by this same other reviewer, I discovered that there were no holes in the miter head for attaching an extension fence, even though the instruction sheet states that there are. So I will have to drill those myself.Once I got these issues sorted out, the miter gauge worked great. It should have been more painless though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what should be standard issue on all Delta saws","review":"I bought this miter to replace the one that came with my Delta 10\\" contractors saw. It's a much nicer made, more adjustable miter, which should be standard issue on all Delta saws. The fit and finish is good and the stops were properly set out of the box, no adjustments necessary. Adjusting the bar for the slop in the miter track was simple and easily done.My only real gripe is that they're still using the same pointer that they've used for decades. The problem with that is that it's relatively easy to bump that pointer and knock it out of proper alignment, plus it can be difficult to see precisely where it's located on the scale. I'd much prefer a more robust, easier to see pointer like are found on the Incra and Kreg miter gauges.I purchased theDelta 34-568 Miter Gauge Clampto go with the Deluxe miter gauge. It installed easily and is a nice accessory for smaller stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta table saw miter gauge","review":"Delta makes a fine product. I am mostly happy with it. The needle pointing to the degree mark is removed from the scale by about 1/8 to 1/4 inch, so the reading is hard to see precisely. My older Delta gauge, which wore out after about 16 years of use, had a better pointer and scale so that it was easier to get an accurate reading. The pointer was right on the scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle K sneakers","review":"I first bought these sneakers in chocolate leather, they wre so comfortable.

I was looking forward to receiving this pair of shoes in the mail believing for the price I paid they would be top quality and ended up disappointed before I even tried them on. The velcro on the side of the shoes is not fully sown on which will cause them to fall apart much sooner than they ever should. I also received the order with no return label or order slip.

Perri Klass is a well known Pediatrician, a knitter, and a writer. This book is made up of small essays or columns from different publications that she has written for. They are the perfect size for a \\"just before bed\\" read. She is thoughtful and very articulate. The stories and thoughts are personal but universal.

I have watched the entire set of A Touch of Frost on DVD and grew to love the characters so much that I thought I'd try reading the books on which the series was based. The book does not disappoint.At first, we experience Jack Frost only through the eyes of others. It is great fun, especially because we know that Frost is a good detective despite all evidence to the contrary. Only later do we get glimpses of Jack's thoughts.One satisfying element is that Frost's plate is full. He has many mysteries to solve, including finding out who's been filching coins from his desk, and why is someone ineptly trying to break into a bank every night?I look forward to reading more books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspector Frost","review":"Loved this book. You read it with the voice of David Jason in your head. Very down to earth and realistic. Moves along quickly and remains lively to the end. Many different plots going on but very nicely bought together keeping your interest at all times. I am looking forward to more Frost mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something of a mess . . .","review":"If you came to this book from the television series derived from Wingfield's books, brace yourself for a shock. The plot is messy, the characters rather sketchy at times, and Frost himself, far from being the amiable, sharp-tounged fellow embodied by David Jason, is a dirty-minded, insensitive, self-centered pig, the sort of fellow who puts the move on a missing child's mother when he discovers she is a part-time prostitute.There are also conincidences in the book, particularly a minor character that links both of the mysteries unfolding in the story, that stretch plausibility close to the breaking point. But there were obviously possibilities in both the story and the characters, possibilities that were realized much more fully when this novel reached television in the first TOF series in an episode entitled \\"Care and Protection.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of great talent","review":"While the author shows outstanding writing potential, style, and use of language, this book failed to showcase that in a way that will propel her to future fame. This book is incredibly difficult to follow and does not flow in a way that makes the reader want to try to follow along with where this story is going. I am not one to give up easily on a book, especially from a writer with such potential, but this book was too much even for me; after only 70 pages, I was ready to throw the book in trash. This seems to be an example of a great writer forcing a story about NOTHING. I hope to see her produce some notable pieces of literature in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postmodern Style but not Postmodern","review":"Whereas Gravity's Rainbow is purely postmodern and a grand masterpiece, The effect of Living Backwards is very superfically postmodern, and attempts to be, but has so little depth, and seems so constructed in a vain attempt to be, that the reader comes away with the notion of a book advertising postmodernism rather than a truly postmodern book. Sort of like a giant billboard for postmodernism.If we extrapolate Heidi Julavits career, it may be one of imitating masters. And to imitate is to fail. Always. She tried a Faulknerian book with The Mineral Palace, and now Pynchon or Rushdie, so don't be suprised if this white blonde jumps to going after Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Effect of Being Propelled Through Fictional Space","review":"The prose zings, the narrative soars: this is Julavits at her best. Like with everything great, there's one problem: the interwoven, short chapters narrated by ancillary characters don't measure up to the rest of the novel, but that's a small complaint. Novels like this just aren't published often enough. If you care about what's going on in the post-al Qaeda world, if you want a primer on how to keep on keepin' on post-9/11, EFFECT is your book. And Julavits is your savior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very much to be missed","review":"Again, this author attempts to use word-play to stand in the place of substance. Shame on her editors. Au courant, maybe, but little more than \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", New York style."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was The Point?","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. Rather, tried to read. I didn't even get past the first two chapters. I skimmed through the rest of the book then I threw it out. I didn't feel it was even worth passing onto someone else. The book was just full of garbage writing to put it simply and I couldn't make sense of anything. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy wasting money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but doesn't ring true","review":"I couldn't decide whether this is meant to be a witty novel or a satirical account of our response to 9/11. Because much of Heidi Julavitis's novel is too ridiculous to be simply a witty story, I eventually plunked with satire. This is problematic: for satire to work it must keep the same tone throughout.

After about 4 hours it \\"popped\\", all the air leaked out, and I found myself sleeping on the rocky ground. This made for a very uncomfortable week!!!

It was not really \\"Self Inflating,\\" since you must blow some air into it to inflate. Still, that would be OK with me if the product worked.My 95-pound daughter used this just four times, all indoors. The bottom seam separated on the fourth night. I do not mean that any pinhole leaks developed - rather, the bottom seam/junction just separated. And, you can see that for inches on either side of the hole that the seam is beginning to loosen there as well.Emails to customer service went unanswered for either warranty support or even repair instructions.No matter what the price you pay, this mattress seems unlikely to last long enough to give value.

If you lay on this mat, your bottom will go through to the floor, and the air will all go to your feet.

My previous solitaire game (which lasted for many years) had the 'red' suits in outline, which made distinguishing suits very easy. Also, this game is very slow at dealing out each hand from the deck. All in all a very frustrating playing experience. I'm almost glad it broke so I can move on to another machine.

Then I found the Novena book and I discovered a world full of inspirational prayers that bring wonderful results. The novenas found in this book are easy to understand and pray with a variety of lengths for those who have an hour to pray or for those who only have a fifteen minute break in their schedule. Each novena is placed in one of the following sections; angles, saints, Mary, and God/Jesus. These highly organized categories allow the reader to find the novena that they want to prayer with ease and they can also find novenas based on what their prayers are dedicated to. I defiantly recommend this title because it is well written and I myself have felt the power of the miracles that these novenas create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You St Jude!","review":"This is a lovely book with beautiful illustrations that remind me of my catholic school days.

Also if you even bump it will tip over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip It","review":"I purchased this floor cleaner for my new house which is 70% wood and vinyl floor but I couldn't wait to try it out! I used it on my vinyl kitchen and pergo wood hall and entryway in my small rental home. I did notice some water streaks/puddling water left behind but it was because I was pulling back too fast and the suction seal between the machine and floor was broken, no problems when I slowed down a bit. All in all it did its job of cleaning the floor even if it took a little longer then a push mop or rag. I did notice the tank dripped a little when I finished wet vac on the kitchen and moved to dry vac in the hallway, I didn't feel this was a big deal since I would be flipping to the wet side right after. Clean up wasn't difficult, much like cleaning a carpet cleaner, just dump into toilet and rinse with clean water a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY !!!!","review":"If you are buying this vacuum for dry vacuming, please DON'T!!!!!! It barely picks up dust, let alone anything else that's on the floor. It didn't even pick up the couple of cheerios my nephew \\"left behind\\". A waste of your time (trying it out, returning it) and a waste of your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked as described...only on the first time!","review":"I purchased the Bissell Flop-It Select Hard Floor Cleaner with Heat (7340) about half a year ago to clean my hardwood floors throughout my home. The product worked well the first time I used the product...but I wanted to write the review after a couple of uses. The product does not do any one thing well. The vacuum portion is weak and the \\"wet\\" side does not work very well. The spray jets on my unit is clogged and does not release any solution (thus making the \\"wet\\" part useless). Now when I use the product, I take out my other vacuum to sweep up the floor. I then spay my own wood cleaner on the floor and then wipe up the floor with the Bissel Flip-It. It seems rather redundant process. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPOINTED :-(","review":"I have twins in high chairs throwing food on the floor for every meal, so I was really looking forward to this. You are supposed to push the button for fluid when you push the vac. forward and the suctioning happens when pulling back.The problem is the squeegie on the front makes it hard to push it forward. Also...the dry vac. portion is just o.k., not as good as I hoped. Once you switch from dry to wet, you can't go back to dry to a different area/room as water will drip everywhere. This was harder on my back than just doing it the old fashion method. I am returning it. And I so hoped this was going to make my life easier! oh well. hohoho."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This cleaner is not very maneuverable and is very noisy. It leaves streaks from the rubber squeegee on the floor. The vacuum option is not an option as the range for the suction is limited to the dirt directly aligned with the entry hole - otherwise the dirt is pushed along or missed. My standard vacuum and an electronic steam mop (with micro fiber pads) was a much better solution. I apply a floor cleaner from a misting/squirt bottle where needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Machine","review":"My machine has been replaced by the company twice now because the sprayer stops working. The company has a no refund policy so they just keep sending me another one, which stops working after 2 months. I will never buy another Bissell product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't suck...","review":"It literally doesn't suck like a vacuum should. The vacuum is very weak. The literature says it's good for dust and crumbs. If you need to suck up anything more than that, like pet hair, you need more vacuum. The wet mop works okay, until you turn it off. Then it becomes a dripping mess. We had to set the thing outside after use to let it drip dry. This is more of a novelty item than an appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"Red Alert!!! Don't spend your dollars with this one!!!! It leaves puddles of dirty water everywhere! I tried everything thinking I was doing something wrong. The reviews that rate this product great are probably PAID reviews by the company. Don't take a chance, you will regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"look for better product","review":"I was looking for a vacuum that can do all the job. I was so tired of doing the same old type of cleaning at my apt's hardwood floor, since nobody cleans except me I was expecting that this would lessens the job. But I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE of buying this product. At first, It was ok. A little bit hard to push forward when you are using the wet vacuum side and the floor is not that wet. And it has the worst vacuum suctioning that I've ever seen.You need to use another vacuum that would do a good suction on the dirts on the floor.And when your doing the suction for the wet vacuum the water leaks on the sides. So It's really a waste of time and money when you buy this product. I sent it back for my refund. I should have trusted the comments before I decided to buy this product. It's really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky and performs poorly","review":"Does a poor job of cleaning floors and is not worth the price.It's a mess to add liquids and a pain to clean the unit.After the first use my wife complained about the product.

I have Pergo laminate floors and I have tried everything out there from different mops to steamers and every cleaner under the sun and no matter what I have to wipe them with a towel or they are streaked with water marks. Even my ceramic tile in the bathrooms needs to be wiped or I get water marks. Well, NO MORE!!! I can tell that it takes some trial and error to use the machine correctly but after testing it yesterday my floors were shining! No streaks or water marks! The vacuum part is not the best so I will continue to use my regular vacuum beforehand. Not a big deal I think, since you have to vacuum using a conventional mop anyway. But washing the floor was just like \\"vacuuming\\" it to a shine! Finally, I don't dread washing the floors!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed","review":"I purchased this item for my laminate floors as we have laminate throughout for the purpose of a wheelchair. The idea of being able to vac and then wash was great and thought it would be easier on my back than a mop. I found this to be true. The issue with it standing upright I found to be true as indicated in a previous review. Most importantly though, the trigger that lets the solution out onto the floor died after a month.The closest place that handles their product warranties is 45 minutes away from us (and I live in a big city). In addition, the place that does handle the warranties told me this problem is common with this product. Needless to say, I opted not to get this fixed and am out the money I spent on the product. The hassle of carting it 45 mins. to have to go back again to pick it up when done brings me to a total of 3 hours on the road with no guarantee that the next trigger will be any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cleaning product ever purchased","review":"Before I purchased this product, I read several reviews, many of them very favorable. This product was also recommended by the grout cleaning/restoring company I recently used for my tile floors. Imagine my surprise and disappoinment when I discovered how utterly useless this product actually is. It does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor, and an even worse job of sucking it back up, leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor. I literally have to remop the entire floor every time I use it. I've tried other Bissel products which were fine, but this one is an expensive dud. Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldnt have wasted my money","review":"I should have listened to all the bad reviews, my product just leaves puddles of water on my tile and does exactly what I said, LEAVES PUDDLES, It has NO suction power on the wet side.

I am going back to a regular mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limits","review":"I am disabled, recently my husband died. Since he was the floor guy, I thought I would try to find an \\"assistant\\". After much research I choose this unit.It does not live up to my hopes. The water output and suction leave much to be desired. Too little on both ends. I also find I have to remove the cleaning pad often to rinse, in the middle of the job. Granted I live in puppy piddleville, and in that regard it's a whole lot better than paper towels and spray. But I wish I hadn't spent the money. A mop and bucket do the same job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"I just received this and used it on my ceramic tile floors. The great advantage is that you vacuum an area and then flip the unit over and mop it. It took some getting used to because the suction works great! My floors really got clean and I would recommend this to anyone wanting to save time. I had previously used a Swifer mop and found it so lightweight that it didn't do any deep cleaning of the floor surfaces. Glad I got this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet my expectations","review":"I purchased this product because I thought it would be better than using a mop on my vinyl flooring. I was wrong. This machine does not dry vacuum well. It blew the dirt, etc. around instead of sucking it up. The wet side works for a while, then before I can get all my vinyl flooring done, the suction stops working. I read on the bissell website that this could be due to the fact that the filter is wet. Duh! The filter is going to get wet! I also had problems with water squirting out of the dirty water tank while I was dry vacuuming. I had high hopes for this product. I could vacuum and mop with heated water with one machine. This product was a waste of money. I will go back to my mop until I find something that works better. I gave it two stars because the idea of using one machine to vacuum and mop is a good concept but this product needs some fine tuning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"Loved the mop, the results were great (no streaks). It is tough to push but its really drying the floor. However, it only worked 2x - won't dispense the fluid. Past 30 days so can't return or exchange and repair shop is 90 min away. I now use it to dry the floors, no bang for the buck here. There are better steam mops, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and a Great Cleaning Tool","review":"I have 25 cats and ceramic tile flooring. This product works great to mop the floors. It gets the fur and other cat problems clean. The tile sparkles after cleaning. And the water that this product picks up is just plain dirty. It's a joy to dump the stuff down the drain. Also, it is not a chore to use this product. It is light weight, easy to maneuver, and scrubs and picks up the dirty water in one pass over. However, do remember to prop safely when you're changing water as it will fall easily, but this is because it is not heavy weight: which is a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I find this product very useful. It cleaned my laminate floors beautifully. I also like that you can store the fluid in the clean tank for the next use and the pads are machine washable. The only downside I can see is it's a little difficult to push forward because of the squeegee. It does take some practice before you get the hang of it's action, but once you do, it's quick and efficient. Spray on forward stroke, return stroke is the fluid take-up. I think a good tip to offer is to also buy extra pads as you can then switch before hitting the next room since the pad will be rather dirty from the previously washed floor. I did not use the dry vacuum as I figure it works much like an electric broom, which doesn't work in my home since I have 3 rather large, shedding dogs. I just whipped out my Dyson and vacuumed with that first."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have animals, don't get this for hair removal!","review":"I was so excited after reading the other people's reviews.

Another item that's a complete rip off to those of you in my predicament, is the \\"Shed Ender.\\" It doesn't end it. If any of you out there have a solution to my dilemma, I'd be most appreciative.

The stickers were not as bad as others have described it. There are clear instructions and it was fun for my my husband and I to put on. It took about 30 minutes.

It came in a huge box but the pieces were light enough for me to carry it upstairs without my husband's help. Thankfully I had read some of the other reviews and put the stickers on before putting the bed together. I would rather pay an extra $5 and have it come with the stickers already placed on as it was a real pain to get them perfectly straight. Once the stickers were on, I proceeded to put the bed together and it was very easy to do. Hardly took any time at all. I decided not to get the box spring and use just the mattress with a plywood board under as I was afraid the baby may fall out at night. Turned out great for him. His eyes lit up when he saw the completed bed and started jumping up and down. So cute to watch. I would totally recommend this bed for all little boys that love cars.

Their relationships have its ups and downs but they manage to draw you in.Can't wait for Jyunjyo Romantica 2 to come out to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Highly recommended for any yaoi fan. DVDs comes in a sturdy box for excellent protection. Thin dvd boxes features the 3 couples of Junjou Romantica. Boxset also includes a small artbook in full color.

No go. I called AVermedia and was dumped into voicemail, and never got a call back. I then called the vendor, Newegg, and they refused to help me outside of RMA'ing the product.So, in short, it doesn't work, and no one I've spoken to or tried to speak to seems to both not know what's wrong, or willing to investigate. My system is Vista \\"Ultimate,\\" on an Nvidia motherboard; I suspect this card isn't supported on either Vista or a non-Intel board. It would have been nice if the documentation on the site noted either.I have an old AVerMedia card, maybe 6 years back, and I was happy with it. But I'm disappointed in their support, or lack there-of, and with the vendor from whom I purchased it. I'll RMA the board. In a nutshell, this is probably a good card, but you have to have the right combination of OS and motherboard for it to be recognized and work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Was very helpful am still reading the book.

However, we are also aware of our own inadequacies in living up to the standard God expects of us. We fall short and do not know why or how we can overcome these shortcomings. We are the walking wounded. THis book leads you step by step on a journey that heals your heart wounds and when your wounds are healed you can walk in victory and let go of the troubling spirits that harrass you. One cannot get better by acting better. The root cause of the undesireable behaviour must be dealt with. This book sets forth prayers that deals with the roots and breaks the chains that hold you back from being all that you purpose to be in Jesus. This book along with Virkler's book How To Hear God's Voice has changed my life and brought new meaning to every word Jesus' spoke in the Scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably beautiful...","review":"I have to admit to being a newcomer to Axelrods' work, but I'm completely won over by the intensity and brilliance of his composition. The melodies come out of nowhere and fit within the songs perfectly, and then continue to crawl into your soul where they keep you warm for days afterwards. These are the subtle sorts of melodies and rhythms that Gil Evans acheived in his less experimental, solo work but with all the sensuousness of his collaborations with Miles. I'm sure that there are many listeners out there who have admired Axelrod's work for decades (including the oft-mentioned current crop of artists such as DJ Shadow - who wrote the liner notes - and others) but let me assure any new listeners that this is an excellent introduction to a brilliant man's work (besides being from 30 years ago, except for two songs). I really can't get enough of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Romantic Comedy","review":"I love love love this movie. It is hilarious and though provoking.

This book opens your eyes to a lot of unhealthy behavior and gives you some great advice and how to deal with it, thiers and your own. I have been recommending this book to everyone I know, women and men. It is a very easy read and it gets straight to the point.It shows that there are no quick fixes, but there are things you can do.

It tells it like it is regarding ambivalence in relationships for both men and women, and includes items on how ambivalence manifests itself in the cyber age. It makes it clear why ambivalent relationships aren't enough to grow on, and helps you define and steer clear of bad choices as well as look at how and why you may be selecting the wrong partner(s) for you.

How it ever got produced is beyond me. The cast, (I can't bring myself to call them actors,) is uniformly atrocious. These people are either good friends of the producer or they paid him big bucks to cast them. It is inconceivable that any of them were cast after an audition. Technically, the cinematography and sound are so bad that it looks like somebody's first attempt at trying out their new video camera. The script is non-existent. There is no story, just a seemingly endless series of scenes between the untalented non-actors. There is no attempt whatsoever to tell a story or maintain any sense of continuity.

In fact none of the sex had a context or story line that lead up to it and it was without emotion such as love or any romance. This was a poor investment.

I always watched this film whenever it was on TV when I was a kid. The last time that I saw in on TV was about 10 years ago. I taped it and then later erased it by mistake. I have been looking for a copy to call my own ever since. There is a poem called \\"And They Believed\\" that Big Mike recites to Col. Scott while they are flying to Fr.Mike's new mission assignment.

Similarly, the lane on which the Hall-Mills murders took place has always been referred to as DeRussey's Lane; I've never seen it called \\"Phillips Lane\\".

Diane Downs is misspelled as Diane Downes. In a particularly sloppy and disquieting factual error, Scott says that it is Downs' oldest daughter, Christie, who died after she and two siblings were shot by their mother; in actuality it was Downs' youngest daughter, Cheryl, who died.

And you shouldn't, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crime, indeed","review":"This could have been a fascinating book: an overview of headline-making murders over the past 100 years. But Scott--though a good writer--has no grasp of history (or perhaps--let's be fair--her editor or fact-checker done her dirt). Just in the first couple of chapters alone, the book gets the date of a famous murder off by ten years, refers to the \\"Ziegfield\\" [sic] Follies, and has the song \\"Good Ship Lollipop\\" released in the 1920s. Plus, there are no photos! I'm not asking for grisly crime scene shots, but a few illustrations are really called for in a book such as this. All in all, a sad and shabby job."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can one book contain so many mistakes?","review":"This author manages to relay amazing crime stories in such a dry fashion that it drains each story of all possible interest. In addition to the stunning number of factual errors pointed out by other reviewers below, I also noticed that the name of infamous spree killer Howard Unruh was spelled as \\"Unrah\\"throughout the book.

All that withstanding on just the merits of a good storyline the book is mediocre. It's disjointed style makes it hard to stay interested. The main character of Doc is not given a soul for which we (the reader) should care about until the last few pages. Kind of late isn't it? Also Fluff, for all her bad and good virtures, miraculously becomes some sort of Angel that Doc just doesn't appreciate. Well I didn't appreciate the character switch. All the sex is violent so if you like that sort of thing have at it but to be honest I was expecting more than the few scenes doled out by Pat.

Pass on this CD but give any future efforts by this duo a chance.I am the first person to applaud for mixing genres of music - when it works. But just because you can put a techno loop with a hip-hop rap with a rock rift doesn't mean it sounds good. \\"Human Condition\\" shows that. It is not that these guys are without talent, some of the loops and rifts are quite catchy, such as on songs like \\"Intro to Life,\\" \\"Human Condition,\\" and \\"Head Case.\\" There are glimmers of promise here (especially the song \\"High Pursuit\\"), but otherwise it just plain doesn't gel. It sounds more like they were trying to throw together everything they think would be popular and hope somebody would find something to like.

This is barely recognizable as Ming & FS---No cuts, breaks or undeground MC's. This isn't even hip-hop. It's full of 4/4 house beats and female diva \\"baby baby\\" vocals. Seriously, with the exception of the second and ninth tracks this sounds like Basement Jaxx. In fact, I pulled the CD out to make sure the factory didn't put the wrong CD in the case---it's that different!! It may as well be a different group. In my opinion, they should have recorded this under a different moniker or something because to put Ming & FS on the CD is a real disservice; but to say it's a different project with a new direction would have been more acceptable. By far, my most disappointing purchase of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Health Care Basics","review":"This book is one doc's opinion, and I can honestly say that I don't completely agree on some parts - most notably, he comes down rather unfairly hard on the statin drug class. Yes, there are some people with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol that need some pharmacological help. However, this book bravely points out a point - health care has become heavily commercialized, mostly because certain elements (pharma) have a profit to make, while less profitable elements such as good ol' diet/exercise are downplayed. Diet/exercise/weight loss/smoking cessation/social support first, drugs second. Also, think about cheaper drug options rather than the ones burned into your subconscious by the telly.

In a time when 40 somethings are joined at the hip to 20 somethings by a common disregard for the \\"truth as we've known it\\", this work refreshingly points seekers to their own crucible of discovery and healthy reflection on what really is real and what really is not. Not a \\"how to\\", but a \\"how about?\\". Not a \\"should\\", but a \\"can if you want to\\" - hitting upon the quantum levels of our faith, our perceptions and our actions in a rapidly changing world. Read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible covers","review":"I waited two weeks before writing this review, hoping that I was somehow complicating a really simple thing. These containers just do not close. I have several other great GladWare products, but these are horrible. The covers on all three containers have never stayed closed and pop open on one or two corners within seconds of fitting it on the container.Now I'm just watching the waterline drop on the batch of soup I made as it slowly evaporates. One plus: The see-through plastic is great for that.It doesn't matter what's inside the container (solids, liquids, air -- either hot or cold). I have never microwaved them or put them in the dishwasher, the covers just wouldn't stay on the containers straight out of the box. I even have one container that has yet to be used and the lid still doesn't stay put. The lids fit well and are the right size, but the only way one will stay on is if I hold it down on two edges. Forever.

It fits the same mounting holes. It has an excellent alignment adjustment mechanism that the other model did not.

I chose a drill bit slightly thinner than the screws and put masking tape on the bit at the point I had to stop in order to avoid drilling clear through the door.Three quick drills, and I was done.Great product. Just enough spring to close the door when it's ajar, but not enough so it would not stay open. It lets you adjust the precise overlay you need to make the door centered in its frame and lined up in all directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake flamenco","review":"The best I can say about Manitas is that he comes from the same extended french Gitano family which produced the flamenco pop group \\"Gypsy Kings.\\" At least the Kings don't pretend to be playing \\"flamenco puro\\" but embrace the popular forms of gypsy \\"Rumbas\\" with some \\"Bulerias\\" thrown in now and then (always in the proper rhymn or \\"compas.\\" Manitas is notorious among flamenco aficianos for messing up the rhythms, and playing rather uninspired melodies. But the real evidence of his mediocrity is that when judged by the old American Bandstand criteria, \\"you can't dance to it.\\" The best flamenco guitarist, of this age or any earlier, is the one who can accompany the dance and the cante.

Boing!","review":"Trampoline mixes a group of writers from the literary edge of genre (Irvine, Hirshberg, Ford) with another group of fugitives from the mainstream (Park, Hunt, Jackson), proving that some of the most interesing fiction being written right now is sprouting in the cracks between the two. Its remarkable what a coherent collection this is, given that the only thing that really binds these stories together is a uniformly high quality of writing and a willingness to doggedly pursue an individual vision. What really distinguishes these stories is a sense of possibility and adventure; Trampoline is fiction as a form of play and risk-taking rolled into one. The stories here proceed as if the constraints of genre simply dont exist and move from there in some pretty strange but wonderful directions. There are a handful of stories that don't quite work, but even those are worth your time. An extremely strong collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great costume, sized larger than normal!","review":"We love our princess gowns and this is no disappointment.

It claims \\"no tools required\\", which is basically true, but it's easier with a philips head. They have, what I can only describe as threaded \\"push pins\\"; 4 that screw into the wall and 2 for each support. There is a hollowed out groove along the back edge of the shelf, where the pins are inserted and 2 holes each, for the supports. I followed the instructions meticulously. After just a few days of holding some of my boys' smaller trophies, maybe totaling 5 lbs. or so, (I believe the directions said they should be able to hold up to 30 lbs.) they started tilting downward and separating from the supports. I tried some industrial strength adhesive to reinforce the bond with no luck. I ended up building my own shelves. These are not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic product deserves 0 star","review":"This product is really useless. Don't be misled by the claim.

This was my first Sidney Sheldon and it convinced me to read his other books. After reading eight of them, 'If tommorow comes' is only second to 'the other side of midnight'. Anyway, I think that if tommorow comes is Sidney Sheldon at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best!","review":"Sidney Sheldon's If Tomorrow Comes is absolutely the best novle I've ever read. This is my favorite novle and I keep on recommending this book. Tracy Whitney is the best character that Sidney Sheldon that ever made. When I was reading the book, I imagined myself as Tracy... Tracy the GREAT!!! From then on I collected almost all of Sidney Sheldon's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheldon's absolute best!","review":"I have read this book three times and will probably read it a zillion more in my lifetime.

I wish there was a sequel, Tracy Whitney is my favorite Sheldon character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality potrayed Brutally","review":"I don't want to deride the book and thats not why i'm here, in my opinion the book was giving the cruel facts brutally. In case the ones who've read this book do not identify the episode i'll ask them to go back to when tracy whitney was taken to the jail, after 2 years of reading it the impression it has created in my mind prevails and haunts me when i think of a jail, it's true and i dont deny it but i would suggest that those who cannot take cruelty in a light way and those who get really involved please don't go for this book. This is in no way a book for light reading. No doubt as always sheldon't characterisation and plot is well articulated and potrayed very well and leaves an everlasting impression.One episode in the book changes my complete view about it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Tomorrow Comes","review":"This book is amazing and no doubt my favorite book.

One of Sheldon's Best.","review":"The thing that makes this book so good, is the crime in it. Tracy Whitney is a great character. She was son unpredictable and educated.

A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Sheldon really captivates readers with this book through his interesting heroine, Tracy Whitney.

THE STORY IS QUITE ORIGANAL AND INNOVATIVE. OVERALL THE BOOK IS GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable pap","review":"At the risk of being politically incorrect, I think this is a book that will appeal to bored housewives. After an interesting beginning, the book falls into cliche after cliche as our heroine continually outwits the authorities in increasingly implausible scenarios. I really can't believe so many reviewers gave this book 5 stars. It really is a rather pedestrian work. One reviewer couldn't give it 5 stars because of the \\"excessive sex.\\" Must be a very sensitive type because I thought there was relatively little sex in the book and what there was was handled in a very romanticized way. Another indicated that it was the best book she had ever read!! My advice...read more books.If this is indicative of Sheldon's work, I certainly won't be reading any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter nonsense","review":"Sheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White, succeeding in all of them, certainly, this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader. The main character and heroine, Tracy White working for a man named Gunther, becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all, just for the sake of doing. The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all. I have rated it two stars one goes for the poor quality and another goes for the fun the story sometimes carries on, particularly in the beginning. If this is your first time with Sidney Sheldon, try other Sheldon novels, i.e \\"Master of the Game\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never got bored reading this again","review":"It's been a while since I read this...

It works on a number of different levels to get at gender and social issues in modern Iran. It does this while being entertaining and not the least bit preachy.

There are a few things in the plot that don't quite fit together, but these don't interfere with the message or the entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important and often overlooked contribution to the debate","review":"One of the great tragedies of the last decades is that Ann Saltenberger's groundbreaking book didn't recieve wider attention when it was originally released. However, that doesn't make her research or her observations any less valid today. Written with her gentle, there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I perspective, Every Woman puts a human face on the bland statistics on abortion complications. Meticulously documented, Saltenberger draws on medical journal accounts of abortion injuries and deaths, placing them in the perspective of women's lives.

In general I think some tribute bands are interesting or even good, so I kind of had high hopes for Ms. Fits. While the band is kickin, the vocals are weak. In all fairness, it's impossible to compete with Glen Danzig... but this singer is pretty bad. With a good lead vocalist, Ms. Fits might be worth checking out. The singing on Hatebreeders and Green Hell is awful to be blunt. I'm not sure if by the end of the CD I get used to it or the vocals improve slightly but the stronger cuts are toward the end of the CD in Angel.... and Astro Zombies. Those are the highlights. The lowpoints are more frequent. It's a shame because the band has the cool factor down- they have Misfit-esque stage names, they have a good look, and like I said the band musically is tight. The vocals pretty much make it a difficult listen for me though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Just adding a female singer doesn't make doing an album of covers worth while. They may be fun live, but if you're not gonna add your own twist to the songs (sorry, a different gendered vocalist doesn't cut it), why try to repackage and sell an album of songs that were done extremely well the first time??For an example of a really good Misfits cover with a twist, look for Idiot Pilot's version of \\"Hybrid Moments\\".

James draws a convincing and intoxicating picture of female nurses in a provincial hospital, we can smell the disinfectant, feel the strong wills, sexual repression and envy that abound but also the dedication and devotion. Adam Dalgleish and his horny Sargeant explore this world in a way at once believable and shocking. Very good stuff, much to be recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-Layered and Complex","review":"Detective Chief-Inspector Adam Dalgleish is investigating the suspicious deaths of two nursing students at Nightingale House. Given the time and circumstance of both poisonings, it appears that a fellow student or one of the nursing instructors had something to do with it, or did they?As usual, P.D. James weaves subtle clues into complex relationships that take time to reveal, but with this book, I didn't mind. Although I found the narrative too plodding in Cover Her Face, it works much better in Shroud for a Nightingale. It could be that the characters's relationships had more depth and intrigue than in the earlier book. Certainly, the pall James slowly casts over Nightingale House makes the setting more intriguing. Also, there is better control over point of view in this book. I didn't learn much more about Dalgleish, but as James fans know, it's the deliciously slow revelations that make her plots and characters so appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truley funny book","review":"I loved the book.

This movie is so good that I have actually worn out the first copy I ordered from Amazon.com and am now waiting for the arrival of my second copy. Believe you me, within 15 minutes of the package arriving to my home, I will have the movie playing. And while Amazon does have the movie on a single dvd, the best bet is to buy as part of a set such as the one link I have attached. As well as the set I have taken the movie from.

Found this slightly lower wattage soldering iron for a good price and it works great! Now whenever one of my battery packs go out on my many cordless devices I can replace the cell myself.

My head is more or less average size :-) so I suspect many will have the same problem.The noise suppression works, but it isn't worth the trouble. As pointed out by another reviewer, there is a very noticeable hiss that is quite annoying. The annoyance of the hiss is worse than the improvement caused by the noise suppression, so I found them to sound better with the noise suppression turned off.That's leaves me with $50 headphones that are uncomfortable and have a now useless battery box attached.

Wayne Hancock, however, manages to pull it off, through a combination of sheer likability, capable songwriting, and a few songs on other subjects. The last category includes \\"Sands of Time,\\" which sounds not just like a tune Hank Williams could have written but like one he's actually singing. It's surely one of the most dead-on, scary Hank imitations of all time. With an approach that derives both strength and weakness from its affinity to Hank, Hancock's is a musical sensibility stuck in 1951, when people still talked about \\"hot rods\\" (as in \\"Miller, Jack & Mad Dog,\\" a commentary on the hazards of drunk driving circa, I take it, five decades ago).

I started thumbing through the book and began shrieking after awhile trying to hold back laughter. After five minutes or so of browsing, I knew I would be buying this book. I found \\"You're So Fine, I'd Drink A Tub of Your Bathwater\\" to be hiliarious as it gives the 500 pickup lines that men use to talk to women. Many of the lines were common and not funny, but some lines were SOOO CRAZY and WILD that I just cracked up from laughing so hard. The best thing about this book, I guess, is it will provide a woman with a lot of laughs or some comeback lines. Men should buy the book just so they'll know what NOT to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called Kids Pitcher!!!!","review":"I bought this thinking a friend could use it in his show, but, the thing is really small definitly not what I expected.

Overall the game graphics are very dated and in games saves are very few. You spend soooo much time stalking, sneaking and changing garb to reach you objective without being detected. This gets very dull very quickly. This is not the \\"thief\\" series at all. There is No incentive to perform any sneaking, your characters rating does not change. So I just starting blasting everything, not even bothering to change costumes.

However, purchasing this game turned out to be a HUGE mistake. I can't believe how Eidos screwed everyone over with this piece of garbage.--> only 12 missions - are you kidding me??--> out of those 12, seven are the same ones from Hitman 1 (WTF??)--> WAY too many AI bugs and glitches, if you haven't encountered them, that means you're just shooting your way through levels, instead of playing it with stealth--> took me just a few hours to achieve Silent Assasin rating on every mission and the game was over before it started--> controls are bad, sluggish at times, and having to pause the game to change weapons/inventory is a pain in the ASS.There are many more where these came from, but I'm not going to waste any more of my time. This game was rushed, in order to scam the customers and get their money. Eidos has finally lost my respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a waste of money...","review":"I have been a fan of Hitman ever since it came out. I own and completed 1, 2, and Contracts. Everything about Contracts is fine--graphics, gameplay are good by today's standards. As a stand-alone game, it's worthy of 4 stars...BUT if you have played Hitman 1, then you have already played 7 of the 12 missions that Contracts contains. That's right--CONTRACTS HAS 5 NEW MISSIONS--THATS IT!!If you do not own any Hitman games, get Hitman 2. It has 20 missions that are long and diverse.If you own Hitman 2 and you don't own Hitman 1, then get Contracts. You'll probably like it and it's not a bad game.BUT if you already own Hitman 1, Contracts is a questionable buy, especially at the requested price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a great beverage that I have enjoyed for about 2 years now...I was very disappointed to recently receive an email notifying me that is no longer available...PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"never sits right after consuming!","review":"I've enjoyed other Big Train products, but this version of their iced coffee tasted too much of dry coffee creamer.

This is electro-acoustic music, or \\"weird, eerie constructions of sounds and droning notes\\" as I prefer to call it. Also, I might not be the right person the review this CD, but I give it a try anyway.The first track is a 40-minute piece, mostly of very quiet sounds of some kind of processed clarinet (? ), machines, talking and strange statics and crackles. The humming gives a nice atmosphere and if stuff like Oval is your bag, this might be something for you. After a second track which is just 58 seconds of silence, the third and last track called \\"Terminal Pharmacy\\" start. This is mainly strings - but NOT Mantovani! Think Gyorgy Ligeti and more atonal music. Not as good as the first track \\"Cede\\" but it has something.

I bought this CD, which is really a four-song EP, because it seemed from the song samples that it contained four great songs. It did and I am very pleased with the music, but there's only about eight minutes of it, and as an import it costs more than regular CD.

This album is possible birth of his Fantomas way of singing. Yes he tends to make noice but, i say this with biggest liberal mind it's great noice. I can never create the sound of a pig sqiling but, even it's off he has so much ability with just a voice. Gibberish has been strong after Patton finished this one off. I'm sure if u ask John Davis he will say \\"yeah patton influeced me on gibberish technique.\\" So there u have it. Unbeleivable noice works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimentation to say the least.","review":"Well, i bought this cd cause i love mike patton. At first, I really hated it, but that was because i listened to it in the car. It really got on my nerves driving down the road in the sweltering summer heat listening to this. The next day when it was pouring rain i sort and i listened to this at my house i sort of liked it, in a very odd sense. I've listened to it quite a bit now, i still dont know totally what to make of it. I guess if u enjoy sitting around listening to odd noises, which i do every once in awhile you'll like it. This certainly isnt for every occasion or for every person though. Anyways so i guess what im saying is i like it, in an odd way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius; or has he simply lost his grip?","review":"Mike Patton can sing, of that there is no doubt. I read other reviews about this album, and was warned that it was just a recording of voice. However, I am a musician myself, and have generally appreciated Patton's different slant on things. Knowing what he can do with his voice is what drew me in with this album.I am dissapointed.There is no theme; there is not even a melody.It's as though Patton got a hold of a digitech effects pedal and a microphone, and that's about as creative as he got. This album lacks imagination, production and creativity. Not even the most alternative minded individual will be able to relate even remotely to this collection of noises. It's not an album, but merely something you will put on your shelf and say to others 'I have it'."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHOWDER BRAIN!","review":"I LOVE IT! Mike patton has noise in his head and make me come aalive like frankenstein! He had the noise in his head, then record it and put it in my head!

I enjoy Mike Patton's work as much as the next person, but this...this is just a waste. This is not a display of talent or creativity, people. Anyone could have recorded this self-indulgent noise and called it art, but because it's Mike Patton that makes it something of value? I am going to have to disagree.If you must, listen to it once just to say you have. Otherwise, leave it alone. The only use this album could ever have is as a torture device."},{"rating":"2","title":"I respect anyone with the balls to release this....","review":"Nonmusical, mind bogglingly strange, and almost so wierd you can't even listen to it. Just wierd wierd noise recorded with a 4 track recorder when apparently Mike was bored in the hotel on tour. Nothing makes sense here....The songs are less \\"songs\\" and more pieces of..almost comedy for those who love fart noises. Very creative...you must give Mike that. I don't think anyone in the world would do this...and have the guts to release it. Just for that I respect Patton more than anyone alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike, Please come back to earth....We miss you!","review":"Let me preface this by saying, this is not music, it's noise. Anyone could pickup a mic and make crazy sounds into it and formulate these \\"songs\\". Don't get me wrong, I love Patton, FNM, Fantomas, and Mr. Bungle, but you cannot seriously listen to this album. Here's an alternative, turn you TV to white static and keep hitting and unhitting the mute button, it will save you $15 and you'll get the same satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please take your lips off Mike's ...(rear)","review":"Those of you who claim to like this album (even in an odd way) need to start listening to music for music's sake and not for name value. C'mon if someone just gave you the album and didn't say anything about Mike Patton's involvement, it would be a coaster under your coffee cup in twenty minutes. This album is made up of tracks that belong on some private collection of Mike's. It's interesting to hear him experiment but certainly isn't worth ...($$) of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patton, you're my hero, but this thing....","review":"I haven't bought this album, and I won't, but I've been listening to some mp3s from it, and I'd have to say I have no bleeping idea what the hell this is! It's like Patton was bored one day and sat down with his recorder and made some funny sounds. I think I could listen to this once or twice as a novelty, but then I'd just get annoyed. I only gave it two stars because it's Mike Patton. At least his other solo album is some sort of music. He needs to spend more time recording with Mr. Bungle (so we can get a record sooner than every four years) and stop fooling around. If you're into Mr. Bungle, pick up the FANToMAS record or look for the Secret Chiefs 3 records. The FANToMAS has silly noises, but at least it goes along to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen.","review":"It's either hip among young non-musicians to enjoy bad, overpriced music, or the others who bought this CD and recognized it for the low budget crap it is just didn't bother writing reviews. Maybe, like me, they felt ashamed after having their ears raped by Patton and his cheap four-track recorder (which was what he used to record every \\"song\\"). This CD consists of Patton making slurpy, gurgly, screechy, and fart-like noises into a microphone. That's it. There's no accompanying music or lyrics. It's unequivically lame, and I'm surprised the record company agreed to release it; I guess they were counting on that I'll-listen-to-anything-that's-weird, wanna-be-avant-garde demographic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the [heck] is this??

Mike Patton...with a tape recorder...making moaning, grunting, farting, kissing, hissing, barking, and any other noise you could make. No music...just a man and his mic.

I think everyone knows that, but this solo effort is a new level of insane for him. Its fine if people want to listen to a bunch of ear piercing noise that will make you go crazy if you listen long enough, but to sell the crap for $17.00....now thats just plain ridiculus.

Kyung Wha Chung is my favorite living violinist and she has demonstrated time and again her ability to speak with every note and she can handle the most difficult technical demands with grace and seemingly no effort at all. Of course the members of the Chung trio are all siblings and all Juilliard trained so it is no coincedence they play so well togather. I also recommend recordings with Oistrakh and Kogan in addition to this recording. If you are looking for a good piano trio cd to get, this is the one to get.The Shostakovich is an interesting pairing, full of intersting rythms seemingly influenced by Tchaikovsky but undeniably original. I always enjoy listening to Shostakovich's unique offerings.I give this my highest recommendation without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good problem identification, but poor solutions.","review":"The book starts off with a good analysis of the problem -- society's dependence on computers and the rapid evolutionary pace of technology (and the slow evolutionary pace of human beings in absorbing this glut of information). However, a large portion of the book focuses on the effects of technology on politics. This is not very useful for someone who is trying to survive the information glut in everyday work and home environments. Then it ends with simplistic solutions, which are ways to reduce data overload (such as turning off the TV)."},{"rating":"2","title":"New approach to information overload, yet no solutions","review":"This book covers interesting ground regarding the social ramifications of too much information.

I tried. Believe me, I tried. The messages, lyrics, ad ideas may be right on, but the music itself is bland and only so-so, pretty basic acoustic folk. And the vocals? God almighty, I can not get over how terrible Jeff Ott sounds on this thing. The sound is mixed horribly, the vocals are mixed WAY too loud, he sings completely off-key, it's just, well, words simply can't describe how utterly bad the singing is. I tried many times to like it, honestly I did. I just can't. It seems to me the good reviews of this CD are more because of the messages than the music itself. I appreciate good songwriting, but only when it's put to good song. It's a shame, because I really liked Crimpshrine (Ott's old band) but to me, this CD was wasted money because it is completely unlistenable, it's just not pleasing to the human ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUCKY'S FAMILY","review":"THE SONG LUCKY IS VERY SAD BUT I HOPE IT HELPS SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS LISTENING,THE BAND 15 IS THE GREATEST AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR ALL THERE HARD WORK AND DEVOTION TO THE MEMORY OF MY COUSIN, WE MISS HIM GREATLY, I HAVE ONLY JUST RECENTLY FOUND THIS CD AND I HAVE BEEN EXTREMLY MOVED BY ALL THE SONGSI WISH THE BEST OF LUCK TO THE BAND FIFTEEN AND WISH THEM MUCH CONTINUED SUCCESS,WE ALL LOVE AND MISS RICHIE AKA LUCKY BUT WE WILL NEVER FORGET HIM OR HIS PARENTS...RIP"},{"rating":"2","title":"very positive very good","review":"although choice for a new generation is still my all time favorite 15 albulm the new sound really got me hoppin and lucky's song made me cry a definite winner buy this albulm or die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary Combination of Book Reviews","review":"Thought it will be a keystone to my explortion to this field, however, as it is actually a summary of 13 books regarding suicidology, no offense, it's really not the right book for one who's seeking an introductory work, at least for me.

Soon this stoic, tough policeman finds that he must confront both past and present pain if these new and fragile, and infinitely precious, relationships are to survive. Never fear, though; Amanda and little Shelby are just the people to help him do it. Longer chapters with more sustained action, a host of appealing \\"minor\\" characters, and telling details showcase both Amanda's grit and beauty, and Fletcher's tenderness and real strength.

The keyboard does take some getting used to if you're used to traditional keyboards. My mother quickly learned however to become a two-finger typist on this board. Not having function keys is the only problem, although if you're not setting up windows xp for the first time (where you HAVE to have an F8 button to accept the license), there is not much need for function buttons.

There were some demonstrations for more complicated designs, but there just wasn't much to the demonstrations. At one point, the person carving the pumpkin was pushing the carving tool toward her other hand - one slip and she would have gouged her hand - not a very safe demonstration.There were a couple of cute ideas for pumpkins, but nothing that I hadn'e seen in books. I thought the video loops would include a jack-o-lantern that I could play at a party.

It is every bit as brilliant on CD, although on the short side as CDs go -- probably no more than 40 minutes of music. But what performances!

The trio, along with bassist Joe Byrd and drummer Wayne Philips, are heard together on four numbers (best are \\"Lover\\" and Ellis' \\"Outer Drive\\"); Ellis and Kessel duet on \\"Makin' Whoopee\\"; Byrd has two features to himself; and a medley combines together short versions of \\"Nuages\\" and \\"Goin' Out of My Head\\" with the typically exuberant \\"Flying Home.\\" A fine all-around effor.

I first heard these recordings on a scratchy Partch/John Cage LP sampler and constantly listened to the Partch side (I'm not a big Cage fan).

There are enough real-life events on any given Scouting event to twice as many pages with humourous anecdotes. This book contained little more than humorless stories with even worse punch lines. Seriously-- a story about a kid getting carsick all the time culminating in a punchline where he took medicine for it may be funny to a first grader with a poor sense of humor, but hardly worth the effort to read the page where the story appeared.

There's no story longer than one page, yet it still managed to lose me before the end of every \\"story.\\"Maybe if you're 11 or 12 years old, this might be funny, though I can't vouch for that.

The most standout tracks are: \\"Just Let Go\\", \\"Cloud\\", \\"Never Win\\", \\"A Kick in the Teeth\\", \\"We Need a War\\" and \\"Happy\\". Just a bit of warning: if you can't digest a heavy dose of electronic music, this CD is not for you! Although there are moments when this album intersects with certain aspects of pop music, as in \\"Never Win\\" and \\"A Kick in the Teeth\\", this CD is not too pop friendly. Despite this little detail though, you should still be impressed by \\"Odyssey\\"....Listen and Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Follow Up!","review":"From the very first song you can tell that Fischerspooner have learned a thing or two since #1. They've increased the amount of vocals, made less ambient more pulse-pounding music, and I was extremely impressed at first listen.Just Let Go is a WONDERFUL first track, the music propelling you into some weird lyrics, funky guitars, and just all around fun. It goes on from there into Cloud, and on. The middle sags a bit as it sounds repetetive from song to song but it's definitely OK, as they are almost all wonderful.The tenth track is a bit boring, the only song I skipped over. I think that's pretty darn good!I hugely recommend this CD to anyone a fan of electroclash, Fischerspooner, or music itself.

The songs are well-crafted - this isn't garage band rough stuff - with catchy hooks, and lots of \\"hey!\\", \\"yeah!\\" and \\"ba-ba-da-ba-ba-baaahs\\". Even with the 70/80s era synths layered on many of the tracks, the guitar work and drum production give the album an up-to-date, fresh sound.If tongue-in-cheek lyrics, simple melody lines sung over a bedrock of guitars and drums are your thing, you should check out \\"Traffic and Weather\\".

All in All, well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly catchy storytelling","review":"This Fountains of Wayne album isn't 100% stellar. The track \\"Michael and Heather\\" is a snoozefest, for example. Yet the standouts ' Traffic and Weather, Yolanda Hayes, Someone to Love, This Better Be Good, and New Routine are absolutely incredible. (Hence the 5-star rating.) The powerpop is, in traditional Fountains style, catchy and undeniably enjoyable, but the real treat is the lyrics:\\"Five forty, Channel Six News TeamBreaking story 'bout a get-rich-quick schemeOne anchor turns and faces the otherSays, It's time that I made you my loverOoh, we belong togetherLike traffic & weatherLike traffic & weather\\"and in New Routine:\\"Two men sit in the corner of a dinerOne of them says, \`I might take a trip to ChinaIt's one of those things we should do before we're too old'\`Thanks but no thanks, bring me back an eggroll'\\"Because not every track is incredible, you may want to purchase the best tracks separately, such as on Amazon MP3 (preferably) or iTunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend the money !!!","review":"It isn't on par with \\"Welcome Interstate Managers\\", but it's bright and bouncy.

There really isn't a bad song in the bunch.I love Someone to Love, '92 Subaru, Yolanda Hayes, This Better Be Good, Michael and Heather at the Baggage Claim, I-95, and New Routine. Planet of Weed and Hotel Majestic, while good, aren't my favorites.As usual, the lyrics are clever and funny and there are plenty of contagious hooks. This album, like Welcome Interstate Managers, is beautifully produced. It lacks the raw feeling of their debut and sophmore efforts, but I personally prefer the more polished sound.Lots of nice guitar work and, of course, there's plenty FOW signature vocal harmonies. This CD is very nostalgic - lots of 60's and 70's influences throughout.I highly recommend this CD.

His intertwining of aspects of previous movies was fantastic. I loved Sigourney Weavers characterization of Ripley in Resurrection and I probably enjoyed it more after reading subtext that is included in this book.

It's based on Joss Whedons screenplay , but Crispin makes it feel original."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book vs. The Movie","review":"After seeing the movie, I didn't know if I could bring myself to read this book. All those flawed places, complete with a flawed ending, really left a person wanting. Still, the book was a gift and I really do need my Xeno-Xip, so I decided reading it would be for the best. Yes, I read and read and wondered exactly why this was so good and the movie was so bad. The book filled in most of those huge holes that the movie left open, and it made me wish I would have just jumped here instead of burning money at the movies. That couldn't happen, though, and I'm glad the book was there to pick up those poor, sequel-shattered pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best voices in our recent time.....","review":"She has the heart and soul in her words.

I listen to alot of popular music and every once in a great while you hear a song on the radio that makes you pull over to concentrate on the song. That was what happened to me with Brandi. It was the voice and the beautiful simplicity of the song. I soon after bought this CD, played it repeatedly. The songs are elegant and are strong thoughout. This fall I took my wife and children to see her open for Shaun Colvin in Boston. Unlike most artists she is even better live and has an amazing crowd reaction. She was also very nice after her set and signed cds for all who waited. Brandi if you read this please come out to Northampton MA for the new album!

When I saw her come onstage with \\"The Twins\\" and two other band members, I honestly thought the worst. By the third song, I was making my way back to the concession stand to get her cd. I was amazed by her vocal range and the emotion in each song, especailly on Closer To You. In concert, she did the Jeff Buckley cover of Hallelujah. I only wish that was on this album, but her performance was so strong, I can close my eyes and remember every note of that song on that night. I was really happy to see Jamie that night, but I was fortunate to come across Ms. Brandi Carlisle and her band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible discovery...","review":"It's not often that I feel like I've \\"found\\" an artist who really, really impresses me. Brandi Carlile has the goods. With a voice and song style that's reminiscent of Turin Brakes, Fiona Apple, Muse, and Radiohead - all at the same time - she has managed to create a debut album which truly stands out. Great harmonies, beautiful chord changes, and the perfect, subtle use of strings on certain songs - it's all here, and it's really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh","review":"I could write a lot about this CD; however, I'll just say that this is the best CD I have heard in years.

This album is wonderful. Brandi has a totally amazing, strong voice that moves from scratchy to smooth upper range in a second. Highlights for me were \\"Someday Never Comes\\" and \\"Gone\\", great lyrics and a superb tune. Even if you don't like folk-country or a sort of acoustic-rock, this album is for you.

I was shocked by how young Carlile is---from her rich, textured voice, confident melodies, and the wise storytelling of her lyrics, I admit I expected someone older! A sort of Janis Joplin (without the screeching), Stevie Nicks (without the fairies and doves), Melissa Ethridge (on a quiet day) seen-it-all-and-done-most-of-it-too survivor kinda person.

I haven't stopped talking about it since.I have the album now, and this woman is destined for great things. She is all of my favorite female artists (Raitt, McLaughlin, et al) yet she is none of them. This is the best album I've heard this year. If you get a chance to see her live, do it!

Top to bottom, an excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I'm a hard rock fan. Im usually not a fan of female singers-with one exception, Brandi Carlile. I got dragged to see 'The Fray' at HOB with my girlfriend. Brandi Carlile happened to be the opening act. I had never heard of her before but I went out and bought this cd the next day. I was completely blown away by her singing. I literally got chills up my back from listening to her perform. Her music is cool-great lyrics, great catchy melodies. I guess what I like is her rock singer quality she has in her voice. She can scream as well as sing softly and slowly. You have to buy this.

It's a great, energetic, and spectacular live performance by the Duke and his band. Their performance ranks up there with the Duke's 70th Birthday Concert, and Gonsalves' solo is, as they say, worth the price of admission alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Ellington","review":"Frankly, I tend to agree with the reviewers who think there's simply too much ambiance noises and announcements collected here; perhaps the earlier studio dominated version was not such a bad idea?But, than again, for as Ellington fan(atic)s it is absolutely essential to know all the fascinating details from the booklet and to hear how it all sounded at the spot...This is not only highly pleasant but also historical album, although (I tend to agree with that as well) the band actually had better nights; Gonsalves' showcase is the only musically remarkable spot. But (another but), an B+ performance from Ellington's band is worth an \\"A\\" grade in any other band's book, so this is the right album to buy if you're already initiated into the Ellingtonia treasure.The beginners might start withDuke Ellington: Blues in Orbit (Columbia Jazz Masterpieces)or, for instance,Ellington Uptown..."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much emcee talk","review":"I recently bought this CD based partly on the reviews from this site. I always buy music CDs for the music. However, I was dissapointed with the amount of emcee introductions and talk that make up such a measurable part of the first CD. I would much rather have music. Dukes got a great singing voice, but do I really want to hear him introduce every bandmember EVERY time I listen to this CD? I would much rather have a studio recording and enjoy great uninterrupted Jazz. The other disappointment were those shrill, piercing horns on some tracks. I found those sounds irritating and anything but enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"As brilliant an intro to Duke as you'll ever find","review":"More so than any other album I've ever listened to of Duke's music, this was the one that got me hook, line and sinker. In short, a masterpiece in any era. Comparable to Miles' \\"Kind of Blue\\" in terms of it's profound impact on my listening tastes. Complex, soulful, and swinging, this is Jazz at it's liveliest and most accessible. Even if it didn't include the now famous 27 chorus recital of Paul Gonsalves on Diminuendo in Blue, the CD would nevertheless warrant must-have status for the too numerous to mention standout performances from everyone in the band. Think you've heard the blues? Not until you've heard Johnny Hodges' Newport rendition of Jeeps Blues. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Uplifting","review":"After hearing a cut of this collection on the radio I immediately ordered and and found Ellington at Newport to be one of the greatest muscial collections I have ever heard. \\"Diminuendo in Blue\\" by itself is more than worth the price. For months this piece raised my spirits me as I crawled home on the L.A. freeways. I rank it is one of the most (if not the most) uplifting and stimulating recordings I have ever heard. The remainder of the collection is wonderful too and also deserving of five stars. There is so much on CD # 1 that it took me a year to start playing the second. The top ten lists Ellington at Newport can populate are endless. One of ten to take on desert island is only a start..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original","review":"This album is invaluable simply for the first two sections of the original performance of The Newport Jazz Festival Suite. Not as tight as the studio version recorded the following week, but, Lord, does it swing! Ellington's piano playing at the start of the second section is understated and stunning. Another bonus is the opening number of the main set, a rousing version of Take the A Train. There are disappointments. The engineers have ruined Woodyard's version of Skin Deep, which was so exciting on the original LP. (If the old version was a studio version, then honesty compels the judgment that the studio version was better.)The interminable introductions could have been removed with no loss except for historians. On the other hand, those youngsters who can stomach listening to the band's introduction several times will understand in their guts why the sixties had to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"bogus studio recorded crap","review":"This is the version avaliable for over a half century on Columbia. It is not the real Newport concert, but a studio re-creation cut the next day, due to technical deficiencies in the original recording. Buy the later two-disc set, which has the ACTUAL concert, in fantastic true stereo,with more than twice as much music. That set was carefully cobbled together from two different recordings-one from Armed Forces radio, the other the original Columbia recording. The double disc also includes the re-created version, so there's no reason to buy this thing,(except that it's cheap)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the 1.8\\" Toshiba HD","review":"My Sony Vaio TGN 350P broke.

They ride low behind your head, and really keep your ears warm. Since being introduced to them, I have spread them to two other family members and several co-workers. Seldom do products deliver so well on what they are supposed to do...but this product really does."},{"rating":"2","title":"likem...worksfine","review":"this is my first experience with behind the ear warmers. the fleece is nice and soft, and it keeps my ears warm without getting them too hot or sweaty. it has inner plastic parts which allow it to fold and adjust to various head sizes...which is what allows it to squeeze onto the head. it's not as compact as I'd like when folded and the plastic doesn't give as tight of a fit as I'd like, yet it's still scrunches down to a fairly small size...and most importantly: it keeps my ears warm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Fleece Ear Warmers","review":"I had bought these for may Husband, He did'nt like them Because, He Said they did'nt fit.

Please don't consider this CD. If any of you actually knew where Cardcaptors came from and what it originaly was, you would never EVER buy this.

What was released in the US was some sort of hell spawn. The music is no better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"This was a disappointment.

I, for one, am definately NOT an American pop fan. Gosh, just go buy the original Cardcaptor Sakura cd! The music is far better than what you hear from Cardcaptors. More like Cardcraptors.

IT SUCKS!","review":"I'm still wondering if I bought the cardcaptors cd or the newest Pokemon CD, since the music sounds the SAME! It seems to me like this people just took the lyrics+music for the newest Pokemon music project, and put it on the Cardcaptors cd. It has NO creativity, no imagination, and the track we are expecting \\"Ordinary girl\\" does NOT sounds like the one on the episode \\"the third element\\". Pretty similar, but IT'S NOT THE ONE on the episode. It sounds good for a RADIO EDIT, but NOT for the album version.

Whenever I heard that unmistakeable smooth tenor voice coming from behind my sister's closed bedroom door I couldn't help but intrude upon her privicy and go in and listen. Eventually I had to buy a copy of the album so I could listen undisturbed in my room. I couldn't be more pleased when I found out it was finally available on CD!'Time To Move On' is one of those very rare albums/CD's where everything comes together to absolute perfection. The production values, song selection and Glenn's unique voice and style make for a listening experience truly beyond description.Somethings are best left in the past. This is not one of them. Glenn's music has withstood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it ever was.

Contrary to the Publishers' Weekly summary, it is not clear that an act of murder has indeed been comitted; the evidence in the book leans against it.This story unfortunately doesn't showcase Stasiuk's greatest gift, which is his uncanny ability to be incredibly precise both in his introspection and his perceptions of the world. This sounds abstract, but think of Saul Bellow, except that Stasiuk is more immediate, and more respectful of the strangeness of the world. I am thinking of some of the essays in Tekturowy Samolot, or of the travel sketches he published recently in Rzeczpospolita.

This book is very informative. If you or anyone you know is thinking of having your/their Dr. prescribe Prozac, I would strongly suggest buying this book.

Why? It was simplistic to the extreme. I loved the minimalist metal sound of it. The vocals on the first one were melancholy without being annoying. However, this one shows obvious talent.

Still great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is nothing new or exciting at all","review":"Kudos to these guys for getting a chance to do something big, but the music itself is actually quite boring.There is nothing on this CD that hasn't already been done by bands who have more experience, like Funeral For A Friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"I saw this band when they were on tour with Letter Kills just a few months ago, and instantly fell in love. I bought their 3 track promo CD at the show, and listened to those three songs for nearly a week straight. Their single, \\"Gun In Hand\\" was featured on the \\"House of Wax\\" soundtrack, and for good reason.The band is an excellent mix of several genres, that blend together perfectly. High-pitched riffs fit seemlessly with the lead singer's melodic voice. In the background, screams echo the words of the songs, appealing to the 'screamo' fans. I really can't stress what an excellent album this is, and how quiet this release was. I highly recommend giving this a listen, it's one of my favorite albums of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"its....half assed?","review":"hmmm i like screamo and all but ive heard these songs before. its another example of a major label exploiting a samll town band in a desperate attempt at finding the next big thing, and who would have known, the big label has yet again screwed another young band. its a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather Listen To Hilary Duff","review":"Review by Cory Rennison:Major labels never cease to amaze me with their abilities to find the most generic bands out there and sign them. The kind folks over at Maverick Records have put out a new addition to the ongoing borefest that is mainstream music and their name is Stutterfly.Stutterfly has thrown together 13 tracks of power chords, angst-ridden lyrics, and song titles that are laughable at best. Some things that did work for this band were the great sounding vocals, and the rare occasions on the disc when the band attempted to have some actual guitar riffs instead of power chords. There isn't really a whole lot of singing in metal these days, so it was kind of interesting hearing it on this CD, however instrumentally, there's just nothing special here.With only a few key moments here and there, which are easily forgotten anyways, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this album. Chances are I'll forget this band's name by next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"And They are Bled of Talent","review":"This album was a real disapointment. Thank god i heard this crap before i made the purchase. To all metal/post hardcore listeners: listen to this before you buy it. It pretty much sounds like a mix of Story of the Year and Hawthorne Heights without the longevity. For screamo enthusiasts who enjoy the repetativeness in the genre, you'll feel right at home. It pretty much sounds just like everything else.Also, this band put songs on this record that they had written over two years before. Now, people, come on. They probably wrote seven of these thirteen songs during the recording of the album. That, in my book, is a sign of weakness. That says to me that they apparently have no more ideas. Sad.To cut right to the chase, there were no risks taken in the making of this album. NONE. Why keep to the formula so closely? Because people will like it. Yeah, that's given. WHERE THE HELL IS THE ORIGINALITY!? It's like eating a burger with no patty. There's NO POINT."},{"rating":"1","title":"It bad acid for the head","review":"First song is ok, but the rest gets worse and worse.

I am ever so careful to send exactly what companies request for rebate yet continue to gleefully get scammed. Not this time. I'm taking them to small claims to get my @#%& 25 dollars.

I sent in all the materials and never got the rebate. When I called up about it, they castigated me for not sending in the UPC code and the page from competitor's manual (I did send both, but they lost it).I will never buy another product from this company.The program iself, once the installation bugs are worked out (Norton Internet Security helped me solve the problem! Trend Micro never gave any help, although requested to) seems pretty generic.

Too bad because I had been using the 2005 version on my desktop PC which is a 3.2GHz so I might not have noticed if it used much CPU power.The high CPU usage also caused my notebook to eat through my battery after 1 hours surfing. I can normally get 4 hours from it when I have disabled the speakers and have the screen light on less than full power..All I will say to you, is download the trial first. and if you like it, buy it.

I was impressed with the great new features and sharp improved interface. Unfortunately, I also noticed an instant drop in the speed of my system. Everything--not just internet--is now at a crawl.

I've spent 4 months dealing with Trend-Micro's tech service (which isn't very good) trying to resolve the problem. The best advice they could give me was to uninstall all my internet browsers (firefox, netscape, IE) as these may conflict with their program - but what is the purpose of internet security if I can't get online???After waiting several weeks for tech services to analyze my memory dumps, I tried to email them back to check status, and had the message bounced back.

If you like what the author has presented, you will find yourself always analyzing different preachers on what they are preaching on the pulpit.Just have discernment and pray for truth in the spirit when you read this book.Do not lose the unity in Christ.I would strongly recommend this book simply because of its daring and bold statements and how this book could help you in great depth in apologetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty thing.","review":"This book is a \\"Nasty Thing.\\"This book is full of quotes that are almost ALL out of context, making this book very dishonest.I have many Hagin books.When reading this book, I noticed things Hagin Sr said that were out of context like: \\"if the symptoms get any worse...\\", but this book fails to mention Hagin Sr got healed.

However, the only good song on this CD is \\"Kiss Me\\"...all the rest are songs that I have never heard of. Why couldn't all the good songs have been put on this CD?

I've never even heard of half the artists! :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a joke!","review":"I'd just like to say that this CD is absolutely a waste of time.

So I bought it, and, with the exception of a few songs, I think it's an awesome CD. My favorites are \\"Feels Like Home\\" by Chantal Kreviazuk and \\"Life's a Bitch\\" by Shooter. Bye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait to buy it !","review":"I think this is gonna be a great soundtrack, except for the important themes that are missing, like \\"Kiss the Rain\\", but anywhere i still beleive that this CD reflects what the show is about; adolescence, teen age loves, usual problems... I hope it has success. Good Luck people on Dawson's creek, the best TV show on earth !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs From Dawson's Creek","review":"I always believed that if you were to call something a sound track, it should actually include material that actually WAS FEATURED in the show which it represents or at least capture the mood of the series. In my opinion this \\"soundtrack\\" fails to accomplish either.It seems like a \\"put something out there and see if teenagers will buy it\\" plan, that capitalizes on what people would see as adolesant ignorance. I hate that.So why did I give it two stars? Well, Sophie B. Hawkins has a pretty intellegent song featured on it. Also, Chantal Kreviazuk is a gifted singer/songwriter and anything with her in it can't be all bad. Even if she didn't actually write \\"Feels Like Home\\" she sings it with a passion that is laking in the other tracks. I was wondering what either of these artists were doing in this line-up.That's only the second and third tracks, it's all mind-numbingly downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the CD, I don't even like the show!","review":"Honestly this CD is the greatest. My favorite song is Ready for the Fall. I like all the songs, it is just really good! The only song I don't like is the show's theme song, because it reminds me of the show.The show is annoying. No one in real life, especially teens talk like they do. They use SAT vocab words and talk so cynically, or at least Dawson and Pacey do. Also after the first year, it seemed the writers were focusing getting ratings instead of providing believable characters. I find Joey too sweet. And what is with everyone dating each other? Well enough about the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"growing on me","review":"Well when I first go the Cd I thought that it would be full a lot of great songs.

Well worth buying!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew Ew Ew - What a Waste!","review":"When I first found out that Dawson's Creek was releasing a soundtrack I was estatic. Finally all my favorite songs from DC compiled on one CD. Boy was I wrong. They totally forgot about all the awesome songs from the first season and even from this one. \\"Say Goodnight\\" Beth Nielsen Chapman, \\"Broken Road\\" Melodie Crittenden, \\"I'll Be\\" Edwin McCain, \\"Kiss the Rain\\" Billie Myers, \\"I'll Remember You\\" Sophie Zelmani,\\"Have A Little Faith In Me\\" John Hiatt. I could go on forever with all the awesome songs that they left out. I am arguably the biggest DC fan and was very disappointed with the turnout of this CD. It is just a shameless plug. One of the very few good songs on it is \\"Kiss Me\\" but that song has already been played out and if you really wanted the song I suggest getting the \\"She's All That\\" soundtrack or Sixpence None The Richer. The only song I can tolerate is \\"Life's a Bitch\\" Shooter. Overall I say it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and Heartwrenching rolled into one...","review":"Part of what makes \\"Dawson's Creek\\" such a wonderful drama is the music that is played on it.

I bought the CD because I liked the song, Kiss Me (from the movie, She's All That), and I've liked Sophie's stuff in the past. But after track 2 there was absolutely nothing. The worst part is that I thought the recording quality was very poor-- I kept looking for a \\"K-Tel\\" label. Sounded more like a tape than a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!","review":"I LOVE Dawson's Creek, but this soundtrack was disappointing to me. It seems to be more of a plug for new songs than any representation of memorable songs from the show. What about Meredith Brooks' \\"What would happen if we kissed\\" from the episode of Dawson's first kiss and Pacey's experience with Miss Jacobs or Jann Arden's \\"You don't know me\\" from when Joey was pining over Dawson? Even \\"Tubthumping\\" could have been included from when Pacey walked into class and Miss Jacobs was his English Teacher? Those great songs from the first season were excluded to make room for plugging new artists. Sure, they played \\"Kiss Me\\" on the episode when Joey and Dawson finally kissed again and they included the theme song, but just as I was afraid of, this album is a plug and not much more. It makes me sad because I absolutely LOVE the show, but I could make a tape of better songs than this to represent the show. It is unfortunately OVERRATED."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder of what's life like on the creek.","review":"I didn't know if to buy the album, even though i am a fan of the show.

The mood and style of the music captures the feel of the show. This album steers clear of the more well known bands and opts to provide the listener with newcomers, much like the show. Although the CD is good, I think it is a shame that (speaking from a UK point of view) the international theme from the first series wasn't included, and that some of the bigger songs that have appeared on the show (Tubthumping, for example) were not included on the album. However, besides a few minor complaints, fans of Dawson's Creek will most likely love this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is amazing, just like the TV show","review":"If you're like me and nothing gets between you and your couch on Wednesday night, then this is the CD for you. It's been my favorite ever since it came out. It almost never leaves my Discman on trips. Each song is totally unique and different, and they are all awesome. Some you can even pick out when you hear it on the show. My favorite songs have got to be 'London Rain' by Heather Nova ( I just got her CD too ) and \\"Letting Go\\" by Sozzi. But the whole CD is wonderful! I'm never letting this one go! Plus there are awesome photos of the cast inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"A not for all teens quiet albulm that is easy to relate to","review":"With songs like 'Life's a bitch'and 'Cry Ophelia' this album is easy to relate to.

I am aware that this memoir has been greeted with cautionary morality and has earned the dubious distinction of a citation in the Flummery Digest on the Internet, but for me, Winik makes sense. She writes straightforwardly without a lot of analysis, without apology, without self-punishing hindsight. I learned about Winik from, of all things, an article in the March 1997 issue of Cooking Light. As a follow-up activity to reading the book, I recommend searching the Internet for Winik's account of going on \\"Oprah\\" to promote the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"First Comes Love epitomizes the 90's era of self-indulgent memoirs over? (and please, let it be over) This is basically a book about someone who makes one bad, selfish decision after another, wreaking havoc on the lives of those around her and then, rather than hanging her head in shame, deciding that it makes her so interesting that she ought to write about it and share it with the world. In fact, it sometimes seems as if the whole point of many of her actions is to have something outrageous to write about. One can't help but feel sorry for her sons, though.

It does give you some insight into the professional football training room, but you do have to remember that it is written by an M.D. It is smattered with the author's love of self. It is not dripping from the pages, but it did leave an off taste in my mouth. I am certain we are not getting all of the facts, and definately not both sides of the story.

This is an enlighting book for a fan of any team. I read it myself and as a woman who grew up with and occasionally watch's football, I found it very informative.

The music was horrid and the instructors were poor and talked too much. It did have another section where a different set of instructors did another routine (one of the participants was quite elderly and used a chair) but it was also a bad workout.

'Flight School' is a dynamic example of standard surf double-picking played in the lower range, and 'Pipeline' adds just the right degree of individual flare while retaining the intrinsic appeal of the Chantays original. A pleasant suprise (one I thought I'd never see) was finding a superb rendition of the Virtues 1959 hit 'Guitar Boogie Shuffle', here entitled 'Arthur's Boogie'. Morris made an excellent choice in selecting the R&B classic 'I Only Have Eyes For You' to add a touch of romantic melancholia to the mix. Finally, the slide guitar and minimal lyrics on the final number, 'Stop Teasing Me', make this tune invigorating. I first heard this band on an internet radio surf channel. In fact, the Danny Morris reportoire is a moderately successful mixed-bag of pop with surf leanings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer","review":"I love \\" I WON'T WORRY \\" and listen to it often.

I was hooked! The one thing that disappointed me, though, was the extreme to which the show's writers went in order to concoct their plots. It was as if they didn't trust that viewers can be hooked by the small dramas of life. In particular, they go over the top with psychic phenomena, religious fervor and grisly deaths. If it weren't for the endearing characters, I would have given up on the series. But I see that there might be a third series coming out... you can be sure I'll be watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming less well known British Detective Show","review":"I stumbled onto the existance of this show while googling West Highland Terriers, and a certain \\"Wee Jock\\" plays a recurring supporting role. Since I do enjoy a good British mystery and did enjoy 'The Full Monty\\" My curiosity was piqued. The quirky characters reminded me of Northern Exposure in a Scottish SettingAlthough the plot lines are more direct and can have a sharp edge to them and so far they are delightfully short of the existential tangents that permeated that show.

Initially I watched the series because I also have a Westie, like Wee Jock. Soon, I was sucked into the stories and characters. When I discovered the books I was excited but confused by the dissimiliarity to the series. However, they are each excellent. It is hard to imagine anyone else playing Hamish or Alexandra/Priscilla.

There are occasional glimpses of humor and interesting content, but as a whole the books falls flat because it is just too lacking in plot and character development.

At the time, I put off reading the book because it seemed to be just a story about a young girl's summer experience. The title (\\"...and TIME\\") should have tipped me off that something unexpected would occur. This is the book that made me into a voracious fantasy/science fiction reader. I recently bought a copy of the book to read again and while it must be admitted that the writing pales when compared to another favorite, Sabriel (also written for children/young adults), I still found myself interested in revisiting the twists and turns of the story. I would definitely recommend this book for children as it transforms a seemingly ordinary summer into a surprising adventure outside the realms of the ordinary.

And what's worse, the so called \\"goods\\" were those little ditties that Goldfrapp used on their website as sonic wallpaper. Don't get me wrong, the songs are lovely, but they're 39 seconds long.

He stops to tell a pointless, self indulgent story while tuning a uke, and then goes directly into a song on his Martin acoustic? Amateurish.

This one is OK, but he degernerated even further in his later collaborations with Bronson.The film lost it for me during a scene where the assorted characters are making an exchange of goods in a drive-in movie. The marquee says something like \\"Western Double Feature\\" and if you look at the screen, it's the same 20 second loop of a cattle stampede.So the other moviegoers drove in not knowing the names of the movies they were seeing and were staring at the same 20 seconds of film run over and over again.I know from fond memories that drive-ins were make-out hangouts back in the day and we didn't always focus on the movie, but this is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Film Noir, in color, 1970's style","review":"The music soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin is a gas!

It's just Ikue Mori going crazy with loops, rhythms, synthesized gongs and chimes, stuttering beats, and layered drums.The sounds on this album are complex. Ikue Mori is an expert at keeping you off-balance without making the rhythms sound random. You can sense an underlying logic to this stuff, but you can't hear it consciously.

I have tried to replace the flimsy and weak batteries that came with the pointer (the brand is Powtek, ever hear of them?) to no avail. It seems that well known brands such as energizer, duracell, eveready, etc. will not work. They are just slightly too large for this item. I thought all AAA batteries were the same size, but evidently this is not the case. The Powtek brand AAA batteries are just slightly skinnier than the well known, and therefore easy to find brands.

Frankly, I'm quite pleased with it. The product description says it has a range of 1500 yards, which is clearly incorrect, but 1500 feet, in low light or darkness, does sound accurate. The unit feels solid, and the on/off switch clicks solidly. The colimnating optics aren't the greatest, so the beam does tend to spread out a bit, especially at distances greater than 500 feet, but this isn't meant to be some sort of fine scientific instrument, so that's no big deal. I did notice the beam flickering a bit after a bit of use, but I replaced the very poor batteries that were included with a good set of name brand batteries, and the beam became much more intense and rock solid steady. I recommend this unit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality !","review":"Although this laser pointer is cheap, it is certainly low quality. Only 5 MINUTES after the package was opened, it began to malfunction. I have to press the botton really hard, and on the left side instead of the center, to make it work. Also it is very light and feels more like plastic or aluminum than 'solid brass'. Haven't got a chance to test standard AAA battery compatibility yet, but this was pointed out in other reviews. Conclusion: NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"optically ok, mechanically -- TRASH","review":"One of the owners had his unit die after a week -- mine died within 30 minutes. On investigation, installing fresh batteries caused so much resistance heating that the aluminum case became impossible to hold -- CAN YOU SAY FIRE HAZARD? The reason for this was that the flimsy spring used to compress the batteries had shifted and lodged against the aluminum case causing a short circuit. There should be a 0.1 cent plastic sleeve to prevent this. This product should be recalled and trashed. I'd send it back -- but I used a tubing cutter to find out what was wrong. At least it won't be re-sold to some other dupe. You really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the other negative reviews","review":"I wanted a laser pointer for a very simple purpose -- my cat loves chasing the dot. So illumination specs, range, battery life, none of that stuff really mattered. I just needed a red dot for my cat to chase. In this I was disappointed. This pointer had trouble early on -- I'd have to depress the button some certain, arbitrary way to get it to work. After about a month it stopped working altogether -- I gave it fresh batteries, everything. It's busted, I'm on Amazon right now buying a new (different) one.

It may be that Silvabrite has a higher melting temp that other solders, I have not tried this iron with any other solder but the tip won't melt silvabrite. You can get the silvabrite to melt if you put it halfway up the tip, but this is primative and the results look equally primative. Definitely need to be able to work with the tip to do nice work.

The image of mean, clipped, and heavily chained or caged dogs, with their skin head or back woods owners, Treating them like dangerous animals that need to be chained to a wall or caged in a pen will be put in the memory of anyone who hasn't had the experience to own one of these awesome, loving family dogs.They say they love their dogs so why are they chained or muzzled, because they made them mean thats why. This book promotes everything negative about pitbulls and their owners, most owners are normal working class families who treat their dog as a family member, not a killer with a prison sentence who needs to be restrained. This book should not be sold on amazon, all other books I bought through this site were great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy book","review":"I read most of this book and could not handle the rest. Having 2 pitbull mixes, I was hoping that it was an enlightening book on the beauty of the American pitbull. It was not. It was a depressing collection of photos on the lives of pitbulls owned by uncompassionate dog owners. They insist they love their dogs, yet tether them to trees and doghouses with giant metal chains. Do they not realize how cumbersome and heavy that weight is to bear on their necks.I do not recommend this book for people who love their dogs. This book, American Pitbull, is a pictorial on people who do not regard their dogs as anything more than a disposable pet, or an income. To them, their dogs do not feel pain, do not need love or compassion, and do not have any thought nor consciousness"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately We Are Robbed Again...","review":"...of the dignity of the idea that we own the most beautiful canines in the world.

While it's important to show a realistic portrayal of the APBT, the bad simply outweighs the good in this book.While much of the text is positive, and well written, there are more photos that show the dogs in a violent light (i.e. a multi-page spread of two dogs ripping apart a pig).In a nutshell this book will contribute the negative image that APBT's already have, and glorify those who have these dogs for the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"This book should be retitled: \\"White Trash, Thugs, and Assorted Degenerates. I bought it as a reference for an art project but most of the pictures feature the not-so-savory owners ahead of the dogs. While this book is full of well taken photographs (and very little text), quite a few of the photos don't even have dogs in them, just some fat, shirtless guy showing of his jailhouse tattoo. It's no wonder these dogs have such a poor reputation-- just look at the people who own pitbulls in this book. Of the 3 books I purchased, \\"Colby's Book of the APBT\\" features the best photos. I admit I haven't read it, but in the little I've skimmed the author seems to glorify fighting. The 3rd book I purchased, \\"The Ultimate APBT\\" is worthless if you're looking for photos.

I have had 2 pitbulls, both amazing and beautiful animals, but now unfortunately I can't have pets as I live in New York. Frankly it disappointed me thoroughly. My overriding memories of my dogs are their sheer physical beauty and their wonderful characters. The pictures in this book reveal nothing of the true nature of any dog let alone a pitbull. The pictures are either bland and do not remotely portray the majesty of the breed or a lot of them detail what obviously looks like cruelty and are very disturbing. A lot of the photographs in the book are of stereotypical pitbull owners.The essay by James Frey, however, is delightful and interesting. The rest of the text is pointless and uninformative.I would not recommend. If you are interested in pitbulls you should buy something by Richard Stratton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book with the assumption that it would be full of stories by and pictures of people from across the country, of all walks of life, sharing their experiences about their beloved pit bulls. Instead, I was rather shocked to find that it contained mostly photographs of pit bulls, mostly all on a heavy chain, ranging from one attacking an animal, to training on a treadmill, to being in a pen full of freshly born pit babies.

This ancient meteor-shower menace was already a cheap cliche (and unrealistic, to boot) back in the days of Flash Gordon. Then there's the ending, which makes me wonder if Bova paid any attention to what he described his characters as drinking. If you're not a science nit-picker like me, however, it's a good read.

He's supposed to be Navajo, but its clear from the get-go that Mr. Bova knows nothing about Navajo culture, so he feels free to substitute a pretty odd mix of pan-southwestern Indian characteristics that are pretty well both banal and cliché.The major plot complication comes in the form of a mysterious disease that I will not give a spoiler for, but again, its pretty obvious that Mr Bova knows nothing about this illness, as there is no possible way that this disease would have manifest itself in the ways described in the book. In 3 or 4 years, yes this disease might be inconvienient, but crippling in just 6 weeks?

Instead of some grand-sounding phrase, he utters some ancient Indian saying. This gets the president angry, and (from afar) she begins to hold all these things against the mission and other things. Like . . . get real. No one would get angry over something stupid like that (or, at least I hope no one would. I guess you never know. People get upset over some pretty stupid things.

His portrayal of many of the Mars team as predjudiced against all sorts of national and racial backgrounds just doesn't fit.

I remembered the name and the artist and went on-line the next morning to find it. I played it for the first time and found five other cuts equally good. Sloane has a buttery voice that transports you. I ordered the Ellington CD at the same time and found that delightful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lied","review":"I bought this dvd because I had read about it on the website of the person who created it. They lied. They tell you that you will see things that you never do. It is just a bunch of home movies, and most of them are crappy clips. It seems as if they are putting Manson down throughout the film. Oh, and it seems as if they finished the film, then got more content, and instead of re-doing it, they just added the stuff to the end... after the credits!The person responsible for making this film should take some lessons before making another.I like Manson a lot, but I feel this was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having some fun!","review":"Just listen to Leon and Dr. John on \\"Frosty The Snowman\\" and you just know this is going to be fun. With his distinctive voice and with instruments like the dobro and accordian in the background, Leon has prepared a pleasant addition for any Christmas collection. \\"Try to listen to \\"There's No Place Like Home For The Holidays\\" without smiling, if you can, you probably don't like Leon Redbone or Christmas music to begin with.

This 'Frosty the Snowman' is the best version I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bing Crosby meets Emmett Miller for Christmas!!!","review":"At times Redbone vocals recall Bing Crosby's style, with a touch of Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams, Al Jolson, and Emmett Miller. Great rich baritone vocals taht recall classic singers of the 20's & 30's, singing vinatge Hawaiian and south sea isle Christmas songs, and some fien old Christmas chestnuts.

It seemed like there were about a two dozen storylines that Chuck Dixon wanted to tell and he crammed it in these ten issues. While some elements were good, others are washed out or completely rushed. Scott McDaniel's are was the same way. It was so frantic that the action was hard to follow at times.

It doesn't have any fancy features, but you don't need a lot of frills to brush your teeth.You use less toothpaste, and your teeth feel a lot cleaner than when you use a regular toothbrush. Additionally, because of the small brush, you can get to the back and sides without any contortions. The soft bristles do a great job on your gums while you brush.The only negatives are that there is nowhere to store extra brushes, and that it's a bit noisy, but these are not major problems. You also have to remember to discharge it completely every six months.Great economical choice for clean teeth and healthy gums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily, I listened at a friend's house...","review":"... and didn't buy this repackaged sliced turkey! This is a mediocre piece of music, third-rate even by 19th C standards. It's horribly recorded, with shuffling feet and hacking coughs overwhelming the cellos and other bass instruments. The orchestra is ridiculously tinny and out of tune; I've heard better in plazas in provincial market towns of Argentina. The singing is \\"period\\" style, all right -- and a very bad period it was for singing, the mid 20th C, period!

It is not only grounded in apllicable, impactful content, but also written in a manner that is entertaining and fun!In my business (and my personal life), I have found that we often complicate issues until they either become too big to tackle or lost in the confusion. In MicroBranding, Mr. Gross clearly explains that this need not be the case when building a personal or local brand. Using real-world examples, he illustrates that building a powerful microbrand is both attainable and necessary.

However, I would only recommend getting this tape series if you have no prior experience with meditation, past life regression, or astral projection of any kind, AND you don't mind being shouted at as you try to relax. Ms. Linn's incessant talking and raising her voice at the most inopportune times create not only an environment which is counter-productive to the purpose, but is flat out stressful. I have loaned this tape series to other members of our meditation group without giving them my perceptions, and have gotten 4 negative responses to it. I've tossed it since I can't even find someone to give it away to. I'd rather meditate & regress with my son's anime cartoons blaring in the background.

The habit of having a storyteller for every tale makes the characters distant so that you don't end up caring about them, and the scenery less vivid. This technique is supposed to give them the universal wisdom of fables but what the stories and characters tend to achieve is either common sense or a sort of vague mysticism that doesn't really accomplish the amount of depth it would need to have this style work.

After a promising start, \\"Kiss Me, Stupid\\" quickly goes downhill - partly due to the horrible miscasting of Ray Walston (a last-minute replacement for Peter Sellers, who suffered a near-fatal heart attack six weeks into shooting). Scattered among the wreckage is Kim Novak's memorable performance as Polly the Pistol.

It was a happy day when I got rid of the old CD towers! What really makes a difference is if you get more than one and get them working together with personalized play lists and shuffling between them so there is no delay between songs. Many of us have more than 400 CDs and are not done buying them, yet. IPODs give us great portability but on a goood sound system mp3's do not have the richness and depth of a wave file on a CD. I also highly recommend you get software (don't bother to key in titles) that will actually do an inventory through the internet of all your CDS after you load them, label them and yes even download a picture the CD cover.

His halty, broken writing style is rhythmless and without style. Worse, the author's constant second- and third- person references to himself were particularly grating, especially given the tone and color of events he relates. This is one storyteller who no doubt finds himself alone at the bar soon after he begins his tale. If you liked Mason's guileless style of self-baring, you will absolutely hate Marvicsin's self-deception.I gave up after one hour's sincere effort to plow into the story.

To think the book is fiction is to not know Denny or much about Vietnam. I have read 99% of the books written about Vietnam and Maverick rates in the top 2% of the books on Vietnam that I have read. If you knew Denny you would know that everything in the book is true as he is not the type person to add fiction just to make a story more interesting.

The only problem, which is not a very big problem, was that sometimes it stops working.

The batteries (replacement) are fairly inexpensive, fortunately. Additionally, i do notice sometimes the laser acts funny- However there is a fix. You can try to screw on the back cap more, and the battery connection becomes more secure, so it works better when you do thisOne idea for a future improvement would be to label the 42 heads. It is misleading, unless i label it myself, which one is what. It would not be a bad idea to try to fix another battery glitch- when the battery is low, the pointer begins to spread quite a bit over a distance- much more than when the battery is in good condition.For its price, it is a good value. If you're looking for something savvy, i like the MiracleBeam Green laser pointer- it is just awesome!! you'll have to try one, but it is about 6x the price of the Clearline."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid product","review":"It fell apart immediately, the heads are all rather stupid (and also fuzzy), the spotlight wasn't very intense.

The quality of the laser was horrible, the batteries didn't work, and when I finally got them to work the laser light could only be seen if the laser was pointed a few inches from where you were pointing it at.The heads that came with this device were dumb and served no purpose. I had the impression that the heads would have patterns of some sort and mine just showed the plain old dots.Besides those technical things, the laser didn't look a thing like the picture.All in all, this laser is not very good and is not recommended.

Listen to the samples that amazon.com has to get an idea what is on the other records. I am a BIG John Zorn fan but some of his work has left some of my friends cold. There are some Zorn records I listen to a lot and some I don't: I listen to Bar Kokhba a lot, also The Circle Maker (which is very similar) and the Masada records (which are wilder and crazier). I ALSO listen to the Naked City record over and over(the first one with the Weegee cover) but let's just say if you never liked punk music, you should hold off a little bit from that one. Spillane's another good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotionally wrenching","review":"Saw this at Blockbuster and almost passed it up. Boy am I glad I didnt.

Watch it when you're looking for great drama, but not for comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, tedious execution","review":"On paper, this film sounds like it will be a great psychological drama, but its execution is a bit creepy and very slow moving. The movie's running time is only 100 minutes, but it felt like it was 100 hours. Nevertheless, it offers a fast glimpse at the always cute Abigail Breslin. Damian Lewis's performance is awe-inspiring and he attempts to carry the film, but the result is quite unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Keane is the drama given two thumbs up by Ebert and Roper. Can you imagine if it was your child missing? What would you do? Where would you look? How could you sleep? Damian Lewis stars in this drama as Williams Keane, a man literally pushed to the edge. His six year old daughter is missing. Keane self medicates his pain with booze and drugs but it doesn't take away all of his pain. The audience is mad to empathize with the main characters plight. Keane soon meets a new woman in his life named Lynn. Lynn has a seven year old daughter. Keane becomes close to the girl then the story gets a little confusing. Everything isn't what it seems with Keane. This is a psycological thriller that will keep you guessing until the end.

In her sophomore effort Taylor goes in another direction entirely singing pop, abandoning her soprano voice in favor of a more sensual mix of head and chest voices. It's not as natural to her but it's an effort to do something a bit different. Taylor's idea of pop isn't the bubblegum, candy coated stuff of her peers either. She covers well known tunes like \\"You Raise Me Up\\" but really shines on lesser known pieces like Cat Stevens' \\"Into White\\", \\"It Is You (I Have Loved)\\", and \\"The Last Words You Said\\". Still in her teens Taylor seems to be exploring her voice and trying to discover what it's suited for. It makes it that much more interesting to wonder what her third album will bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Videos and promos are not complete.

This book was a real disappointment - from the characters I had a hard time caring about to the unbelievable dialogue. Who talks like that? Seattle may be oh, so hip, but pu-lease! Doig throws in so many one-liners and cultural references, it's like listening to a Dennis Miller routine. Yeah, I get 'em - it just becomes ridiculous after a while. I almost threw the book down when I came to the line \\"I came, I saw the paperwork, I don't concur.\\" Yuck.The best parts where those describing the land - Montana, Seattle, Alaska. The book was good enough to get me through a flight to D.C. and back, but to compare this writer to Wallace Stegner causes me to wince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountain Time by Ivan Doig","review":"Ivan Doig is an excellent writer and Mountain Time rates as one of his best. He bases his books in Montana and provides outstanding pictures of the people, attitudes, landscape, and scenery of the state. I am a native Montanan and know both Seattle and Montana's Rocky Mountain Front. Both are accurately depicted here. Doig's description of a cafe that is \\"somewhere between unfinished and deteriorating\\" would fit any number of cafes in small-town Montana. On a plot level, Mountain Time presents some unique twists and many poignant moments that will keep the reader involved from the beginning to the end. This is not a book where you will guess the ending before you get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original McCaskill lore is back!","review":"For those who are familiar with Doig's subject family, the McCaskills, Mountain Time brings back the original powerful relationships between family members, as seen in English Creek and Dancing at the Rascal Fair. I feel that Ride with Me, Mariah Montana lacked a great deal of the characterization found in the prior two novels, and now in Mountain Time. Doig also borrows from the mystery element of Bucking the Sun in his newest work. His language and word choice are definitely superior to any of his prior works, as much of Mountain Time read like poetry. I felt let down by Ride with Me, but Doig has given his readers a gift with Mountain Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stylistic Exercise","review":"After reading four prior Doig novels and loving three of them, I felt that this would be another good read. I was wrong. I found it hard to care about the characters and felt that Doig was relying his overly-stylistic prose rather than developing a story. After reading the other bad reviews, I tend to agree with their characterizations, but will now have to finish the book as I just began the backpacking trip which I is where I tossed the book down in disgust. As an avid hiker and one who has traveled the country Doig writes of, I found the trip account unrealistic and painfully uninformed. The only reason I didn't choose 1 star is that \\"I hate it\\" is too strong a statement for a book I couldn't care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Stegner","review":"I wanted to like this book. And in places the novel is satisfying, for example when Doig's characters are involved in nature (especially the trek to the fire tower). Especially pervasive throughout is a dialogue that just doesn't work - people don't normally converse the way Doig's characters do - at least not throughout the entire story. The repetitive, \\"so-hip\\" banter between characters becomes annoying almost from the start. The characters too were so extreme that I felt each person developed into a caricature, or stereotype that was so hard to become involved with, or develop sympathy for.I would have quit this book mid way but for the hype on Amazon. Especially the comparisons between this author and Wallace Stegner. Compare this book to say Crossing To Safety, and you can see just see what an unbelievable stretch this comparison is. And it may have set up expectations in my mind about Doig that were unfair to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are the Very Very Best!

Since this is a novelization, it clearly wasn't the author's fault that she was hamstringed by a bad plot, and she does make some effort to paper over the plot holes here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of DS9...","review":"Ever since I first began watching DS9, I've been hooked on the action, plot twists, and most of all, the people. Except for the deranged opening with a delirious Kira, this book was fantastic! I read it after the episode and loved it. Their good-byes made me cry (even after reading it 2 times) and the memories made me smile. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know how the DS9 story came to a bittersweet ending. Even in 20 years, I'll still be able to remember how this Trek spin-off touched my heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tea","review":"This tea is hard to find. I originally bought it at a Chinese grocery. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a mild cup of tea. Unlike Silver Needle white tea, it does have some color. However, the flavor and aroma is like other white teas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as store bought tea bags","review":"The packaging looks the same as the ones you can buy in Asian stores but the tea is weak and lacks the strong body of the store bought bags and it cost more. The only reason I bought it online is the local store didn't have it. But I was very disappointed in the product. Next time I will drive to Portland and buy it instead of buying a poor imitation like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Concise, Marvelous Photographs","review":"I got just what I wanted from this book; a vivid depiction of some of the best works of graffiti in the entire world. I was certainly not disappointed. The art presented here ranges from simple, stark icons plastered in street signs to massive photorealistic portraits on the sides of enormous buildings, and everything in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review For: GRAFFITI WORLD","review":"This book is excellent if your interested in seeing real graffiti they show alot of famous such as COPE2,123CREW,ABOVE,and many other famous artistthey also show art from all over the world such as North America, Europe,Asia,China,and many other places. And another thing is that this book is HUGE! it has around 500 pages and all of them have full color pages of graffiti. This book is great I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best global outlook of Urban Art","review":"Nicholas Ganz has done a great job at traveling the world to capture in this book the state of street art everywhere. Taking the reader through it by continents (Americas, Europe, Rest of the World), the book takes you on an in-depth, visually-loaded trip that highlights the work of the best street artists around these days.If you are looking for an in-depth look at the origins of this genre, you won't find much of that in \\"Graffiti World\\". However, if you want to compare street art between, say, Denmark and Sidney, or see how the New York style has had an indelible influence in places like Brazil or South Africa, this book will delight you as you learn all about it. Five stars job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gift","review":"I bought this book for my sister on her birthday and it's awesome... but some of the art in this book is not as spectacular as I thought it would be. The book is very enjoyable regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graffiti World","review":"For a minute I thought I was the only person I know that hated this book. I believe Nicholas Ganz was too far outside struggling to get a look at an already active / flourishly culture and failed to understand who or what to look for when making his book.I got this book for Christmas and sold it used the following week. See for yourself... if this book was just released in the states why are there already so many used copies for sale so soon? Obviously I wasn't the only person dissatisfied. Beyond the hard cover of this book nothing about it impressed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graffiti World","review":"This book is no different than any other graff rag on the market. Just like all graff mags, all of the photos in this book were contributed from random corners of the globe. In fact the author still has a post on Art Crimes where he's encouraging graffiti artist to mail in their submissions. Strangely I didn't find any mention of this in the book (?) or maybe I was in such a hurry to get through it I didn't catch it.I found much better interntional graffiti in Graphotism's International Graffiti issue # 15 and for half the cost. This book gets 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good.","review":"Horrible. Not happy with Seller.

The Stage 1 books explain simple and easily observable science concepts for preschool- and kindergarten-age children. Stage 2 books, which includes this title, explore more challenging concepts for children in the primary grades and include hands-on activities that children can do themselves. \\"Archaeologists Dig For Clues\\" is well-conceived and informative, with bright cartoon drawings. It is formatted a little like the \\"Magic School Bus\\" books, more for upper elementary kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loved it!","review":"We used this book to aid in learning about archaeology in 1st grade science.

Get the Blue One","review":"The blue Memory Sticks by Sony or Lexar play MP3 files just dandy. I should know, I've owned a Clie the past 2 years and I have been enjoying MP3s on my 128 MB Memory Stick since I bought my Clie.All you need to do is put the MP3s you want to listen to in the MSAudio folder on the memory stick. In fact, Sony's manual even gives instructions on how to do this! For the price of ONE Magic Gate Memory Sticks you can buy TWO blue Memory Sticks of equal size! Don't believe me, visit cliesource.com and ask all the Clie users there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Protection????","review":"Sony acts as if the ability to block MP3's is a virtue. Otherwise it functions like all of the other memory sticks out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've stuck to photography","review":"While seemingly self-deprecating, this author manages to insult every culture other than her own and paint a very clear picture of herself as a spoiled, prejudiced, ignorant woman.The flagrant anti-Semitism is the worst aspect of the book, so prevalent I didn't want to finish except to see whether she'd redeem herself at all (nope), but all the troubles-with-the-incompetent-help anecdotes paint a very clear picture of an anachronistic, selfish woman who should definitely have stuck to her shopping.The worst story of all: the day a woman flagged her car down because her husband was dying of a heart attack, and the author didn't take him to the hospital because his nose was running and that disgusted her.The positive reviews excerpted in the book are all quotes from her friends and social circle who should have read it first. In sum: not worth the 1-cent used-book price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great description of the life- politics aside","review":"Being a diplomatic spouse myself, I really enjoyed this book and could relate to many of the feelings she had and many of the experiences. It is her memoir and she is clearly an intelligent woman and entitled to her opinions but I found the tone and some of her political comments particularly galling. Politics aside, it was a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I destroyed brain cells reading this book","review":"I was living overseas with my husband when I found this book. So, I was very excited to read something that was relevant to my own experience -- and maybe have a good laugh. Looking back, I kick myself for spending money on this book (especially the premium price charged for English language books in the country I was living). The author's observations and jokes are not only boring, but just plain dumb. After the story about trying to hire servants in India and discovering that one of the candidates had six fingers on one hand, which would make finding white gloves for him exceedingly difficult, I should have stopped reading. I kept thinking, \\"You lived in all of these wonderful, exciting places, and THIS is what you took away from the experience?!\\" Unfortunately, I chose to finish the book. It only got worse. Save yourself the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"When life gives you lemons, some can only see lemons...","review":"I loathed this book. I loathed this book so much that I binned it in the subway - with 20 minutes left to go in my journey.It is a tale of a privileged Sloane Ranger 'trailing spouse' following her husband around various diplomatic postings. With a large income, plenty of idle time and the chance to explore highly varied cultures, the life of a trailing spouse should make a pretty interesting read. Instead, the reader gets page after page of whinging, loathing and misery. Enraged at the author's haughty tone and bleak portrait of life in Central Asia, I could feel my blood pressure rising in the subway. At the interchange, I shocked fellow travellers by loudly thumping it in the bin and storming away... to make the most of my day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diplomatic Baggage","review":"What a delightful, witty, and engaging book! I took it on a girls trip to Florida and giggled every night after lights went out reading in my bunk. Next morning everyone on board wanted to read it. Tidbits of living in countries so different and under conditions ranging from basically camping out to luxury accommodation. Add the opportunities for new foods, new languages, new customs and new housing staff and you have a mix not to be missed. And just imagine (you can't) raising children/teens under those circumstances. A mind relaxing, belly chuckling book - but with enough of the realities of life and sobering moments to remind you this was a real life and certainly not a cushy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracks","review":"1.

It came with lots of extra screws, so no matter what size you need, it probably has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent filtration system","review":"No, this \\"chrome\\" isn't true chrome, but I'm really surprised people expected it to be. It comes in white for the same price; you'd think people would assume this was plastic. Mine still looks brand new, though.You CAN run hot water out of your faucet, you just can not filter it. This is true of all faucet water filters. There's a bypass that will still allow you to get hot water, but it won't be filtered.I live in Chicago where we, admittedly, have water that doesn't need much filtering...but I've had this filter on my kitchen faucet for 3 months now and there's still 50% of the filter life remaining.I got this system (with 2 filters) for $9.99 at Big Lots, so I'm surprised to see it costs over $40. It's a good filter, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, Not Chrome","review":".....and the \\"plastic coated chrome-look finish\\" water spotted almost immediately and couldn't be cleaned or polished into an appetizing appearance--big yuck. The horizontal style should be an improvement, however I found the filter much more difficult to remove than the older white vertical Pur I'd replaced. The final straw was last week, when an overwhelming stench issued from the filter--I'm assuming perhaps the indicator failed and somehow the filter became contaminated....I loved my old clunky vertical Pur, and I do believe overall Pur makes a good product, but this one is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, doesn't last, no customer service","review":"My filter worked perfectly for two weeks.Then the indicator quickly registered the filter going bad. Fine; I can go buy another filter.But then after a month, the unit started to leak out of the non-filtered spout whenever I ran water through the filter.The warranty should cover it, but I can't find any information about warranty returns on Pur's website, or the packaging, or anywhere else. Conveniently, there's no phone number for Pur, and they don't return my emails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product and terrible customer service from PUR","review":"I purchased my PUR filter at Costco because I could get replacement filters in packs of 5. What I discovered is that after the first two filters, my dispenser unit started showing a red light after only a few weeks. I purchased two gallon jugs (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and EVERYTIME I turned the filter on, filled one of the jugs & kept track of the amount of water I had filtered. I discovered after 14 gallons, the light blinked yellow, and after the 15th, turned red. I contacted PUR from their website, but I'm apparently not important enough to even respond to.As soon as I'm done with these filters, I will purchase another brand of water filter.

The one thing I don't like about it is the 3 small buttons that are beside the large \\"push to talk\\" green button were so easy for her to hit that she was hitting them by mistake and that would mess up the time or turn the alarm on, etc. So we cut a small piece a cardboard and taped over these small buttons, so that helps with that problem alot. I would recommend this clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ladder, but no lightweight!","review":"First of all, you'll likely have to WAIT to get this ladder...shipping seemed to take forever. However, the product is first-rate, and works as advertised. The ability to use this on uneven surfaces is a real plus, and the 24 foot extension allowed me to \\"scale new heights\\", reaching places on my HUGE home that I never thought I'd see. One important drawback...this is a HEAVY ladder. Despite its being made of aluminum, I was a bit surprised at its heft. I would NOT recommend for the ladies or for seniors. Heck, even for a marginally \\"strong\\" guy like myself, this is a challenge to carry around. Still, a great ladder, all in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wide to fit most stairs","review":"I really like the 24 foot and this works well with outside jobs for our home on a hill. I got the 16 ft for working on interior stair and the base is too wide to fit what I assume is average staircase pitch. You could also say the problem is that the legs do not extend far enough. Either way it did not work. Measure first to be sure before you buy it. Werner should be made aware of this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Ladder arrived with 3 bent rungs!! One of them was so badly bent it is cracked. There was no packaging at all, just the bare ladder itself with the shipping label on it! That means it travelled with no protection at all..BAD IDEA AMAZON. This ladder was also scratched pretty bad, and one of the plastic endcaps was torn off exposing a deep cut in the aluminum underneathe. It also wobbles quite a bit when extended, and the leveling system is not as easy as it appears. The only good news is it is light and tall. For $300.00, I was burned. I will be returning it, but this is a hassle and I need a ladder to do my gutters. They better not give me any trouble returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"My first introduction to writer Steve Thayer is in the book Silent Snow. There is no question that Steve has a sense of place. He really fills in the atmosphere of Minnesota's twin cities and really engulfs you in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Unfortunately, at least for me, I felt immersed in cliche characters. The tough reporter married to the brilliant news anchor doesn't spark any originality but that's nothing compared to the background story. All the characters were dug out of a James Cagney film. The cold-as-ice broad, the dirty cop and the tough tenacious reporter with a nose for news. After a while I didn't care at all about the situations. In addition, writer Steve Thayer falls into the melodrama. \\"I'm sad, I'm happy, I'm worried\\" type situations give the characters no complexity or interest.If you want fluff, this isn't bad but I can't justify giving it high marks for character, story, or plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"good plot, awful writing","review":"I am in the midst of reading this book, and wanted to see what other reviews have said.

The characterizations of the protagonist and his wife are so limited that I assume they must have been introduced in some earlier work, one I haven't read. Some subsidiary characters were better described, but over all the book lacked cohesiveness. The present day kidnapping was much less well developed than the Lindberg story (which was well presented) and the motivation for the current crime seems extraordinarily contrived. Moreover, unlike the Lindbergs, the husband and wife never really seemed to miss the baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to put down!","review":"Just as in \\"The Weatherman\\", Steve Thayer's \\"Silent Snow\\" grabs you right from the first page, and then it won't let go!! There is heart-racing action and/or intrigue on nearly every page. And just as you think you've figured out who the culprit is, Steve twists and another character becomes suspect. Real people and places are interwoven into the story well. The ending is so vivid, you think you're in the middle of all the excitement. Could there be a movie far behind...? Keep them coming Steve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book is terrible.... the writing doesn't stand up to the standards of a b movie script, and although the reviews on the cover lead you to believe there are some major twists in store, most readers ought to know \\"whodunnit\\" fairly early on in the story.

It was a well written and entirely enthralling book.Unlike the others, I liked this book MUCH better than the Weatherman if only for the characterization. His portrayal of the people involved is much more interesting in this book as well as the little tidbits of history that make you want to go look up books on the Lindberg Kidnapping case.I hope to see more Thayer books out there.

Not half as bad as, for instance, \\"Sherlock: Case of Evil\\" or the gawdawful adaptations of Doyle's stories with Matt Frewer as Holmes. But it's pretty bad. Emphasis (as has become a cliché) on Holmes's substance abuse, particularly in the beginning. But the most astonishingly bad thing about the story is a particular plot twist which, of course, I may not reveal, but which is one of those which no good writer would ever exploit as a surprise solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I always appreciate attempts at recreating Sherlock Holmes. As a huge fan of the stories, this movie definitely falls short. Contrary to the stories, Watson is portrayed as a fumbling idiot rather than a war veteran. Even the plot is lacking. A solution that has been done countless other times. Honestly, I found the BBC television worth more merit and true to the original stories than this.Appreciate the effort; but it just didn't cut it. I want to like it so bad...but it just doesn't happen with this one. The acting is poor and the story line is terrible. Very sad to see a classic fall short."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Games Afoot Fetish","review":"This is a very satisfying Holmes original that forgoes cozy atmospherics for a taut serial killer storyline. The thrilling and suspenseful last half-hour wouldn't be out of place in a mainstream feature. Very well played by Ian Hart as Dr. Watson and Rupert Everett's prickly take on Holmes. It's unusual for such a distinctive and charismatic actor to play Holmes and not surrender his personality to the role. Instead he offers a highly original take. Too bad this didn't start a new series - it's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful...","review":"Rupert can be such a funny and wonderful actor--e.g. in the recent magical version of AN IDEAL HUSBAND. But Oscar Wilde is not Arthur Conan Doyle. And, Rupert, you are no Jeremy Brett here. Not that he really had to be. But to play Sherlock--pastiche or not--with absolutely no intensity, no intellectual vigor, no excitement--is to kill the main characteristics of Holmes. Rupert seems to be slumming here--lots of posing and looking mournful--and makes the detective the last thing he should be...ordinary.A well-mounted production in many senses. Good character actors in support. A modernized story with fingerprinting and sexual perversion. But, without a believable Holmes, who cares? To make matters worse, Watson and Holmes seem much too young here. Watson is too short. And the relationships among Holmes, Watson and Mrs. Hudson are nowhere near as close and warm and devoted as they should be.This production is just terribly misbegotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy classic Sherlock Holmes - this is a must see!","review":"I found this to be a perfectly delightful film! I believe the Rupert makes an ideal Sherlock. His mannerisms and his dry British wit made this truly enjoyable. I would love to see more of Rupert in such a role it fits him quite nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Holmes film I have seen so far","review":"Arthur conan Doyle never delt with such crude subjects. I didn't like Everetts Holmes, he was creepy and rude. Watsons fiance was also crude. Watson was wimpy. After seeing all of the Brett and Rathebone movies I was excited about a \\"new Holmes\\". Good thing there isn't a series of these. Even the cartoons are way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Jeremy Brett instead","review":"Despite its lavish costumes and good score, this production can do nothing to mask its poor casting. As the title role, Everett is awkward and frenzied . . . not like the cool, calculating Holmes we all know- he seems less like a brilliant (and frightening) genius and more like a raving drug-addict. (Not to mention the terrible violin scene...) The script does little to capture the spirit of the Conan Doyle stories.Take my advice and watch Jeremy Brett instead. Or better yet, go read the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jeremy Brett","review":"This is not Jeremy Brett, and as such it can never be a great version of Sherlock Holmes. But if you have to settle for less than the best it is not horrible. It is also not a story that Doyle wrote; it is an original screen play using Doyle's character. Which is why the plot sort of does this kind of flop on the descent toward the finale. Keeping these things in mind, it's ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thumbs up; Not thumbs down","review":"It was great to see a new Sherlock, even though this Sherlock was very unSherlockian. He had the wrong guy detained, recklessly endangered a girl, and just seemed to be too much of a slacker. But, it is good to see any effort in the post Brett world. We need new Sherlocks -- as imperfect as they may prove to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boat knowledge reclaimed","review":"As a long time cruiser and live aboard I was surprised at the contribution this book makes to modern sailing skills.

The acting ranged from over-the-top (the nelly queen Lester) to dull and listless (the business partner David), although there were certainly some decent performances too. The sound was horrible--the dialogue was so low you had to turn up the volume all the way but then the horrible music would come on and blast your eardrums. In some cases the wind noise on the microphone was so bad the dialogue was completely washed out. The movie tried to make up for the horrible plot(s) and production values by treating us to soft-porn eye candy, but that wasn't enough to redeem it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad/SAD this could have been good","review":"Murder in Portland could have been a good film if they would have taken the time to write a strong script which this is not.

This movie poorly made and poorly writen.I think if some would have put more effort in to writting this and working with a better trained cast this could have been a good movie....

I can't be certain that the case was to blame but overall, I don't think the price is worth it, and I don't feel confident enough in the ventilation to ever use the case again.Also, the case changes the weight of the balanced screen, making it move due to accidental shifting more so than if the case is not on the computer.I took off the case right before logging into amazon to write this review, and for the first time today, the computer is not hot to the touch, so I'm pretty confident the case is to blame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Excellent","review":"I was amazed how well it snapped into place and how well it gives me a unique MPB look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides the protection desired","review":"Have not discovered any scratches on my Macbook Pro after placing it in this case - which is my reason for purchasing it.

It did crack in a couple of places, but I'm pretty rough on the computer and it still did a good job protecting the computer. BUT THEN, I had to remove the case. It is so awful to try to remove it. Both my husband and I yanked at the thing, trying to pry up the tabs, and finally with much effort we ruined a couple of credit cards prying open the case at the corners to get it off.

Everyone thought the new macs come in different colors or I had mine spray painted. They were \\"green\\" with envy... haha. My one bit of advice though... when you are putting it on your laptop, take the plastic wrap off and IMMEDIATELY place it on your laptop... if you set it down the inside gets little flecks of dirt I had to keep trying to wipe it out so there wasn't dirt sandwiched between my case and my laptop.

I bought the case in green, which makes my computer look a little more unique than regular MBPs. It was very easy to put on and easy to remove, and I think that it definitely can protect he laptop very well.The only things I don't like about the case is that it makes the computer feel about a pound heavier. Since the plastic is so thick, the top of my computer closes very quickly and a harder than normal since it is weighted down by the case.There are some cases that don't fit well (according to the Speck website) but mine happens to fit perfectly without having to send it back or fixing it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it was usable","review":"I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop.

Three things to consider though.1) It attracts more hair, fur and dust than you Mac without the hard case. Not a huge problem though.2) Your mac will get slightly heavier even though the see thru looks like it's weightless. It's not.3) You can't tip your display as far back as you can without the hardcase. To me it's a little annoying when sitting with the mac in my lap where usually need to tweak the display all the way back to get the right viewing angle.

It is an exciting romp through history from an intriguing and new perspective. It may be the most definitive book on the evolution of the role of women in society. As someone who is both an artist and a PhD mathematician, the most meaningful aspect for me was insight into the evolving balance between left and right brain orientation in society and individuals. Current societal trends point to a more tolerant, creative, balanced, insightful, and workable future for us as individuals and as a world village through integrating the wholistic wisdom of intuition with analytical ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattering the Paradigm","review":"Whatever the value that can be associated with the work, one must ultimately agree that it destroys the static, unpredictive, and merely descriptive nature of history and sociology (as Noam Chomsky would say). Shlain completes an intricate, iron-clad web of cause and effect that at worst is compelling and insightful. The book sees past the sociological archetypes of religious and ethnic dynamics as the SOLE forces behind human development. However, the book is not simply reductionist, but instead, inclusive of many different human aspects tied together with the one skill that separates humans from the animal kingdom - communication (much more than the simple communication of: Watch out, predator! or I'm ready to concieve). In short, your mind will reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there no zero stars option?","review":"As a woman (who incidentally learned to read when I was two years old), I found this book to be apalling and insulting. What the book boils down to is that we'd be better off if we didn't read, but the evil patriarchy has imposed literacy on us so we need to know how to read, but reading is against the female nature so we're even worse off.Please don't waste your time and money on this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please seek elsewhere!","review":"Shlain's thesis is fascinating, but it is severely undermined by his extremely sloppy scholarship. Issues of relative importance of hunting & gathering, the global spread of agriculture, and most especially his near-total ignorance of current biblical scholarship (just for a few examples; I could make many more) make this book problematic at best. Also, it's a wise reader who is wary of a one-size-fits-all explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but. . .","review":"This sounded like a great theory. Literacy battles goddess worship throughout the centuries. There's lots of interesting historical info, especially on the conflict between religion as preached by its founders (Jesus and Muhammed, for example) and the brutalities inflicted by subsequent followers of the religion. But the author never connects his historical illustrations to his stated theory. Here's an example of his typical argument: the witchcraft persecutions peaked in the 15th century. The printing press was invented in the 15th century. Increased literacy therefore led to persecution of women. Right. The book never comes through with any real proofs. Right brain/left brain is old stuff and that's all he really ends up with. Summary: a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most thought provoking book I've read in 10 years!!!","review":"I heard Dr. Shlain on KPFA radio, and was so inspired I bought the book. The next 3 weeks of my life were lost in deep concentration as he traced the history of culture and religion. I was required to remember all the history I learned as a youth, and with that and an open mind, I viewed history with a new reference. I now understand why Waldorf teaches art before reading. The book is extremely thought provoking and I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt at science","review":"This book has an interesting thesis, unfortunately, it is riddled with inconsitancy and pseudo science. The first couple of chapters deal with the evolution of the human brain.

In a class with Sjoo and Moore, Eisler, and Merlin Stone, The Alphabet vs. the Goddess connects the dots and follows them into our collective future. The question of the past few decades \\"HOW did humankind transition from matrifocal culture to patriarchal, and why?\\" is answered brilliantly in this book (and finally, a much more plausible answer than just 'IndoEuropean Invaders'). I LOVED this book, it will go high on my list of titles to recommend. Even if you are immersed in academia, studying linguistics and philosophy (as I once was) don't worry about the negative review posted below -- take it as an indication of how revolutionary this work is.

Where are all the pre-literate societies which practice goddess worship and treat women fairly? The fact is that the inequitable treatment of women is just as much if not even more prevalent in pre-literate societies as it is in literate ones.Shlain is exploiting the naive and undeserved attention which so many people offer for no other reason than that the author has before his name those magic letters \\"Dr\\". He should reserve that title for his working life. If his ideas had been forced to stand up under their own strength then the precious resources of paper and ink which were wasted on this book might have been saved for a better purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Thesis Gone Wrong","review":"Dr. Shlain has an intriguing thesis. However, his attempts at supporting it go from somewhat plausible to rather ridiculous. His explanations of characteristcs of left and right brain were commendable, but I could hardly contain my annoyance when he began descriptions of how Christian religion proves his thesis. Dr. Shlain clearly does not understand Christianity, nor are his facts about the history of the Jewish people around the time of the Exodus accurate. This book is perhaps worth reading, and certainly its arguments are compelling, but the evidence does not come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shlain's theory is quite interesting, but a bit farfetched","review":"Shlain's book made for a good read, however it seemed hard to agree with what he was writing.

Should we go back to being an illiterate society so women can get higher status?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"This must be the worst book ever written. Not only is this book ridiculous in its purpose, but it is anti-Semitic and unfound in its conclusions. The author makes claims and assumptions that are not backed up by any evidence at all, and what is even worse than that, he makes what evidence he is using fit his claims by altering it to fit his purpose. This is a fine example of bad writing. It is academically unacceptable. I am amazed it was ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment","review":"I found Mr. Shlain's premise fascinating. Unfortunately, the book didn't carry through on the promise it made. It started off on the wrong foot by never actually giving any evidence that women are more right-brained than men. Some of the historical examples in the book were fascinating. Others were pure speculation, twisted to fit his thesis, or just plain factually wrong. He also fails to clearly define what types of proto-feminism he's looking for. As a result, there are confused and confusing examples where women are enshrined but not enriched or vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooey.","review":"Is this guy serious? What a crock.a.

Women may have been worshipped in those good old days, but they were hardly treated well -- sacrificing of virgins to the Euphrates every spring is not exactly something I'd like to go back to.Women -- learn math and science, get paid better! Now that's empowering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book for the sole reason that th author is based on a simple division of our brain as left/male hemsiphere and right/female one. It does have some fundament. But his theory looses its ground when we consider writing as art (thus both related to the right hemisphere and to women); and when we have major litterate civlizations such as minoans and elamites whose religion was exclusively of GODDESS worship. Thus goddess (woman-centered society), litteracy, art, civlization are all in the same basket and linked to each other --not separeted."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating read!","review":"a perspective-shifter that traces the evolution of human consciousness and invites you to re-evaluate the way you think, take notice of the forces that have helped shape the way you think. Every woman should read this, at the very least, but men should as well, because we all have a little of the divine feminine and masculine within us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I've ever stopped reading","review":"The theory was fascinating but the scholarship is atrocious. How anyone could give this four stars (without being paid) is beyond me.It did give me some intersting jumping-off points for my own theories but he cannot support any of his own. Most of what he purports is based upon the story of Moses AS THOUGH IT WERE HISTORICAL FACT! Come on! I have never written so many derrogatory remarks in the margin.I did like the brief history of human evloution and some of the origins of Judaism but that's about it.Don't buy this book for more than a few dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist beyond belief","review":"I've read some silly books in my time, but this has to be one of the silliest. Reading and writing, apparently are masculine activities, and somehow in opposition to feminine intuition etc. What a load of rot. How did a book as daft as this ever get published? It's a wonder the author doesn't recommend that wsomen shouldn't learn to read and write at all. How does the author explain the fact that women's status invariably rises in cultures where they do become literate. And how does he know reading and writing were masculine inventions anyway? This book really is pernicious. If you are gullible enough to believe all that stuff about women being intuitive, men being logical etc (i.e. women can only feel, not think) you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't this a picture book?","review":"I think this book would have been a lot more persuasive had he presented it as a series of images.

In my view, the circumstantial evidence marshalled in support of the author's thesis is remarkable and persuasive, even if causation is incapable of absolute proof. The depth,breadth, and clarity, as well as the erudite and delightful choice of words and phrases, makes it a \\"must read and continue to contemplate\\", irrespective of the ultimate validity of the underlying thesis. I'm part way though reading it again, and find it even more illuminating the second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I never read a book like this before! Although I knew that many cultures honored Goddess before they converted to God(Male) it never occurred to me what the circumstances might have been.

A major shift in the film's creative shift resulted in all but two of Sting's original songs being cut from the finished film.

So unless you are a really big fan of score music, I would not recommend spending money on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD based on original movie premise","review":"This CD is great, the Sting songs are, as to be expected, wonderful, especially the ones he sings. It is unfortunate though that this CD has very little in common with the movie as it was released. The movie was originally intended to be a serious drama, based on the \\"Prince and the Pauper\\" storyline, but it apparently didn't work, so Disney rushed to change it into a buddy-comedy. I guess the timeline to get the revised movie into theaters didn't allow for them to make significant changes to the soundtrack, because songs that support the original story (Disney was to call the movie \\"Empire of the Sun\\") still appear on the soundtrack, even though they have absolutely nothing to do with the movie as released.All that having been said, this is a truly enjoyable soundtrack/score combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Favorite","review":"I was really pleased to find this on CD. Charley Pride has a voice that is country, down-home. Certain songs that I haven't heard on other albums have become my favorites for instance, 'They Stood In Silent Prayer'.

It was good for about 6 months. It held all my books and papers. After 6 months things started to come apart. The pencil and pen holders had holes from the tips, the shoulder strap padding was flattened and was coming apart; it felt as if the whole bag changed shape. Only buy this if you cannot afford anything else. After a year it just was not usable anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"product seems cheaply made","review":"This is a very basic and not terribly well constructed bag. May be worth the $14.99, but $10 shipping? No way. My husband ordered this along with another product from Roni's Casual Wear. Informed later that second item no longer available, and credited.

Tooley affectionately refers to her alter ego, Lee Driver, as her dark side. Dark side certainly describes the evil that walks the streets of Cedar Points, and the imagination of the author who creates such horror. With a knack for the unusual, Driver again creates a masterpiece of the macabre and the fantastic in FULL MOON_BLOODY MOON. Her secondary characters are fully realized creations of originality reflecting the fantastic elements of the story. This skillful author continues to fulfill my exceptions for the unexpected, and I look forward to the next. As an aside, while I keep hoping Chase and Sara get together, the delightful dodging of the issue certainly helps to add tension to the novel.

But now even Ender's Game has been tainted in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but...","review":"Ben Goldberg is a helluva clarinetist and composer, John Schott is a skilled drummer, and (sorry!) I forget the guitarist's name. I no longer own this disc, which says something. It's dark, moody, rich, intelligent, and free, taking Goldberg ever further from the mainstreams of jazz and Jewish music. It is, however, simply NOWHERE NEAR AS ENGAGING as the New Klezmer Trio material, and I'd recommend MELT ZONK REWIRE or SHORT FOR SOMETHING long before recommending this. This IS a fine album, and Goldberg is someone well worth knowing, but come to it later, if you need MORE. Buy MELT ZONK REWIRE a.s.a.p., though, if you're interested in explorations at the juncture of klezmer and free jazz, of just love the clarinet in jazz contexts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"OCZ stands behind their products, so purchasing anything manufactured by them is a no-brainer.

The movie start's with a flashback when Kagome first came to the feudal era and it shows when Kagome broke the jewel shards into over 200 peices. The beaming light from the Jewel shards woke the insect demon Menomaru which is also the son of a very strong demon that Inuyasha's father killed 100 years ago. Now it is up to Inuyasha, Kagome, Miroku, Sango, and Shippo to stop him from ruling the world. You might notice that the artwork is a little different then the series but after you watch 5-10 minutes of it you'll forget all about it. This is a must see anime movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"InuYasha Movie 1 : Affections Touching Across Time","review":"If you are a InuYasha fan this movie is for you. Between Kagome and InuYasha's relationship growing, it has a couple good laughs in it. For a brief moment, InuYasha hugs Kagome!!!Yet, this would be a good movie to add to your collection along with the 2nd & 3rd movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inuyasha is great!","review":"This movie is very good! If you are looking for romance, hey you have picked the right anime! This movie shows many interactions betwenn Kagome and Inuyasha, it reveals their need for each other. The part where Inuyasha and Kagome splits up into different eras shows that nothing can surpass true love. The whole Inuyasha series has not let me down yet, and I have to say this movie is no exception! It is really great! Inuyasha is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the first","review":"Gotta say I have seen better. If you love InuYahsa as much as I do you will buy this no matter who says what. So put it in your cart and go! This movie involves an enemy defeated by Inuyasha's father long ago. Well there is more to it than that but I don't have all day. English version is good but subtitled is always better. Either option is available, my favourite is english 'cause who wants to pay that much attention to the screen? really no spacial features or anything like that so don't get your hopes up. I would say buy it if you want to start watching Inuyasha or if you are already hooked, like me. Stop being cheap dish out the cash and add it to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my item was in terrible condition","review":"I ordered a dvd and it arrived in terrible condition.

And you gotta like this one!Miroku: *to Inuyasha* We can't be too hard on him(Shippo), Inuyasha, he's just a little fella.*Miiroku grabs a wiener, but Shippo has it too*Miroku: Errrrgh...*Shippo makes big \\"Bambi eyes\\" and Miroku hands the wiener to him*Miroku: You got lucky on that one, Shippo.Happy Inuyasha-ing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it's weight in gold","review":"I recently got this movie, and I must say, it was worth every penny. The animation is beautiful, especially when compared to it's anime series counterpart. You can choose to watch the movie either in English or Japanese, with or without subtitles. There are character sketches, japanese movie trailers, and extras galore. You could spend well over an hour just on the extras.The movie itself is fairly good, with all the action and humor we've come to expect from InuYasha. There are a few tender moments, but not so much that it makes you sick. There isn't too much language, but more than most parents would want their younger children watching. Also, after the credits, there is a bonus scene that will have you rolling on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with everyone who gave this one star...","review":"InuYasha is stupid and childish, and it's TOO sappy (and yes, I'm a GIRL and I don't like sappy stuff...*gasp*!) with not enough of a good storyline. I WOULD NOT reccomend getting this movie, cuz your only wasting your money and your time. Try watching REAL anime, like FullMetal Alchemist, instead of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z and InuYasha. You'll thank yourself.To conclude, if I could give this a BOMB rating, I would, because there is absolutely nothing good in this good for nothing piece of trash they call a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"All BNO fans need this...","review":"This DVD was great, and quite long too!

Especially for the song 'Ding Dong Merrily on High' which is not on most of the other compilations. I've liked all his compilations so far, the British singers really have the best Christmas CDs I've ever heard, with lots of string arrangements and choirs in the background, this one is like that. Nothing on here is boring or cliche. Julie Andrews' Christmas CD's are the same way. This one is shorter than some of the other compilations but for the low price on it it's one of the best for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I was very sceptical at first, after reading all the reviews and seeing the screenshots. But the movie exceeded all the expectations and revealed a new dimension in the world of cinema. It is not a cilent movie, but only a few words are spoken, however the director and the actors managed to kept me mesmerized and captivated from the beginning till the very end. I only wish this movie were twice, no three times longer, and after it finished I kept reliving the episodes and the atmosphere for many hours and days.

The book title is completely misleading. I guess that the author, in 2002, had predicted a range trading market in coming years and so he wrote a book to backup and document his hypothesis to sell to his brokerage customers. I dont mind whether he made it right or wrong. However, I am very disappointed of how messy and disorganised his book is, that I really cant understand how he reached his conclusions with very brief coverage on Chaos Theory, Elliot Waves, Contrarian Indicators.....In short, I strongly recommend you to give it a pass not because of the outdated investment advice but the absence of applicable learnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reference Book In Conjunction With Astrology","review":"Had Gotten this Many Years Ago in conjunction with the 2000 Ephemeris Book and A Few Books That Explain The Intricracy of Astrology Reading[Natal Chart Interpretation].

Preston is a great player, but the compositions are rather empty. It seems that in most cases a catchy guitar riff generated the songs, not the desire to write a good song.

The sapphire is a little darker than I had hoped it would be, but that just makes it look even more like it could be real. The stone is quite large, making it a great cocktail ring, but a little too much for everyday wear.

I wear it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but wear with caution","review":"O.K. this is my second try doing the review for this item. When I bought this item in November the cost was only $9.99. It says Sterling Silver (I wear sterling silver jewelry all the time so I thought nothing of it) and began to wear it the day I got the ring in it's little white box. I took it off when I got home-before washing dishes, sleeping, showering etc. then wore it the following day to work. It turned my finger green after wearing it for only 4 hours. Someone told me to put clear nailpolish on it but why should I have to do that if it's genuine sterling silver like all my other rings that don't turn my finger green? It's pretty, thats for sure but I can't wear it too long due to the green factor. I wouldn't pay more than the $15 bucks (shipping and handling along with the price tag) I ended up paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading!","review":"The seller needs to include the dimensions of the ring. Because it's tilted you cannot tell what the size of the ring-- there must be different views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read!","review":"This book fills a gap that I've found in non-specialist writing on the Cultural Revolution era, and that is the impact of disrupted education on a young child's life. As I teacher, I can just imagine the horrible ostracism that he experienced. Most memoirs are written from an older person's perspective, while this one is written from a child's (even with it flaws, it's still very interesting...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful & Charming Story","review":"When I went to the library I came across this book and I looked at it and it looked very interesting. When I went home and read it I learned so much about things that we has american citizens were not even aware that existed. Da Chen and his family were put down because the were landlords. Da Chen was hated by everyone and barely was given the education he deserved. Da Chenin this story shows us that no matter how tough things are you can strive to do the impossible. I recomend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about how things were in Da Chens life in China. I can't wait until Da Chen writes more about his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me make a suggestion","review":"Before you order this book, please read \\"Wild Swans\\" by Jung Chang (and then cancel your order for the \\"Colors of the Mountain\\"). \\"Wild Swans\\" weaves the gripping story of three generations of Chinese women from the era of the warlord and concubine to modern China in such a smooth and stylish narrative the reader will have little use for the choppy and unpolished story. Nice dust jacket, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book. I'm not new to writings about China and the period following the Cultural Revolution, but was disappointed in this work. The author's observations seemed so self-serving and calculated to garner as much sympathy as possible...overkill, in other words. In fairness, I was moved by passages near the end describing the manner in which his family pulled together in their quest for higher education. At the very least, this book should make anyone thankful for all we have in the U.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"I have read many memoirs of the Cultural Revolution and was rather disappointed in this one. The author is certainly intelligent and well-educated; however, he is also arrogant and self-centered. Reading this book is not a useful way to learn about this troubled period in Chinese history. It seemed to me that the author's main goal was to entertain a Western audience. If so, he was successful. I question the veracity of much of his story. For a well-written, educational and accurate portrayal of this period, I recommend Liang Heng's \\"Son of the Revolution.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Coming of Age Story of a young man","review":"THis was an easy read with a great story. It was great to learn about the political culture in China and Da Chen's educational triumph.

To me it sounds like it was written by some \\"privileged\\" kid who woke up one morning and found himself on the other side of the fence! Yes there is a little color, and a bit of humor, but over all not much substance or compassion, especially when he talks about how he and other people treat animals. May I suggest \\"Waiting\\" by Ha Jin.

I found them incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't you just tired of these memoirs?","review":"First there was the Woman Warrior, then Life and Death in Shanghai, then Wild Swans, then, Falling Leaves, then... All books about one person's experience in China during (or around the time of) the Cultural Revolution. They are all worth telling I'm sure. But let's be honest, most of us want a good story, be transported to an exotic place, and experience things that would never happen to us. Where is James Clavell when we need him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the Arrogance!","review":"Don't buy this book if you're looking for a humourous, touching memoir like \\"Angela's Ashes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Story","review":"I am more than half way through this book and am enjoying it very much. It has shown me the strong love a family can express in nurturing a gifted child through a very difficult period of time. Da Chen was a delightful child. This is a book I wouldn't hesitate to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we have in common","review":"It is with humour and humanity that Da Chen paints a picture of life in post cultural revolutionary China. Da Chen shows more of what chinese and western societies have in common with class distinctions, common humour and what pereverence can accomplish. Although occasionally tedious this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colors of the Mountain","review":"Although I didn't know so much about the Cultural Revolution, I found this book to be riveting. It was one of those rare moments when I savor each chapter slowly instead of rip through a book. Da Chen writes beautifully, and captivates me with his eye for detail. Comparisons to Angela's Ashes are inevitable, but really now, these are two wholly different cultures, two entirely different settings, and two sets of experiences. Chen's memoirs transported me effectively into the Cultural Revolution and its profound effects. The book is but a sliver that gives its reader a little deeper insight into a horrible period of time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colors of the Mountains","review":"An interesting story of what life was like after Mao's introduction of the Communist Party to China, written by a young man full of spirit and will who was determined to succeed in the educational system which prevailed at the advent of Communism, in spite of all that he was up against. Enjoyable and well written. Never bitter about everything that happened to him, he took the lemons life handed him and made lemonade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming to understand","review":"As with many recent memoirs, \\"Colors of the Mountain\\" is a warm-hearted, plain spoken, attempt at understanding a childhood -- one more difficult than most of us can possibly imagine. A born artist, Da Chen seems to have spent most of his life in America determining how to come to grips with this impossible youth. Most reader criticisms have to do with the book's flawed factual details -- but what writer is going to remember the names of office-holders and bureaucrats from when he was nine years old? The more important point is that Da Chen made something out of this remarkably trying childhood and became a remarkable man and writer. That is why the book was written. I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had expected","review":"Colors of the Mountain was not as well-written as I would have liked it to be. Though it appeared to be a good book, it definitely was not a really memorable one or a great literary work. The author's words weren't very eloquent, as he often repeated the same adjectives, etc. Save your money. Somewhat educational about China during this time period, but other than that, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not light up","review":"The clock's purpose is wonderful, giving you three different pieces of information but it does not illuminate so you can't read any of it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay read, nothing special","review":"Save me from silly young heroines who don't know what they want. And for a man in his 30s - who's apparently been around the block enough - not to know what the woman in his bed wants is pathetic.But I liked the author's use of secondary characters and filling us in about their lives - hence the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if you're looking for E, G, Robinson","review":"I found this DVD on Amazon by searching for Edward G. Robinson. As you can see from the cover shot, he is pmominently displayed. Out of the 50 movies there is only one in which he is the star. Only one of Frank Sinatra as well. In fact only one each of anyone you are likely to have heard of before. If I slog through all 50 I will probably find more of Robinson as a 2nd banana or bit player.

This CD, along with the rest, just simply rips, roars, and romps through a variety of jazz standards (including \\"Airegin\\", \\"Avalon\\", \\"It Might As Well Be Spring\\", and, of course, \\"Flying Home\\") with ease, humor, and plain old swing. This is an \\"uncompromising, 'kicks' band\\", as plainly stated on the liner notes to the LP, by John Tynan - and man does it ever show! Do yourself a favor...pick up at least one of the five volumes out there and see for yourself what all my fussin' is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi classic LP in super CD transfer","review":"What a treat to hear Exploring the Unknown in this excellent CD import! In comparison to my well-worn RCA LP, the mid-Fifties monaural sound has been cleaned up immaculately. Paul Frees' narration is placed solidly over The Voices of Walter Schumann's spectacular performance of Leith Stevens' colorful and dramatic score. The rocket blastoff in the first track was used in the opening countdown of the OTR program X Minus One. Some highlights are the virtuoso choral ensemble work in The Comets and the sensuous soprano solo in The Heavens.

They sound a lot worse than stock speakers. I got these as cheap junk speakers to make a mobile unit ran off car batteries to take down the river...

Ferguson skillfully and playfully intertwines the dimentions in which her characters exist, and the more I read, the more I felt myself being transformed, permenately. The abstract ideas of multi-dimentional, simultaneous existance have become simple, understandable, and natural. This 'easy read' is fascinating, thought-provoking, and delightful. Ferguson's ability to show the simplicity of such a complex subject is sure to transform your life, in ways you can not yet imagine. Whether your interest is in history of humanity, the power of the woman, the power of the self, multi-dimentional existance, aliens, or your own 'spirit-guide', 'Inanna Returns' is fascinating wealth of information, sure to change your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Truely atrocious writing makes this book a chore to get through. I hoped Ferguson might give this ancient story some credible modern context, instead she gives us a bad soap opera. Individuals looking for someone or thing to blame for their problems will find that Ferguson has provided the ultimate excuse -- humans can't be better because our higher DNA functions have been turned off by Inanna and her family. But, don't wory, they're helping us fix that now.

The style is not so far removed from early Pharcyde, but with a slightly more gangsta emphasis in the lyrical content. The production is mostly raw and percussive with very cool samples (especially \\"Flippin' Off The Tip\\" which will have to go down as the best hip hop track ever to sample jimi hendrix, IMO), but what lets the album down slightly are the annoying skits in between most tracks which are about 1 minute long each, and sound like they were recorded on a dictaphone with loads of harsh distortion. they're just not nice to listen to. The tracks and emcees (there's about 5 or 6 different rappers) are all up to par...an album to pick up if you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor service and delayed communication","review":"We will never order from this company again.

These stories are tremendously well-written, and explore the beauty of life, and the very best and worst in human beings.

As I read somewhere, when the writer decides he's also going to be the lead actor, that's kind of sign the film may not be that great! I wonder if Corey Michael Eubanks also sold popcorn at the theaters during showings?This is pretty routine but it had a few intense action scenes, such as the beginning. How many people are escapees using a bus? And getting away! Come on!!!!After that interesting beginning, the film bogs down deeper and deeper and - snore - deeper, mainly because of the dumb romance angle with the typical no- brained, jealous, spoiled bully boyfriend.There are so many \\"Payback\\" movies, like Mel Gibson's, that surely you can find one a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prokoviev defined movie scoring","review":"This is by far one of the best film scores of all time, coupled with the amazing direction of Sergei Eisenstein it makes for an amazing film. Within this soundtrack you can actually feel the presence of the Teutonic knights marching across the frozen lake, the battle music is legendary. Prokoviev was one of the first film scorers, and largely wrote the book as far as technique. You can also hear clearly the influence that Prokoviev has over current film scorers, most notably Danny Elfmann. You can also clearly hear the amount of work that has been stolen by John Williams!Don't believe me? John Williams is one of the music world's greatest plagiarizers. Listen to the Star Wars music, then go out and listen to Holst's \\"Planets\\", especially \\"Mars\\".

Research","review":"If only the author had came clean and offered his book up as \\"possible\\" solutions or alternatives or opinions instead of trying to convince his readers that his \\"findings\\" were the results of forensic research data analysis or anthropological findings/discoveries untold for centuries. He plays on the minds of the gullible. For example, Jesus faked His death? Good one! Dogs ate His body? And did not leave any trace of their deed? I guess dogs were different back then. It was sad to read other reviews of readers who said they enjoyed the indepth analysis and pro and con discussion the author provided.

They talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about crap no soldier in his right mind would ever talk about.The acting was atrocious.A combat medic complaining about being a medic? I was a combat medic, and that just never happens.It had occasional good action scenes, but over all it was really a horrible film.Guys like Furie should leave the writing and making of modern war films to guys who have either actually served in that conflict or at least done some serious \\"real\\" research about soldiers and modern warfare and the conflict they are writing about.Man, I miss guys like John Ford."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic Ripoff of \\"Black Hawk Down\\"","review":"Right down to the wounded Tom Sizemore tough-guy sergeant character, the downed helicopter rescue mission, etc. Iraq instead of Mogadishu.

A character in a continuing series is interesting and believable only if allowed to mature and grow, i.e., learn from their experiences. Throughout the book V.I. reminds us her body is aging -- at least something is changing about her. I found the characterizations extreme and the plot predictable as well as melodramatic. Paretsky needs to choose another vehicle for a diatribe about prison issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I was alittle disappointed in this book. It seemed to drag on and on and the story was very preditable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Time","review":"I believe this was the first book with V.I.

Always really takes her jobs seriously and really is exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable","review":"Spoilers WithinA more appropriate title would have been \\"A Series of Improbable Events\\". The characters are interesting and the premise good and mysterious. But why did this \\"Security\\" pursue Warshawsky in the first place? They get a t-shirt from Frenada to put on the dead body of the escaped inmate - why not go to Wal-Mart? Warshawsky goes into the CEO's home computer - gets easily through the passwords and then sends incriminating emails - very baffling? The prison sequences are contrived and out of place. And why did the \\"Security\\" firm kill Frenada?None of this adds up - too bad because the writing and the characters are clear-cut and lucid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mystery book","review":"This is a readable, and standard book by Paretsky, which means that one is always interested in Warshawski and the things that she gets tinto and out of.

We all know she can and will do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Paretsky novel and probably my last.","review":"It took me a third of the book to figure out it wasn't going to get any better but by that point I had to hang in there to find out how it would end. But getting to the end was so boring and tedious. I guess I just don't \\"get\\" this V.I. character. I found her to be abrasive and with a huge chip on her shoulder. How does this girl manage to maintain any friendships? And she kept getting herself into absolutely ridiculous situations--does she have a brain in her head? I found the whole plot difficult to believe and boring to boot. I think V.I. needs a new line of work, not only for herself but also for her friends sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the mostly great VI series, this sticks out as a stinker","review":"Our heroine must be suffering from depression. Paretsky has replaced our witty fun detective with a morose whiny dud who takes herself way to seriously. Add to that a plot that is too hokey and characters that just aren't believable and you start to wonder if you're reading a VI book at all. I found the depiction of the womans prison painfully childish and the ending predictable and anticlimactic. I'd say borrow this book from the library if your a die hard fan and must read it but don't waste your money on buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reading but dubious issues","review":"I liked some things about this book, however I am astonished by liberal ideas that Paretsky tried to squeeze in. Why is being rich bad? Why should everyone help an illegal immigrant? Why should we support illegals? Half of prison contingent is illegal, so let them work, they came to this country, broke our laws, and why should they not be punished for it? How come good neighborhood and beautiful houses are shameful, but criminally entering this country and stealing from people are not shameful? I think that Paretsky has some perverted sense of justice. I did not like a lot in this book, and I think that maybe better editing was needed. This was not supposed to be a book with social doctrines and divide and split ideas. It was supposed to be easy mystery/detective story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one won't keep you up at night","review":"V.I. is hard to like.

There are nice moments, and the CD has a nice spare, quiet sound, but hardly ever gets beyond that, which is the big fault. Zorn's style doesn't lend itself to much development, and there is no solid focus at the core of the CD to maintain much interest through an hour or so of this short, whispy bits. The ultimate effect is one of boredom. Any other film music CD of his would be preferable and display the same style that is both over and underdone here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ratchets - rancid or clash?","review":"Glory Bound by the Ratchets is all heart and muscle. At the core of these rough songs are catchy pop gems. If you hunger for the sound of Black Market Clash era Clash or And Out Comes The Wolves era Rancid this is the album for you, but, the unavoidable comparisons aside, this album stands on its own as a tough, honest, and fiercely independent effort. Here's to hoping this is the beginning of a long career. My advice to all of you - if the brief review above piques your interest, buy this album. You won't be disappointed and you will be pumping your fist upon second listen. By the tenth listen, seven or eight of the songs will have had their turn as your favorite.

Played just like on tv, you try to match the prizes and reveal the board, once you have enough clues you try to solve the puzzle.You are given 60 rebus cards to play with. Their needs to be an two players or two teams, the odd player out becomes the Emcee for that game and he sets up the game board for play.Hopefully, Endless Games will create additional prize set and rebus cards.

It is difficult to take out the number card without accidentally pulling out the prize card underneath it. The only fun part about Concentration is, of course, trying to figure out the secret phrase. This would be a perfect computer game for the memory part of the game. I know I've seen in on a 512k version 10+ years ago, but I haven't seen a new computer version.

And then there's the infamous \\"Bad Hawkwind\\"-- 18 minutes of sampled and looped Eye screaming that seems kind of amusing at first but starts grating.Its not a bad album, but its not particularly good either-- if you're interested in exploring the partnership of these two, check out the live set thats part of the Zorn 50th birthday concert series."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUSION OF HIP HOP AND DANCE AT ITS BEST","review":"hausmarke and dj thomilla from the legendary german hip hop crew \\"die fantastischen vier\\" are really going new ways. after spinning together in many clubs in germany as the \\"turntablerocker\\" this is their first cd. and it REALLY ROCKS. fusion of HIP HOP and many different dance styles like funk, house, drum and bass,big beat, elektro and some latin. most of the tracks are just instrumental, and that's good like this, it's just the concept of those two geniuses, which goes way beyond hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"longevity","review":"As other reviewers have indicated, this album is a musical blend of hop hop, drum and bass, jazz, R&B and electro.

It runs an outdated version of Internet Explorer (version 3 or 4). The home screen feels old - the closest equivalent would be the original version of Prodigy back in the late '80's.More importantly, because it runs an antique version of Explorer AND has no memory, many web sites won't load or will be missing large chunks.

More recently the product has been re-branded as MSN TV. The only thing that has changed is the name on the box.

A lot of people have not even heard of it. But that doesn't change the fact that this movie is great. It's very well written, directed and acted. It is action packed right from the beginning.

Far too little literature on him remains in print and this is, by far, the best volume available. After a brief but effective biography (and a very helpful map tracking the journeys) the bulk of the text consists of Xavier's letters back to Ignatius and the Society of Jesus chronicling his 10 years in Portugal, India, Indonesia, Japan and China.

What a grim, grim movie. Everything so dark, all the people so depressing - even Meg Ryan. I was warned this movie would be choppy, but I had no idea you could get out of film school without knowing that there's a limit to choppiness. I did enjoy seeing Meg Ryan in the altogether - she's a very pretty woman - but they seem to have done their best to make her unattractive. No makeup - or the wrong makeup - and some pretty slutty clothes. Jumpy camera work - supposed to be cinema verite I suppose - made everything even more erratic.

The series of gruesome sex crimes felt degrading and exploitative without even creating that much suspense. Meg Ryan wasn't bad in the film and I don't blame her; I just couldn't relate to the fact that her sexually frustrated character kept making stupid choices.

But it's very well done, even the lesser parts.What's the saying? \\"Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.\\"?And the casting is marvelous.

More bodies appear and Frannie has reason to be suspicious that the cop she is attracted to is the killer.In the Cut is a dull movie. The mystery of the killer's identity is spread out so thinly over the whole movie, there is no suspense when you figure out who it is. The sex scenes between Ryan and Ruffalo are gloomy and forced. I didn't believe the supposed attraction between the two. There are a lot of arty set pieces in the film to try and trick you into thinking there is some important subtext here, but there isn't. It's just a boring, poorly-made movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh look there's a stain on the wall - better clean it","review":"This is pretty terrible as Hollywood films go.

Cardboard cut outs would have acted better than this. And as the plot plods along you can't help but think when the hell does this endThe only person I really feel sorry for is Kevin Bacon. The guy is woefully underused as Meg Ryan's \\"intense\\" ex boyfriend. He gives the film a brief glimmer of hope but is then gone for almost the rest of the entire film.Save your money on something better unless you like seeing Meg Ryan have sex in a movie.....but even then that's much of a highlight when the film is as boring as can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Film in Years!!!!","review":"If I could give this film zero stars, I would do it without hesitation.\\"In the Cut\\" is unoriginal, unintelligent, and disgusting.In a quest to prove that she is more than just America's sweetheart, Meg Ryan fails miserably as Frannie, a character that you just care nothing about.The usually terrific Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Jason Leigh are suprisingly limp as Frannie's cop boyfriend and beloved sister, respectively.How could Jane Campion, who brought us such masterpieces as \\"The Piano\\", \\"An Angel at my Table\\", and \\"Holy Smoke\\", make such a steaming piece of crap?[...]Stay away at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!

I read where she wanted to get away from her \\"america's sweetheart\\" image. But my advice to her is to go back where she started. She looked like a washed-out has-been in this movie, and I always thought she was kind of cute. I'm not sure what's happening to hollywood, but I'm to the point where I look for the older video to watch any more. As for this movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. I'd give it a zero rating if that were possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly Bad","review":"I guess this is supposed to be an erotic thriller. Meg Ryan has some fairly intense lovemaking scenes and appears nude, so maybe the term \\"erotic\\" fits. There's not a single thrill in this movie, however. The characters are flat, undeveloped, lifeless, uninteresting and not particularly likeable. The story is laughable -- disjointed, dull, uninteresting ... You get the picture. How this \\"story\\" ever made it to the screen is beyond belief, but I guess it should encourage anyone interested in being a screenwriter -- if this sold, anything will sell.

Jennifer Jason Leigh (whom I loved in The Hitcher and Single White Female) does herself no favours by saying yes to this role. Meg Ryan acts very well. If you're a fan then this movie is good.

Meg Ryan is a greet actress but she is totally wasted in this film and Mark Ruffalo is totally miscast as her detective lover whom she suspect is responsible for a series of violent crimes. The logic in this film is almost none existent with Meg's character literally falling for a man who she considers dangerous. Jane Campion is a fine director but this is with a doubt one of her worse film and I hope she will be able to live it down. I do love Meg as an actress but she better start looking for better material than this because she is much better than this film that is a real drag to get from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This movie is nothing more than a glamorised porno (and not even a hot porno).

It's a murder mystery in which the film's protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is. But, she has her doubts. But she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy's arm. He has the same thing. But what does she do? She has sex with him. Sex, sex, and more sex. If you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him? Plus, 50% of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk. I don't think this was a perfectly planned movie, to tell you the truth.Final Verdict: It's easily forgetable and needs to go right before it starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but falls short","review":"This movie has a dark, seething style and seems to be going somewhere or saying something, but devolves into a standard direct-to-late-night-HBO slasher movie ending.

My jaw dropped when I saw this movie.I believe that one should be atleast be 21 before endulging one self into this poor excuse for a movie. All this is a sex show.

Coming from me, that is a huge statement. CUT stars rising star, Mark Ruffalo.And he shows all that he can show and so does Meg Ryan. Filled with GRAPHIC and TASTELESS sex scenes, this \\"thriller\\" or what ever this was intended to partray, I really couldn't tell given that this was basically one of those adult movies and given that this movie had NO plot what-so-ever.

She's a lonely woman, who has a hard time finding a satisfactory relationship with a man. She goes through a series of encounters. Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as her half-sister; who tragically gets killed. Not a bad movie and Ryan does a little bit of revealing skin in the movie. Better than I expected, from her; given her previous movies, which are mostly (as previously stated) comedies, where she plays \\"cutesy\\". Her relationship with the one detective is also interesting; as she suspects he's the one who is about to kill her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I'm surprised at Meg Ryan for making this movie.

I'd recommend checking out something uplifting instead. 'Invincible' by Werner Herzog comes to mind - that is very good.And furthermore, isn't it pretty stupid that the villain turns out to have a cop investigating his crimes. If there is any plausibility in this it is never brought to the surface. (There is no plausibility - just a bad storyline.) Also, how stupid of the villain to go after his cop buddy's g/f and her sister. Talk about wanting to get caught.

Undermining the raunchyness and all the (...) scenes is a fairly boring and uninterersting crime story that literally goes nowhere. I was hoping for a better ending that would've brought meaning to the 60 minutes of scenes that bored me to death. Sure, there would be a a hot scene or two, somebody would get mangeled and then it repeated that for 45 minutes. By the time the 3rd or 4th victim was killed, I really could've cared less about the story of desire and obsession between Frannie and the detective. I just wanted to know what the movie was getting at as far as the killer goes so that the movie would end and I could get on with my life.

There is no possible way I could recommend this film to anyone unless they had trouble sleeping.At the start of the film there were 15 people in the cinema, when I walked out after around an hour there was only one person left, she followed me out straight away (apparently I woke her up!!)I realise that some people may be tempted to see if it is really that bad, it really isn't worth it.In case you havn't realised by now what I'm saying: DO NOT GO AND WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON GOING TO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pure dribble,meg ryan must be hard up","review":"There was a lot of hype about nudity and porn factor in this movie. This was the biggest bunch of dribble I have ever seen. It was filmed completely in the dark, made no sense, The audio was terrible, sounded like everybody was mumbling, and then they would try to break your eardrums with a racing engine. I guess it was to wakeup all the sleeping viewers. If meg ryan needs money this bad, she needs another profession. To see meg ryan nude simply go to google.com image search,type in meg ryan and pictures will pop, one will be naked meg ryan. I'm glad I rented this junk I would hate to have payed good money.

Not even with the same stylish visual rubric that \\"The Piano\\" was wrapped in (same director.)Sadly, helped by an unremittingly cheerless script, this urban-noir tale suffocates under the weight of its own self-importance. Sleaze does not make substance, and outright lewd banality cannot be shrugged off under pretense of faux weightiness -- the obvious poverty of this script is still evident through the liberal dose of raunchy sex scenes and pretentious dialogue.May be a worthwhile rental, but I wouldn't cancel any plans for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If she only had a brain","review":"Jane Campion continues her brainless quasi-feminist propaganda that like most feminist thinking makes no sense at all. You've seen it all before folks, including an adaptation of \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" so poisoned by her contempt for men that it makes a nonsense of the women in the story - including the heroine - who like them. And who could forget the complete mess that is \\"Holy Smoke\\"? Even \\"The Piano\\" was victim feminism 101.When Campion stops making men into nazis from some old war movie she'll make a good movie. She writes like a martian who has never met a human in its life. Forget it!This thriller is entirely unbelievable, and flawed by having no connection with any possible reality whatsoever, except for those who share her prejudices. A total mess. And ugly looking too."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Perils of Pauline, more Campion Camp","review":"A female director (Campion) and 2 female producers (Parker and Kidman) give us a frank look at some kind of unreal female version of a male fantasy of a sexy slasher movie, whatever that is. Trash talkin'. Plot telegraphin' from the first 10 minutes. You know what the twists will be. Our Pauline just isn't interesting enough. Bad. Baaaaaaad. Desperately seeking sexy without actually being appealing. What were they thinking, if anything?The Piano, at least, had some quirkiness.Yeah, dumb is a good tag for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $3.85 back","review":"I think what they were trying to do in this picture is show what a great film noir they could make now that they are so free -- free from all those restrictions of the studio system respecting dialogue, free from conventional ways of \\"seeing,\\" free from the need to disguise various flavors of sexuality. But in filmmaking, freedom isn't enough. You also need to have some talent, and there is more narcissism than talent on display here. Arty photography, heaving sex scenes, and dialog that tries to be hip aren't enough to dress up the predictable \\"will he kiss me or will he kill me\\" plot. The film is bad enough, but more atrocious is the sheer arrogance of what the filmmakers must have been thinking when they made it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Mystery & Thriller","review":"Save yourself a couple of hours time and 20 bucks. I like thrillers and mysteries a lot, but this one is over the limit. The movie kept dragging and dragging without a meaning.In the first half an hour of the movie, Meg knows about the killer. Strangely though when she discloses it to the detective, all he got to say is \\"Come down to downtown\\". That is after a couple of murders and the murder suspect (according to Meg) shares something with the detective. Tell me about loop holes.Probably the writer, producer and director thought that a murder mystery with cheap and abundant sex will make this a blockbuster. Well, they were wrong.Bottomline: Save yourself the pain and humiliation and go see some other movie.

This is the only good thing about the movie.The plot, such as it is revolves around the romanticentanglement of Meg Ryan's character Frannie Avereyand Mark Ruffalo's Detective Malloy. Unfortunatelythere is no chemistry between them at all. Meg Ryan comesoff as a very confused and disturbed person who surroundsherself with unappealing people. Into this mix is a grisleymurder, which Malloy investigates. Unfortunately, again,the plot makes no sense what so ever.

Those two hours, I might add, seemedmuch longer.So, save yourself the pain: stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"Oh dear, oh dear. I must say I've never warmed to Jane Campion. \\"The Piano\\" was pretty itself, but very much a woman's film, containing men that I'm sure no male viewers could actually relate to. And \\"Holy Smoke\\"? All one can really say about that is what a shame for Harvey Keitel to get involved in such a mess. Other female directors seem able to put convincing men on screen. It's always puzzled me that Campion cannot.This is another mess. One that like certain European films (Catherine Breillat's \\"Romance\\") tries to sell entirely on the basis of raunchy sex but actually claims to have more going for it.It's an awful ugly grainy looking mess, and although I fervently believe Ryan is a much more tough lady than she ever admits to being on screen, I didn't buy the too self-conscious image change. I'm sorry but I don't recognise any real human beings in this and thought it an unmitigated disaster,"},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as A.I.","review":"This was the second worst movie next to AI that I have ever paid money to see. People in the theater booed when it was over. The cinematography reminded me of a college film class with moving cameras and artistic shots.

In the version I saw it was extremely explicit but very sensual and these scenes helped create the plot and atmosphere. I was SOOOO disappointed with this R rated version - it was cut to ribbons and if you blinked you'd miss an essential plot point - it wasn't even worth giving to my friend as it is a travesty of the film I saw.Perhaps I should have had the Director's Cut - but not being familiar with the differences, I assumed an R was what I had seen - if this is an R I can't help but wonder what the non R is like and how little it could offer in terms of nuance and atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"This film reeks of 'trying too hard.' From too many random, disconnected shots (woman in wedding dress in subway, flags, pouring sugar on the table in the diner etc) to heavy-handed plot development (ramming red herrings down our throats) this film just doesn't work...on any level.

You could just read the chapter titles and you would get about the same amount of information as reading the chapters themselves.

The writing is so clunky and overbearing and preachy, and the scenes were stitched together is such an amateurish way--I could barely finish watching this movie. It felt so incredibly dated. There were a couple of things that really stuck out (in a bad way) for me. 1) Mickey Rourke is way too young for the role--and having that fake grey hair dye job only made him look ridiculous. 2) The woman (Ariane) who played the reporter, was absolutely horrible. It's obvious that she's a model and not an actor. Oh--actually there is one more thing about this movie that really grated on me. The film score was awful--it stuck out like a sore thumb. There's nothing worse that having music that just doesn't fit the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year of the Dragon","review":"I want see Mickey Rourke in his films these he had played.I met only his cine \\"Nine half weeks.\\"He is a famous actor.

The first time I was impressed, but only recently realized I had only seen the last third of the movie. After viewing it on cable recently I cannot believe I ever liked it in the first place. Two problems are: the editing is atrocious, Cimino cuts from one scene to another too abrubtly and the chemistry between Rourke and the tv journalist is non-existant. Also the ending left me shaking my head, and the plot was a bit hard to follow. Finally, Cimino relies too much on gentle guitar music, like he did succesfully in \\"The Deer Hunter\\" Beleive me there are no tender moments in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever happened to Ariane?","review":"Anyone know? By the way this disc is worth picking up just for the commentary by Michael Cimino...I always thought he was semi-reclusive, so it's pretty entertaining to listen to him ramble on in a pretty stream of consciousness kind of way...As for the movie, I'd say it's pretty harsh, and probably politically incorrect, but I still find it damn entertaining, and it's nice to finally have it in widescreen with remastered sound. It's well worth the price and very underrated. After Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, this is my favorite Cimino film, and it's very re-watchable....which I think is essential to owning DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Intelligent Action Film!","review":"This film is so good and Mickey Rourke is so amazing that I could almost cry! Back in the Eighties, Rourke was an artist who cared about his roles and delivered performances only artists like Daniel Day-Lewis can do nowadays (anyone can be an actor, but few are artists!). The film operates on several levels: it's an action film, it's a film about race relations, it's about trust, it's about betrayal. In other words, Year of the Dragon - like Heaven's Gate and The Deer Hunter - are true works of art! Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I bother?","review":"I read the book by Daley and enjoyed it quite a lot.I could only get through the first fifteen minutes of this movie before having to turn it off.

I found this movie unpleasant to say the least. Though it had some interesting ideas, there was not a single appealing character in the film. While some might call this \\"realism,\\" to me this was just poor scripting. I've seen films that made unpleasant people who are still appealing characters (such as the Usual Suspects or Resevoir Dogs) but this movie couldn't even make a \\"tough policeman\\" type appealing. I cannot deny that the up-in-arms attitude of many Asian American groups towards this film are uncalled for, but at the same time I found it self indulgent, dull, and, as my title says, highly unappealing. Though I'm apparently in the minority in this view (judging by the other customer reviews) I feel obliged to make it known, and to mention that everyone who I watched this with agreed with me. I guess I'm trying to say that this movie isn't for every one. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"TYPE OF ACTION/DRAMA THEY DON'T MAKE ANYMORE!","review":"A newly appointed NYC police captain, Rourke, has decided to go after the chinese mob all by himself.

Most of the other songs in the film are fairly unmemborable. I wish they had released the whole score."},{"rating":"2","title":"updated with 30 songs","review":"I had searched forever for this CD for my oldest son who is a huge Goonies fan.

To me the film score is what gives the film its soul, its personality. I hate when I have gone to see a movie and just absolutely fallen in love with the score, then go to buy the soundtrack only to find out that it is a blasted soundtrack album of pop songs that weren't even in the movie to begin with!!!

It sounds like a dull and uninspired generic Iggy Pop solo record..\\"My idea of fun..Is killing everone\\" Just to let everyone know I am a huge Stooges fan and own the original presses of the first three albums and the remastered and remixed versions and a lot of bootleg stuff. I would say listen to it before you buy or else you're just gonna be trading it in. It pains me to write this when I heard the Stooges were making a new album I was ecstatic but now i'm just thinking of what could have been if drugs didn't ruin the first two incarnations of the band.

Second, this album is incredibly bad and I don't mean bad as in good. It's awful. Iggy's lyrics will make you cringe. The words he has chosen to rhyme are elementary level and embarassingly bad. I'd expect this kind of song writing on a demo CD of a really crappy bar band. The type of bar band that think they're going somewhere but don't realize they don't stand a chance.The music - nothing really stands out to me. A number of songs start exactly the same, most of it sounds like any studio for-hire rocker guys could have churned out.This CD is a piece of s**t and it's going straight to the second hand shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"FWD","review":"Its great that Iggy reunited with the Stooges but this CD is not so great. The songs just arent that good. There is no urgency, no passion in the singing. There arent many good hooks or melodies. The guitars arent very buzzkill and the lyrics are trite. The only decent song is \\"My Idea of fun\\". Unless you get the Japanese Import which has \\"O Solo Mio\\" which is a damn good song. Why that was left off the US version is a real tragedy!! My advice is, use the Weirdness as a coaster or frisbee and then buy Beat Em Up, Raw Power (Iggy mix) and Funhouse and crank those up instead.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme Boredom!","review":"First I gotta say that I love Iggy and have enjoyed most all his solo work-post Stooges. The best and most brutal recent solo effort Beat EmUp kills both this and the Somewhat less offensive Skull Ring. I dont believe It has anything to do w/ Iggys age so lets just dispense w/ thatgibberish! The music on this disc has no hooks whatsoever. Maybe repeated listening will make me enjoy it more but right now I am not sure its gonna get that chance. I tuned into an A&E; special on skinheads and it reminded me of the music represented here (without the lyrically racist angle).Sadly, without that message you get nothing as is the case here.It sounds mostly like a contractual obligation that they were forced into doing and Iggy is giving them what they deserve S**t! To even mention the brilliant NY Dolls comeback disc in conjunction w/ this should be a crime !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best they could do?","review":"Jesus, I love the Stooges and I love Iggy. I even listen to some of Iggy's weaker stuff because he does try new things but this album is a real cop-out. Nothing new, just a tired rehash of a sound that's a pale imitation of their first two albums. None of the songs truly rock and Iggy's voice is just plain bad on this. Where's the Down on the Street? Raw Power? Not one of those caliber songs on this album. You can see it on the reviews on this board--everyone's making excuses. I wanted to like it too but they simply didn't deliver. I'm going to see them next month and hope they don't focus on this poor material."},{"rating":"2","title":"More in the red, please","review":"Great record, but does anyone else notice that the vocal track is a little low in the mix?"},{"rating":"1","title":"i cant believe the stooges did this crap wish it never came out","review":"they should of never got back together to do a studio album this sounds nothinglike the old stooges its complete crap but iggy is the man i would of thoughhe would never be dumb enough to put this out i guess just old age getting to himi still love iggy and the stooges are one of my favorite bands but i just cant believe they put this out i wish it never came out"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not raw power or fun house","review":"Well I have to say after listening to this album I'm so glad i didn't plop down my money for it. The Stooges are great but this album is not. Stick to the old stuff and maybe their next one (if there is one) will grasp the true essence of what the Stooges and Iggy are all about. If you are a die hard fan and want to listen to anything they put out then you won't be let down. But for the rest of you put in Fun House and drift away to Loose, 1970 or any of the other awesome tracks on the LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be swayed by the true believers","review":"I could go on endlessly about why this effort has no merit, but I'll let other reviewers here do it for me. On the other side, their are a fair number of reviewers who claim \\"credibility\\" by saying that they come from Detroit and wax ad nauseum as to why this is such a great return of the fabled Stooges...\\"you had to be there\\" and that sort of nonsense. Let me just say that I'm 56 years old, grew up in Detroit and Warren, saw their first concert at the Grande and witnessed them (and the solo Ig) innumerable times over the years. They we're indeed a mesmerizing force at the time and, the truth be told, changed the musical landscape. Unfortunately, you would never know it by listening to this uninspired drivel. I give it two stars out of misplaced respect and the fact that two songs on the CD are OK (\\"My idea of fun\\" and \\"The weirdness\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very brainy! Would read again!

But before he can, the Beastie gets off the paper and runs away! This is the exceptionally well-written lead from the book, \\"The Night the Scary Beasties Popped out of my Head.\\" The book uses sloppy, but pleasing-to-the-eye pictures drawn by seven-year-old Dan Kamish. Dan's father, Dave Kamish, textures and colors his sons illustrations. While there isn't really a very sophisticated plot, the pictures and funny vocabulary that the Kamish family uses makes you want to keep reading.

It brings to mind the pathos always associated with Billie Holliday. Be that as it may, this album is better than any of the other Etta Jones album released in recent years. Her sense of swing and style has never left her, and her vocals are clear and strong. Her voice has shown the effects of her 70+ years, but especially in a tribute to Billie, this is not only fitting, but almost eerie. Only on one track is there a direct imitation of Lady Day (Fine and Mellow), and it seems as if Etta is channeling her. \\"All of Me\\", \\"God Bless the Child\\", and \\"Them There Eyes\\", are the highlights of this great album.

I researched other home cutters including Remington and Conair and most people complained about those cutters pulling the hair. I am happy to report that this cutter cuts very smoothly without any hair being pulled. The 2nd nice thing is that the motor is pretty quiet; certainly not silent, but pretty quiet.

Therefore, I would recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price!","review":"Can't go wrong!

One reads so many books which describe things in the cards which one cannot see so easily in the Rider-Waite. When I got the deck and went through it, I could see those things - like the river in the Emperor card and the Death card. You can see the water body more clearly in the High Priestess.What I did not like, however, was the fact that the expressions on the faces of the court cards were changed!

I went by their name only, and so was disappointed. This should teach me to read the fine print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"As other reviewers have said, the coloring on these cards is excellent. I found the original Rider-Waite deck to be garish and distracting; this is much better. The finish is very slick.The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, written by Arthur Waite, is included in this set (or can be purchased separately). It was written around 1910, and the first 70 pages are almost impenetrable unless you know something about the Order of the Golden Dawn and Waite's background. Skip that part and just read his description of the cards. You will find that many other authors have simply re-summarized Waite's original descriptions.This book (and some version of the Rider-Waite deck) belong in every tarot library. But this book is perhaps not the easiest place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal Waite Tarot Deck and Book Set","review":"This Tarot Deck and book are a standard the world over.

Now gently push outward and around with your pointed device until you have an inch wide hole. Pour a quarter cup of MolePatrol into this hole. Cover back up the dirt. Repeat with other mounds.On a dirt patch, one where the moles frequent, place a two foot or larger square board flat on the ground. Make sure it's over known mole territory. If you can, dig down a bit so that you know that moles will tunnel beneath it. Leave it there for a few days. Then lift it up and see if you have tunnels beneath it. Pour a quarter to half cup of MolePatrol in these tunnels and replace the board. Check weekly under the board to see if the bait has been eaten. Replenish if necessary. This is much easier than diggin' holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear as mud...","review":"Many of the songs on this release sound like alternates to the versions that became popular.Sound quality on most,if not all, songs is terrible,very muddy and muffled.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great science series","review":"Grandchildren (7 and 5 years old) love to see the bus transform itself into different vehicles to handle whatever conditions come up.

While some purists may scoff at this the linear notes do a good job of providing musical justification for this act.Trying to make a brass instrument sound like a woodwind is no small task but Andre blends perfectly.

I just simply didn't care about any of these people. I made it through 3/4 of the book and was so disappointed. The story dragged. I found the whole premise preposterous. And Alice was not a sympathetic character. I kept picturing Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis as the aging comedians and Alice as some ditzy English floozy from a bad sit-com. Perhaps I just didn't care for all the English sayings, \\"I fancied him, she fancied him\\"...\\"And Bob's Your Uncle, there it was\\".I don't recommend this book or the author for anyone who likes their mysteries and thrillers fast-paced or interesting.

It appears that the person lieing most to Alicia is Alicia herself. The book begins at a point at which it appears Alicia has put some serious trauma behind her and attained a degree of emotional maturity. Wrong! It quickly disintegrates from there. And the reasoning for her continuing to stay in a situation of spiraling peril -- she can't leave her animals -- tries my patience. Just go to the police, bring them back with you, and voila!

The movie was incredibly powerful. I enjoy Rage Against the Machine in modest doses. This single is a little less intelligible than some of their other songs. It's a reminder, though, a prophetic call to evaluate the structural injustices of our society. It's a lament and a call to arms.In my heart of hearts I secretly wish for George W. Bush to be impeached, convicted, and sentenced to listen to this during all his waking hours. But if he hasn't completely dismantled the constitution, he'll be protected from this \\"re-education\\" because his lawyers will plead that it's cruel and unusual punishment.Avoid this if you don't like Rage against the Machine.

A few tracks are rough around the edges, but when that is not working in any piece's favor, the seemingly unlimited wealth of talented players always working with our warped maestro still usually demands attention. Even if we are listening to a tired blues theme or a standard jazz progression, the variations on these themes remain interesting for the most part still to this day. Hitting a masterful stride with the horn-heavy third act, Zorn proves once again why he is one of the most versatile, edgy, and equipped composers working today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Totally Wrong","review":"The quality is great but I gave them a low rating because of the deceiving fit.I've purchased Mootsie Tootsie shoes many times and have worn a size 8-1/2 for 35 years.

The book is populated with real people, driven by drama, and adorned with the occasional inspired phrase or image (I especially liked the prologue's reference to \\"the kind of factory-farm operation that could still squeeze a profit out of teats\\").As a pastor, I was also grateful for Glass's portrayal of spiritual work in the story; I read repeatedly the characterization in chapter seventeen: \\"Spiritual work was frustrating. No way to measure whether or not you were doing any real good....Maybe the only time he accomplished anything was when people's lives began to fall apart\\" (p. 161). Such hardscrabble realism shows the insight and honesty of the author and the depth and breadth of the characters.The story of truck driver Ross Martin is an American story, and a universal one. It is worth buying, worth reading, and worth learning from...especially if the success of this novel encourages the author to keep writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and captivating.","review":"This book has all that could be desired for the lover of suspense, good family values and anyone who has ever overcomefeelings of guilt and shame.

My own 'Bold in Her Breeches: Women Pirates across the ages' didn't really tackle the politics enough, I now feel. What it did do was give women histories a context, calmly.Unfortunately Klansman's book comes across as heated. It needed to be coherent and focused. And it is, in a way, a product of 1970s feminism. But there are some great ideas in there struggling to come out. I'd like to see a rewrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best investment you'll ever make for your body (and wallet/home!)","review":"These adjustable weights give you 90lbs of resistance, which is really great and suitable for all but pro body-builders.

Not only do you save a TREMENDOUS amount of space in your home, but it also allows for a new kind of resistance (you can adjust the weight on either side of the dumbbell.NOTE: You will NOT throw these things around like your standard dumbbell. There's a locking mechanism that will break if you do so, which means the dumbbell itself is broken. Also, the workout DVD that comes with it is also PRIMO EXCELLENT!!

I don't find them to be too bulky like other reviews stated. Standard 90 lb dumbbells are bulky as well. I already had them set over 55, which is why I went with the larger capacity dumbbells.

I have only been using them for a month so I can't comment on long term duribility."},{"rating":"2","title":"great space saver","review":"Although a little bulky to lift with, these weights are a great space saver. 90 lbs is all the weight you need unless you're on steroids.

On the pricey side, but pays for its self in a couple of years without paying for a gym membership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Love these things. I took so long to make the decision to buy and wish I hadn't waited and have no regrets at all buying these 1090's. Don't delay its worth every penny. Great use, sturdy strong compact for the weight and one size fits all without the cheesy-ness of the others! Solid as heck! No clanking, no shifting, no insert this here and take out that there. Turn the dial and go, it IS just that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving up from the 552s","review":"I owned the 552s for about a year and outgrew them (excellent DBs, by the way), so I decided to move up to the 1090s. They are obviously bigger due to the 40lb difference, but surprisingly, they are not that much longer. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the length of these dumbbells do alter some of your exercises, but if you're one of those upgrading from the 552s, there is no new learning curve, I guess. The only complaint I have are the rectangular handles as they could become very uncomfortable when dialed into the larger weights. Minus one star. I bought some athletic tape and wrapped the heck out of it. Problem solved.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. I recommend purchasing the dumbbell stand for these. It would be a pain to pick these up from the ground. Happy workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect!","review":"I've owned the SelecTech 552's for several years and I love them, but I was starting to outgrow them and wanted a bit more weight. I purchased a set of the 1090's and they're great. My only gripe about them is that the handles aren't as comfortable as the 552's, but I just wear workout gloves now and that has mostly remedied the issue. I would highly recommend either the 552's or the 1090's for anyone who wants a well made and versatile adjustable dumbbell set.

Great for small workout spaces (i.e. dorm, bedroom, office). Really good for bust-em-out programs like P90X where quick weight changes are required. Only problem occurs when range of motion is limited due to the width of the dumbbell (about 18\\"). This problem rarely occurs (only two exercises in P90X are affected as far as I am concerned). I must follow up by saying that the benefits of having so many choices in one dumbbell far outweigh the costs. Also, you really need two of these to appreciate the effectiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as you can get for 90lbs","review":"Very solid and well engineered product... Here are a few points:* The handles have a bit of a rough grip. When you are using the dumbbells at their max weight it can tear your palms up a little.* I don't recommend getting the stand for the 1090's. The heavy weight makes it awkward to maneuver at that height.* I purchased the Weider Club bench (about $100) to go with it and it works great!* I've searched all over and this is the absolute best price I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, just one flaw.","review":"First let me say that these dumbbells are great. They offer a very wide range of weights with quick adjustment and very small square footage.The major downside is the grip. It is said by numerous people how the grips dig into the hand with the knurrling. That is very true, gloves are almost required when dealing with heavier weight. I am sure you could add tape to the handle and fix this issue. I am more surprised that they went away from the 552 grips, which were rubberized.Other than the grips, these dumbbells offer everything I need to be able to leave my current gym. I would highly recommend these regardless of the grips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta get these!","review":"This product is amazing. These work perfectly with p90x as you have to change weights constantly. They also take up very little space. They do everything they say that they will do!Thus far I've had zero problems out of them and I use them 5-6x's per week and I've owned them since July. The ONLY THING I SUGGEST is.......bat tape! The handles are very tough and not user friendly. I bought some easton bat tape and wrapped the handles and now it's perfect.Another FYI...these are not as durable as traditional weights. You can't throw them down like like you would other weights. They are not designed for that. They are designed to be used and then put back into their base....Well worth their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get present for gym rats","review":"So my fiance is all about the gym but that doesn't always work with his schedule. These are a great space saver, and they are pretty much a full set of dumbbells. My fiance loves them and they are a great purchase and a solid product. The only reason why I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars was because like other users, one the weights slipped off and jacked up his toes. :/ other than that they're great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I bought the bowflex 1090 dumbbells to use with P90X. They are perfect for any home gym. They are compact but longer than normal dumbbells, you get used to them. Had to wrap athletic tape around the handles because they tear your hands up.

The weights have been re engineered, but the stand is exactly the same including the straps. On the originals, the strap lay perfectly flush with the base while sitting on the stand. The stand on the new model is a bit more squared and raised. They did not however redesign the straps to fit.When I called Bowflex and warned them that this is a recipe for injury and the ensuing lawsuits, they simply said they knew what I was referring to and have not had any complaints. They also said they had no reason to change it unless more people were to complain or injure themselves. I told her it was a backward way of doing business.

The title gave away too much, if I had not read the title the book would have been more exciting and it would have been more fun to read it. Personally I do not enjoy books that are predictable and boring, but I would recommend it to someone who was square and enjoyed reading something unentertaining (that's just my opinion). It was also kind of weird like with the whole bathroom stall thing and stuff. It was interesting to read about their very messed up situation but all in all it was kind of deranged and freaky and something I don't like to read about in my free time. I had to read it for an assignment and I probably would have stopped reading it after like the first chapter if I had a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Clue!","review":"I am appalled!This book not only disurbed me but made me sad and angry as well.

The plot is trite, the characters pathetic and unlikeable, the language foul, and the writing juvenile. The book is supposedly the childrens' perspective after their father murders their mother. He apparently does so because she is going to expose his adultery with a student. In the end it is explained that \\"Who you are and what you are is partly because of who your parents,your grandparents, and even the ones before them were...We humans like to think we are free to choose our life. Maybe we are and maybe we aren't\\". The book then goes on to explain that the father has murdered their mother because of some perceived childhood traumas. Atleast in the end the daughter \\"walks slowly away\\". Luckily we're free to choose what books we read. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better.","review":"I thought that the book was only OKAY, because there were some parts that I believed were gross and kind of sexual. The book was about a teenage girl and her younger brother who have to deal with their dad killing their mother. The book switches from Jenna's (the girl) point of view to Jack's point of view(the boy). In my eyes Jenna was a mean little brat to her mom, although Jack seemed to love his mom and respect her. Jenna was into GIRLS and their bodies. Jack loved to paint just like his mom, so when she died he took over her studio and went there to paint and to think of her in the hard times he endured."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Modernization of a Classic Tale","review":"I came into this book with high expectations, but found myself very much let down. The plot was unsurprising, with a series of affairs and abandoned children, and in that it evoked Oscar Wilde's classic \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", one of the great gothic plays of all time. Unfortunately, whereas Wilde's play has touchingly poigniant scenes as the truth comes out, for instance when Jack realizes he has been telling nothing but truth his whole life, and comments on how terrible this is, this book seems to make light of the gravitas and realism of its premise, particularly in the courtyard scene. I reccomend it only for serious Wilde scholars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me...","review":"The item description doesn't tell you how big the map is when unfolded. I was surprised to find that the entire United States is displayed on a sheet that is barely bigger than a legal size sheet of paper. The map itself is only 9 1/2 inches from east to west -- I can cover the entire map with my outstretched hand. Thus the crowded Northeast section of the country is so small and packed with data that you'll probably need a magnifier to see much. And in such a small size, there is almost no detail; the only highways marked are the major interstates. If you aren't sure that Nebraska is north of Kansas or that Idaho is east of Oregon, this might be what you need.

At last we get to read more about this passionate and uppity heroine who reminds us that the Divine Feminine is the true partner and equal of the Son of Man, and who delivers a rousing antidote to the cultural shame around being a woman.

I like that it uses the 1/4\\" thread, so I don't have to keep track of a bunch of adapters. Doesn't work that well with the 300mm f2.8l, the lower legs and the pan head just aren't beefy enough.Over a day's shooting, the QR plate will loosen and create a bit of play, but considering that I don't have to fumble around for an allen wrench to tighten it and can switch the plate to a different lens or camera faster, it's a good tradeoff.

It's lighter in color and closer to unfinished maple than blond oak or maple.My one (very small) complaint is that there is no reason to make any device which requiresone to read the manual to set the clock. Other than that, you could plug this in anduse it without ever being forced to read the manual. All devices should have threededicated buttons -hour, minute and am/pm in my very humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent radio; Terrible clock-radio alarm.","review":"Radio has excellent sound, and pulls in weak stations; HOWEVER, the alarm clock radio is extremely inconvenient to use. If you want to disarm the alarm so it doesn't wake you on Saturday morning, you have to go through four steps to do so. All of the buttons are identical, and the labels are very difficult to read. If you want to change your wake-up time, you have to go through six steps. Plan on having the Owner's Manual in one hand while you push confusing buttons with the other. I use the Sangean to go to sleep by, but keep a more convenient and reliable clock radio on the other side of my bed to wake me in the morning.Also, some of the features are only available in Europe, so I paid for some features I can't use. Great sound, but you might find more convenient performance at a lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sangean WR-2","review":"This last purchase has been our third WR-2. The remote control and the pre-selected station features are very convenient and a pleasure to use.The tone controls are optimized for music and speaking voices are overly bass boosted. Less powerful FM stations are very sensitive as to antenna positioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen radio","review":"I had bought a Sony under the cabinet radio for the kitchen and the reception was terrible. I returned it and bought the Sangean radio. The reception is great. I use the radio for mostly listening to talk radio and it meets all my needs. The kids really like the radio because it has RDS, which allows them to see the name of the artist for each song. A few cons would be the single speaker makes listening to music ok, but certainly not equivalent to a two speaker stereo. The remote only works if you are in front of the radio. My kitchen table is off the left and I need to get up and move to use the remote. All said, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clock radio. Almost gave it a 5 star rating.","review":"Everything about this clock radio is great except the brightness control. The LCD that displays the clock and radio stations is way too bright. I can not go to sleep with a light blasting in my face. I'm going to try to buy something that goes over the display and dims the light. Even if I can't dim the brightness enough, I will still keep the radio. For the money I don't think there is a clock radio out there that is as good as this one.By the way, don't buy the Boston Acoustics Horizon Solo or it's predecesor. The functionality of the clock radio is insane. When I used the SLEEP feature with an AM station that works when SLEEP is off, I get a loud humming sound that drowns out the commentator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality and nice looking radio.","review":"This radio does what i wanted it to do-recieves a radio station that i couldnt get with a regular boombox. But i was expecting a little more out of the reception. I thought it would recieve all kinds of stations-but since i live in a very rural area i guess those expectations were a little high. I still like it and it does give me a radio station that others would not recieve-im happy.

However, 9 months later, the sound has stopped working (February 2013). All the RDS, etc., still works, so it's receiving the signal. Just no sound. I was using the FM antenna that came with it, but when the sound stopped I hooked it up to my giant FM antenna (in the attic). Still no sound...I'm going to send it in to Sangean since it's still under warranty, but I would think this radio should last longer than 9 months.

First, it has a true wooden finish, not a laminate. The sound is great and it's easy to use. The backlight on the display can be adjusted so that it is not too bright at night.

This has a blinding blue light that will light up your room when the power is on. They must have done this so you could easily find the power button at night, but I'm not exagerating-you will feel like you are in a neon lighted porn district in Amsterdam when you see how this lights up your room. I through out the box and will have to try and sell this for whatever I can get on ebay.Also, while the reception is better then a normal radio-it is not great. If you want better-they make you buy a antenna add-on-what a rip off. I had a big klunky GE Super tuner $45 and it was better the this. Another thig is whe you touch any of the buttons on the front you will experience static.this should be priced around $80 for what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor am receiption on sangear WR-2","review":"I am returning my second Sangean WR-2 radio. I reordered because I did not believe that a radio that cost that much could have almost nonexistant AM recieption. I tried an external antenna with little improvement. We are in a remote area, however, A 40 year old radio and a $18 dollar boom box both received a usable AM signal in exactly the same location. I bought this for a xmas present for my wife who likes to listen to talk radio. I thought she would like the many nice features on this radio. The FM has good sound. This is the only reason I gave it a two star rateing.

But without an alarm, it's doing less than half the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the reviews say","review":"The small orange power-on button has a very bright white half moon glow on it. It's irriating at night as if some one has cracked open the bedroom door. Original purchase and this replacement that I received are both like this. Weird design for such a costly Taiwan made radio to have a button that looks like someone never finished coloring the plastic orange on button. Rich deep bass sound but you never can crank up the volume if you want to blast a song. Volume dial goes up to 60 on the dial but it's not much louder than when the dial is set a third lower at 40 on the volume dial. Like the white enclosure as it matches my white kitchen applicances where I moved the radio to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Don't Like","review":"Bought one three years ago and am now looking for a new one. The radio cuts off for up to an hour or so once or twice a week, for no reason. Never did like how you have to play with the display everyday just to have the clock visible. The buttons are not comprehensive and after threes years I still haven't the dang thing memorized, so that I could hit the right button for the right function in the middle of the night, in the dark, for example. Too much bass, which you have no control over, disturbs the neighbors. Lousy reception, my 25 cent Salvation Army Special is a better radio by far. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great desk radio with classic style.","review":"This is my second WR-2.

The first was my brother's old timex which was amazing in many ways.As far as my Black WR-2 which I own 3:Positives:1) Great sound. Warmth and bass without sounding like a rapper's boom box. Won't name names but there are $150+ radios out there that have 100x the bass and nothing else.2) Great reception. Clear reception all the way around even with just built-in hidden antenna.3) Love the rotary knobs for tuning and volume.Cons:1) Display is too weak and not clear in direct sunlight. Should have a light sensor and increase brightness in day time. Display overall doesn't have enough contrast.2) Snooze and other buttoms a little too small.3) It would be nice if this was like $100 and not $140."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compact AM-FM radio.","review":"This is a nice compact AM-FM radio.

I can not say one work bad about the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated settings","review":"If you are looking for a clock radio that is easy to set and quickly change the alarm settings this is not the radio for you in spite of the quality of the sound. The previous clock radio I had for 25 years (Nakamura) only required two buttons to change the alarm settings, this radio requires four buttons and wastes time. The previous radio also had two alarm settings. In addition if you want to see the time while the radio is playing you have to hit a button to disengage the song announcement feature. Besides all of this it is large for what is does, twice the size of my previous radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely to look at, but miserable AM reception","review":"The old radio we had in the kitchen when I was growing up achieved better AM reception than this. Even the radio in my cheap car (Hyundai Sonata) gets better AM than this.I live in a rural area without sources of interference. The radio is on the second floor, near a window. The building is wood-framed. There is no possible excuse for the pathetic performance of this radio! And, yes, I tried an external AM antenna.After dark, it does not, and apparently cannot, discriminate between distant stations. Rotating the radio (to orient the internal ferrite rod antenna) makes only a marginal difference.During daytime, a station that I can hear clearly on my car radio comes in with enough background hiss to be almost unlistenable on the Sangean.All the money seems to have gone into the box, which is very nicely done. But I didn't buy a radio just to look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, poorly written manual, display too bright.","review":"This radio has a great warm/rich sound. Love that!

I called Amazon who referred me to the state-side wholedaler who advised that the radio is digital but NOT HD (Hyper Digital). The wholesaler said that he had received several similar calls, so I'm not the only one who was misled by the Amazon listing. I returned the radio to Amazon for a full refund, and then bought a used Polk Audio ISonic HD radio through Amazon, which was considerably more expensive, but receives three HD channels offered by NPR and several other stations.

But, I bought the unit for a bedroom where it would be used as a clock and occasional alarm in addition to a radio. From its position, across the room, the dispaly was either way to bright, or not bright enough to see the display.

The sound quality is unbelievable for a small unit. The only gripe I have with this radio is the lack of a dual alarm and the ability to select week day or weekend function for the only alarm it does have...even cheap clock radios have these basic alarm functions.

Its face was a warped-looking cloudy pink-and-grey splotch and the pale watch dials made it impossible to make out the time at a glance. Visually unattractive and virtually useless, it was returned to Amazon (which issued a full refund except for my time and trouble to ship it back, naturally)! Recommended instead is the Pulsar Women's PEG664. The same style--but with a gold-toned band--the darker face coloration of the PEG664 closely resembles mystic fire topaz.

The attempt to impose a static philosophy on the process of becoming leads to philosophic untruth and irrelevance. There is something of aesthetic brilliance in the dialectical fortresses they construct, but no individual could ever be contained in those propositions.It is in the form of Johannes Climacus that Kierkegaard expresses his revelation. The book is skillfully constructed and witty.For someone interested in Kierkegaard's thought, but turned off by his monstrous, enigmatic books like Either/Or, I would recommend this book. This is philosophy that reaches the individual but never forces him into a system to regurgitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is unlike anything I've ever heard.

The Dying Man conveys an undeniable disgust for the ignorance and cruelty that is so prevalent in our world; yet, this negative energy is constantly accompanied by a profound understanding, and a subtle, underlying feeling of hope. In fact, this album is crawling with subtleties that will certainly escape the attention of mainstream listeners. But isn't that the way it should be?! Ranging from slow and hypnotic to loud and industrial, this album defies categorization and demonstrates an extraordinary range of unusual talent and insight. The Dying Man is truly a work of art.

Excepting those passages where he lectures on social issues rather than letting the story speak for itself, and setting aside the matter of how much of this book is \\"true\\", the core reality is that Tristan Jones tells really a heck of a good tale. The story is improved by the infinite detail afforded by his experience and expertise as a mariner (which nobody denies). There are very few sailors who would not learn a lot from Jones' narratives and none who could fail to enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady of Lavender","review":"This was a wonderful find for a lover of Irene Kral's music.

I stepped up my memory and graphics and found this controller is awesome for this game amoung others such as sports, pinball, plane simulation, and all around fun. I can not comment on 2d fighting games but on 3d games it works wonders. If playing sports however, the controller seems to be a little sluggish, but still very precise.

I then came home with the MS Sidewinder, plugged it in...and I was off and running.

They shipped the 2 pieces wrapped together, nothing seperating them. Obviously a mistake on their part. The dish arrived chipped on the top part because of the way it was wrapped. Amazon sent out another right away. At my request the new one was wrapped seperatly. When it arrived the bottom had major glazing flaws, white spots in 2 places. However, I have no doubt I was sent a used one when I paid for a new one. Probably one previously owned by another reviewer who said they sent theirs back. It smelled funny and has water spots and lots of dirt. I decided to keep it since who knows what may be wrong with another one if I tried to get a replacement. It is too small for the butter I buy. I read some reviews where people say its too small, some say its perfect. It depends on the butter you get. I will need to buy different butter or just use it without the lid.

But it ought to be functional - it's too small for a stick of butter. The lid doesn't sit all the way down because a standard stick is too tall for it. Then butter gets all inside the lid, and you don't want to put it down because you'll get butter on the table.

I am very happy with it and would recommend anything from Fiesta to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I bought this in Marigold and it's absolutely perfect. A stick of (Cincinnati area) Kroger Private Selection Organic Salted Butter fits perfectly with no mess.

In theory all stick butter should be the same size, but since \\"theory\\" doesn't always translate to fact, I'm guessing that various brands skew somewhat.Aside from proper butter fit (something I never imagined myself saying), the dish cleans perfectly in the dishwasher and it looks very nice.

This music is very cheesy. More specifically, its melodramatic, sentimental, and irritatingly precious. Worse still are the pretensions toward poetry and Tegan's tendency to lionize her own artistic talents. As easily as these melodies can lull the listener into a stupified ersatz bliss, they can just as easily dull the ear to much more challenging forms (eg jazz or classical). This is the worst kind of commodified, commercialized cheese, spewed forth not by some faceless record company (that would be forgivable) but by the singer/songwriter himself! Tegan and sara succesfully did to rock and roll what twinkie did to foodstuffs, what the A-team did to theater and what Vanila Ice did to hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"One of their best.

In fact, I haven't heard of them before. I only got it because Chris Walla from Death Cab for Cutie produced it and the sample music sounded good. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy this album. The lyrics aren't especially clever, however the music is good. The vocals sound something akin to Cindy Lauper doing alternative but not annoying. Song 3 is my favorite. It sounds something like a Killers song with female vocals. Many songs on this album are reminiscent of other songs and bands though I can't quite put my finger on them all. In general, \\"The Con\\" is kind of rock, pop, and alternative rolled into one. Chris Walla must have made all the difference. I wasn't too impressed with Tegan and Sara's earlier work by the samples I heard, but all in all, I truly enjoy this ablum.

I got the cat one first, and when it quit working a few years later, I installed the bigger doggie version. My pets can get in, but neighborhood pets can't. It uses a 9 volt battery, which seems to last for about a year. The pets don't mind wearing the magnets on their collars. I keep mine set so that they can get in, but can't get back out. They will sometimes paw at it trying to get out and they knock the battery compartment door off. Intermittently the magnet does not engage the locking mechanism - I think the solenoid may be a bit flaky. Overall, this door is well worth the expense of buying and installing, even with the intermittent flakyness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works decent, wont keep racoons out though.","review":"Door installs relatively easy, pets figured it out rather easily.

First, the measurement says it will fit a dog with a shoulder height of 14\\" - my dog is 12\\" at the shoulder, and there is no way she would fit through. While the entire piece is large enough, the actual flap opening is rather small and she wouldn't even go near it. Also, the electromagnetic \\"tag\\" that is supposed to go on the collar is ridiculous. First of all, it's very bulky and rather heavy, which I don't think would be very comfortable for a small dog or large cat. Secondly, the loops in which to string the collar through are too small for any collar with a buckle. I would have had to buy another collar with a very slim profile and more of a belt like buckle. Overall, I had to buy a regular dog door to replace this one. Generally though, installation was rather straight forward and I did like that they provided various screws to use dependent on your door thickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to install","review":"Being one of those women whose hubby isnt mechanical,I have to say this was one of the easiest installjobs I have had to learn.

It never happened.The book tells the story of four different characters that left their native land, and settled elsewhere. They all suffer from deep depression and have some connection to the Holocaust. None of their lives intersect, although they share this similar past. The individual stories aimlessly move through each of the character's past with a tepid tone and abrupt, unfulfilled ending. None of the characters are particularly interesting, and those that have an unusual story - like an unlikely feted artist - are stripped of any life through a centerless story.For those that are interested in the areas of emigration, the Holocaust - read some other novels/factual accounts. Afterwards, think about them as a whole and you'll be greatly more affected than these four sterile accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connecting the pictures","review":"Once I realized that the stories connect interesting but random photographs, I could not get away from the feeling that the book was not \\"real\\" stories.

The photos have a degree of immediacy that removes the distance that the somewhat dry recountings of fictive facts might otherwise retain. Even on a second and third reading, there is an undercurrent of dread that encompasses the reader. There is a kind of fascination that draws us in and will not let us go. Indeed, this is one author whose death I continue to mourn because he had just what we all need to hear. That nothing is permanent except loss, and that we become human to the extent that we connect with this fleeting reality.Now, if only there were a children's author who does something similar, but perhaps this is an insight that only makes sense in one's middle age?Anyway, contemplating the bitter fruit of anti-semitism is only one level of Sebald's text. There are so many more. Read on."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This book was given to me as a gift when I was struggling with the reality of God and with my spirituality.

Its a simple story, forcefully told.The Scots dialect may be difficult to understand for non-Scots, but put in the effort as you will be well rewarded.Everything about this book is superbly written: From the descriptions of the seventies tenements, to the football violence, to the ageing process. What differs from most of Welsh's other books is that although there is his customary despair and nightmarish scenarios, there is a heavy dose of comedy and the dialogue is absolutely incredible.The book's main conclusion is redemption and is ultimately uplifting.Quite simply the most aggressive, funny, outlandish and uplifting book I've read in many a year.Good work, chap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weslh Imitating Welsh","review":"I hope this isn't true, but if \\"Glue\\" is any indication of the current state of Irvine Welsh's creative juices, than he is in a state of disrepair, or worse, decline. The novel is Welsh imitating Welsh. He tries to convey the best aspects of his earlier work - the slaggin' Scot slang of the urban poor best found in Trainspotting, provocative scenes best found in T-Spotting or Maribou Stork Nightmares or Acid House - but it comes across as trying rather than being, a fatal flaw for any writer, let alone one as previously charismatic as Welsh. It's tired writing, without any real edge, cliche-ridden to the point where Welsh brings back characters from the T-Spotting. Sad to say, these are the only interesting scenes in the novel. Stop recycling, Irvine, it's bad for your health and mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Many might feel with this effort that Welsh is merely rehashing Trainspotting...in fact all of the major characters from that story make a brief appearance in Glue. Nevertheless, though Welsh's familiar themes of drug abuse, sex and delinquency abound, Glue is a story about people.The book details the life of four close friends growing up in Scotland from the 1970s into the new millenium...through troubles and joys. It is a fun read told with Welsh's unrestrained yet stylish flair. The human element is very strong here...we see the four friends in every light; what brings them together, what drives them apart and ultimately the tragedy that they must all overcome. It is a sad and beautiful story, yet more upbeat than some of Welsh's previous works. Personally, I think it is his finest. If you enjoyed Welsh's other efforts, definitely pick this one up today. It is worth every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"glue","review":"A good read well written, but could do with shortening. And kind of clichéd; haven't we got passed the idea that the only way onwards and upwards for your urban poor is music and boxing? Stuck in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated","review":"This story may not be as big a hit as Trainspotting, however the stories of the development of a group of friends from the schemie are worth reading. Featuring plenty of laugh out loud moments, and accurately protraying the work-shy and/or alcoholic lifestyles of the characters this is an entertaining and worthwhile read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"This book expands on the world created in Trainspotting, a social study on 4 boys becoming men and coping through poverty, drugs, etc.It's not Trainspotting, a book I fear all Welsh's work will be compared with, but it's a fast paced highly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happenned?","review":"I was a big fan of Welsh in his previous novels. I truly thought him as the talent many claimed him to be. I didn't enjoy Filth much, but this Glue needs some cohesiveness. It's as if the author figured if he called the novel glue it would miraculously happen in the content of the book. This is my third attempt to read this book. I again gave up. This feels more like an anthropological text then a novel. I get a lot of background, the hows and whys these people do the things they do. But he doesn't give me a reason to be interested in this world. I hope he goes back to his old self in his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get some therapy, Welsh, you sick ****","review":"If you're determined to enjoy Glue I suggest you skip pages 59-67, exactly the point at which I abandoned Welsh forever. I'm stunned that none of the previous reviews mention the graphic and gratuitous torture of two dogs covered in these pages, let alone object strongly to it.Welsh: you're quite welcome to sit at home and conjure up images of breaking a dog's legs with bolt cutters, kicking it in the face, stamping on its ribs, hanging it from a tree, hitting it with a bat and dousing it in paraffin before setting fire to it - although I strongly suggest you get on medication because the inside of your head must be a joyless place- but don't share it with me.Jonathan Cape/Random: how dare you let me unwittingly buy this ugly piece of misery. That scene crossed a boundary and totally sickened me. Glue is a 469-page, anti-life, pointless waste of trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This was an excellent book.

No matter how bad they are, I persevere and make it to the end just to say that I did.I gave up on Glue. I ordered the book because the author has some degree of fame. The book opened with ordinary prose. Only the dialogue was in scotch and I could somehow work this out. I was prepared for the dialogue to be like this. When I read a southern American book, the dialogue is written differently, in order to create an accent. However, after the prologue, Glue was written entirely in Scotch. This isn't English. It was impossible to understand.Because I didn't read the book, I can't call this a review. Instead it's a warning to other readers not to be unprepared like me. THIS BOOK IS NOT IN ENGLISH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Cruelty Unacceptable","review":"I've read all of Welsh's previous works, and loved or at least strongly liked all of them, but Glue is crossing the line for me. The detailed animal cruelty did not add to the story, and after reading the part about the boy \\"shagging\\" all the girls, I feel that his objectification of women in combination with animal cruelty to be more than I could swallow. I stopped reading the book. It was too disgusting. I think Welsh has crossed the line of good taste, and is now aimlessly shocking readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glue","review":"Four complete characters growing up in a society that has let them down. Glue shows you that you can run but you can't hide from your past or you're mates. For better or worse they are always there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scottish deadheads grow up the hard way","review":"Irvine Welsh is certainly a unique writer. His prose is written in a language spoken by Scottish youth, which makes it barely understandable for most everyone else (at least in the beginning). And his knowledge of the Scottish youths lost to drugs is scarily in-depth. Unfortunately 'Glue' doesn't break new ground for the author. All the drugged out characters have already been hashed through in his earlier works. And 'Glue' doesn't have the sort of extra madness found in 'Filth'. But 'Glue' is an interesting story of four Scottish youths who fight drugs, alcohol, and each other until they reach their middle years. There is also a rather good, moving ending (no spoilers). So 'Glue' isn't special by any means. Just a fine read.Bottom line: best left to those who've read better works by the author.

Excellent product--would buy again/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"The base is a tripping hazard - both I and my wife have tripped over it.The way it is mounted to the wall is unstable - the plastic cups that bolt to the wall are too shallow to prevent the gate from dislodging from them (especially on the top - see below).The friction system using the adjusting screws is solid enough on the bottom of the gate where, thanks to the (extra tall) base, the screws push against an uninterrupted piece of metal(the base). On the other hand the top is a lot looser, especially on the side where the extension is not used, causing the tall thin set of rods to flex and dislodge from the cup. If you try to tighten it, the gate is impossible to close. On top of it my 2 year old son managed to loosen the adjusting screws on both sides of the gate causing it to open even without the safety latch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreambaby Extra Tall Gate from Amazon","review":"Love this gate! I have three Rottweilers in my home and they haven't destroyed it yet. It was easy to set up and easy to move to different places within my home. I bought this when my foster dog was outgrowing his crate, and wanted him to be able to stretch his legs, while having access to an entire room. He is much happier now and my other two have not been able to push through it. The walk thru door is awesome an makes things so much easier. The height is excellent for my ex large male Rott.

Read all the reviews for this one and other similar taller gates. This one could be attached to the wall. Have had it for about a month. so far no problems. One of my cats can jump it, which doesn't bother me, but I know some people buy this for a pet gate. I have twin 16 month olds and they actually shake it pretty good and it still nice and tight.

So now we have a saftey latch holding the door together so he can't open it anymore. This is very upsetting the adults in the house. So if you want to keep your kids out of a certain area or from falling down stairs THIS IS NOT THE GATE TO PURCHASE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and measurements were off","review":"If you're looking to use this gate with the extensions, good luck! I have a 65\\" opening that needs a gate and I went to the manufacturers website plus amazon to make sure I had the correct measurements and extensions I needed. When the gate arrived, it was way off....the gate without the extensions is much shorter than what I had expected it to be from measurements listed online.On top of that, the gate we received was defective. The gate metal was warped and the door would not latch at all, unless we had the hulk handy to completely bend the gate!We returned this gate and have since gotten the Summer Infant Sure and Secure extension gate. It involves hardware to install which is the only downside but the measurements were correct and the gate actually works!I will say, Amazon took the gate back with no issues and UPS picked the gate up from our house the day after we requested a return, so kudos to them for their customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT buy.","review":"I bought this gate for my rambuncious 14 month old dog.

After my experiencew with this gate,I've realized that no presurized gate can stand up to the constant opening that happens in a busy family.This gate worked fine for the first few weeks, but within a month the rubber grips on the pressure mounts began pealing off. Once they were gone the gate slipped all over the door frame no matter how much pressure was on it. It also scratched up our woodwork. Lesson learned. I will use the wall mounts in the future.Another complaint is that there were no replacements parts readily available, and within a month I had to spend $33 to order them from the only place I could find online. The manufacturer is in Australia, and I could not find any contact info on the website to ask for replacement parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice gate","review":"I bought this gate to use at the bottom of my stairs for keeping newly crawling/walking babies in my daycare off the stairs. I purchased the gate with the 2 extensions because my doorway was 42.5\\" wide. The details said that with the 2 extensions (3.5\\" and 7\\") it would fit openings up to 42.5\\" which was perfect! When i set it up it was a little tricky to get up by myself. I do not like how the metal screws with rubber ends that you use to pressure mount it to the wall stick out so far. I am purchasing a second 7\\" extension to replace the 3.5\\" extension it came with to see if that is better. overall I do like the gate and it is easy to use with one hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate","review":"Great Gate but a little hard to open.

Only wish you could turn off the auto close feature. If you want to leave it open you have to slow it while it closes. Can be a pain when you are carrying something into the room to find the gate is latched. Otherwise, no complaints. I have similar Evenflo gates, but they aren't as tall. If you want a tall gate, this is it. Has held up good so far, had it a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAMAGED!!","review":"I bought this gate because of all the great reviews on it. I was very disappointed as soon as I took it out of the box. The whole gate was damaged and bent. It was bent so bad that the gate would not close and left a 3 inch gap between side and the gate. I would of returned it but I didn't want to deal with the hassle and the $20+ to reship it. So my husband did his best to bend it back into the correct shape. So as of now, the gate seems sturdy but we have to be careful opening and closing the gate due to it being warped. I think this gate would of been awesome if we wouldn't have received one that was damaged!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I purchased my first gate to protect my elderly parents from accidentally falling down our wide staircase, after they moved into assisted living I decided to leave the gate up as I had grandchildren and am a dog breeder and need to keep dogs out of certain areas.

He is an expert escape artist and has been able to work out how to open previous gates that we have had.This gate is the first gate that we have had that he cannot work out!It's great, and very secure. There is a small discreet button on the top which slides to the side, you then slightly lift the gate to get through.It's the best gate we have ever had.Much better quality than other gates we have purchased.Well priced and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a very good pet gate.","review":"We bought this to keep two dogs separated at times. We installed it in a hallway. It was easy to install and is well made. Gate swings both ways which is handy. 90 percent of the time the gate will automatically swing shut and latch itself (good if your hands are full) behind you as you exit. We just prop a soft toy under the gate door if we want the gate to stay open. Gate opens by sliding a little button latch and pulling up on the gate, a little difficult with hands full but easily manipulated at all other times. I would recommend this as a Pet gate. I found it to be lower cost than the pet gates at the pet stores. I kept two 60 pound medium large dogs apart with this, they cannot jump over it and they could easily see one another through the gate. I choose BLACK because even though the walls in the house are white, we have dark wood trim and I think the black blends in very well and looks unobtrusive."},{"rating":"2","title":"sanity saver","review":"This is a must have if you are having problems keeping a 2-3 year old in their bed/room.

It took me awhile to play with the extensions before I manage to even get it close to the locking position and I am in construction.It is also very loud when it shuts, and may wake or disturb a sleeping baby"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I have an extremely intelligent, high strung 2 year old who could just jump right over the standard height gates, so I looked a long time before I decided to get these gates. I read all the reviews and they were all good so, I ordered them. They are good quality but my two year old can just open the gate right up. He runs right through them. If we tighten up the pressure to keep them shut, He just goes right over and loosens the pressure so he can get the gate open. He's recently taught our one year old daughter how to open it. So, needless to say, I am very disappointed with this Dream Baby swing through gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drean Baby Gate is a dream","review":"Excellent product; helps limit the furry family's access to baby's room.

In fact the CGI is poor by even early 90's standpoint. This would have looked bad 10 - 12 years ago. Some say that kids will see through that and like this. I disagree, animation has come a long way since we were kids and with 95% of shows and movies featuring outstanding to really good animation (both cell and CGI) I believe the target audience (once again tweens) will look at this and walk away, or watch it once and walk away. This is not recomended, a lot more effort should have been put into this. Completely unforgivable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Male AND Female characters","review":"This was good for BOTH boys AND girls. The female main character, for once, was a real character, as opposed to a love interest. And when she fought, she actually fought as opposed to \\"fought sexily.\\" And the energy between the two characters was unique and kinda sweet. Add all the wizards, explosions, troll-like villans and pretty well-done fights and you've got a decent mix. The only complaint I had was that the only other female character was dead. What of both of the main characters' mother's too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys would really like this","review":"This movie has a lot of things boys like - Dragons, flying, Wizards, magic. It really has a pretty good story with twists and turns clever enough to surprise kids. The only reasons I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is the animation of the characters could be better (like the new GI Joe movie), but some of the structures and scenes are quite beautiful. In the sequel to this movie, the directors should do more first person view shots like things flying past and almost hitting you etc. for even more excitement. Overall, a very good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice watch, gains lots of time","review":"i love everything about this watch, except that it gains a lot of time. i'm constantly adjusting it against my casio Gshock. it gained 45 seconds overnight. i also tried resting it on its side with the stem down, to no avail. the tissot midsize see-through back autoquartz is extremely accurate, only losing about 3 secs the first week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy Caliente","review":"This is for anyone who is open to GOOD music.

But the spirit of Cuban Ibrahim Ferrer shines through and this set definitely brings forth a joyful sound. The best songs, in my opinion, are at the front, but they are all good in their own rights. Joy of freedom is expressed in the first number, \\"Bruca Manigua\\", and then contrasted with the longing sound and lyrics of the bolero, \\"Herido de Sombras\\". Then there's \\"Marieta\\" with its sly bawdiness, and a song of innocent partying, \\"Guateque Campesino\\".

They aren't looking for some kind of hit, just music they have enjoyed, in the hope that you too will get some pleasure from it.My personal favourites?

This album carries on the style of BVSC but covers a broader spectum musically and shows a more soulful side to cuban music, there are some really beautiful romantic ballads on this album.

Here is the breakdown of the royalties. Ray Cooder 50%; the Cuban goverment (the agent) 45%; the non-Cuban technical staff 5%; the performers 0%. Ray Cooder is only exploiting the Cuban performers for his own profit. This is common knowledge in Hollywood. There is no doubt a lot of feelings coming out of the performers, but that is all. They were never part of the top Cuban performers group in the Pre-Castro era. The quality and technics are poor; the duets are never in sinc. I have better recordings in my private Cuban collection.

Ferrer is an enjoyable song stylist. His version of \\"Que Bueno Baila Usted\\" is every bit as lively as Beny More's original and stands out as one of few upbeat numbers on the CD. I am sad that they did not show the recording of that song in the movie because the studio was probably hoppin'. Ferrer went from shining shoes and trash removal to international superstar in two years and at 73 years old. That's enough right there to buy the CD.The sound quality of the CD is poor. That's surprising since even Cuban CDs recorded at EGREM, the state run studio usually are of very solid quality. On some songs, you hear a hiss that is reminiscent of the Dolby B days of tape recorders. That's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hat too big!","review":"Don't waste your money!

Unforunately for Mad Catz, I strongly dislike this controller for Xbox. Its control sticks are far too sensitive! Whatever springs or mechanisms which hold the sticks to their usual upright position must be weak because they are far to easy to move around. This weakness causes me to miss my Shots in Halo and make overly sharp turns in my racing games. If you're thinking this is because the sensitivity is turned up too high on my games, you're wrong. At the same game configurations for controller sensitivity, CONTROLLER S IS FAR MORE CONTROLLABLE. Even though one star is the lowest Amazon.com will let one rate an item, I believe 0 stars would be far more accurate. Save your money; don't buy this controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality videos that are mostly not even cardio!","review":"I got this set for free - thankfully since the quality on these DVDs is generally so bad I can't imagine paying for it. Grainy film quality, blurry instructors, and in Martial Fusion the instructore actually manages to go off the green screen and have parts of his body dissappear.The Martial Fusion and Step are the only true cardio workouts here, and they are moderate workouts at best. This appears to have been cobbled together in a sad attempt to make more money without putting in much effort. Skip it, there are much better workout DVDs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really supposed to work?","review":"We ordered this because we remembered our older kids loving it and wanted our yougest son to have it. Well, we never got it to work on our computer.

There are only 45 pictures total in this book...and most of them are mothers in other cultures holding their infants. This would be fine if it was a book on cultures and infants...but it's not very good when it's in a book that you expect birth photography. The reason I gave this a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating is because there ARE a couple of nice breastfeeding photographs...however, even most of the infant pictures are disturbing and not nice to look at (photos of babies left alone in cribs in an empty room while they cry alone, or otherwise not being nurtured and loved). I did not like what I saw, and felt cheated that I'd spent $12 to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for lucnch box!","review":"I got this for my kindergartener's lunch box. It's the perfect size. I don't cut off crusts and the sandwich fits perfectly with the area below plenty big enough to hold grapes, a fruit rollup, or cheese-its...whatever you want. It's a little short for an apple unless you cut it up. I was worried at first that the top might break off from the bottom part but we've used this almost every day for over 6 weeks and so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly designed","review":"This little sandwich box is sturdy, closes well, is easy to open, and it's just the right size. The tray up top is large enough to hold almost any sandwich I make for my son's lunch. We use Orowheat bread, which is a bit wider than regular loaves, but when I cut off the side crusts it fits perfectly. Sandwiches made on Orowheat hamburger buns also fit--though occasionally they are too tall, in which case they always fit under the tray. The space under the tray is large enough to hold the little 1-ounce bags of chips, and sturdy enough that you can just put chips or vegetables in loose. After four months of use, the decoration on the top is holding up well--however, I have always hand washed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I went through 6 of these in eight years. Each one started falling apart almost right away, but I had to fly a lot and I needed to carry my gear. This case converts into a cart, so it was convenient. I will not by this brand again. A complete rip-off. The handle broke off on all six cases. The wheels wear out within a year and the lid gets misaligned quickly.I would not recommend this case to any serious photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but great.","review":"I just loved the cat-and-mouse game played in the first season. The aliens thought their revival had gone undetected and despite the lost of much of their burning-ray technology, their need to take over human hosts, and their limited numbers hid out in a radioactive cave in the desert they felt confident. The humans, on the other hand, were largely clueless of the enemy they faced. Their single advantage was that the aliens didn't know that they knew. The motley crew of of defenders combined in such a way to cover each other deficiencies and enhance their talents. The alien enemy took over various humans in sets of threes from college students to fashion executives, providing a strange commentary of contempary society. Each episode brought out new revelations about the alien enemy.The first season is one one to buy. Forget about the 2nd season which should have been given another title it was such a departure."},{"rating":"2","title":"where are seasons 2 and 3?","review":"became addicted to the series when it first came out and couldn't wait for the reruns. video taped many of them but lost them when i moved. please get moving on completion of the series on dvd. i have the original movie and season 1 but would like to complete the set. the war of the world series was one of the really good sci-fi series even though it left you hanging in many episodes to draw your own conclusions. can't wait to see it again and i'm sure i'm not the only one.thank you, sunny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good series","review":"Great series for end of 80s.Original concept , interesting story made as continuation of original Wells story and movie.Watched it on TV about 10 years ago and I waited a long time for this released on DVD.Hope 2nd season will follow soon.One downside - the story was cut off - no 3rd season were made :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Good series let down by bad transfer","review":"Although not a great series, it has it's moments, especially where episodes directly tie into the 1953 film. The show contains some genuine creepy moments and is entertaining in a quaint 80's fashion. However, what really lets this box set down is the picture quality. The picture is washy and looks like a 2nd generation video copy rather than a DVD transfer. I don't know weather this is due to the way the series was originally filmed (on videotape maybe?)or whether no effort or expense was put into creating the discs (after all the price is very cheap for a 6 disc set)."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIssed it, Glad to see it now","review":"I had no idea this series existed, I am a big Sci-Fi fan, Love the War Of The Worlds movies and of course read the Classic as a boy in grammar school.I received this DVD collection as a gift, and as I started to watch I got completely absorbed by it.I enjoyed the reviews here and agree with complaints some people have made about the packaging and some production values, but that said I think it is great TV stuff, good characters, good special effects for the time and limited budget, and most important an interesting unfolding of a story line. It amazes me that good shows like this one are so often overlooked, while real junk is avidly gobbled up by the masses. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time....","review":"At last!!! Finally this series made it to DVD. I remember tuning in to watch this every Saturday afternoon. Alas, it only lasted two seasons, but in that time it produced some really good episodes.

I was so excited to see it released on DVD after the horrible experience of the recent movie remake, I shutter just thinking of it! This show was ahead of it's time and cancelled far too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment at best...","review":"Okay let me start with the fact the I purchased \\"war of the worlds the entire series\\" from rare TV. It was expensive. When I got it, no cases thus no artwork. Video quality poor. I saw this and assumes they had brought up the video quality. Wrong-o!The only improvement they made was the cases, keep case, and the menus. No captioning (I am a little hard of hearing) audio is the same as the set I have. This is not amazon's fault it is the producer. I think Paramount should get it together.That all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay....","review":"I find it strange that every good review on here, claims that the first season is better than the second. I would have to disagree. The first season is crammed with poor acting, terrible plotting and dialogue that would make you scream. In comparison, the second series killed off the worst offenders and shifted the action to an urban wasteland, bringing a completely different focus to the alien menace.I found it was a far better plot device to remove the military support from the main cast and cut them loose to fight the aliens alone in a nearly ruined urban nightmare.If this were the second series, I would buy it. The first season does nothing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maaaaavelous....","review":"Well, I loved the fact the Harrison Blackwood is back in action in digital format. I am anxious to acquire the second season, but I have mixed feelings about that because of the fate of Col. Ironhorse.

Also, John Colicos appears as a hybrid alien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the show a lot, but these DVDs are utter crap!","review":"I picked these up at Best Buy for $15.99, and even that was too much for the horrible transfer job on these discs. The only reason to even buy these over a VHS copy is to get more episodes per disc over eps per tape, but considering the poor, poor quality, they probably could have fit 4 eps on a tape and it would have been the same. I cannot recommend more that people AVOID THESE DISCS, I'm sure they don't plan on selling many anyway, had I know what I know now, I wouldn't have bought them. I'm sure we'll never see this series re-issues on DVD, so this is the legacy they leave. It's a shame that they spin these out at the last minute to schill along with the release of the Tom Cruise movie. What a scam! Shame, shame, shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another series butchered by network suits.","review":"At least in its first season, this was one of the most intelligent sci-fi series to come along, with good character development and compelling storylines. This series first played on Saturday afternoons in NYC, and I used to make a point of not missing it (this was the ancient days before VCR's became household items). I have never forgotten the episode where one of the heroes lost his beloved, and never knew what happened...excellently done.Of course, since it succeeded, the suits had to change the plotline in the second season, to make it more \\"relevant to the 18-49 demographic\\"; it was soon cancelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAR OF THE WORLDS FIRST SEASON TV SERIES 1988","review":"I REALLY ENJOY W O W FIRST SEASON.

So much so that I would have given 0 stars for this show had that been an option. Anyone who believes that the first season outplayed the second must not care about quality acting. The second season is watchable whereas, I have to say, the first is almost unwatchable. I would say that the second season is more worth having on DVD than the first, without question. Indeed, the inclusion of Adrian Paul was a big help to the show as I think many will agree. I actually hope they release season 2 on DVD. My advice, just pretend the first season never existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this DVD people","review":"Screen quality is VHS or less.

I've watched the first 3 episodes and this was a horrible waste of money. This has to be one of the worst sci-fi shows I've seen. Now I realise why I had never heard of it before this dvd release. Everything about it is terrible. Especially the acting. The 4 stars have been some of the worst actors in the business. Hopefully they didn't find much work after this as they are an embarassment to everyone in the profession. Aside from the that the writing is terrible and totally unimaginative, and the direction is incredibly lame. There are no special effects to speak of, except those left over from the 1953 film, just a few gooey make-up effects. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"War Of The Worlds TV Series","review":"I saw the package in a store and I remembered having seen the earth with alien hand comming up over top and the 3 alien fingers and thought \\"Cool, I remember that and have to get it\\". I personally was very disapointed with having spent my money on it, I think it was a piece of garbage after I saw it. Don't get me wrong, I have to give due respect and props shout outs to them for trying, but I personally feel it stunk and was a waste of money. I would not reccommend this to anyone.

Execellent style and staging (borders upon Val Lewton country), but not enough substance to satisfy. Silly script with an even sillier solution to the mystery. If you've seen The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939 -- the one with Basil Rathbone) and The Wolf Man (1941), then you've already seen this done better, although those earlier efforts didn't have as much attention to detail on setting up a misty sense of doom. (The misty doom was later used by director John Brahm with a beter script in The Lodger.) It's sort of like seeing an early template for Hammer horror. 20th C. print on DVD is awesome, and it's nicely packaged with good language/subtitle options. I'd recommend it as a curiosity piece for fans of pre-1950's era horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seamless,smooth,rough and rugged.

You can summon a few monsters but most of them you don't find until the very last tower. Once you beat the game you cannot replay your character.

The movie seemed to be trying to draw teenage viewers with unneccesary fighting and added romance, and it didn't really keep the spirit of the book. Many key scenes and characters (i.e. Jake) were not included in the movie. One scene that was very symbolic and important in the book was the rattlesnake scene, which was not included in the movie. The plot was changed too, for example, Antonia and Jim got romantically involved in the movie, whereas in the book, Antonia thinks of Jim as a little brother. Also, many of the characters' personalities in the movie were drastically changed from those in the book. One of the things that we liked about the movie was the images of the cornfields and the winter prairie. Overall, this movie was very disappointing and did not capture the feel of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst adaptaions ever","review":"This is one of the worst film adaptations of a book, overall, I have ever seen. For example, in Cather's novel, Jim's grandfather is an understanding peacemaker and appreciates Antonia's strength and independence. In the film, he's a grouchy snob who looks down on Antonia for being a foreign farmer! It's as if the writers never read the novel but instead scanned badly-written crib notes. The only parts worth watching might be Jim and Lena during Jim's University days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good by Biohazard standards...","review":"This is undoubtebly one Of the Bio's weakest albums.

I have a hard time imagining this would be of use to anyone. There is scant information and the few listings they have are poorly orgainized. For example: interior design, graphic design, architecture and civil engineering firms are all gathered together under the heading 'Design & Enginnering'. The listings are then arranged alphabetically and no description of the firm is offered. Unless the company conveniently has 'architecture' in its name, you'll have no idea if you're sending a cover letter to an architecture firm or a graphic design studio. These disciplines are far too different to be lumped together!

If you think about it, though, there must have been something great that Tokyopop saw in \\"Kim Possible\\" that made it worthy of this enjoyable first.The art in this book is in color, and looks basically like freeze-frames from the TV series. It does lack some of the usual manga items, such as tiny characters on blank pages, and random words, pictures, and notes here and there. But those things are only for smiling at, and don't affect the story much. The fact that the book was in color was very attractive, and already having an insight to the characters from the show was nice. I finally got tired of waiting for future books to come out, but it looks like there is a nice, long line of them now!I recommend this book to Kim Possible fans, comic book lovers familiar with the show, or people who like comics and would like a taste of KP.

If you don't like the songs on the CD in the original, produced and polished version, then you probably won't care too much for this LP. If you are a guitar fan or a Knopfler fan, you will definitely get a kick out of this album.

Everybody Pays is great here as well. Several songs here were not performed live on his last tour, so tis great to get to hear them in a live setting. Back to Tupelo and Stand up guy were not played at my concert, and likely weren't played elsewhere. Even if there is a live album, the quality of sound here should top it.

The viola executes the Dvorak's opening melody with short slashes that greatly enliven it, but the whole of both quartets is played for intensity and drama--the ABQ don't know any other mode. One is swept away by their energy, musical intelligence, and above all their ability to play in tune with gorgeous tone while digging deep into the score. The sonics are close but warm.

Unfortunately this book showcases none of that genre. It is a selective presentation of unimaginative talentless minimalist junk, mostly printed in black and white. The Soviets did have some original strains of modern art in their propaganda machinery, but little of it is reproduced here. This is just a sad cocktail of unoriginal ideas - borrowed from the West and executed poorly (an artistic equivalent of industrial rip-offs of Western consumer goods from the same era).

For those of us that may be seriously considering this as a possibility, or even those amongst us who disbelieve in the whole concept of past life, and past life memories the corroborating evidence in the book is very compelling. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This audio-book is really amazing. I enjoyed every minute of it.

Thomas Andrews speaks and it's a story everyone should hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoo boy...","review":"Some reviewers obviously need to work on their critical thinking skills. For one, just because someone can speak in an entirely different voice doesn't mean that he or she's the reincarnation of some historical figure. I, for one, can speak in quite a number of voices and yet I don't claim that I am the reincarnation of, say, Queen Victoria. And as others here have pointed out, just how the heck was Mr. Andrews supposed to know things that nobody knew until later last century? His mad psychic skillz? Lesson of the day: don't believe everything you read or hear, for that matter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by its Tilte","review":"This book subtitled \\"Titanic Secrets Revealed Thru The Eyes Of Her Builder\\" was enough for this reader to purchase this book. Don't make the same mistake. This book is really just a historical novel. Ths clincher with this book is. \\"Revealed thru the eyes of her builder\\" means some American from Cleveland has become a shipbuilder's \\"Bridey Murphy\\". Receivng information about the defects in the Titanic from the long dead builder speaking through this author. Coincendently the \\"builder's conclusion as to why the Titanic sank is the same as the episode on the Discovery Channel's Titanic Documentary.I recommend the Discovery Channel on this one. My main gripe is the title gave no hint that the source of information is on shakey ground to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wild Imagination","review":"This book is a good example of jumping on the Titanic hysteria bandwagon. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the first author is the reincarnation of the Titanic builder. There is no evidence that there is such a thing as a past life or past life regression hypnosis that is genuine. The authors obviously did some homework on the Titanic and put together a nice little story laced with some wild imagination. There are no secrets here that were not available to anyone who had wanted to do a little probing into the life of the builder of the Titanic. In short, the book is a hoax, albeit more entertaining than the recent dismal movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul touching to say the least.","review":"Truly my favorite of any book I've ever had the honor of experiencing. I have always had a deep love and respect for Thomas Andrews. When I got this book I was totally unprepared for how deeply it would affect me to hear the sound of Tommie Andrews speaking through the author. If there was any doubt in my mind, it vanished at that very moment. This IS real. The book totally validated every feeling I have ever had about Mr. Andrews. It is a book worth listening to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so real, it is almost spooky !","review":"After listening to the tapes, I believe Mr Barnes about his life as Thomas Andrews. I do have an ear for sound and voices. The voice of Thomas Andrews is so unlike Mr Barnes, I dont see how it could be faked. Also his voice is a combination scottish and Irish, if you had read his book you would know that his mother had a scottish background, so maybe Tommie picked it up from her Also tommies voice on the tape has a certain type of sound almost like a channelled entity, It also brought tears to my eyes listening to the final moments of tommie's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"both views","review":"This is my first time reading Sara Craven, and I have to say I was disappointed. The marriage proposal out of the blue could have worked - IF - she wrote about both sides of the story, but not just the heroine's. I understand Chessie's belief on the relationship with Miles Hunter to be a 'working relationship', but the story could have opened up a lot if Ms. Craven revealed Miles' character. Before the accident, he did lead a normal life and now the restrictions put on him and how he feels about it might have increased her rating a little.I have to agree with the other reviewers that the sex scene was mediocre good. Well, it was the best in the book. Linnet - the bitchy lady - again could have worked if it was explained more; and Alistair if the author wrote about Mile's prospective and if he was jealous.If you want to read it, go ahead and pick it up, but I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Kid is excellent children's entertainment!","review":"\\"The New Kid\\" is a heartwarming video about Norma Jean, the new kid in school. We see Norma Jean, a bit \\"different\\" from the other kids, try out for the school talent show. She falters, is treated snobbishly by two school girls who are choosing talent for the show and told she really wouldn't fit in. Still, Norma Jean decides to help as a stage hand and at the last minute when someone else doesn't show, gets to participate and steals the show. I first watched this video with children ranging in age from 1 1/2 - 5 and all of them were captivated by the characters, the story and the outstanding music. I would say that this is one of the best children's videos I've ever seen and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Things Are Packaged In This Tape","review":"My 2 year old and 4 year old loved this one.

My husband and I are HUGE Lewis Black fans, based on his live proformances, CDs and Comedy Central apperances. I bought this DVD for my husband's birthday. I was embarrased when we watched it together. I would like to think that this was done when Black was young, hungry and obviously stupid, but he doesn't look that young in the skits. I am also ashamed of anyone who paid Black or any of the other performers for this work. We are not prudes and may have been able to look beyond the crude vulgarity of this work if it were only funny. Don't waste your money on this.

Vaudeville and Laural & Hardy-inspired as these skits are, there is little to explain their concept or even what we are watching. On the DVD are two skits. That's about it. No interviews, no extra footage to invite the viewer into the concept, nothing.That's not to say that some of the performances weren't well done. The ideas for these pieces do seem like they were good ones; I am, however, left with an empty feeling after. In the descriptive terms that Lewis Black has himself used in the past, A Pair of Lewis Black Shorts come up short and to many will come across as proverbial candy corn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Offensive. Huge Disappointment","review":"I've been a huge Lewis Black admirer for a long time, spending money on concert tickets, books and dvds, and was excited to receive this dvd. But now I feel like a complete schmuck. I was horrified at the \\"gynecologist\\" sketch. Apparently he thinks that women who go to the gynecologist just sit there in the little rooms completely naked, all juiced up and waiting for somebody to screw. It certainly wasn't comedy, so I guess it was supposed to be soft porn.

This one should read: WARNING! THIS DVD IS NOT FUNNYSomeone got this for me as a present because I like Lewis Black. He's funny, but this is nothing like his stand up routine or any of his recent work. All the jokes [sic] are sexual. It's a couple of sketches filled with recycled offensive sexual humor. Usually when one uses an old joke, one endeavors to tell it in a funnier manner than it was previously used. Not so in this DvD.A three year old says, \\"poo poo,\\" and laughs and laughs as if it's the funniest thing in the world. The humor in this DvD is little different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I bought this DVD hoping for an entertaining night at home. What I got was a huge dissapointment. It wasn't funny at all, well it might be if you where a 11 year old boy. It was raw and crude. I would return it in a heartbeat but no one seems to want it.

You can't separate the egg from the stainless without a crowbar (be sure to use a wooden one, to avoid damaging the pan). No amount of oil will help...Also, and this is far more disturbing, the edge of the pan is at a very light angle, does not have a steep angle to help the flipping process....so if you decide to saute vegetables or anything in small pieces, if you try to flip them, you will need to snap your wrist like a bronco rider pulling the reins of an unruly horse.... and you will still lose a piece or two, unless you get it just right... Furthermore, if you surrender and pull out a wooden spoon, the very short wall of the pan will ensure that you spill at least some of the contents onto the stove when you stir.Pretty pan, but altogether the wrong pan for cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henkel 1481 Duck 3/4-by-12-Inch Hook & Loop Fasteners","review":"I used the hook & loop fastener to attach an 8 1/2 x 11 inch,6oz whiteboard to the fridge.

The first game's guide provided information as a glossary and as a walk-thru. If you had a question about something in KH1, you could easily find and turn to the corresponding section of its guide for answers. Why didn't the writers of the sequel's guide stick with what worked? I can only guess that they were more interested in style than substance. This book is fat because it is inefficient, full of fluff and fanciful designs that make finding information cumbersome and frustrating. Using Deats' guide, unfortunately, is a distraction from the game rather than a quick reference. I love the Kingdom Hearts series, but I didn't buy this guide for fanfare and souvenir. It will probably be best to go to a gamer's website and download a copy of someone else's guide and/or walk-through as this guide is sorely lacking utility."},{"rating":"1","title":"KH2 Guide","review":"Now KH2 is a very easy game so I personally dont think a guide should be bought.Now for one they give a map in this game which is very useful and the maps are very easy to locate so their isnt much of a problem their.Secondly health items are very common and you can buy them from moogles.And lastly it feels so much better knowing you beat the game by yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite out of the series","review":"Out of the ones that I have read thus far, this is by far my favorite! Morrigan is indeed impulsive and arrogant, but she's also strong willed, caring and pretty confused about her feelings a majority of the novel... but, that's what makes the story so great---she actually seems like a real person! If she only portrayed characteristics that embodied perfection, she'd be absolutely boring.Another reason I loved this novel was because it was friggin' hilarious at times. I almost died laughing when I was reading about her skills at cooking and cleaning. I also like that all the books in the story end well, and so I'm always content--- other than wishing they never ended.

Felt if she had been more written up as the clever hard nosed business woman from a super high tech planet there might have been more of a premise or a main character whom you want to follow and root for.

In the beginning of the novel, the catty other brides-to-be made a big deal about Morrigan finishing her uploads first, unlike some of them who didn't even bother watching a single one. So why did she suddenly become the fish-out-of-water can't-do-anything-right helpless heroine trapped by Mr. Caveman and his customs? WTH? Her ignorance of their customs and deliberate insults bordered on racism.

We also use for biscuits, pancakes, tortillas, scrambled eggs, french toast, waffles....everything that we want to keep warm. And, it keeps food perfectly warm for 1/2 hour or more.

I was lucky to receive it just before a Christmas party at my home. I'd made pork green chili which was served with warm flour tortillas on the side. This worked wonderfully for the medium size tortillas I used. The very large tortillas available now are too large to fit properly. But, it easily kept the smaller size warm for about an hour and fresh overnight (I forgot them). I've also cut up bread that is hot or warm and they remained warm and fresh throughout the meal. Since it's microwave safe, it also allowed me to microwave a few rolls for dinner and take them directly to the table. So, next I'll try soups and stews for rewarming. It's not beautiful, but it's solid and the functionality is the most important factor. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but ugly","review":"This is a really impressive item. It actually does what it says: It keeps things warm without a hassle. No cord, no need to heat ahead, etc. You may want to leave the lid a little loose with waffles, etc., so they don't get too moist from the humidity. It is large enough to put a bowl in to keep soup (for example) warm, which is when having a tight lid is great.My only complaint: Isn't there any other color possible? Red? Blue? Yellow?

Now it wasn't exactly a movie I hated with a passion, but it's definitely only a one-time watch for me. If you're familiar with the old Jason, you probably won't like this - obviously. They had a few of the same kills as they've already done in the original movies, which I thought was really lazy. I mean, a part of the film maker's favorite things to do with the series was create NEW and INNOVATIVE deaths amongst the characters. Not to mention, Jason decides to keep one of the campers chained up in his house and not even kill her... yeah, right. Like Mr. Voorhees would be caught dead letting anyone live. I don't know, I guess I just need to stick to the old movies. That doesn't mean I'm gonna pass up on making fun of the sequel when it comes out though.

I would also like to state probably one of the better horror movie reboots that I have seen. First off the film had great actors in the film (Which is better than the older ones where they only had one decent actor). The script is also decent. Also they didn't do anything to drastic (Like sending him to Manhattan or Space).They did change Jason a little he seems faster stronger and he seems a little more territorial (we also don't have to wait for two more films to come out to see him in his hockey mask). But at the same time of not doing anything to drastic the film it's self in a lot of ways is too similar to the original. Some might like that but majority won't (even some of the cast die in similar was).

I really got the impression the author had done a little reading on these ideas and then decided to write his own book. Here's a sample of the writing style - on the topic of the Islets of Langerhans (the structures in the pancreas that produce insulin) he says \\"Instead of picking on these little guys because of the funny name, you should know that these guys produce... insulin\\". As for his diet, it's either well-known information (don't eat excessive sugar), or is stated without adequate justification (like eating complex carbohydrates in the day and protein at night). I'm not saying it's incorrect, I'm saying it needs justification and discussion. And as for the diet itself, with a title like the Evolution Diet, you might wonder why it contains amongst other things Cheerios, popcorn, Triscuit crackers, and diet root beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"This was a pretty amateurish book, IMO. I'm not an expert, but the timing of when you should eat various things seems dubious at best. Hunter/gatherers ate what was at hand. If they killed a large animal in the morning, I doubt they waited til evening to eat it.But what made this book the most amateurish was the extremely poor English usage. It seems like at least every page had an extra \\"it\\" where it didn't belong, or lacked \\"the\\" where there should have been one. I think this was caused by a failure to proofread. I cannot take any writer seriously who publishes a book with this many errors. After about 1/3 of the way through, I just scanned the rest of the book, having lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does eating broccoli for 9 hours sound??","review":"Yes the information is interesting but unfortunately not practical in the slightest. I would have imagined a diet called 'the evolution diet' would be based around fruits, veg and meat. This diet however calls for buttered toast and orange juice for breakfast followed by 9 hours of broccoli and banana or Triscuit crackers and carrots. A chicken wrap or burrito for dinner is hardly what 'natural' man (or the 'Hunter Gatherer') was eating in Central Africa!. I wouldn't be wasting your money on this one - borrow from the library for a laugh because it seems like that's what the author is doing all the way to the bank - while eating his danish, bagel and orange juice might I add(pg 70)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk science, silly diet, bad prose.","review":"I was wondering what foods humans evolved eating and if it would be sensible to eat predominately those foods nowadays, so I bought _The Evolution Diet_. It has nothing to do with any of that. I expected it to discuss evolution and early human diets, and why certain foods are more suitable for humans than others. It doesn't. I expected it to make scientifically supported claims about diet and nutrition. It doesn't. When it does cite a source, it's often an article in _Redbook_, not a peer reviewed one from the likes of _Nature_. The book is high-school-term-paper-grade fluff surrounding a weight loss plan.

Perils contains too much soap opera, and John Lund is almost a statue. But Betty shines once again in the musical numbers, proves herself to be a fine comedian, and she could act! Enjoy.

This is why greater emphasis is being placed on family-based approaches to therapy, rather than seeing the child alone. Particularly in challenging family situations--such as with foster and adopted kids--we now understand that parents must resolve losses from their own past in order to facilitate the child's healing.This is one of the first books to bring this reality to light. While the 'how-to-do-it' section is a bit brief, it lays the foundation for this premise in ways that parents and practitioners can easily understand. After this, read the newer works by Daniel Hughes, Ph.D.I like how the authors balance the clinical (of Dr Siegel) with the practical (of Mary Hartzell). This brings a nice balance that makes the book accessible for most readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is very interesting and provides a very useful and unique perspective to parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I found this book to be horrible.

The plastic containers that each of the 4 seasons comes in, looks like the old tricorder Bones McCoy or Spock use to sling over their shoulder when they would be part of a landing party. The disc themselves are in a deep blue DVD holder case opening like a book, with 5 \\"pages\\", one \\"page\\" to store each disc.

On the first episode I could see major halos around the uniforms in the scene where Archer was talking Hoshi into coming on the trip while she was in South America.

Bakula established himself in the sci-fi genre with Quantum Leap, and plays Captain Archer in this Star Trek prequel. The trio listed here make for a curiously unique portrayal of first-time deep-space explorers: spanning the extremes from child-like wonder to homeland security. Jolene Blalock provides the first glimpse of human-vulcan inter-play, and looks remarkably 7-of-9 in her uniform, from the neck down. Perhaps the best character is Dr. Phlox, well-played by John Billingsley. Phlox rivals the other Enterprise doctors, holding his own against them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERPRISE","review":"Star Trek-Enterprise has been taking a lot of fire.

I have found Star Trek-Enterprise to have plot depth and craftsmanship, series continuity, and character development. I think they are excellent and very well done.This complete series collection is well done. I found no video or sound problems and a lot of extras. The menu presents a short learning curve and there is a minimum of overpackaging. Wish there could have been a fifth and final season to tie everything up and make for a more complete story.The series should have been given that chance.

The network HD showings were spectacular, especially the opening. The eye-poping picture you invite your friends over to see what Hi-Def truly is.

Himself a Jew who was taken captive by his Roman conquerors, Flavius Josephus became an accomplished historian of his day and his writings demonstrate an intimate knowledge of the Romans and Jews of his time. His writings offer insights into Jewish history, religion and customs as well as the war which ended Jewish independence for nearly two thousand years.As with any account of history, this one bears its own biases and preferences. Begin with a personal study of Josephus and his background and what we know of the production of his historical accounts. From this starting point, however, nothing will prove more satisfying than reading the words of Josephus (in translation) for yourself! This volume begins with the historian's own autobiography and it only gets better as one continues to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"I know this author personally and this book is written in first person.

The reader witnesses a series of stressful trials and tribulations told from several perspectives. Murray then skillfully references scripture and inspirational passages as encouragement and support for the characters and reader. She also illustrates the effects of making poor choices and the importance of \`doing the right thing' at all times. She also reinforces positive, clean, Christian living and shows how to hold fast to faith even when bad things happen to good people.This was an excellent sophomore novel to \\"Temptation\\".

I could not remove the connector from the plugs to reverse them but was able to reverse the connection coming off the lamp which solved the problem.

Riker is there only for comic relief. There seems to be a lot of discussion of this sex-bomb. Too much seems to dwell on issues that does not concern plague. It took a long time before I realise the architect of the plague was being referred to and this story is where the villain gets defeated.

It was a HUGE mistake to try and act like that was some clever crossover and REVEAL.For as a hollow an experience the last episode might have been, at least it was entertaining.

The more you watch the 4th season, the more you realize that UPN made a mistake cancelling this show.

I just hope that they follow up on some of the story lines with movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best and Last Season","review":"By far, season four of Enterprise was its best. Under the writing direction of Manny Coto, the fourth season did a much better job of embracing accepted Star Trek mythology and using it to develop the series. One of the best story arcs was a three-episode run featuring Brent Spiner as Dr. Arik Soong, the ancestor of Commander Data's creator Dr. Noonien Soong. The episodes revolve around a group Khan-esque supermen left over from Eugenics Wars and Soong's attempts to bring several Augment embryos to life. The second great story arc of the season was a three-episode story about the re-embracing of Surak's teachings on Vulcan and featuring the introduction of a young T'Pau. These three episodes allowed Jolene Blalock a great opportunity to really embrace her role. I wasn't a big fan of the final two episodes, but overall this season was their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ending EVER!!!!!!","review":"I have never been so disappointed with an episode of star trek in my life as I was with this ending.

Seasons 1 - 3 were fantastic they followed an explicit storyline and after each episode I was eager to watch the next one, but Season 4 definitely didn't offer any excitement and after the first episode I wasn't eager to watch the rest. All I can suggest is their (the writers)imaginations had dried up.

It is a pity that so many good ideas got wasted and not developed any further in this season.There are excellent performances from extremely good actors like John Billingsley, Jeffrey Combs, John Fleck. It is a pleasure to watch and to listen to them.The last episode was not satisfying in so many ways with characters out of, well, character.In fact, as a family of 4 we decided to imagine a better ending and keep it at that.Watch for the reconstruction of the original series bridge: it is remarkable.Don't have any high expectations from this one but go with the flow and you will have a good time anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why this was next to last episode.","review":"After cannibalizing nearly all of TOS series, they ran out of ideas.

And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races, echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year's shows. This is new? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more. This last season was certainly painful to watch. I did enjoy most of season three however, and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make, making it a truly deep emotional engaging show.

When they finally died I tried to get a deal and switched to Oster brand. They were not nearly as good so I switched back to Wahl. This product damages their brand. I could not even get 1 complete haircut before the blades were putting 3 stripes in my hair. After 3-4 trims they were completely dull.

The box cover did not even fix. The clipper was made with very cheap plastic and some scratch was seen. There is huge noise when turn on. Finally unable to cut in 6 months. Just pull hair. I am very good in maintaining. It must be product defect. Try to contact the manufacture: To send this back for repair will cost $11 postage. Not worth to exchange with another cheap one. This was bought on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased \\"Wahl 79450\\" from seller \\"Brand Variety\\" a few months back","review":"I used to own one of these and I decided to buy another...well, turns out that either the product was a fake/counterfeit/after-market/not original, as I immediately noticed that it wasn't running up to full throttle until after using it for a while. By the 3rd use, the clippers were hardly moving and hardly producing sound. It suddenly quit working without warning...I was so mad I put it in the trash where it belongs......I am not too pleased with this because I paid almost $30 for this back then and didn't even use it past a couple months.My advice to you is to avoid these brands and buy something more powerful like the \\"Wahl 79900N\\" which also adjusts the clipper blade height without having to use a guard/comb and most of all, AVOID BUYING FROM \\"Brand Variety\\" because they sold me junk and did nothing to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a shame","review":"its a shame that i bought this product thinking that what was promised in the product description was exactly what the customer will get.

The first item I had was beard and mustache trimmer I received as a gift. Didn't work, slow speed, didn't cut. That was more than ten years ago so I thought I'd give 'em another try. My mistake. Same problems. I've used Norelco and Conair and they've worked just fine. I recommend those brands, but do not purchase Wahl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst hair trimmer I have ever had","review":"If it would be possible to give this product 0 or even below zero stars, I would. I tried to shorten my beard with the trimmer today and the only thing it did was to pluck out some hair and stop when more there were more than 4 hairs to cut at once. I did not even try the battery powered second option, because those are usually worse than the ones with an outlet. Anyway, I would never buy this product, because even $19 is too much for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, Great product, Great buy!","review":"Having used Wahl's before I was looking at their product for my own set of clippers. My sister who cuts hair for a living suggested I purchase Wahl's as well. I got the clippers, and they already have paid for themselves double over I'm sure. Myself and a few buddies cut our hair on a weekly basis to stay proffesional looking. Clippers do a very good job on balding, as well as basic fades / high and tight cuts. The trimmer that is included is very nice as well, all though a little loud. But I certainly wouldn't think about getting a replacement for it unless it breaks. Over all I'm very happy with this purchase, and look forward to many haircuts with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLIPPER THAT PULLS HAIR","review":"I bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son's fast growing hair.

I realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair I buzzed. The little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair. I've decided to send it back.

However, I was wrong. It only took a couple of weeks for this thing to blow a gasket. The buttons for the reheat and bagel options decided to light up one day and stay on, resulting in burnt toast on one side. For the money, this thing sucks. I find that you can't get a good toaster anywhere, however a $15 one is a better bet than this one. They claim it's much more than they sell it for, but don't know why. I've just resorted to the fact that I will buy a new cheap toaster every couple of years. Maybe I will reinvent the toaster and become a millionaire. It doesn't seem like a very complicated appliance. But nobody can make a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, worked fine for about 5 months","review":"I purchased this toaster as a Christmas present for my parents, based on its attractive design and features.

You could not find a better toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned me and then broke","review":"I loved the looks of this toaster, and the pop-out feature so my preschoolers could make their own waffles. Not only did the product not work well, but it's dangerous as well.Although it is advertised as \\"staying cool\\", the chrome areas where the toast is inserted get quite hot. I was reaching over to get something behind the toaster, and my arm brushed against the hot chrome. Over a month later, I still have a large burn scar. With the forward-facing design, this is actually quite easy to do, and my 4 year old also has a small burn on his arm.In addition, the unit itself was very cheaply made, and it often took several tries for the unit to grab the toast and start toasting. Finally, after about 6 months, it got stuck, and we couldn't get it to work again. Into the garbage and good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk the damn toaster","review":"I purchased this white T-Fal toaster from amazon after reading the rosy reviews.

Started out with uneven toasting...ok, could live with that. Then, the toast would pop out sporadically. Then, not at all.Finally, wouldn't even stay down when inserting bread/bagel - nothing. That's when we finally gave up on it altogether. Incidentally, only two adults operated it, so it was not handled frequently or roughly. Also, it looks cheap - plastic, not sturdy. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only looks good","review":"I bought this toaster because of the looks and unfortunately, that's all it has to offer. The biggest problem is it takes FOREVER to toast. Even when it's \\"warmed up\\" it takes way too long. It also toasts very unevenly -- part of the toast is dark, other areas are completely white. Also the levers that lets you boost the toast up out of the toaster after it pops up are very cheap and get stuck almost every time you press them down. You have to pull them back into position.I do like the way it looks -- everyone comments on it, but I always respond by saying, \\"yes it looks good, but it's the worst toaster I've ever owned.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Toasting problem","review":"Several months ago, I purchased a T-Fal toaster. The toaster has some great features and I want to give it at least a 4 or 5-star rating but the toaster toasts only on one side of the bread most of the time. Interestingly, every now and then, it toasts both sides of the bread. Can you help me? I sent an E-mail to T-fal about this problem but never received a response and have been unable to contact you by phone. I called 800-395-8325, wait and wait and wait and, on several occasions before anyone gets to the phone, I'm cut off, thus this E-mail. HELP!

I agree with all the others: the toasting process is very unpredictable. Sometimes a \\"two\\" setting will get you perfect toast, sometimes it gets you burnt bread. Sometimes one side will toast, sometimes both. You have to babysit the toasting process at all times. The only good feature is the \\"stop\\" button and believe me, you will have to use it a lot.

I don't know what the judges based their opinion on. Toasting was very spotty with white areas next to golden brown, and those were next to areas that were burned. I tried three kinds of bread in the toaster before I decided to just return it and keep shopping. The only thing it did handle fairly well was a fourth item -- an English Muffin. I like my toast to be golden brown on both sides, with an even coverage of the browning. That's what I found with a Phillips toaster. I also saved money with the Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Reports is wrong! terrible toaster!","review":"We purchased this toaster a little over a month ago based on Consumer Reports rating this a great toaster. I do not know what toaster they tested, however it could not have been this one. Since getting the toaster it has consistantly demonstrated that it can burn toast and bagles at any setting. The worst feature is that you can burn something at setting 3 and lower it to 2 and it still burns or does not hardly even toast. The other poor design on the toaster is that it is very shallow. Any bread that is not of standard Wonder Bread size either is not toasted on the top or if it is a longer slice of bread will not fit at all.

The flash is surprisingly powerful and thus gives the camera a greater range. Red-eye is greatly reduced or eliminated and the ability use bounce-flash can enhance many photographs. The flash syncronizes with several digital cameras that I have tried and should syncronize with yours as well. The flash unit is not built like a tank and thus should be handled carefully.

This cannot be turned off.Unfortunately, when the camera flash strobes to help focus, it triggers the DF200 slave flash, and when the shutter snaps a half-second later, the Vivitar DF200 is not recharged and cannot flash. The picture is under-exposed, because the DF200 lit the subject beyond what the Rebel was expecting during it's focusing phase, and then the DF200 doesn't light the subject at all during the actual image acquisition.I'm returning the flash.

In the other games you have a mission to try to save something and you go around planets finding coordinates for other planets and secret bolts and things like that. In deadlocked all you do is get transported from planet to planet and kill some bad guys or screw in some bolts to beat it. Pretty much every challenge is like this and it gets really boring. There is pretty much no story to it. The shooting and the guns are fun but it gets really boring and the whole time you are waiting for something good to happen. Most of the enemies you fight are the exact same robots so that gets old after a little bit too.

I feel like the game lost its element of excitement and adventure. The new guns were interesting and I especially liked the napalm mod, but the music and limited space are very annoying. Also, the controls are altered, which really confused me at the start. The humor has changed into more of an adult type. I used to let my little sister watch the other R&C's, but I am nervous about having her taking in all the language and ruthlessness of this one. Once you get used to the new controls, the boring music, the blatant humor, and the monotonous arena battles, I guess the game is okay. Still better than the other games out there, but I expected better quality from Ratchet."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son just loves it.","review":"My son plays this game a lot.

The composer obviously meant them to either compliment the overall musical texture or heighten the ongoing drama. All of the recordings appear to be pulled from previously released performances from the late 80s. Muti employs his usual paint-by-numbers artistry, with little style or drama to speak of. His Anvil Chorus is particularly rancid. Engineering is a further drawback.

Not a chance!The first half (side) seemed more of an attempt to justify this forey into book writing & only the second half (side) got down to the subject matter. While I agree with some of Adam's criticisms of modern-day save-your-business rituals, he seemed to discount each really insightful and on-target point with silly attempts at humor that weren't funny enough to be effective.The tape is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED.

Meetings are waste of time, managers are stupid, and co-workers are imbeciles. I half expected this book to be full of these cliches. Not even close. Scott Adams does an excellent job of showing the humor of a job with smart observances and clever ideas. From the absurd yet funny comics, to actual written letters from organizations, and his own personal experiences - Adams gives out humor that is relevant, funny, and pertinent. His topics range from management, to consultants, to engineers, to marketing, and much more. He touches on all facets of the workplace in a manner that couldn't be handled well in a few comic strips.I'm working and getting my MBA now, and this sort of book tends to ground me.

In addition, Smith shares information that was not shared during the trial, which puts an interesting spin on things.However, this book seems fragmented and is poorly written...perhaps Mr. Smith was attempting to rush to get a book out about Longo first? It is in need of some editing!Also, I did not appreciate Smith's commentary near the end where he partially blames Longo's faith (and, it seems, faith in general) on what happened.This is an okay read for people who are fairly familiar with the situation, but I'm not sure anyone not familiar with the case could follow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Spin","review":"The author's focus on the religious background of Christian Longo appears prejudicial and sensationalistic.

She is dumbfounded when she realizes that it was her he wanted all along - not her sister as she had been led to believe (and who she was impersonating!) - it was all a scheme cooked up because he knew it was the only way to get her there. There are some really cute scenes where he baits her by pretending to critisize her \\"sister\\" (really her) by talking about rumors and other personality traits and claiming to find them offensive and unacceptable. Very hot and very romantic - makes you want to be swept off to the desert by a handsome sheikh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"as desert as the scenary","review":"terribly boring . she was so self centered that i am surprised she even noticed him . i couldnt believe that there were so many pages telling you the same without any story progresion ."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfying read","review":"Rebellious princess impersonates her older sister when meeting her sister's betrothed, a dynamic sultan, in order to help her sister get her daughter back from her in-laws.

Her plans go awry as hero fails to respond to her wiles as most men usually do.I really liked this Porter book. It was meaty & well-developed. The romance had depth, with the hero & heroine showing growth as the story progressed. I usually don't like heroines with numerous previous lovers but the heroine in this one was likeable, made no excuses for her strong sexuality, & surprisingly had her own brand of personal integrity. She was also tough & opinionated but not in an annoying way. I also liked the strong, very confident, & patient hero. He was sexy & touching in the length he took to pursue anti-marriage heroine.

There is only one AMAZING song on this album: KEEP QUIET! (How can I keep QUIET\\") KEEP QUIET is a DYNAMITE song! It is one of their best songs! So why did their producer foolishly put it as song number 4, when it SHOULD have been the album's first track number # 1 !

The songs all sound the same as they did before, both lyrically and musically. There's a good reason most Barlow Girl fans are between the ages of 10-14: they don't understand what good muisc is yet. There are only so many times you can say the same thing over and over again without becoming repentive, and they wore that out halfway through their first album. I'm hoping someday soon they leave the music business altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"How Can We Be Silent\\"","review":"I am inspired by artists for their honesty, their authenticity, and for their committment to inspiring and influencing others through a Gospel-centered lifestyle. Nobody's perfect (as we all know), but it's nice to know that there are still people out there who have a passion for reaching out to others, inspiring purity, modesty, honest, and so forth. Such is the case with BarlowGirl, as well as their CD-release \\"How Can We Be Silent\\". If anything, this album signifies people living in and persevering in a broken world, and not letting said world bring them down or prevent them from accomplishing the mission they've been given.My message to the band: Thank you for being great examples for so many others, especially young and teenage girls.

I was instantly captivated by the song and started looking up other samples of music by BarlowGirl. 20 samples later and I found myself buying their albums.How Can We Be Silent perhaps isn't my favorite album from them, but it does have my favorite track. Song For The Broken is just amazingly beautiful piece. This song rocks, and it has incredibly beautiful lyrics. I love BarlowGirl's style. They're very dynamic. They can rock hard, and they can play slow, soft pieces. And all the while, with some of the most beautiful lyrics I've heard in a while.Other pieces I enjoyed on this album include Here's My Life, Million Voices, Sweet Revenge, Take My Chances, and I Don't Regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock Sound, Great Message","review":"Barlowgirl has created another high quality rock album.As with their previous albums, the lyrics are unashamedly Christian. Their lyrics are always very bold about their faith. They combine that with excellent musicianship and great vocals. The harmonies on this record are outstanding.There are a couple of songs in this collection with a bit of a different sound. 'One More Round' in particular is a bit jazzy. This demonstrates an ability to create diverse sounds.Musically, this may not be quite as strong as their previous two albums. I particularly enjoyed 'Another Journal Entry'. Lyrically, this is their strongest outing yet. These young twenty somethings are rock solid in their message. In addition to song about the love of God, they also explore struggles in the Christian life such as brokenness, doubts, unanswered prayers, and timidity.This is a keeper. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame that this book is out of print","review":"Kinflicks is one of the few novels I reread regularly, because it always seems fresh and insightful and humorous. Lisa Alther, sadly, for all her gifts, has never been able to quite match this stellar achievement of her very first novel--an expertly woven narrative of past and present, of trauma and lessons learned and cycles yet to unravel. I'm also mystified as to why this book has never been made into a movie, since it contains numerous cinematic moments, compelling characters, and a gripping narrative. Critics in the other Amazon reviews don't seem to \\"get it\\"; both the humor and the lessons of the novel appear to be lost on them.

We are very pleased with the purchase and love how the colors look together. The only complaint is that the glaze on the white plates seems to be more fragile than the other colors -- after only a few uses the dinner plates were covered with very dark knife scratches. The Amazon review says that scratches from flatware can be \\"easily removed with a nonabrasive cleaner\\" but I haven't been able to get them off. I have also noticed some production flaws (small bare spots, etc.) but these are minimal, and overall I think that Fiestaware is a great deal. I love how the dishes can go into the oven and how they don't get hot when microwaved. Also, we're very clumsy and haven't chipped a piece after 6 months of use. I'm giving 2 stars specifically to the white setting (and most people are probably not buying Fiesta in white!).

There was nothing marked on the box to say that it had fragile goods inside. Inside the box, there were three of those air bags down at the bottom??? There was nothing protecting the dishes on the top, bottom or other side. I don't understand, anybody would be able to pack this box better. I'm still waiting for my replacement. I will post again once that one arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unknown","review":"Haven't received it yet. It's been a month, according to info from you it is due to be shipped in the middle of october"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobalt is really Cobalt Blue","review":"When I ordered Cobalt from the picture it appeared to be a different color than Cobalt Blue. Upon receiving the set, I found that the color is improperly labeled and Cobalt is really Cobalt Blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken item","review":"I was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and I needed to send it back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"good as always","review":"This product is excellent. I already had several sets of Fiesta, purchased more than six years ago, and all of them are holding up perfectly. I am careful to take good care of my belongings. I ordered two sets, and they arrived in a timely way. BUT one set arrived intact and the other arrived with the mug's handle broken off. This was a disappointment. Rather than making this someone else's problem and sending the mug to its doom in a landfill, we used some epoxy and did some reconstructive surgery. I hand wash this one (everything else Fiesta goes in the dishwasher), but otherwise it is perfectly fine. I do regret that the packing was inadequate. But... viva la wabi sabi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Fiestaware!","review":"The color is beautiful.The glaze is smooth.The dishes are very heavy & appear to be quite durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, you can still buy Fiesta Black!","review":"As a Fiesta nut, I have about every modern color that Homer Laughlin has produced -- except black -- until now.... What a pleasant surprise to visit Amazon.com and find it readily available.What can one say about Fiestaware that hasn't already been said? Timeless beauty, hard-wearing quality, reasonable cost, and the fun of mixing, matching and collecting the regularly-released new colors.With Fiesta, suddenly dinnerware stops being something you take for granted, something merely to serve as a more elegant alternative to a paper plate... And becomes something engaging, interesting, and the subject of conversation when entertaining guests.It's nice to have black pieces in my collection now. Thanks Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Etched and worn in a period of months","review":"I have owned these dishes for about 3 years now and am already looking to replace them. They look like I have had them for 30 years--etched terribly from the use of silverware. I am embarrassed to use them with company. I will never buy fiestaware again. What an expensive lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Mega China!","review":"I bought the Sunflower Yellow and assorted other colors of Fiesta Ware from Mega China, and I love it. Also, Mega China sent this product out really fast, and in perfect condition. They packed the product really nicely for shipping. And when I ordered mixed colors, I forgot to say in my order what mixed colors I wanted, but Mega China had no problem when I emailed separately to ask for specific colors. They were so helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dishes ever!!","review":"I was very particular when choosing my everyday ware as my last set of dishes were horrible. However, I love these!! The feel and look is perfect and they are incredible in the microwave!! Your food will heat as you want but the plates will not get overly hot. I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL COLOR","review":"IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND SHE LOVED IT. IT WAS A MATCH FOR HER NEW KITCHEN.NICE COLOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiesta 4 place setting/white","review":"I love the Fiesta Ware. I ordered the 4 place setting which has a mug style cup and not cup and saucer. Other dish settings had the cup and saucer and the cup wan't big enough and I never used the saucers. This was at a very good price. My old dishes were almost 20 years old and I had shopped several times for what I was going to replace my old dishes with and I love my choice. I can always add to it over the years and it will never go out of style. You can get replacement pieces which will save in the long run. I will never have to shop again for any thing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dishes","review":"These dishes arrived quickly in good packaging. They are beautiful, sturdy, shiny, attractive. I have already started using them. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice dinnerware-color deceiving","review":"Great product but looking at all the colors on line is tough to determine their true color. This color on line looks brick or reddish orange on the computer but it is really basic orange. I was hoping for the former. I will keep it but I am finding it is hard to \\"see\\" the real colors on all the fiesta dishes so I had to go to a local department store to determine what I will buy next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got what I needed!","review":"Have a group coming for the Holidays and needed to add to my set of dishes. Store where I originally purchased did not carry any longer. Went on Amazon and there it was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fiesta 4 piece place setting white","review":"We are very happy with our new dishes. They are a wonderful addition to our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"shamrock green rocks","review":"My husband saw the shamrock green bowl and ordered it for me. I have nothing else in that color so I ordered a place setting. It arrived yesterday. Its so pretty, the color is rich and even. It arrived fast well packed and looks great. I love fiesta.. its fun and durable and you can always add on and on and on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Others State Poorly Packed for Shipping...","review":"I am not going to bore you with my comments on Fiesta...I love it! As far as packaging goes, I didn't have any problems with my orders (all 3 shipments arrived safely.) For the price and promotions offered, you can't beat Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more bowls!","review":"I just bought the 4-piece place settings and extra plates and bowls. The quality is great, very heavy and seemingly durable and the bright yellow is beautiful! But why can't I buy more bowls the same size as in the place settings??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiesta Collection","review":"I just within the last year started collecting Homer Laughlin Fiestaware. I really enjoy using the colors together. They are all compatible and look great for everyday use. My children and grand-children love to set the table with coordinating colors. I have purchased at least one or two place settings of each color and plan to start collecting for my grand-children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and fun","review":"There are so many colors, shapes and sizes. The Fiesta ware is very strong and doesn't scratch or chip easily. The best part is that they're made in the U.S.A and will last you a lifetime!!!!! I ordered two settings and both arrived in two days (as advised) and in perfect condition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond pleased!!!!","review":"I only ordered one place setting because I must admit, I was a bit skeptical. However, I was ecstatic once I receive my order because it was exactly what I wanted and like my other settings. I have been collecting Fiesta for some years and am trying to build up my stock. This is genuine Fiesta and worth the money. The Amazon price was over half off what a place setting is in stors and with free shipping, it is definitely worth the buy. I plan to continue buying my settings from Amazon unless I run across a good bargain in the store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these dishes!","review":"I have tons of Fiesta, but I had not added Lemongrass to my collection until I purchased these. I love the color and will continue to buy fiesta as they will never go out of style, and the quality is fantastic! FYI for other collectors, the color is a bit more yellow than Chartreuse they discontinued a while back."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Fiesta Marks","review":"I bought the four piece placesetting, service for eight in white and was very dissapointed with it. The plates became marked with gray lines from using table knives and forks on them. I had looked so forward to having these dishes and ended up selling them in a local resale shop for a fraction of what I paid. They were so marked that I was embarassed to put them on my table. I wrote to Fiesta about this problem and they told me to use a cleaner for another product, which I did. I scrubbed and rubbed for about 20 minutes on each plate and never was able to remove all of the marks. That's when I decided to get rid of them. I've since asked friends about their experience with Fiesta and no one has had a problem although none of them have them in white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Surprised!","review":"I ordered 10 different sets, in many different colors and was happy surprised that none of them where broken or chipped when I opened them. They are wonderful, but amazons pictures of what colors they are, are completely off. I looked at the colors on dillards website to pick out the right ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiesta Dishes","review":"I have several place settings of Fiesta Dishes. I ordered 2 more place settings recently and was dissapointed with them. The dishes are warped and don't stack well with my other dishes. These dishes are apparently rejects. I love the idea of the Fiesta brand but these were not like my others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love this dinnerware!","review":"The thing I love most about these dishes is the size of each piece. The coffee cup is a small mug, the bowl is flat in the bottom, which helps avoid spills and the plate and saucer are small enough to limit huge portions. The jury is still out on whether or not they will break or chip easily, but thus far, I love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiestaware--Turquoise: a color all its own","review":"Fiestaware in and of itself is a superior complement to any homemaker's table, but \\"Turquoise\\" surpasses all in color. The pictures shown on-line don't come near to its vibrance and eye-appeal. A must have color to add to your open-cased cabinet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Place setting","review":"I read the title wrong. I thought I was getting a setting for four. One of the cups came chipped and I made a note of it on here. I never got a response. I decided to keep it. I am not going to buy any more sets. I saw a few days ago at Kohls, they have the same set. It was probally cheaper with your Kohls discounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Fiestaware...","review":"The Shamrock color is one of my favorites (as is plum, persimmon, cobalt, turqoise...) The only reason the place settings don't get five stars from me is the bowls are too wide for my dishwasher rack and create all sorts of headaches when it comes to loading the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is not accurate","review":"The color here looks really light green, but in actuality it is a true shamrock green. The difference is huge from what you see here and on the Fiestaware web site. It's more grass-colored. The quality is fine, but the color is seriously misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A copy is a copy sometimes","review":"Although I would buy other pieces compared to the original Fiestware, this line is a dissapointment. I bought two (4) piece sets in Cinnabar and Cobolt. The color is on the weak side and the Cinnabar bowl had an imperfection in the glaze. I just didn't have the time to return it.Like I said, I would buy more because I love the array of colors but this is an ok knockoff and nothing more if you're familiar with the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiestaware Persimmon 831 4-Piece Dinnerware Placesetting","review":"Really poor color matching. The cups weren't even the same color category as the plates. Some pieces never arrived many weeks after the order. Trying to return it introduced us to the nonexistent customer support department at Amazon. Their emails don't accept replies (I wonder why) and just try to find the form for submitting a message - it's buried so deep in their site I'm suprised it wasn't crushed by the weight of all the pages above it. And then, when you do submit a message, no one reads it...you just can a nonsensical canned reply. In the future I wouldn't buy anything from Amazon I couldn't afford to lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibrant color! Very pleased...","review":"Ordered two place settings of this color (evergreen) and 2 place settings each of 5 other colors. I can't wait till we have company! They are so vibrant! Regular shipping was fast, and they were packed really well. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"New dishes","review":"Actually I have purchased 4 sets of the Fiesta. I needed a fresh look and new dishes. Based on past experience Fiesta was the logical choice.Nice dishes, microwave usable and looks good on the table.Recommend it (in any color) as a very good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss POOR !","review":"This was the worst shopping and service, I have ever had shopping on line. I would suggest to shop some where else , if you can !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing with Disappointed","review":"I'm glad I bought this book used at a yard sale. The author seems to be more absorbed with trite and somewhat contrived witticisms than with dispensing helpful knowledge. There is an element of bitterness I don't find helpful at all. The writer is childish and petty at times, all the while giving 'advice' on what to do with and for children. Although writing this book might have been cathartic, the author might have better spent her time with a therapist rather than purging into written drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I regret buying this book, I felt the author was imature and maybe not yet over her own divorce. I could not decipher whether the author was portraying herself as an attorney, physcologist or divorced mother. Having gone through a divorce myself I had hoped that this book would give me hindsight but came away pondering if the author realizes as I came to realize that it takes two to make a marriage just as it takes both parents to make a civil divorce for the children involved. I wonder if the author has yet to realize from the tone of her book she is quite likely a part of the problem. I found no solutions in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"String Quartets 9 & 12","review":"String Quartets 9 & 12 is a 1992 EMI Records Ltd recording starring the Britten Quartet. Jan Smazcny has written the music notes and we have a wonderful photo of the composer himself. Also included is a short biography of the Britten Quartet. Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasing chants","review":"I bought this to use during massage sessions. It is definitely chants so is suitable for some times when repetition is not an issue.
