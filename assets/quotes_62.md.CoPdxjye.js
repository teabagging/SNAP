This should have been released in an expanded version, or at least the original broadcast should have been left intact. Why not release a chopped up classroom version afterwards? Good luck peddling it to classrooms.

I was looking forward to this mini-series. You just can't condense history into this amount of time and do it justice. This movie has quite a few errors, some very, very bad acting (I won't mention names), and just made a mish-mash of history. I have fond memories of Centennial, but I haven't seen it since it first aired and I was much younger and less knowledgeable about the era. I'd love to see it released on DVD. As for this, maybe I would have liked it better if I wasn't so familiar with the real history. Even then, I had a very hard time following the main white family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the purchase....GREAT MOVIE!!!!","review":"This is a wonderfull piece of cinematography. The story line and characters are amazing. It should be taught in all schools as an important reminder of our past. I once had a teacher that always quoted something to the effect of \\"Those who do not know their past are doomed to repeat it.\\"This movie is action packed, heart breaking and inspirational all at the same time. The directors and producers have truly out done themselves with this masterpiece. It makes you feel so much for the native Americans of this great land. I am inspired to learn more about the native tribes of the U.S. and to explore more of my Cherokee background.There are so many layers to this that I cannot even begin to do it justice.Just buy it, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The West","review":"The movie was excellent, very educational, even though the \\"Wheelers\\" were a fictional family. The events leading to the development of the \\"West\\" shows just how unjust our country was during this period of American History.My grandchildren have seen the movie and it made for great family discussion. I recommend this movie for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the West","review":"I have read all of the reviews and I will not buy this dvd until it is complete.

I'm very disappointed. This was going to be aChristmas gift for someone who doesn't have cable and didn't get to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The West","review":"This movie is one of the best western movies i have ever watched. It told the story of the west like it was and didn't water down the realities of the injustices done to the American Indians. Most people have posted that they are missing chunks of the movie and that it ends terribly. You have to make sure that you watch each part of the movie though. Each disc has Episodes, and if you finish the first episode on the disc and do not go back to the main menu and select the second episode on the disc you will miss pieces. Everything is explained in the movies. I didn't find any piece of any of the characters stories unexplained except for Abe Wheeler's. The movie is very long and runs around 12 hours. It will entertain you for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY","review":"THIS SI ONE OF THOSE FOLLOW THE FAMILY THROUGH TIME AT TIMES YOU LAUGH OTHERS IT WILL RIP YOUR HEART OUT BUT IT WILL KEEP YOU WANTING MORE"},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Stars for Into the West!","review":"I've waited almost a year to re-watch Into the West on t.v.

It isnt even listed as being edited or cut at all. Honestly, cutting scenes out of a movie that has already been seen on network television just isnt right. Most of the audience out there wants to see all of Into the West, not a watered down version. High school history classes included, besides with what these kids see on TV and movies as it is why even bother sensitizing history. Why dont we cut out half of Saving Private Ryan or other favorite but bloody educational movies.So what I want to know is: when will Ted Turner come out and give us the real thing? Maybe even with extended footage eh? Cause, honestly, pulling tricks like this on his customers has to have them rattling the ratings chains... I'd say he owes us!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited to Pieces","review":"I found this DVD collection extremely frustrating. Good characters and acting, but the worse editing I have ever seen. Huge gaps that leave the viewer in a state of total confusion. For instance, why did the mountain man Wheeler leave the love of his life, his Indian wife, for what looked like fifteen years? Why didn't he know where she was? What happened to Keri Russell? I heard that she married an Indian chief, but why didn't I see that? Did I turn my head to look at something else in the room and miss it somehow? Did the original series really end with George pecking at his typewriter? That seemed to be a weak, bleak ending leaving him there at the school with the maniacal master. Later I read on line that the set had been edited for use in the classroom. What a mess. Whoever did this took a great story and reduced it to tatters. Why would these people imagine that tatters make a good school lesson? Does anyone know where or how I can see the full version that was on TV?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the West -- Unedited, Uncut","review":"This miniseries is severely edited in its commercial DVD release. However, it was issued in its entirety, as televised, for Emmy consideration to Emmy members.

What a shame the commercial release is not complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've noticed that a few other reviewer's have compared ITW to Centennial. ITW,unlike,Centennial introduced characters and then \\"forgot\\" about them. Example: What happened to Kerry Russell's,\\"Naomi Wheeler\\",her Indian Chief husband & their child???? What happened to Abe Wheeler??? I found ITW a giant let-down. The cast was first-rate.

My husband and I were hooked from the first episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good history lesson","review":"The only thing wrong with this movie is they didn't take time in the last episodes to work on the characters. It needed to be finished a little better. All and all it is a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into The West Review","review":"Although the film was somewhat intertaining, it was far from being histoically accurate as advertised.

I was however, very disappointed when we watched the dvd that I ordered from you. It didn't have the whole story as the TV version.

I would not recommend this dvd if you watched the mini series on television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Us A Real Box Set!","review":"I got \\"Into The West\\" as soon as it was released on DVD. It was chopped up, the \\"extra\\" stuff was just bogus and there was no soundtrack as originally promised. As a matter of fact, TNT and Dreamworks haven't released the soundtrack!! Only some bogus \\"music inspired from the movie\\" which other than a reworking of Sarah's song, wasn't interesting.There are some great scenes cut from the movie,too, that weren't even in the version shown on TNT. Kerri Russel's character had a real neat saga that they did not pursue. Her camp was attacked and she was taken back by white soldiers whom she escapes from to go back to her Native family.Give us a real box set, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"World On Fire\\" NOT inspired by this","review":"Sarah McLachlan released World On Fire in 2003 - TWO YEARS BEFORE the mini-series.

I watched it on TNT and really enjoyed it. However, I am not going to buy her an edited version."},{"rating":"1","title":"has the full version ever been released?","review":"I agree with the poor reviews.

The DVD should have more......Does anyone know if the full (uncut) version was ever released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Hype","review":"Bought this series for my mom and dad, who ONLY watch Westerns. I saw the great rating on amazon and expected something epic like Lonesome Dove Series....it definitely was not as good as Lonesome Dove. The beginning starts really good and then it slowly becomes more and more boring. More and more characters are introduced into the story, until it becomes over complicated and you lose any real concern or connection with the characters. I stopped watching in episode two, My parents finished the series and said it was (at best) \\"ok\\". If you are really bored...Get it! If you are expecting a remarkable Western, brace for possible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I was deaf","review":"This CD made me wish I was deaf. The vocals are truly horrible. It is as if Robert Smith had a tone-deaf son with Down Syndrome. The instruments are decent, and at times catchy, but in order to appreciate them I had to focus all of my energy on ignoring the mind-numbing singing. Some people should not start bands. And the singer of this band my friends, is one of those people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jar Gasket","review":"Item is excellent product and it is designed to fit the special jar I have.

Thanks Amazon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great texture, but they stink!","review":"I cannot believe how much these smell like chemicals! I tried soaking them in water and baking soda. I soaked them in vinegar. I hung them on an indoor clothesline for one month and they still reeked! After two months the smell dissipated enough to finally use them. But I'd never put something delicate in the jars. They still smell months later!

I was real close to just throwing the canisters away until it dawned on me....check Amazon! There they were! So, for a few bucks, took off the old hard cracked rubber gaskets and replaced them with these and they are like new again. I store coffee in one canister and now when you put fresh ground coffee in and then open the container up after a while you get a blast of air from the pressure release from the beans as you should get in a properly air tight container. So glad I found these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like others say - don't measure your old rings, they're all stretched out!","review":"Like many others, I thought I'd ordered the wrong size when these arrived. Compared with the old ones, these seemed tiny. But that's becuase the old ones are all stretched out. For regular-size jars (an average man's hand barely fits through the mouth), this is the size you want. It's a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find","review":"This has been an item I have needed for my kitchen canasters but could not find. Work wonderful to seal them tightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I had been searching for gaskets like these for quite some time.I have lovely glass canister jars, that I bought well over 30 years ago. They have wooden covers with rubber gaskets. The gaskets, understandably, had become dry and brittle. But aside from that, there's nothing wrong with the jars - and I still love them.I finally purchased these gaskets because another reviewer was kind enough to give the exact measurements (.90mm/3 1/2\\") in their review. That's how I knew they would work.They are made well, and form a nice tight seal.Best of all - I can take my jars out of retirement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement","review":"I looked all over for this product and was happy to find them on Amazon.com This product fit my need perfectly and I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks For Saving My Glass Storage Jars","review":"My clear glass storage jars have been around since the early 80's, and I am ashamed to admit that the rubber gaskets got so dry that they crumbled in my hands when I tried to remove them. I was ready to toss the whole set into the trash (no good anymore right?), when I decided to research the internet and find if there was a way to save them... Yay, there is and Amazon carries these Fido gaskets. The gaskets arrived in a few days (quickly shipped) and my glass storage jars look as good again as the day I bought them. Thanks Fido and Amazon! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I have been looking for!","review":"I have a set of cool old fruit jars that I use as canisters for flour, sugar, etc. The rubber seals have long since lost their flexibility and I've been looking for replacements for ages.

Thanks to the prior reviewer for posting the gasket size - it helped me verify these would fit instead of relying on trial and error."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SILICONE!","review":"I'm glad to see that these seals are not cheap Chinese, but Italian manufacture.

The sand sharks are great fun.But then they're dispatched by an \\"atomic bazooka\\" - need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"Bought this for my kids ages 10, 7, and 5.

We'll probably hang on to this one forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Ravensburger Enchanted Forest Game","review":"This is a great game for anyone. We have a 9-year old and a 5-year old and both of them are able to play on their own and enjoy this game. My wife and I love it, too. Easy to set up, easy to understand and play, fun for kids of all ages, doesn't take forever to play a game. A perfect game for any occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite childhood game!","review":"I remember this being my favorite board game to play with my brothers when I was a kid. I bought it for my own children (aged 3-11) this year and it has been a hit. It is fun game for itself and not just something to be endured for the children's sake (like never ending games of Candyland).This is an excellent board game for parents to play with their children. I would recommend that kids be at least 5, but younger kids can play because it doesn't require reading. It is a fun combination of memory and luck. The board game is in a fairy tale setting with interesting pictures to look at. I rated this 4 for educational value because it is designed to be fun, not to teach something. It is also more durable than the average board game, but it is a board game and can be crushed or damaged by a determined child so I gave it a 4 for durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanted","review":"I grew up playing this game and somewhere in college lost it.

I had it as a child and I have been looking for it for years. I am 34 now and I still love to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"My 7 year old loved it after the first time. Stimulates memory, challenging and strategic thought. Exciting because there are always different paths to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family, young and older","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews on Amazon, and I'm glad that I did. This is a fun filled, thought out game that will keep the youngest of your family and the oldest entertained. Fun and colorful, I recommend this highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game Board","review":"This is one of the best game boards that I've ever bought for my son and I bought a lot of them. He wasn't as thrilled as with this game. He just loves searching for the treasure on the enchanted forest and try to outsmart me and others. We could literally play with him for hours. By the way, my son is only [...]. I would recommend this toy to all the parents who is looking for a great game board for your kids.Thanks a lot to the company who invented this idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Watching Paint Dry ?","review":"If so, then this game is right up your alley. I bought it for our 6 year old daughter after reading the rave reviews. Ummmm .... unless we were doing something seriously wrong, I dont get what all the excitement was about. Its dull, it takes FOREVER to get through, and it was a definite Christmas miss at our house. The overall concept sounded great, but the execution was lacking. That being said, the game components are of a beautiful quality, and Im sure that even with a lot of play, that this game would last quite a while. Not our cup of tea, but if you enjoy spending upwards of an hour with a child's \\"no reading required\\" board game, and getting absolutely nowhere, then this is the game for you. Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Game","review":"This game is easy enough for young (4-5 years old) children to understand, yet it's also fun for adults to play. It combines the traditional roll-the-dice type of board game with the memory type of game. The object is to find the treasure under one of the trees and then make your way to the castle to claim your reward. Don't be too obvious about finding the treasure, though! If others think you've discovered it, they can steal it if they can make it to the castle before you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I. Bought this game because it looked like something a bit different and had decent reviews. It is so boring. My daughter is almost 7 and it barely keeps her attention. You have to keep repeating your moves and \\"peeking\\" under the pieces. Not very creative, very disappointed, especially after spending $20.00 on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This and the method books are a great way to start","review":"I bought this in order to supplement the method books I am currently studying. Its much more informative than the \\"Dummies\\" dvd and you will learn more. My only complaint is when using it to do chapter searches(get to a specific point) it is very confusing. It also would be better with a supplemental book that contains the songs you learn. Still buy it you will be glad you did.I would also recommend Hal Leonards Method books as well. Enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good choice!","review":"This course (DVD + Books) may not be the most fun, but it does cover all the bases better than any other SINGLE course out there. To tell you my honest opinion if having fun while learning the guitar is what you want to do, then I would say go with \\"Guitar Basics\\" by Bruce Buckingham and work your way up through the Musicians Institue series of courses. The main difference between these series is that Guitar Method starts with reading music and picking out \\"lame\\" melodies, where as Guitar Basics starts you out with playing chords and chord progressions. So the decision is really in the hands of where you want to start. Chords or notes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No impressed","review":"I bought this dvd because of the list of songs in Product Description. It says: \\"You'll learn to play the songs:....\\" but in most of the cases they are not the songs but small riffs. Also this dvd is difficult to navigate and you can not loop the exercises.I learn some tricks from the dvd but the bottom line is that I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No method, no teaching","review":"As a professional musician (not guitar) and teacher, it is possible that I approach this with a higher expectation of what should happen in an educational setting than most; but I am hard pressed to find a \\"method\\" to this DVD, or really to identify where any actual teaching occurs. All this DVD contains are mediocre demonstrations with no explanations as to how to do things or why they work. If actually taught, the material in this DVD would be great, but its really nothing more than a play-along DVD that leaves figuring out the why and how to the student. Further, there is no technique taught past elementary tips on holding the guitar (\\"most people hold it kind of like this ...\\") and holding the picking (\\"grab it like this and then make fine adjustments\\"). I've encoutered guitar lessons with better content and clearer instruction on youtube and am very sad to have spent money to purchase this DVD. Look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality and Quantity both inadequate","review":"There isn't much on this DVD - perhaps its only 40 minutes at most. It's only 11 very short songs, and a few riffs and licks, less than most guitar books. Also, the poor editing of the DVD makes practicing along with the DVD much, much harder than it needs to be. Do not buy this DVD without the book, or you'll never be able to practice enough to really learn the songs before you thow your guitar thru your TV. The idea of a DVD to go with a book is genius, and the material and the featured teacher are great, but they need more material, and a better idea of how a student might actually use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Horriable","review":"I just set a goal for myself to teach myslef to play guitar. This book is really good. I am learning fast and easy on how to play the guitar. The only down side is that the chords in the back of the book are hard to finger then some other ways. I bought my book used so the previous person had crossed out the chords and put in the easier ones to finger. Otherwise this book is a great starter book. This book unfortunatly doesnt have tabs for some of you people who can't read music. I can read music I have been playing the Tenor Saxophone for about 4 years now, so reading music comes easy to me. But yeah this book lacks the usefulnes of tabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I got this DVD along with the Guitar Method book 1. They came in a pack with a price of 25 dollars. They said it was on sale too! WRONG.This DVD is HORRIBLE. Basically, all you need to know is, do you know how to take care of your guitar? Hold your picks? Basic stuff. You know what? You can find these tips EASILY on internet. What else does the DVD offer? What the book, Guitar Method 1, has. You do not need to watch this DVD at all. It has repeating information that you'd see in books. Why would you spend money on this piece of... nothing?Now you may be thinking, \\"maybe the DVD shows us how musics are played.\\" No. The book gives you everything. You do not need this DVD at start.For the Guitar Method books, buy the complete set. It is 15 dollars for the complete set while each book of this series is about 10 dollars each. Once you finish the book 1, you'll want the book 2 and 3 to finish the series of learning sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling it Animorphs should be a crime","review":"I absolutly love the books. They are awsome they are great this is not. This series is so bad I can't stand it. The books are wonderful and full of battles and aliens. This has no real battles. Morphing is only showed half the time. You never see an entire andalite at once. The Hork Bajar just stand there. The taxxons are not in this. The acting was absolutly terrible. If only this series was good. Animorphs had so much potencial so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good...","review":"If you ask me, you should read the books first, then watch the movies. The other way around kinda spiols it. I like how the movies are visual, I am a visual person after all (kinda). I still think that the books are better than the videos because they have a longer storyline and a really interesting one, not that I am saying that the videos don't, because they do, they are just kinda dilluting it, that's all. Read book #1, then go down to your local video renting store and check out the first video in the series and you'll see what I mean. The videos are pretty good though, beleive me. The books are better, however, if you want a really good book to read, choose the Holy Bible, God's word."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO K.A. , BOO NICK!","review":"I've not actually seen this video but from the picture on the front I think tha it's about tse episode based on book 12(?) \\"The Reaction\\" even though in the book it's Rachel who has a spontainous morping frenzy.

First off, some people have read the Animorph books and think they are great so they assume that the show and movies are just as good. Well, they're wrong. Take it from someone who has seen nearly the entire first episode. Second, The people who really like the show probaly are not hardcore Animorph fans and are more casual fans. A hardcore fan can tell the difference between the books and the TV show and movies. There are lots of other big problems, but this is the biggest. So read the books. Then you'll find the big differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but doesn't cut it.","review":"I loved the Animorph books when I read them, but the short-lived TV show on Nickelodeon had the wrong actors, cheesy lines, and no Taxxons.

The main story about the Cafe' I found to be brilliant, very thought-provoking and somewhat enchanting. The characters are very unusual, but the author makes them believable and makes you become emotionally part of the story. The stories that followed in this collection are all very well written, but a few lacked substance and I found some of them to be dry and disappointing as a reader in comparison to the first one in the book.

But once I started the book, I found that I couldn't put it down. There is one particular page that describes the feelings of a lover and the beloved, all I can say is that it hit me hard because the author showed me what I was doing to a certain person in particular.

On the other hand, someone could be a great man, but if his lover is induced to love him \\"violently\\" and impurely, then theirs will be that kind of love, and not as true as the other.

I found this book to have a much darker tone than all of Austen's work. Aiken takes the story on a path of brooding, sickness and poverty. The characters are drawn with a much heavier hand and seem to be generally bitter and unhappy in a very 20th century way. Worth reading, but if you read Austen to visit a happier, simpler era, this is not the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma Watson delights","review":"While you may not feel that Jane Austen would have taken the story in this direction, in Joan Aiken's hands the story is absorbing, detailed and delightful. Her style is more common sensical and tends to veer towards realism. Births, deaths, marriages that work, marriages that don't. Great style. Though she pays hommage to Jane Austen by completing Emma Watson, this is a book that can stand alone and face applause.

All but the last 6 oz. so I pumpity pumped the gurgling hose about 20 more times without luck. Maybe If I had used the smaller hose? It is built well, easy to set up and use.

Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though. Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself. I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered. I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum. They said \\"yep it might be\\" and that was it, no \\"we will get one right out to you\\" or ship it back for an exchange. They were very rude.

The plastic seems fairly thick and well molded. There's only three moving parts and the directions are simple (if you bother reading them).So what could go wrong?Ahhhh, as some people have already noted it appears the manufacturer produced a number of these without inserting the gasket/seal/o-ring/whatever between the black plastic top and the main body. So, it won't hold a vacuum. You will find this out as you're pumping like a MAD MAN and all you get is a hissing sound from the top. If you remove the screws holding the black top down, you can see where the gasket/seal/o-ring/whatever WOULD BE if you had one.Bottom line - hold off on buying until they work through this bad lot.

I pulled hard enough to risk breaking it off (which I did not want to do). I called the tech support line and the guy said \\"Yeah, some vehicles have a flap or other similar item that it can catch on, just depends. You'll have to drop the oil pan to get it out\\" No warnings, let alone a list of problem engines are in the enclosed manual. In case a waste of money.

Unfortunately I was unable to try the product out until it was past the amazon return period. The pumping function is broken as others have reported.

I ended up buying it from a discount supply store online elsewhere. The unit itself works amazingly fast. Its a couple pumps and go watch some TV for 20min.

The first one that was delivered had a broken gasket at the top of the pump, so it didn't hold any pressure/vacuum. I sent it back, and the next one had a broken bracket between the pump and tank. So the pump wasn't correctly supported. If broken out of the box, I can only assume the rest of it won't be far behind. I returned it and haven't re-ordered.

I was wrong. The first time I used it, I had to keep pumping it over and over and over and over to get the oil to come out (even after warming up the car). It probably took at least 20 minutes to get the oil out and I am not convinced it all came out. Plus, I did not think about the oil filter when I bought this. You still have to remove the oil filter, so you still have to put a pan underneath your car to catch the oil. So, I still have to use a pan, which is what I was trying to avoid. I was willing to live with these things, but the THIRD time I went to use it, it started shooting oil out of the lever that control the direction of the flow. In my opinion, I would save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not suck","review":"The pump in theory suppose to suck oil out of the dipstick hole. It did not do it for Honda engine.

I purchased it to change the oil on my 99 ML 320 because I got tired of paying $125 for an oil change. Anyway, after wrestling with it for 3 hours, I finally jury rigged a line up to my shop vac and sucked the oil out in 5 minutes.I would not recommend this product at all. I pumped my \\"a**\\" off for three hours and frankly even at my advanced age I can pee a better stream than what came out of the hose. The instructions say \\"Pump 10-12 times\\" and the flow will start.....total BS. Do Not Buy This Product unless you're looking to exercise your back and arms. It's just plain useless for oil changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well/no regrets.","review":"Works very well! Some reviews mentioned that it pulled the oil out slowly but i didn't find this to be the case at all, pulled out hot 40w easily. The only thing i would complain about is the rubber grommet that connects the dipstick tube to the larger evac tube, i'm going to find a reducing barbed union which will be a bit of a tighter seal."},{"rating":"2","title":"mess free oil changes","review":"This device gets mixed reviews, so I ordered it with some doubt. When it arrived I read the instructions and gave it a test using a bucket of water. It extracted the water and dispensed it back into the bucket very well.The real test came when it was time to change the oil in my Crossfire which holds 8.5 quarts of Mobil 1 0-40. The engine was very warm as we had just returned from an afternoon ride. The hot oil did take some of the curl out of the extractor tube, but otherwise it worked just as described.Once the oil had been extracted, I switched to dispense mode and transferred the old oil into a container that I use to take to the recycle tank.No muss, no fuss. This makes for a mess free oil change. And if you happen to overfill, it is easy to extract the excess."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is AWESOME!","review":"Ordinarily, I would have to put my vehicle on jack stands to change the oil. Now with this product I do not have to!!! The unit does a great job of extracting the used oil through the dipstick and in a matter of minutes the engine is completely drained. Replace the filter, add oil and you're done! The only thing I can say negative about this product is that it does not have a valve on the main suction tube to control the flow of liquids. This would definatly come in handy when pumping the used oil out of the tank and back into the quart bottles. To get around this dilemma, I flipped the lever from \\"extract\\" to \\"fill\\" and pumped the oil out of the tank. When the oil got close to the filling the quart bottle, I simply released pressure through the expandable plug. This technique seemed to do the trick! I highly recommend the MityVac MV7201 Fluid Extractor, especially if you own a BMW or Mercedes with the oil filter on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need some QA improvements.","review":"This is my second unit of Mityvac - used to have the 7300. Better then the 7300 because of the separate air pump, and the reversible flow.This particular unit did not hold the vacuum, so extracted out around 2L and then stopped. I could hear the fuzzing sound near one of the screws. Kept bumping and tighten the screws with no positive effect. Returned for a refund. I ended up with an unsuccessful oil check with 1/2 new and 1/2 remaining oil - wasted oil. Need better QA checks before getting these out for customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save some money, do it yourself","review":"I didn't know you could change your oil this way till I saw discussion in the forums about draining vs. sucking. The cost of an oil change at the dealership plus the time you spend waiting can add up. I figure I'll buy a quart or two of 0-40 per month and change my own oil. I got the oil filter through amazon as well as the wrench. Since my oil filter is on top I remove the filter, insert the tube and start pumping. If I need to change the air filters I can do this while the oil is draining. After the tube starts sucking air I remove it from the dipstick tube and put it in the waste oil container, flip the switch and pump the dirty oil out. My car is happy and so am I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mityvac 7201","review":"This fluid evacuator is surprisingly well made. It comes with several hose connections for use in various applications.

I had to get permission and an address to return the unusable one before the would send a workable one.Make sure the oil is warm, but not boiling before you try siphoning it - after you have done errands would work. I can get two-three oil changes done myself on one oil filter then I take it to my mechanic and he checks out my car's status.

Rubber stopper a bear to get out, even after lube.2. Tubing connections fiddly.3. Dispense/Extract valve sticks repeatedly.4. Final death occurred by implosion of the actual polyethelyne chamber. Just crumpled like a tin can. Made me jump about a meter, and got oil all over my driveway. Not like I used it more than a couple dozen times, in total, either.

At first, I had all the problems other people have described: it was not working at all, at most I would get about a few inches of oil in one of the tubes. Did all the steps prescribed, still no luck.Then I started to fiddle with a silver latch on the top of the device. The manual calls it an \\"expansion kit\\" in the product diagram, but does not otherwise reference it, what it is for, etc. I found that as I flipped that latch, oil came gushing through the hoses and into the evacuator. At last, what a relief!As a result, I am quite happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mityvac 7201 Fluid Evacuator Plus","review":"I used the Mityvac 7201 for transmission fluid evacuation, works fast and very well. I suggest using the largest diameter hose you can get down the dipstick tube for faster evac time . the hose kit that comes with the unit, adapts down to a smaller diameter , but I picked up larger diameter hose at hardware store. The 7201 holds plenty for most changes, and easy to pour out . It gets a little messy cleaning the tank and hoses for storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Seal & Pump only worked ONCE!","review":"I received product on time and it worked great the first time I used it on my Merc C300. Yeah the seal is missing, but it still had suction so I continued to use it. Even reading about the possible flaws: Seal (missing), Pump failure, No suction and the ability of switching between suction and extraction, I went ahead and gave it a shot. HEY USE MY BAD EXPERIENCE AND LEARN FROM IT. DONT BUY THIS!!!!! FIND OTHER ALTERNATIVES!!. The Pump completely stopped working after first use. Purchased in Aug 2010; used Sept 2010 (1st time) and 2nd use Feb 2011 (wife's car). IT came apart from the inside of pump mechanism. If anyone one wants mine for parts, I'll send mine to you.

Good luck if you decide not to head my warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well...but it's S L O W","review":"I had read about evacuators on a few forums - it works as described. No complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts.that said, perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve.The fill/drain capability looked appealing, but if you don't need to use this device to fill fluids, I would opt for the drain-only device - less moving parts, fewer things can fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to manually pump out the oil","review":"Returned the first one as oil would stop evacuating once the pumping stopped.On the second one, there was a leak where the tube inserts into the mityvac as the connector ring came off.

Most guys in the shop have the earlier model and it leaks at the pump portion after about a year of use. The 7201 has the pump externally mounted so there isnt any fluidcontamination of the seals. Also, it has a bigger tank and is way faster than the earlier models. I got this from Amazon for 1/3 the price of what the tool trucks are advertising. Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy garage asset","review":"I recently purchased this fluid extractor to perform oil changes on the 2 diesel cars we have. It works well and as advertised for that purpose and eliminates a lot of the mess of draining oil from under the car.

Previously, I had used a quart container with a pump top which took several minutes to fill and dispense 5 liters of fluid. Also, the procedure of refilling the container several times was quite messy with a considerable amount fluid ending up on my garage floor.Using my new Mityvac Evacuator Plus, I was able to fill the transmission in one simple operation by filling the Mityvac with 5 liters of ATF, setting the valve to dispense, and pumping the fluid into the transmission.The time and effort it saved me was considerable. I should have purchased this years ago.I'm now looking forward to replacing the fluid in my wife's VW Jetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, better to just hooked a drain valve and add a hose for a clean drain","review":"Air was leaking from the top side cover in between the two screws where the suction tube outlet is located.

After pumping till my arms got tired, I only ended up with about a quart of used oil, which in fact was at operating temperature. I'm sure if there was no leak, I wouldn't have had to pump as much. I ended up just draining from the bottom, which was 100x easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't hold a vacuum","review":"So far this has been a big disappointment, but I think it's due to a quality defect. I tried pumping the oil out of my BMW (8 quarts), and it took 45 minutes and 200+ pumps, and yes the oil was hot and the cap was off.Upon investigating, it appears the main plastic tube was poorly cut at the end--almost like a crimp, which won't let it seal with the second tube going into the dipstick. I will re-splice and try again, but even if that works, they get 2 stars for the out of box failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUICK and easy","review":"One of the best tools a DIY person can purchase.

It's about a young girl abandoned by her mother, a young boy molested by his uncle, and about no one being prepared to deal with death. It is about second-generation immigrants tenuously linked to the old country, about growing up and growing old, and about feeling all of those things. It is not a happy story, but it's not entirely depressing either. It's about ordinary life, which is sometimes disappointing, but nevertheless bearable, for most.Occasionally, I clean out my bookcases to make room for more, but some books don't get to go, because I'll read them again someday.

Within two months of use my left speakers went out. I opened it up to find that the motion to open them split the wire because they were not tucked away properly. Currently I have gone in and ghetto ridged the speakers to work. The core components are there but the assembley is bad. Sounds like other people are having better luck with theirs, just beware of potential problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I received the Altec as a gift and was excited to use it with my iPod. The sound quality just isn't there. It sounds tinny and certain higher notes that are heard with headphones and other speakers are missing with the Altec. It's like not hearing the violin in an orchestra. That's really annoying.

Copying large files over the Firewire attachment (I use my iPod to store big files that I want to work on at home) bogs the computer down to the point where I have to unplug the iPod and connect it to the cable directly. iTunes connection probably works okay, but there seems to be a problem with using the unit in full firewire disk mode.

Unfortunately, not satisfactory. The static that is continuously emitted from the speakers drives you crazy.

Yes, buy a different set of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Altec Lansing inMotion speakers","review":"Just about six months ago, I decided that my iPod should have a couple of speakers so I wouldn't have to use headphones all the time. I finally decided on buying these speakers on Tuesday, July 26 '05 from newegg.com. Newegg gave me an estimate on the arrival date which was Monday, August 1, '05. They, in fact, got to my house on Saturday, July 30. My expierence with these speakers is that they are FLAWLESS!!!! They do everything that I expected of them, and are extremely simple to use. They also put out an extremely high volume level before they start to distort, but all speakers distort at one volume or another. I am very pleased with these and I reccommend them to anyone who wants a good speaker system for a (lower) price. A+++++++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!

But it has one major flaw. The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves. After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars. But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy","review":"Though not very cool-looking like other models, the sound is nice for its small size.But this device has a major flaw: a very flimsy ipod connector. After just a few months of use, I noted that the volume would fluctuate, or go completely mute, for no apparent reason.It was the connector. My inMotion sits on my desk at the office, and I hardly ever take the ipod off of it. So there was not much chance of misuse.I now have to move my ipod around on the docking station in order to get it to work properly or at all. But any small bump on my desk can make it misfire.I cannot recommend it, and will most likely go Bose ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 2 ipods with no warning","review":"These speakers were awesome for a while.

From the first notes of that great riff, you know it's something special. That song sets up Alice Cooper's version of West Side Story. Alice's version has street gangs (Gutter Cats vs. The Jets) complete with a Street Fight, juvenile delinquents (Public Animal #9), nostalgia (Alma Mater) and even a Broadway style Grand Finale. Throw in the obligatory songs about insanity, necrophilia and tripped-out fantasy, add doses of humor and showmanship, and you've got Alice Cooper's formula for a great record. Alice would ride that formula for a few more albums before running out of steam, but this one stands among the best work he's ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Audiophile\\" Gold CD Flunks Sound Quality Test!","review":"Don't get me wrong,this classic Alice Cooper album is worth 5 stars in my book,but this gold CD offers no improvement in sound quality over the unremastered one (which you can buy dirt-cheap ANYWHERE!).It's still sounds thin and muddy,nowhere near as good as theBillion Dollar Babiesand theWelcome to My Nightmareremastered reissues Rhino put out a few years back.Save your money and buy/keep the old one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rhino!!!","review":"Don't buy this!!!

It is very doubtful that this is from the original analog master tapes, and even the liners are very vague on the source used. Sonics tell the tale. There is lots of definition and detail, excellent separation, and as good a soundstage as this can have. But it still sounds digital, unlike the earlier Huffman remasterings for the defunct DCC. Clarity is favored over warmth, and the high end - cymbals in particular - sound bright and exhibit digititis.Not a bad remaster at all, and betters the stock Warners CD. But not up to the standards of DCC, or for that matter, anywhere close to what the Mobile Fidelity true analog, and true original master standard is.Not worth the money.

Subsequently, it tears itsself apart and stitches itsself back up together, this time complete with an orchestra for \\"Luney Tune,\\" and \\"Grande Finale,\\" along with layers of texture and arrangement evenly divided upon each track of rock n' roll, alcohol-induced originality. If these moments of elaborate texture aren't enough, see the all-out jazz jam of \\"Blue Turk,\\" or the homage to West Side Story that is \\"Gutter Cats Vs. The Jets.\\"--- Jon Blanton 2004(C) cddude24@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"And We Got No Class...........","review":"You have heard the title track a million times, and the disk is worth buying for that song along. I don't think this album was as strong as the other Alice Cooper Band releases with Warner Brothers, but it's still a really good disk. Besides the title track, you have to hear 'Gutter Cat vs. The Jets' a kind of goofy send up of 'West Side Story', and the follow up quickie instrumental 'Street Fight'. One of my favorite tunes on the disk is 'Alma Mater'. The rain storm sound effect, the echo vocals and the ending lyrics where Alice hopes he will be remembered really give the song a melancholy feel that will leave you thinking back to old buddies you haven't seen or heard from in awhile. And when will Quentin Tarentino use 'Grand Finale' in one of his movies? That would have been perfect in Kill Bill, just a big old 70's wall of sound instrumental. Pick it up, with Alice Cooper you just can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Days","review":"Alice Cooper's had his share of hit songs, but he will always be remembered for \\"School's Out.\\" It's a good song, but ironically my least favorite on the album! This whole album is pretty solid with some awesome songs on it that never made it to the radio. This was the band's real breakthrough album. Billion Dollar Babies would pretty much eclipse it a year later, but this album was big business. This would give us a glimpse of what Billion Dollar Babies would become; It plays around with some different styles and keeps the hard rockin' sound of the previous two albums. Given the \\"concept\\" of this album, you'd think that \\"School's Out\\" would be the last song on the album instead of the first. This makes absolutely no difference, I'm just talking out of my rear. School's Out is, without question, essential if you like the Coop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vision And The Vow is a joy and a challenge to read","review":"In reading The Vision and the Vow by Pete Greig, you are taken beyound comfortable boundaries, beyond the \\"easy-does-it Christianity\\" that the modern church has gotten drunk on. Pete Greig challenges those who claim Christ as Savior to also embrace him as Lord. We cannot divorce the two, and therefore we must submit to His authority with our whole lives. Greig takes us through his vision of where the Church is headed, and how Christians needs to rise above mediocrity and start becoming revolutionary.We are to be disciples, not converts.

I first checked this book out at the library and then found that it had so much useful information that I had to buy the book. The recipes in this book have been tried and tested at different altitudes. Each recipe has a table of different altitudes so that no matter what alititude you live at the recipe is perfect for you. I give this book 5 stars. It arrived in perfect condition, and on time shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"This cookbook has saved my sanity as well as my cooking skills! I recently moved from the Eastern seaboard to CO and everything I \\"knew\\" about baking went out the window. The change in altitude makes a huge difference in everything, but especially baked goods. This cookbook is a must for anyone wondering why their tried and true recipes aren't working at higher altitudes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baking better at altitude than I did at sea level!","review":"This book is amazing. I have make the best cakes I have ever made - beyond even the ones at sea level - as a result of this book. I've been struggling with the altitude's effects on baking ever since moving to the Denver area 6 years ago. But since moving up to 7200ft, I decided it was time for serious action. This book is great, because not only does it include divinely delicious recipes, it also provides general rules of thumb and conversion suggestions for adapting other recipes to high altitude locations. I'm totally sold. THANK YOU, Susan, for a wonderful guidebook, and for the yummy cakes!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book excellent instructions!","review":"I've made a couple of things from this book - apple pie and sugar cookies.

I'd trully recommend this book for all the baking newbie out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Altitude Baking","review":"This book is good for anyone who lives at high altitudes. I have yet to use it, but it has wonderful charts and instructions for those of you who are confused as to how to change the ingredients and oven temperatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"some, yes, some, no","review":"My results with this book have been mixed. I live in Cheyenne, Wyoming (about 6,000 feet). The Angel-Food Cake recipe was good; however, I had poor results with the chocolate chip recipe. After experimenting with the remainder of my dough, it seems like the recipe should require a great deal more flour (almost a full cup more).In the recipe's dialogue, the author happily reports that the chocolate chip recipe works (essentially unmodified) between sea level and 7,000 feet. I think most people baking at high altitude could easily testify that their rude awakening to high-altitude baking occurred with some simple cookie recipe that worked well at lower altitude, only to blow up (and fall) at higher elevation. The claim that one baking recipe delivers consistent results between sea level and 7,000 feet seems counter-intuitive and, in my experience, is false."},{"rating":"1","title":"disorganized mess","review":"The recipes need to be in some sort of order in an index. The pointless anecdotes are infuriating when one is in a hurry to find a recipe. I have baked in Colorado since I was a child and these recipes do not turn out well. The cakes are heavy and some of the recipes are crytic and incomplete. The general suggestions regarding modifications for high altitude can be found using any Internet search engine. This is a total waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I spent the money","review":"I have been successfully baking at high altitudes 5000-6000 feet for about 33 years and am known as an excellent baker. Always wanting to improve I bought this book and made three of the cakes. The Chocolate Buttermilk was gorgeous to look at and tasted like sand. The Hot Springs Honey Cake had excellent flavor but it, too, was too dry to enjoy. And the Porterfield Pumpkin Bundt Cake is in my freezer and will taste it with trepidation. I will not recommend this book to my baker friends.Very disappointing results. I'm going back to my usual manner of baking at high altitudes and am sorry I purchased this book. I think the author had her head in the clouds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pie in the Sky Confusion","review":"I moved from Sea Level to over 7000 ft. I needed a book to help me learn to bake at this higher altitude. This is not a good book for that. It gives a lot of recipes only two of which I could find the ingredients to try. Almost every recipe calls for buttermilk. They do not sell Buttermilk in the country where I now live. The two cakes I made turned out badly. The Angel food cake was like styrofoam after a day. The other chocolate cake had all the chocolate flavor of a brick. I am very unhappy with this purchase.The book is full of stories from the author on her high altitude mistakes. I did not make this purchase for stories.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"I have found this book to be very helpful. Reading about all of the recipe testing that was involved gave me a better idea of what works and what doesn't at high altitudes. I really like the chapters that explain the science behind it all too.I have only tried two recipes out of the book so far, the gingerbread and the biscuits. The gingerbread was really good, moist and tender! I will add more fresh ginger next time because I love ginger, but it was definitely a hit with my husband. The biscuits were a flop, really my only complaint about the book. I live at 5000 feet and I thought it strange that the leavening was so low compared to all other altitudes. Maybe it's a typo?There is a chart at the back of the book to help you adjust your own sea level recipes. This was a great help. I've successfully adjusted my favorite chocolate cake recipe with the chart. I'm so glad I purchased this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this recipe book...","review":"i love this recipe book... I love to bake but I had problems baking at high altitude before.

Baking at high altitude is challenging, yet only a handful of small-press cookery titles and regional offerings have addressed the special challenges of baking at high altitude, until now. Purdy has stayed at five different locations and elevations across the country to adjust recipes to perfection: Pie In The Sky presents reliable recipes to replace questionable conversions of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really hoping this book would solve all of my high-altitude baking problems, but it has not been as useful as I wish it were. First, I struggled with the numerous errors/typos in my first edition. While I was glad to see the corrections on here recently, I think I basically had tried to make every recipe that turned out to have an error. Very frustrating. Beyond that, the Independence Pass Brownies were not very chocolatey, the chocolate/white chocolate chip cookies spread just as much as any non-adjusted recipe, and the Buttermilk Chocolate Cake (even after I figured out that the directions should say baking soda insted of baking powder) had a really coarse grain. Therefore, overall it has been disappointing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results","review":"We just moved to Colorado and went from living at sea level all my life to 8,000ft.

It is very complete and easy to use and I love the fact that it is plastic and won't get ruined if it gets wet (because boy- it sure rained a lot of the time I was there). I used little repositionable \\"sticky\\" arrows to mark my \\"home\\" and my favorite sites \\"internet cafe\\" or \\"store with the neat paper\\" or \\"best Onion Soup\\" so it was easy to find those places again.

First of all, the Kindle sample, does not give you any text, it only gives you the table of contents. Then, when you order it, the Sutra that begins each chapter is barely legible on the Kindle.

Johnson","review":"This little book is a Buddhist perspective of the Yoga Sutra. Although Buddhism reigned over India for nearly 1500 years (300 BC - 1200 AD) it was systematically exterminated by foreign invaders. Thankfully, the Buddhist teachings on yoga did survive in neighboring regions like Tibet. The authors said that they first translated the Sanskrit into Tibetan and then translated the Tibetan into English. Then they spent over 80 hours teaching it line by line, word by word and debated/discussed it Swami Svarupananda at the Sivananda Ashram in the Bahahamas. This appears to give it a unique flavor in Yoga Sutra translations and commentaries. Although it would be much cooler if the original Devanagari and proper Sanskrit Transliteration were included for each verse, by the way half of verse 10 and 11 are missing, its not bad for a little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Leppard-Best Band Ever! 11","review":"This video ROCKS!

Drawing upon insights from social sciences including cultural anthropology, cognitive neuro-science, and medical anthropology to facilitate interpretations of these events, Visions and Healing in the Acts of the Apostles is a complex evaluation yet highly accessible and evenhanded in its treatment of potentially volatile subject.

He has enjoyed reading it and even said that it made him feel special. My one dislike is that I felt I had to explain to my son that the book is meant to be funny not always literal and that some of the information has been found to be untrue. I read several more recent books on left-handedness that reported that some myths about left-handers have been de-bunked.

The next morning the girl is dead, and as Sarah and Frank try to investigate the Black Hand gets involved and no one is talking. Thompson handles the issue of discrimination and prejudice well without assigning blame to either side. She also works in some great New York history into the story without it feeling forced.

Thus, he could not be Antonio's baby. Mama Ruocco demands that the girl and the baby be put out on the street immediately. Calmer heads pevail and they are allowed to stay, temporarily. By the next morning Nainsi is dead by suffocation. Sarah and Detective Frank Malloy begin searching for the murderer.Theodore Roosevelt makes an appearance as one of the New York police commissioners.

During the performance the guitar player broke a string and then they embarrassed us with some weak jokes. It was a relief when they started playing again.

Starting with a simple survival scenario (think Hitchcock's \\"Lifeboat\\" in space), the movie soon starts serving twist after twist as the cunning characters try to outsmart each other and maximize their own chances for survival.

In Hole In The Sky, Kittredge mangages to capture the sad fallacy that underscores western machismo with often heartbreaking results. Kittredge pulls off the near impossible in this modern age of weepy pseudo therepy memoir writing: he reveals inner failings without sounding tiresome, whiny or trivial. He writes in a prose style that is devoid of any pretensious posings or trappings. He also captures a true sense of time and space.

Well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Fountainhead","review":"I picked up this book at the request of a woman whom I had met at a rodeo in Northern California. She said it would be a good introduction to Eastern Oregon. What she didn't tell me was that it would be a good introduction to the rest of my life.Kittredge picks up where Ayn Rand leaves off in The Fountainhead. He paints a picture of a life of individualism and isolation which is not as rosy and romantic as a Great Basin sunrise. Kittredge started his life as a young Howard Roark in a rugged setting. Three wives and countless whiskeys later, the author still can't kick the habit of rugged individualism, but his beautifully written memoirs might dissuade a young person who is lured into that desert lifestyle.If you're going to San Francisco, read this book.

Both had the \\"insert SIM card\\" message many, many other people had complained about. The first phone I purchased had a brand new SIM card in it. When I took it back, they replaced the SIM card and within days, I was getting the \\"insert SIM card\\" message again. I brought the phone back and asked for a replacement. They gave me another brand new phone and within days, it too was telling me to \\"insert SIM card.\\" When this happened, calls could not be made or received and the only fix was turning the phone off or on. After the second phone failed, I took it back and got an LG. I have had no problems with that.After seeing how many people have had this same problem, I'm surprised Samsung continues to sell this phone. They must be aware of this widespread problem.This was my first experience with a Samsung product. It will be my last.DO NOT buy this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent phone","review":"Overall this has been a good phone. I love the size and weight of the phone. I have had it for about a month now. I have had a couple things that I have not been as happy with. When a get a busy line, I most times get no busy signal at all or occassionally I get about three beeps that are barely audible. The caller busy display only stays up a couple seconds and is gone by the time I take the phone off my ear and it returns to the original screen. Many times I am unsure if my call has even gone through and I have to redial and look at my screen to see what is going on. At first, I thought it was dropping my calls. I have had a little trouble hearing people that I could hear perfectly fine on my last phone. Other than those two main problems, I would recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert Sim card error","review":"I got two of these phones a month ago and I'm constantly getting Insert Sim card errors on both of them.

I've never had any sim card problems or reception problems like others have mentioned in their reviews.

The only con I can think of is being able to navigate quickly through the menu. It takes several steps to do most things. But thats not really a big deal to me.

On each card a composite image is paired with a word or a phrase. The artwork is inspiring; the colours are rich and vibrant. The booklet which describes each card is a bit disappointing in that each explanation is more of a rave than an analysis which can be fitted into an overall theory or system of divination. However, whoever's using the cards explores and invents and elaborates and that's fine. I have many tarot decks but I find this deck better able to interface with modern themes. Although the tarot adapts to any time and any circumstance it inevitably reflects lives which were more narrow and fearful and restricted than today. The Vertical Oracle is especially good for interactive work where the client is invited to choose and interpret. A five-card spread can helpfully challenge and dismantle fixed ideas and tired patterns of thought and feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Perspective","review":"This is an oracle for those who need to get a fresh uncluttered perspective. The images help you to see options you had not thought of for yourself and for your clients. The options given are never static they are always pointing up and out.

It takes about 4-5 episodes for the characters to gel and get back into a groove. Like the Homicide, Sopranos, NCSI, South Park, and Arrested Development network interference can really screw up a good thing. It seems the shelf live of a good series is about 5 seasons max then the networks start \\"tinkering\\" with it and just run it into the ground.

The scripts were lackluster, many of the scenes seemed phoned in and many episodes just were not up to previous seasons. The show did a slow fizzle.And that's a real shame. We lost a greatcasino owner in James Caan. Tom Selleck should have been a great replacement but his character just didn't jell like it should have but the storyines just didn't shine. And it seemed that all the fun and cheekiness was drained out of the series.What happened to the writers?I'll not be buying this season. For those die-hard fans who liked the season -- fine. But for those who didn't catch the episodes and are discriminating -- unless you just have to have it, I'd recommend to chose another series.

This book is not about killing people of color, it's about killing anyone that violates their way of life, such as it is. They kill because they can, and only a fool with a death wish would challenge them. This book documents the 1940's and 50's South with all of it's horror stories. How can one man in a small dusty town become so arrogant and above the law? You have to read this book to believe that it really happened. I still shake my head on occasion with a knot in my belly.

Writing data to the card was extremely slow, and would generate many, MANY write errors when sending it large files. What's the point of getting a 256MB card if you can't write large files to it? So, I returned the Viking card and got a Lexar 256MB SD card instead & it works great.Maybe I just got a rare, defective card, but I'm not brave enough to waste anymore time on it.

The last time I saw Ronnie, it was a pure acoustic set. He definitley mellowed with age. I had most of his albums at one time.This second Album is fantastic as he explored beyond the hard rock mantra of the time.

You still have the crushing rockers \\"I Got the Fire\\", \\"The Dreamer\\" and \\"Paper Money\\" which would have easily fit on the first LP. The instumental \\"The Dreamer\\" and \\"Spaceage Sacrifice\\" give Ronnie a chance to stretch out on guitar far beyond anything on the debut disc. This is in addition to my two favorite tracks, the pop cruncher \\"Underground\\" and the gorgeous ballad \\"We're Going Home\\" where Ronnie's guitar playing sparkles.

It was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless Effort","review":"I remember as a young teen hearing about how bad this album was. I figured my tastes have matured and maybe I should give this album a try (now I am dating myself). I puchased this CD on account of the reviews I read on this website. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I was once I'd listened to it. I'm a huge fan of the Montrose debut(one of the best metal/hard rock albums ever recorded)& Sammy Hagar. It's amazing how a record company's influence can totally destroy artistic license. I simply refuse to believe that the same members that put together the debut could release such powerless drivel.There is one occasion of inspiration noted on this album, the track entitled 'I Got The Fire', as good as it is it still pales in comparison to the worst track on the debut. This is truly for the hardcore fan of Hager/Montrose."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've reconsidered this one....","review":"I had this one ages ago and was sort of let down after the monumental first album by this power rock quartet. Being much younger then, I didn't appreciate the album, expecting a first album clone, and I now think that was unfair. So, with that thought in mind, I decided to purchase another copy and give it a fresh listen with ears grown older and more appreciative of a little diversity, and I'm glad I did. On my first listen after receiving it I found myself liking it much more than when I was in my 20's. I still find the tune I loved best,\\"I Got the Fire\\", to be the highlight of the disc, but to my surprise I found the entire disc likeable and worthwhile. \\"Underground\\" was always a good song to me, but I had never quite come to terms with \\"Connection\\",now it's one of my favorites on the disc. The rest of the songs are not just filler,as I used to feel. Overall, I give this disc a solid four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Money (Or Montrose II)","review":"Way back before Sammy couldn't drive 55 or he fell into VanHagar he worked for a journeyman guitarist named Ronny Montrose. This guy had all the chops, styles and gimmics available through the early and mid 70's. This was the follow-up to the debut and probably not as widely covered but certainly right down Ronny's alley. Like a lot of songs written at the time they were good on an album and even more explosive on stage. If you enjoyed what he did with the Winter bros. and Rick Derringer you'll appreciate this old school gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book that doesn't really cover writing for the web.","review":"I purchased this book with the intention of improving my ability to write for the internet.

Avoid this book if you want to learn how to write online copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointment","review":"I expected some of the spectacular, athletic dancing we usually associate with Russian folk dancing; however, there were only a few such performances. Most of the singing/dancing was slower paced, low skill level, and, to my taste, quite boring. It was interesting to realize the broad multi-ethnic spectrum that Russia encompasses, but each performance was repetitive and dragged on too long. Tony Randall's narration was no help."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better..","review":"I've read several books in this series and this one is the poorest. The others were good.

I am a serious Christian and this book is an insult to Christians everywhere, painting Christianity as nasty, empty-headed, exlusionary biogtry. If this had been written in the 1950s, we could have excused its ignorance and foolishness, but today there is no excuse for it. As a Christian, it embarrasses me, and as a human being, it fills me with pity for its unhappy author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I whole-heartedly agree","review":"I completely agree with Mr. Attig about there being no need for this book. If you truly are gay, which is a reality for millions of people, you don't need spiritual healing, let alone when it comes from a book to know that whatever path you choose is your own path, and should be respected by everyone. This book is unnecessary and should only be bought if you're insecure. \\"We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another,\\" said Jonathan Swift, which is obviously demonstrated by this book, which is derogatory and offensive to gays and lesbians, because it says that what they stand for does not exist.

It's good to have a nice copy of the whole unabridged masterpiece to one day read to my kids. This edition is also easier to find than the previous full edition and much more affordable, downright ... even. My only complain is the gaudy high school text book style cover. I think the Chinese Government must have a law that all works translated from Chinese must have tacky covers because that seems to be the norm.

Once you learn a bit, you start seeing the similiarities between english and dutch, which help you remember it in the long run. it includes basic expressions/accomodations, eating out, travel, sightseeing, stores & services, health, reference, and dictionary sections. another helpful tool would be to get the accompanying cassette tape, which lets you hear the pronunciations and helps you learn better, although they speak a little fast for the basic beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!","review":"This figure is one of my favorites.

Ross is not that case. Mexico's history is extremely complex, particularly since it is so much tied to US history (\\"nice neigbors\\" the US were not EVER). Yet Ross is so skillful that he will take you through the maze so that you start to understand Mexico. Being a gringo many times disqualifies a historian since these academicians disect Mexican History disregarding the ommipresent neighbor and its expansionism and hegemony policies. Ross knows best.

But it felt as if he was rushing to finish the book. A lot more elaboration is needed. And I'm still wondering what the miracle was.

What a drag! I wish I could give it zero star.It is painful to read, especially if you are not a golf fan: the book goes in so much detail into golf that it makes it even more boring.

What a waste!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I am usually a fan of James Patterson's books, but really did not enjoy this one. It is an easy, fast read, but just didn't grab my attention. I also think the cost of the book is a bit much for a book that has less than 200 pages and that includes many, many blank pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"While it was a light and quick read, Miracle on the 17th Green is very predictable and formulatic. Appreciate what you have or you will lose it. Don't be afraid to succeed. Beyond that, I found very few life revelations or insights. I love golf, and golf books, but I could not rate this one even in the top 10 of the golf books I have read.One item that really didn't ring true was that a course in the Chicago area is pretty unlikely to have real pins on the actual greens at Christmas. I live in MA, and our greens are always covered and blocked off by Thanksgiving at the latest. I realize that doesn't affect the essence of the story or message, but it bothered me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not James Patterson's best","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I have read his books like Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and Sam's Letters to Jennifer before. And I thought this book would be of the same quality but it wasn't. I got thru the whole book but it didn't give me the feeling that I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever by James Patterson","review":"If you are not totally into golf, you will hate this book.

Short read that is best golf story I have read to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not a big fan of this book. I usually can't put a James Patterson book down but this one took me a while to get into!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't like golf, don't read this","review":"I love James Patterson. I've never read a book of his that I didn't love, and even his non-mystery books are amazing. But I could not love this book. It's all about golf, and some middle aged man who hates his life and miraculously starts to play amazing golf. The plot is dull and predictable and the best thing about the book is that it is at least well written.But I don't like golf at all, in fact I find it to be horribly boring and don't even like mini golf, so to muddle through all these golf terms and descriptions of the course and which club he's using was torture for me. It's a very short book but I ended up skimming the second half of it after I realized that yes, it really is all about golf.So if you're into golf, you'll probably like this book. But if you're like me and just wanted to read another one of James Patterson's books but have zero interest in golf - skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read. A complete afternoon of enjoyment","review":"I've read all of James Patterson's work and this one is right up there. It is a completele departure from the murder, thriller, page-turner.

It was predictable and did not inspire any sense in me of caring about the characters. Thankfully it was short, although perhaps its brevity is what prevented the plot and characters being developed sufficiently. At any rate, my reaction after reading it was essentially, \\"so what?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Tale of Life","review":"Admit it. You're stuck at a dead end job like the rest of us. Miracle on the 17 Green is about a middle aged guy named Travis who has a hopeless job, a great marriage with three wonderful kids (but doesn't realize it) and some yet to be exposed talent with the golf clubs. Great little tale about all the above and how he goes about learning to appreciate life in general. A wonderful read. Typical Patterson book -- short chapters with easy to follow characters. Highly recommended!!! Give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Lame and Predictable","review":"Even an avid golfer will find this a tedious read. The plot is contrived and predictable. The humor is sophomoric at best. It is blessedly short but I'd rather play the worst muni in the world than re-read this book. The only reason I finished it the first time was because I couldn't believe it could grow steadily worse from page to page. If your golfer has any education at all, buy him or her a P.G.

This book is not the murder mystery he is known for - it's more like SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICOLAS.MIRACLE ON THE 17TH GREEN is set around golf - but don't worry about really understanding or having an appreciation of the game to read this book. This is a story about Travis McKinley who discovers he is not happy with his life and decides to make changes...starting with his job. The short story (only 150 pages) told in James Patterson style (short chapters) begins on one Christmas when Travis golfs the game of his life. From there his life begins to change - for the better. He discovers during the next year what really matters to him and his life takes on a clarity it has never had.A good book that proves Patterson can write a good story no matter what the subject!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and Fun","review":"Not only is this a useful phrasebook but tons of fun!

I first heard of The Chieftains when searching for the soundtrack to the 1990 Treasure Island starring Charlton Heston and Christian Bale. Upon hearing the song Molly Ban (music performed by The Chieftains and sung by Alison Krauss) I realized that I must hear more of their songs. To my delight, I found this album, which has 8 tracks from the Treasure Island film. I immediately purchased it and have not been disappointed by that choice. The music from Treasure Island is wonderful, but so is all the rest. 5/5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selections of Irish music from motion pictures","review":"The music starts with the historic O'Sullivan's March and from that point on the Chieftans blend some contemporary compositions with historic Irish music for a seamless series of great listening. There are two selectins from Ton Cruise and Nicle Kidman's Far and Away. The most selections, eight short pieces, are from the film Treasure Island with a young Christian Bale and Charlton Heston. The love theme from Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon is included. Richard Burton filmed a version of Tristan and Isolde and three selections are from that film. Overall the Chieftan's interpretations of Irish musical heritage is superb. The marches, the dances, and the sad mournful selections all have the poer to evoke Irish sensibility. Excellent recording that I have enjoyed for 14 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bethany","review":"I loved Treasure Island, Grey Fox, and Far and Away soundtracks. Chieftains had released an earlier CD without the Far and Away edition, so it's great they added it on. Triston and Isolde is a bit slow for my tastes, but I'm more into the toe tappin' portions of the CD. There tends to be more fun with the Treasure Island, Grey Fox, and Far and Away portions. Very good CD to own, especially if you are a Chieftains fan, or a fan of any of these movies. If you love these particular movies, I definitely recommend it, since, while listening, scenes from these movies tend to come to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the same product I get in the store!","review":"I've been using Queen Helene Cocoa Butter lotion for about 8 years - never had a problem with it and loved it.

Then it kept making me break out wherever I put it on. Finally I threw it away. On a better note, I contacted amazon yesterday, and even though I threw the product away, they still refunded my money and said they will look into this.

At first, I liked it, it reminded me of being at the beach (it smells similar to suntan lotion) but, after frequent use, that gets a little nauseating.

I am here to tell you that if you suffer from acne, this will make it more worse than you can imagine! I speak from experience, and have researched this as well. Although this product is water based, it still contains oil and because it absorbs so quickly-it stays in system for a while. Even if you don't use this on your face it can cause you to break out because it does not completely wash off your hands even when you are washing your face. It is a very fine oil that can clog pores and add oil very quickly and easily.It is a great price, and for individuals with resistant non-acne prone skin I am sure this product is wonderful.

Generally, I can often skip a few superflous pages of a book and continue on to its eventual end. Sadly, Arcady got the better of me. I gave up in the middle. The premise (which made me buy the book in the first place) seemed excellent. However, the tale started off rather blandly and it just went downhill from there. There seemed little point to any of the book. Hints of characters that could have been interesting were never developed (at least not in the first half of the book that I did read). Descriptions of the fantastical creatures that inhabited the borders evoked no imagery at all. Liked the idea, hated the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete treatise on Easter Island","review":"This fine book is the most complete treatise on Easter Island available. It covers all the island's most fascinating aspects, including its geological history, the question of the origin of the Rapa Nui people, flora and fauna, and of course, most importantly, the archeological remains. The writers illustrate how a complex interplay between the natural environment and human behaviour created the island's unusual prehistory, including the demise of the statue cult. Although there are still many unanswered questions about the moai (giant statues) this book gives the qualified answers or at least suggestions as to how these things came to be. It wisely leaves behind all sorts of pseudo-scientific theories and bases its discussion on real archeological evidence, of which there today exists a substantial amount. The only unfortunate thing about the book is the slightly misleading title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"As a big fan of the PC (and event Super Nintendo version), I was so excited to get this game. But, it turns out that it wasn't worth the money. The parred down controls make it very boring after awhile - no subways or waterpipes to put in. They are missing a lot of the little detail such as the cars, etc. And, it's very complicated to lay streets and stuff in the direction you want or to scroll around to see your city. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the PC versions...","review":"When I first heard about Sim City 2000 on the GBA, I thought dang that should be pretty sweet. Then I realized that in actuality, the game would probably be pretty lousy due to the small screen and limits of the GBA. Still I decided to pick up a copy anyways but it wasn't worth the $20.As some have said, yes the game can be fun for a short period of time but then you'll most likely never get the urge to play it again. Doing some simple tasks in the game proves to be a bigger chore than in other versions and the cities you create feel empty and lifeless. However, if you've got lots of time on your hands and don't mind some of the neater additions of the pc versions missing along with some slowdown when disasters occur, then you will probably enjoy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sims are fun- Just not this one.","review":"I reccomend the sims buting out or the urbz. its very hard to get money and you'll have to know what industral, commercial, and industerial- boring.

Lewis is masterful at weaving humor into his serious arguments. This is not a light read. His style is a bit dry for those used to a more American tone, and he discusses difficult subjects such as the nature of thought or vivisection. He often refers to or quotes authors from a variety of time periods without additional explanation. Some readers may find that disconcerting. I have immensely enjoyed it and look forward to reading this book again and again, after I loan it to a few friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've used this book over and over in my own writing.","review":"You know a book is packed with wisdom and insight, when you find yourself repeatedly referring back to it for quotes. God in the Dock (an expression referring to the courtroom dock / witness stand), covers such a wide range of topics, from evil and miracles and myth to creation/evolution, ethics and ordinary human squabbles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection of essays","review":"The ideas are lively, typical of Lewis, but many are responses to contemporary people and arguments that limit their charm to the modern reader. Still worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"God in the Dock","review":"Excellent series of articles by CS Lewis with his usual incisive views of Christianity.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I can't say enough about this author. Every book of his is incredible. great book like all his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific pet grooming aid","review":"This is the best comb I've found for grooming my cats and my dog. It really gets the loose hair combed out. And my cats love it because it doesn't scratch their skin. It does a great job on my dog also -- really grooms her thick undercoat. Very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for both of my cats.","review":"I got this after reading that it was good for both long-haired and short-haired cats. I just started using it right out of the packaging and so far both cats love it. Plus, it works well on their fur as well. They are both flea and tick free currently so I can't say how well it works in that regard, but it does seem to get down deep into the root and I can see how it would trap the fleas in between the bristles."},{"rating":"1","title":"For grooming,not so sure about shedding.","review":"I've used this comb for my cat and she still sheds all over the place.Maybe it's best used for grooming,not so much for shedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork On Poetry... Pagan Poetry!","review":"I take this song seriously up to the point were Bjork reiterates \\"I love Him\\" several time, I just can't help but to laugh. I think Pagan Poetry was a song that was a bit over done, and we could have settled for something that was less advanced. I am giving this item a 4 because I do think the mix of \\"Pagan Peotry\\" is interesting and I love the opiate version of \\"Aurora\\".1.) Pagan Poetry = Very interesting song that you can only take seriously up to a certain point. This song has great background music.2.) Pagan Poetry = This version of the song is great, and it even starts out with the recherché lyrics at the begining of the song.3.) Aurora (Opiate Version)= This is the prize of the single, the beat to this song is great and the lyrics are just so irresistible.If your a Bjork fan, you'll love this single, if you want to become a Bjork fan than this isn't the single for you to get quite yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bjork Single...","review":"Pagan Poetry single 1, is done well, for the Pagan Poetry song and the remix. The remix is good (though little instruments) but a lot of f/x's and a natural atmosphere, making you feel as if Bjork was singing to you at night in a forest. Though the vocal has been screwed up a bit, the rest of the song is very well done. As for Aurora, stick with the original, this one is hardly worth listening to. It contiously repeats 3 guitar chords, way too long, throughout the song. The only attraction of it, is its vocal arrangements.The first songs, are done well and memorable, but yet the lesser attraction sets it back, as so Pagan Poetry Single 1, rates a 4 out if 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read the book","review":"a story of honor and integrity. Wish it had a dragon in the story line, but it did't. Easy Kindle download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I have a tendency to read anything that is even remotely connected to Arthurian legends, so I snapped up this book immediately hoping for a new angle on the familiar legend since the cover clearly indicates this is Sir Gawain's story. I cannot begin to describe the depths of my disappointment. The story is tedious at best and becomes quickly bogged down in its own distinctions of right and wrong and sorcery and Light and Darkness to the point of seeming more like a sermon than an entertaining tale. The characters are predictable to an extent beyond them just being based on familiar legend, and truly there is little to distinguish one from another. The story goes nowhere, and the number of typographical errors (a repeated sentence at one point!) makes it irritating to read. If you're truly looking for a captivating version of the King Arthur legend, I'd suggest readingTaliesin (The Pendragon Cycle, Book 1)instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelously inventive retelling.","review":"This is almost the tale of Sir Gawain, almost of Sir Gareth, and almost something out of Narnia. Ms. Bradshaw has created a series of delightful characters, fully realized, and wonderfully alive.

Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Enjoyable Read","review":"I managed to snag the Hawk of May during one of the many Border's closings in the Chicago region. The book is told in first person and the author has a solid voice that keeps the pages turning. The changing of some of the names to reflect the 'old age' or origins of the time period allow the author to throw a few neat tricks and changes into the themes of the Arthurian history and the book is well told and well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"Nice take on one of the legends - easy to read and worth picking up the rest of the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawk of May","review":"His name was Gwalchmai, but story tellers and legend would call him Sir Gawain. Born to an evil sorceress it was no surprise that his life was on the road to darkness. But one day destiny came calling... sending him on a very important quest. His life would be forever changed when he took up arms under the Pendragon flag.I thought this was a wonderful take on the King Arthur legends. I love reading books about King Arthur, but this is the first time I've read one just about Sir Gawain. Hawk of May is compelling and magical. The character of Gwalchmai pops off the pages and shines. Originally published in 1981, but the story is still fresh and poignant for 2010. Beautifully descriptive, a must read for any Arthurian fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Father!!","review":"I bought this book because I have seen the 1991 made for tv movie (Lifetime) \\"Love, Lies and Murder\\" and was mesmerized and horrified by this story, I also read the Anne Rule \\"If You Love Me\\" rendition of this story which is basically the same but with added extras and photos.This man is evil as evil goes, manipulating and brain wahsing his 14yr old daughter and the 17 year old sister-in-law to kill his 23 year old wife. His dauther took the blame and he molested and married his sister-in-law in order to keep the secret. This man is disgusting and without any conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly talk...where is David playing the dulcimer?","review":"David Schnaufer was undoubtably the most diversely talented dulcimer player of our time. I took classes from him and have every album he produced or contributed to. I was excited when I thought I might see him play once again! This DVD is 75% talk and 25% music. There is not a single song that is completely played without the interruption of boring narrative. Its a short 28 minutes, and could serve as a basic introduction to the dulcimer and a quasi-eulogy to David.It would have been worth it if David would have been featured playing even one song, or playing alongside of the quartet...I hope the quartet will produce a music album or video to redeem this talking video. Underneath the narratives, the music showed amazing potential. And yes it was great to see David once again...If you are looking for amazing music, buy one of his albums...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experimentalist Soft Rock","review":"Gary Wright's THE DREAM WEAVER is a great CD of experimental soft rock that, unlike many of its more commercial counterparts, still holds up after over 30 years. Perhaps that's because Wright never takes his use of electronics for granted, topping them with intense, soulful lead vocals which sound like they're coming from a singer such as Solomon Burke, Don Covay, David Ruffin, or Dennis Edwards. Also, many of the rhythms come straight from late-60s/early 70s R&B rather than the disco that was becoming popular in 1975. Overall, this album has stood the test of time very well, and is a must-own for anyone who enjoys high-quality pop-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic!Should not be forgotten.","review":"This is and should always be considered a classic.It's timeless"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic seventies","review":"I don't think that there's a song that brings back the high school experience of the seventies as well as Dreamweaver.

Makes you totally relax..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel that Gary should've stayed with Spooky Tooth","review":"I just don't think he has what it takes to be a solo artist. He's lost his rock and roll edge that he had with Spooky Tooth. I remember those classics \\"Evil Woman\\" 9 and half minutes of rocking, and \\"Lost In My Dreams\\" more intense than any Black Sabbath, or Marilyn Manson song, and they did a good rendition of the Beatles \\"I Am The Walrus\\". This is bland pop music. I used to wake up to \\"Dream Weaver\\" along with Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\", and one other tune every morning on Philly's WFIL AM 560. I didn't like \\"Dream Weaver\\" then I don't like it now. I especially hate \\"Love Is Alive\\" as it makes me cry as it's just a sad song. I had another solo album from Gary called \\"Touch and Gone\\" it's just as bad if not worse than \\"Dream Weaver\\". For some odd reason Gary lost his rock and roll when he left Spooky Tooth, and I don't know if he'll ever find it again. Hopefully so."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD","review":"People cite the title track \\"DREAM WEAVER\\" as the finest offering on this CD. As a matter of actual fact, it is possibly the worst thing to ever happen since Hitler invaded Poland. Rock can be divided into two distinct eras: Pre Dream Weaver (PD), and After Dream Weaver (AD). Dream Weaver itself is Ground Zero. PD Rock is fierce and driven, motivated and weeping, screaming for us to examine ourselves. Ground Zero was like an Atomic Bomb bent on destroying all things that bound us together. It's many little bells and inlay of glitter tapestry was sickening. Once I was exposed to it I craved nothing but silence, blessed silence. What followed (AD), was an era dominated by Disco, and deafening Dream Weaver knock-offs. It would be a full twenty years before the Rock Revival of the mid 90's. A damn nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step lively, read fast, repeat 10 times","review":"This scale looks nice, but its readings are very inconsistent.

Just like what most of the other reviewers have mentioned, the weight fluctuates even when you measure the weight successively within a minute. The fluctuation on my scale is within 4 lbs. It is very frustrating to use such an inaccurate scale, because it is as good as not using one.

I'm African-American and I wear my hair natural. I think my growth over this time was a combination of taking better care of my hair AND the Exotic Allure vitamins. These vitamins do make your nails grow pretty rapidly. I saw a difference in the length of my nails within a week of taking these vitamins.

I kid you not, after a month, my hair is about 1.5 inches longer & I can pull my hair into a small ponytail. My roots are full and thick yet soft. I keep staring at my hair in the mirror from all angles, because I am in disbelief at how fast & full it has grown in one month. At this rate, I'll be looking like Chaka Khan by Christmas.

Someone attached the wrong image to this listing."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"My four year old son is not interested in this book at all. The images make it a bit confusing: there's a picture of a word, then the word with a letter that is supposed to be in a state of change, then a picture of the new word that was formed. I think the second picture is what's confusing him. There's also no real plot that I can see, which is probably why he doesn't like it.

The Doobies were on a roll during this period, cranking out great tunes with regularity. While this one isn't quite as strong as \\"Captain...\\" it is still a very close second for me. The song everyone remembers from this album is of course the overplayed(but a great song nonetheless) \\"Black Water\\". My favorites here are \\"Another Park, Another Sunday\\", \\"Eyes of Silver\\" and the opening track \\"Song To See You Through\\". The Doobies were undergoing a transition around this time,about to add personnel in the person of the great Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter of Steely Dan fame (he is in evidence on this album). This album is a must have for Doobies fans.Four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Doobie Brothers Album","review":"WHAT WERE ONCE VICES ARE NOW HABITS is yet another great album by the Doobie Brothers. The only merely average song here is the overplayed \\"Black Water\\", but the rest is top-drawer. The fact that the surviving Doobies, like almost all rockers of their generation (the only exception I know of being Cat Stevens aka Yusuf Islam), advocate sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes this CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Music","review":"The Doobies were my favorite group as a teen (I stopped following them after a few Michael MacDonald albums) and this is my favorite album - their songs were so well crafted, with lots of nice touches in the percussion and backing vocals.

Can be completely corrected though with the use of Panorama Tools. So how cheap it is, come with a little bit more extra work. Also with lenses this big (especially on an S2is or an S3is), the flash gets a restrike which shows on the photo having an oval dark tint on the bottom when the flash is used at full wide angle **which is mentioned in the Raynox website by the way.A few minor complaints, but it surpasses my expectations of a good lens, these are not cheap knock-offs of questionable glass, these are great lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of art from old master","review":"Reviewed using the Cross converter and Waterman Florida Blue ink: On inexpensive copier paper, this pen's medium point writes smoothly and wet, and has never skipped. It starts instantly after days capped, and is weighted and sized perfectly for an adult man, with an excellent grip. The converter is screw-in, a safety deal all converters should use. The section and barrel threads are metallic finished - if not all metal - with the threads not too loose or fine. The very slight closed-cap looseness doesn't effect performance.

Much of the information contained in this work is useful, in the form of short vignettes, which makes it an easy read.There are numerous pointers available for all practitioners of Reiki. Some of the information provided in a historical context could use an update, and the terminology needs a little correction. Despite this, it is still a pretty basic book that anyone may find benefit in.This book could have used a sharper eye for editing, for there are numerous errors. Much of it is simple, though it does get a little distracting at times. Avid readers of Reiki News Magazine may recognize many chapters as articles that appeared in said publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibilities and a Bright Future","review":"William Lee Rand opens the way to exploring an exceptional world where balance and wellness unfold and we undertake the mission of healing our hearts and spirits.

It must have the author's friends. None of the examples work and could never work no matter what platform. It is obvious that the author never actually worked through these issues although it looks good enough that it faked me out. Examples: he uses virtual base classes as if they were implementation classes (DOMImplementation class), he uses methods that dont exist (System.out.null()), he fails to declare or instantiate items that he uses in the examples, ..., ..., ... It took me a month to work my own way through the 2nd chapter. Not worth the time, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The book isn't really for beginners.

However, I was shocked to find the author was demonstrating code using the Apache Xalan release from late 2000. This is shocking because in Feb. 2001 Apache released a newer version which made drastic changes to the Xalan API. This made several chapters useless. You would think that the author would have had time to update the chapters considering that the book wasn't released until Jan.2002.This book says it is for Beginning to Advanced levels. A beginner would have a difficult time with this book. The writing style of this book leaves a lot to be desired. The author in the first chapter tries to cover in 34 pages what other authors cover in 300 pages.

Returned the tv the same day as I am not ready to retire my replay units. This tv may be fine for HD (which is the picture they have on display in the store), but if you are going to hook up older video equipment to it that outputs SVIDEO or composite video, you will be disapointed with the picture.

Hardly any splices anywhere but the sound had some hiss. I found a 2nd VHS copy originally released in 1986 by Viking Video hoping the sound would be better.

This title deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgar & Charlie made a movie","review":"I was looking for anything containing Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy... of the 3 DVD's I found, this was the only one featuring them in a movie setting. The story is good, and their part in it makes sense. Plus... when I want to share their antics and comedy with my family, I don't have to worry about language or shady situations. For the time period this was made, the story line goes along pretty well. Your emotions will vary, in a healthy way, meant to show the human side of life, and it does so very well. I almost gave it 5 stars... and perhaps if I watch it again and again, I may well wish I had done so. This features Charlie more than the other Bergen family members... and when Charlie \\"acts on his own\\" with no apparent \\"help\\" from Edgar, it shows that someone was thinking and not just making a movie. Go ahead, enjoy it for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the only tea I drink!","review":"This is by far the best cup of tea around.

Still, I love the 10-minute segment format and I definitely feel all the exercises! The Arms section is my favorite because it works muscles I don't get to any other way.

I would suggest getting another band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and Effective","review":"I ordered both this DVD and the Ana Caban band DVD. To my surprise, this dvd surpassed all expectations and was more fun and challenging than the Ana Caban workout. I liked having the option of the 10 minute workouts targeting specific areas, so you can choose whichever area you want to focus on for the day to fit your schedule. A lot of the moves felt really familiar because they were directly adapted from reformer workouts.Let me tell ya...my limbs were sore for 2-3 days straight after my first workout! No pain; no gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy to follow, feels good!","review":"Suzanne Bowen is a calm, clearly spoken instructor. I find the moves easy to follow and I feel my muscles have been worked the next day! What I like about the 10 minute videos is that it feels like you're done really quickly, even if you do 3-4 because each seem totally different due to the instructor wearing different outfits and there's a short warm up and cool down for each one. You sort of trick yourself into thinking that it was really fast so you keep on going. But if you don't, studies have shown that even 10 minutes help! I haven't had any problems with the bands and I've had this for more than a year. Besides, it comes with two! Finally, how can you beat the price?? Consider what one workout costs in the gym and even if you use this only once it's a 3rd to a 4th of the cost of one class. It is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout and definitely see/feel results!","review":"I enjoy this DVD a lot.I love all of the sections, but I feel like the leg section isn't as hard of a workout as the rest. She says during the workout that it's very effective and it's tough, but I don't feel like it's tough at all. It's kind of too easy, so I question if it's actually doing anything.My favorite section is the total body.I think the arms section is the hardest and the most work of all the sections. At least it is for me, but then again my arms are weaker than the rest of my body.The best thing about this DVD is after doing it for two and a half months I see and feel results. My buns are toned and tightened as are my legs.But, as often happens, I'm getting bored doing the same DVD so often, so I just ordered another DVD with Suzanne Bowen because I really like her as an instructor. Can't wait to try that one and mix both DVDs up during the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love It!","review":"Suzanne is a great instructor. She cues well and makes very clear about how you should breathe. This DVD includes 5 segments: Pilates for upper body, lower body, abs, total body and flexibility. I love ALL of these segments because they are doable, yet VERY effective. With the help of the pilates band, I definitely feel the burn in the first 4 parts and have a very comfortable stretch at the end. What scary is it's addictive! The \\"10 minutes\\" is a trick! Because once I finished one segment, I want to do another! So I end up just pushing the \\"play all\\" button when I have the time.

However, I was a little bummed to open up my dvd and find that the band is marked as made of latex.

So for anyone else with a latex allergy, heads up that you will need to order another band if you don't already have one at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The instructor is often hard to follow because it takes time to figure out how she is positioning the band.

I try to do 10 minutes at night as well as in the morning and I saw and felt the better tone of my body in 2 weeks. The band is so effective because you can use it to adjust the resistance of the workout and therefore it is suitable for use from beginner to advance. This dvd is timeless. You can tailor many of the exercises to fit you. I Highly recommend this dvd no matter what level you are in fitness.Pilates for flexibility is my absolute favorite - this stretching segment is so rejuvenating."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIke the variety of workouts","review":"This is the first pilates dvd I've bought. I'm really happy with it. You can vary the level of difficulty with the included band. It's a fun workout and I felt it the next day. You can do 1 ten minute segment, a few, or all of them. I like the variety of it all and the instructor is very pleasant. I'd tell my girlfriends to get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video Great Price","review":"I purchased this workout video for the great price. I was leery though on the quality of the workout and production. No need to worry though. It's a great workout that allows you to tailor your workout to your abilities trouble spots.

I talk myself into doing just 1 - 10 minute workout and before you know it I've done 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but fun!","review":"I've had this dvd for awhile but recently started actually using it...lol...each workout is only 10 minutes long, but you feel the burn! I am ALWAYS sore after doing the workouts, especially the one for the upper body. My triceps are crazy sore right now! :) I really recommend this dvd; it's challenging but enjoyable and effective. The instructor is not annoyingly perky but quite pleasant and easy to listen to and follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Band Workout","review":"I like to try different Pilate's DVDS and adding the band is a nice way to make the workout better with some resistance. Only trouble I have with the band is keeping it on my feet as well as they do, I guess it just takes some practice. I like that the band gives you the feel of being on the reformer, but I wouldn't know, since I have never been on one to compare the feel. But some of us are not lucky to own a reformer, too much $$$$, so I have to use the band. Again, I like Suzanne as my instructor, she explains everything well. Her voice is very calming and reassuring. I don't like very chatty instructors or super fast talkers, it distracts me when I am working out with them. I hope Suzanne keeps coming out with more Pilate's DVDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for busy moms!","review":"I have been a pilates fan for years and years. This video doesn't present as big of a challenge as I was hoping for, but it still provides a good mini-workout. As a busy mom, it is great to be able to grab a 10 minute ab session (upper body, lower body, etc) when I find myself with a few extra minutes during the day. This can't substitute a full workout(unless you chose to complete multiple sessions), but it is an excellent supplement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vet bills through the roof from this product","review":"My pet sitter gifted my dog with one of these for the holidays.

It arrived in good shape with adequate packaging to assure no damage was done in transport. I have a Martin D-42 that I play, which is a beautiful instrument. I was surprised at the volume and tonal quality of the Dean. The action is low now with no buzz, after I adjusted the truss rod. The workmanship of the guitar is of good quality. I would recommend this guitar for a beginning guitar or intermediate guitar player. Amazon.com's price was about 1/2 the cost compared to other .com music stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and of money!!!","review":"The guitar looks beautiful. My guitar came with no picks or a pitch pipe. I had to send it back and get a replacement guitar, and the replacement guitar came with no picks or a pitch pipe.

I was very disappointed. I'm not happy with the purchase. WASTE OF MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A kick-butt workout","review":"I really enjoy this workout because it really gets the heart pumping right away and throughout the workout. I work out at home and at the gym regularly and this workout is very challenging. After 20 minutes I am soaked with sweat, and this is just using 3 pound hand weights. It's the compound movements that keep the heart up. I've had to put it on pause just to catch my breath. I don't see myself betting bored soon with this at all. The only problem is that David and the gang workout on the beach and it's not that easy to do some of the moves (mountain climber) on an apartment floor. Also, his count is not consistent (he'll say 5 more to go, and then he counts 1 rep and moves on...) Lots of jumping jacks so that's a concern if you have picky neighbors below. This a very different workout. Definitely recommend trying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Back Please","review":"I am greatly disappointed in this video. First, I think a professional of David's caliber should not sale this as something that you can do in the comfort of your home, unless of course, you have carpet a mile deep to absorb the shock. He does the routine on sand and with just cause. The constant jarring that you place on your joints by doing this tape could have long-term negative effects.I feel that because of the techniques required to do these movements properly are important, that the sandy surfaces are not the best for instructional purposes.I believe some of the customer's comments, that you will see positive outcomes by doing this tape. You can't help but to lose inches and tone up . . . but at what cost?"},{"rating":"2","title":"David Kirsch Bootcamp DVD","review":"There's nothing like a high-paced workout that touches every area of your body. And when the setting is a beautiful beach, as it is in this video, it is even better. What I like about David Kirsch is that he's not your typical aerobic dance instructor, though it looks as if some of the bodies behind him are those of dancers. David is a true \\"coach.\\" His exercises are tough, but his motivating style edges you to continue on, even if you can't do all the exercises the first time around. I loved the challenge, and my butt has never felt so firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this and the Ultimate NY Body Plan DVD. I wanted a hard workout dvd. It is a ripoff as it is just 43 minutes, including stretch and cool down. The rest of the DVD is an \\"infomercial with David Kirsch\\" where he talks pychobabble on body mind connection without saying much of anything coherent and a commercial\\"behind the making of the dvd\\" segment, where he is mostly shown on the beach hugging and snuggling with his wife, and she has a segment on \\"don't hate me because I have a beautiful body...\\" I buy from Amazon all the time, but this DVD was a complete waste of money and the workout did not tire me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, Time-Efficient Workout","review":"I feel I get a complete strength training workout, and it keeps my heart rate up with some cardio moves mixed in. I also like that he does a bunch of different exercises, which prevents boredom, and that they work multiple muscles at once. You get a full-body workout in 45 minutes. I agree with some of the other reviewers - his cueing definitely needs improvement, and some of his mind-body connection statements can sound a little hokey. Overall, however, I feel it is an effective workout, and I feel accomplished afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Excercise DVD","review":"This is a tough work out. David combines upper and lower body movements to make the most efficient use of workout. The workout is fast paced, and David keeps it interesting. The workout recommends using 1 - 5 lb dumbells. However, even without the weights, it gets your heart pumping within the first 15 mins of the work out. This one is a winner.I had a couple of small issues with the DVD, no closed captioning (to to follow the workout whilt watching TV in PiP) and the DVD has very poor menu navigation (had to restart the DVD to get back to the main menu. Overall, this was a very good workout video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Initially this seemed like a real good buy. After using it for a week, I switched back to my older Casio calculator. The biggest problem with this Sharp is that the keys are awful: if you write 123, you press 1, then wait one second, then press 2, then wait 1 second, then press 3. In all, you end up typing in extremely slowly because if you press the keys in quick succession, this calculator simply stops registering your input. If you're an advanced calculator user, you'd want to be able to type fast and without looking at the screen. This will not happen on this calculator. Often, I'd type too fast and not realize I was missing digits or brackets, which gives wrong answers. This extremely frustrating machine will give you a headache fast.

That said, my first mat came out perfect with this tool, but like I said I had the general technique down already. I don't have other handhelds to compare to but this one is solid and lived up to my high hopes. It feels like it will serve me well with care.

If that's not enough, her private journals (Harriman, editor, Dutton, 1997), also available to Raimondo before his book came out, are conclusive. Moreover, Raimondo's earlier claim that Rand was influenced by Garrett's \\"The Driver\\" has been refuted by Chris Matthew Sciabarra, Stephen Kinsella and Bruce Ramsey.Oops!

This album is simply outstanding-- TH fully understands the conventions of the pop music and indie rock genres, and is therefore able to create songs that are the creative pinnacle of both. Perhaps this album's most endearing quality is it's straightforward playfulness and celebration of the small, happy things in life. I know that sounds terribly schmaltzy, but if you listen to the album, you'll agree. TH uses a pretty straighforward four man setup-- drums, bass, two guitars. But their songs are just so... CATCHY. Thier riffs and basslines perfectly accompany the lead singer's optimistic voice and lyrics. Definitely, there is something intangibly attractive about Troubled Hubble's music that I just can't put into words. So you'll just have to listen to the album yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-Heligoat album offers no trouble whatsoever!","review":"I ran into this band because i caught the Heligoats opening up for Clem Snide many a years back now.

So, there is the breakdown...now about THIS album; to my ears you can hear where he evolved from into his Heligoats persona. Penturbia has quirky songs about migraines and work and other assorted good jingly jangly bits.Troubled Hubble is certainly more of a band scene and you can feel it in the music.If you enjoy weirder slices of pop with quirky lyrics, you will not go wrong on this album.

For instance, there is no speaker phone feature (was great for when I was put on hold) and the ringer volume control only works if you press it WHILE the phone is ringing, and then resets to \\"loud\\" for the next call - in my house the phone keeps waking up the baby and I can't set any handset or the base to silent mode. Also, switching to pick up call waitibg is a crapshoot, you never know if you will disconnect one or both people. If you want a totally stripped down phone, this might work for you. For anyone else, it's a step down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Phone","review":"Bought this phone package, and everything was ok for about 3 weeks. Then, for no apparent reason, the phone began to experience very noisy static - to the point that you cannot hear the other person unless they are yelling.This seemed to occur primarily if you move farther than 5 to 10 ft from the base unit. Switching through all available channels, and researching online at V-tech's website led to no solutions to correct the problem.After researching for a replacement, it is clear that all of the negative comments about this phone are justified.

A student of Jung, A.S.Neil is very famous for his work with children in the field of education. The title of the book comes from a chant some Summerhill students do to make fun of the author's name, something he treasures because Neil sees his role (as head of Summerhill) not as Authoritarian, but as fellow traveler. I found this story of his life to be not only interesting, but touching as well.I don't think I have ever read a more \\"honest\\" autobiography. Neil tells his story in a very matter-of-fact manner, and although he doesn't lay on the schmultz, you nonetheless feel his struggles and triumphs as you join him on his journey/life review. I have given this book out as a gift to several people, and was happy to see that this edition had some new notes from Neil's daughter, who has taken over the running of Summerhill now that Neil is retired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest reviews","review":"Honestly this book needs a good editor. I'm not sure if the writer knew what he would sound like to everybody. He says things that sound really pushy, like it's a good idea to bully boys so they grow up. He tells a story about taking boys surfing and one boy didn't go and makes it sound like that boy was just a loser. I don't know how this helps anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with lack of depth","review":"I was excited to read this book, because as the mother of a boy, I wanted to find out how my husband and I can make sure church is relevant to our son. Unfortunately, I was offended at much of the content because of the author's problem with women in authority. Rather than focus on concrete suggestions of how to draw boys into church, the author spent a lot of time discussing God's role for women in the church and how the Bible does not support women in leadership. I did not feel that the author was qualified to address that issue. He has much experience in youth ministry working with boys, but I didn't come away with a better understanding of how my church can change to meet the needs of boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on problems but light on solutions","review":"I know the importance of good strong male mentors for young men, so I was eager to read this book.Unfortunately, the author seemed to take his entire book talking about the problems that this generation of young men faces.

There was no COA/certificate which, on a ~$1,000 diamond pair of earrings seems very strange to me. The clasp on the pair I received was bent, and the prong on the other earring was actually slightly crooked. The diamonds didn't look like G-H near colorless to my eyes as they seemed to have a yellowish tint, but I'm no grader so I can't take that part as too much of a negative. Of course, that is part of the problem -- there's absolutely nothing that states what these earrings are or that they are in fact VS2 grade. There is no certificate, no IGI, not even a basic COA. (There's also no hallmark on the earrings -- I guess because they are too small? Which means they could even be white gold and cubics...)Overall though, they just look and feel cheap -- and that's the real problem.

He doesn't tell anything pithy about any player or tournament and if you know anything about golf you will come away very disappointed. Additionally, the author's writing is lackluster and he appears to rely on second hand information and the anecdotes of others. The best lines of this book are on the back of the jacket cover and after that well... there are just a lot of better golf books!By the way the 5-Star review (in this section) \\"Strenge Aces the PGA Tour\\" is either written by his publisher or his friend.

It is a very nice early readers book. The plot follows a little girl at summer camp who is a detective. When the counselor gives her bunk a mystery to solve, the game is on. Several of the girls are in competition to solve the riddle and win their prize.This book is written on such a level that first and second graders can read a chapter book with a real plot.

He has so much to say, however, that an intro in the \\"For Beginners\\" style could be helpful, especially for younger readers.

For example, it's news to me that prominent analyst-writer Adolf Guggenbuhl Craig is Jewish. He remarks on his Christian practice on more than one occasion.

Miami was loaded that year as well: Ken Dorsey, Willis McGahee, Vilma, Andre Johnson, Kellen Winslow, Sean Taylor, DJ Williams, Joseph, and McDougle.

It is a masterwork of epic proportions.Perhaps more than anything - this album cements Black Sabbath as pure musical geniuses. They reach down into the very pits of their souls - and summon a work of art so majestic, it defies suitable descriptions.At its simplest level - this album is unique, powerful, intense, complex - it is everything you could ever hope for from music. It is the amalgamation of four people and their ideas into one collective consciousness. It is beyond simple titles or description.

Megalomania (4.75/5) starts slow then gets heavy, this ones almost as great as symptom. the rest of the songs are still good, but not like the first four. the original cd, which i have, ends on Am I Going Insane? and i feel like im going insane that a song like thats on and ending an album like that. its not a bad song, it just doesnt fit in on here. i strongly suggest buying this one if you like sabbath or ozzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sabbath","review":"What else can be said?Black Sabbath released Sabotage in 1975. Though this album, in my opinion, isn't their best, it is nevertheless a very solid Sabbath album from the Ozzy era. Ozzy, Geezer, Tony, and Bill are pretty much in top form. Black Sabbath is known for their catchy hard rock guitar riffs, and this album provides many. Songs such as \\"Megalomania\\", \\"The Thrill Of It All\\", and \\"Supertzar\\" are good examples. These three songs also happen to be favorites on the album.This album is a must-own for all true Black Sabbath fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Sabbath Album.","review":"I know most people think Paranoid or Master of Reality is the best Black Sabbath album, but I honestly believe that Sabotage is their best. Unlike the pure sludgefests of their early albums, Sabotage displays a degree of musical maturity not found in their earlier releases. To be sure, some songs(Thrill of it All) have a bit too much keyboard for my liking, but overall the music is simply outstanding. Every song from Hole in the Sky to Megalomania to The Writ shows extraordinary songwriting and musicianship. All in all Black Sabbath had never before and would never again come close to matching the quality of Sabotage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of the end . . . almost.","review":"By most accounts, Black Sabbath's stride began to waver a bit with the release of Sabotage. In strictly relative terms that may be true. Any band is bound to peak sooner or later, and Sabotage is clearly the day after. No new ground is broken and the performances occasionally lack Sabbath's typically tight delivery. Nonetheless, Sabotage stands quite nicely on its own merits and offers enough to keep any fan happy. On no other album will you find Bill Ward working as hard as he does pounding out Symptom of the Universe. Megalomania is an unheralded classic, displaying great production and quintessential Sabbath song construction. The rest of the album includes similar efforts except Supertzar which is just weird and ends, thankfully, before it ever really begins. For the most part Black Sabbath are guilty only of resting on their laurels, but, given their credentials at this point, zero growth isn't necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Short of a Flawless Masterpiece","review":"1975's Sabotage took Black Sabbath to new limits. Their lyrics went deeper than before, and they tokk heavy to a whole new level. This is their greatest album, with any line up, and showcased a great time for the lads."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of The Mid-Late Era","review":"Although this certiainly is not the best Black Sabbath cd, It is a whole lot better than Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die.The best songs are Megalomania, Symptom Of The Universe and Supertsar. The riff at the start of Symptom is amazing. Although this is a good album, its not the best and I would reccomend Black Sabbath or We Sould Our Soul For Rock And Roll more. Don't discard this however, it should be purchased in most heavy metal households."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabbath's best yet most underrated album","review":"Despite the overpraising of PARANOID, this recording stands out to the true listener as Sabbath's best album. PARANOID had three classic tracks on it, and the remainder of the album was marginally good at best. But SABOTAGE is consistently good from beginning to finish.Starts off with the contemplative \\"Hole in the Sky\\" and \\"Symptom of the Universe\\", which are great listens but don't yet make the album the scintillating masterpiece that it is. That is accomplished with tracks 4 and 5, which are \\"Megalomania\\" and \\"The Thrill of it All\\". The former is one of Sabbath's all-time greatest songs. A shame they didn't perform it during their reunion tour. \\"The Thrill of it All\\" features some killer Ozzy vocals. The album is concluded with the melodic \\"Am I Going Insane\\" and \\"The Writ\\".Five stars; Sabbath's best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer NOT compatible with windows 7","review":"I bought this printer after reading the good reviews.

The link to send the ringtone download link to the phone didn't work. Poor customer service - NO REFUND, so be sure you want ro risk the purchase price before you spend your money. Their reason for not refunding is that the software prompts you to create a test ringtone to send to your phone before purchase. Problem is that no matter what sound file you use to create the test ringtone, it generates a generic ringtone which is in no way resultant from your source file. In my mind that is not a valid test.I would not recommend this product. I will buy my ringtones instead.

Lovely.","review":"I have been following the writings of Ronald Donaghe for many years, from his first novel, Common Sons, to essays that have appeared in Hometowns and Member of the Family. But here, in this one volume, I finally got to meet Mr. Donaghe, during a time in his life when he was deeply hurt; yet all of his essays (whether about his pain or his family) reveal a rare optimist. I came away from this collection of Mr. Donaghe's essays committed to my own self-renewal, by following his lead: one must examine oneself as a gay person, in context to one's roots, one's family, and ultimately one's sexual morality. Mr. Donaghe, an author, is filled with love for his family and the love for truth (as it affects him), and gives one a sense of strength, even when in deep psychological pain. Read it, treasure it. Tell everyone you can about this rare gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"trumpet gig bag","review":"It's a very nice product....I have to admit there's times I miss my old \\"Tuxedo\\" trpt bag.

It brings to life people and movies who are long dead but not forgotten. Each page pulls the reader in and makes them take notice just like the sparkling ruby red slippers. You can't look away and you can't stop reading. When I reached the last page I found myself, like the author, realizing that there can't be an end to the story as long as people want the slippers...and face it how can you not love the slippers??? I think the best ending of all would be if this book was updated so we could all know the path the slippers have taken since the book was first published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This book is one of the most fascinating things I have ever read. The descriptions of the MGM auction and the details of the days leading up to it are priceless. As another reviewer has stated, I also think this book should be expanded/updated and re-released.... possibly as a hardcover coffee table book. Since it was written, Debbie Reynolds has publicly shown her Arabian test shoes and has admitted her dealings with Kent Warner. Also, at least one pair of slippers has changed hands again and one pair has been stolen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works too good!!","review":"Our cat is in love with this brush, so much she can't sit still.

The photo contrast and clarity are good, and it does a nice job of presenting them as a slide show, and have a really neat function of Mosaic presentation with up to 3 potos displayed at once. However, only downfall of this unit is that it does not play MP3's for music on a slide show. Others at this price and in it's class do. If you find a really good deal on this, buy it, you will not be dissapointed, but if it is at full price, check and see what else is there, you may be able to get more for the same money. I bought one of these on sale below the comparable competators, and I love it. Would work well in an office where music may be distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a better frame.","review":"Picture contrast is too high. Pictures look washed out.

I find myself having to stop at a certain point in the game since there is suddenly no more character world. Just a character running around in pitch black while enemies still do damage invisible. Granted the price was low on the product, however there should have been more information on the product prior. I'm extremely dissatisfied and would not shop for another material product through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"backgrounds and music anyone?","review":"Okay, my best friend and I rented this game because it seemed really cool. Then we put it in the PS2 and waited for about 10-15 minutes for it to load. Seriously! Then we built our characters (the coolest part) and went to play.The beginning wasn't bad. Pretty standard leveling up crap. The sound, however, never worked properly. The music came and went. The cut scenes constantly froze. The backgrounds would take about 15 minutes just to load and then when we left one area we had to wait another 15 minutes for that background to load. We tried 3 different games all with the same results. Also, the PS2 plays every other game perfectly, so I think this is a big problem with the game.Try something else because this game isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This game is overpriced, very overpriced. If you gotta have it, wait till it's under $20. Still overpriced but it's more reasonable, and this isn't far from the bargain bins. This is a no skill no thought game. Sony puts at least 18 controls on the controller, two in this game control your hero. L1, controls where and X, hack, and that's it. Not much to work with. If Sony keeps this up, might be time to switch to X Box. Spend your money on a better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"the #!%$ing game will not work!","review":"Ok so i just got the game like 10 minutes and when i put the game in the playstation2 it it read the disc for about a minute and then said disc read error did anyone else have this problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real","review":"This game is nowhere close to what I expected.

Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance 2 is 10x more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Explore the Worlds of Norath","review":"I found this game a bit too easy but there are times when the difficulty rating was high and it was certainly more challenging. The Prince of Hate can only be defeated a certain way regardless of what difficulty level you play. Once you figure out how to beat him and the other bosses you pretty much got the game cornered. I liked the character customization at the very beginning. You'll also notice that all the NPC's you encounter that are female have very noticable endowments to say the least. The game is prone to crashing if there's but one small scratch on the disc or if your PS2 isn't at least a year old. Yeah that bites and this is the only reason I don't give this otherwise enjoyable game more than 4 stars. The bugs will annoy you after awhile. I am fortunate enough to have ordered a game that's bug free, but I've heard other folks complain mostly about the bugs in this game. Well, I suggest renting first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best video game ever","review":"this game can never get boring. You can choose your characters race, what he looks like and name him. There are 45 levels. More than 10,000 items. Including armour weapons potions and magical items. You can fight close range with weapons e.g swords,axes,maces,staffs,daggers. With long ranged stuff e.g bow,spears,magic. The more you play the better you get and you can upgrade skills.

I have had it for about a month and I am already on my second time through. The graphics are great and the game play is smooth. I tend to like the hack and slash type of games and this one delivers! There are a few areas that I do not find that enjoyable to play, but it is just my opinion and that is why I only gave it four stars instead of five. I bought Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance at the same time but I enjoy this game so much that I have not even opened the package on the other one yet! If you are looking for a good hack and slash game, give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could have been better...","review":"This game is a great way to get people interested in the MMORPG EverQuest, but I do feel that it tends to be too repetitive.My wife and I played this game all the way through on the first two difficulty settings (she plays a cleric and I play a shadow knight). The worst thing about this game is the limited distance that 2 or more players can get from each other. This isn't so bad in the dungeons when someone gets trapped against a wall; however, durring boss battles one player can trap another in the corner of the screen with the boss.If you think that playing on easy level is, well, too easy...just wait until you are playing the more advanced levels, where the mobs (monster or beasts) have more hit points and do a heck of a lot more damage. Overall, despite its repetivness, this game is very addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This game is really quite good. There are many different characters to play as. There is no difference between the male and female of each species to play. That's a nice change. The zoom is a little lame, but you want to see ahead for you most of the time anyway. There's around 25 hours of play time the first time through. Some of the bosses are challenging, but not impossible to figure out. If you like Baldur's Gate, you'll like this game as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun action-packed game!","review":"I've had endless hours of enjoyment playing this game.

Best multiplayer RPG for this system!! I spent hours with friends, family, and usually alone time playing this awesome game. Pretty good graphics for the time period, decent storyline, that really is optional to follow (the game is really straight-forward), and I am proud to say that I was able to sway many of my girls that are friends to spend the afternoon crawling through the dungeons.It's easy to get into, super addictive, and pretty awesome character design.

He cuddles it, he loves setting off the \\"Ruff Ruff... pant pant pant... Ruff ruff!\\" sound that it makes, he grabs it and shakes his head until it flies off. Then he chases it down and does it all over again. If it matched the size and quality of the Multipet gorilla we bought last, I'd be more thrilled.

He tore a new hole on the other side of the head. Sowed it up again and gave it back to him again. A few minutes later he tore an ear off.

Well written book too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"While I have a lot of admiration for Swensen and his accomplishments, he has difficulty writing in plain english. Unlike his earlier book, supposedly he wrote this book for the masses and not just portfolio managers. Unfortunately, the book is just simply loaded down with unnecessary portfolio/finance babble, which makes this book difficult to read and dense as wood. It is too bad, because Swensen puts forth a number of important points in his book, but their effect is diminished by the author's poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Ideas but I couldn't finish it","review":"Well, the title says it all. Where was the editor on this? The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest. I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness. And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like \\"Taxes impair wealth accumulation.\\" I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that. I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult To Read","review":"Swensen may be a brilliant investor--but he's not much of a writer. The book is extremely dense and often painful to read.

Writing, difficult","review":"I read about this author for several years before I got the book.I've read books on the same topic, but this gives further support for accepted principles. Mr. Swensen gives more insight into the benefits of investing diversification into low cost index mutual funds. He is particularly good at detailing visble and hidden costs that detract from performance while giving practical advice on implementation.Writers that have mastered their subject, write clearly. I don't understand why the cumbersome writing. Personal style, poor editing, or obscure ethical/legal protection?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Investment advice from a pro","review":"Although for many investors, the stock market is the only game in town, author David F. Swensen, the experienced manager of Yale University's endowment, suggests investing in logical low-cost, fair, nonprofit index funds that track the market closely. He advocates building a carefully balanced portfolio, and strongly recommends regular rebalancing. He comes to these conclusions based on his rigorous analysis of the returns achieved by a host of other investment media, especially mutual funds. In fact, he builds his investment guidebook around a scathing scolding of the mutual-fund industry, even though mutual funds also have strong supporters. getAbstract believes Swensen's counsel will be useful for individual investors who face a bewildering array of choices. In fact, if you had a rich uncle on Wall Street to advise you, he would probably echo much of Swensen's logical advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Personal Investment This Decade","review":"This is the best primer on personal investment strategy that I have read in the last ten years. Could only have been written by someone with Swensen's credentials who is totally unbeholden to the mutual fund companies and other financial services players who are systematically bilking small investors through high fee, high risk investment strategies that do not pay off for the investor in the long term.Swensen's advice is sound, based on proven portfolio management principles, battle-tested via Yale's global endowment, one of the largest and most sophisticated investors of our time. The chapters on the proper use of ETFs- exchange traded funds- in a personal investment portfolio are worth the purchase price alone.Of course, most investors will never take the time to read and reflect on a book like this--but you should! Just don't count on your mutual fund company to tell you about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - Swensen has no ulterior motives....","review":"Like this book a lot. Sharpened my thoughts regarding ETFs, emerging market bonds (just sold what I had), and the usual suspect Mutual Funds. One oddity - he ignores Closed End Funds. Anyway - Swensen comes off an objective and trustworthy commentator. Compare that to Barton Biggs latest book - I am a Biggs fan but come on, when he plugs for Hedge Funds I found myself laughing at his duplicity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hope This Works","review":"This book is very well written for an everyday kind of person or family.

Don't do it BEFORE you've grasped chapter 5 of this interesting work."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUT WILL THIS WORK IN THE COMING FUTURE ECONOMY?","review":"Swensen gives excellent advice such as using Vanguard (as I have for years), and he recommends that individuals play a very active role in their financial future. What concerns me greatly though is that financial counselling books such as this don't say a word about the seemingly inevitable coming massive depression that should arrive around 2010, driven by boomer demographics. I suggest that Swensen's excellent advice be married with this by also reading Arnold's very scary THE GREAT BUST AHEAD and visiting the book's website thegreatbustahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wants to be 2 books","review":"This book wants to be at least two different books:1) A book slamming the mutual fund industry2) A book giving new investors basic descriptions of different asset classes and the behavior to expect from them.On the first point, I don't know why he bothered. Anyone who has done any research on mutual funds and how they have been run in recent years will already know all of this. The only addition was the information on some of the newest ETFs and how they aren't so great. This is worthless repetition of common information.On the second point, it would be OK for some new investors, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.In the end his strongest point seems to be that the investment world is strongly against the small individual investor. Great, thanks a lot. Why not use all of your years of experience to give us some help? Telling us the most available options are worthless and then not giving us anywhere to go isn't useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing you haven't read before","review":"I don't get the positive reviews.

It would make a very solid addition to the Game Boy library of any experienncd gamer or fan of shooters. To put it lightly, you must be like me and enjoy excercises in frustration. You will die many, many times before you memorize the enemy patterns and develop the neccesary reflexes to move on to the next stage.I must disagree with the assertion, however, that this is the best R-type game out there. While this and the original R-Type, certainly makes the top 3, I believe that R-Type Final, with over 10 stages and 100 ships, is a much more well rounded portrait of the series as a whole. It has much more replay value as well. If you can't stand polygonal slowdown, though, R-Type III is certainly a viable choice. A very fun game indeed, if you are a fan of classic shooters or you are just looking for a very challenging GBA game, look no further than R-Type III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful nocturne","review":"Wow, I'm glad I bought this when I did!

(Note: I am quoted in the book.) I loved the first edition and have always thought this was one of the most underrated libertarian books. Libertarians have a tendency to be negative because the political world is not to our liking, yet this book emphasizes the positive side of the case for libertarianism. For every problem that government would deal with by negative means--force and aggression--there is usually a positive solution--through individual peaceful action or voluntary cooperation. Mary explains this as well as anyone has. Hers is a holistic vision, emphasizing the interconnectedness of things. Here is a great example: \\"Through its domestic aggression, the United States has empowered virtually every threat to its national security in the past 50 years.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"DINO AT HIS VERY BEST!","review":"Just received this marvelous cd today and can't stop playing it!I have been a fan of this wonderfully talented man for 50 years!Don Costa's arrangements are flawless!

What do Wookiees eat- nada. What kind of \\"product\\" do Wookiees use to maintain their coats- if only.Not counting the cover itself, there are only TWO total pages that even mention Wookiees.

However, I'm now 35 weeks pregnant and it's become pretty much useless. It's very flat and gives no support anymore. I wish there was a way to re-fluff it or something.

After more than two years of continuous use, the sand-type coating is starting to come off, and the heating element died at the end of last winter (more a result of rodent activity than the product, I think). But for a relatively inexpensive birdbath, it worked great. Even through tough midwestern winters. Bonuses were in addition to all of the bird activity at the bath - a pair of foxes started making a regular trip every evening to the bath last winter for water.

It was thinner, and when we measured it, it turned out to be 5/8' instead of 3/4'.Second, the material felt different from the PVC tubes we'd seen in stores. We took it to Lowe's to compare. The rep there commented it is rubber, not PVC (plastic). I am no expert on tubing material so I'd take it with a grain of salt, but I want to flag it here and maybe the seller can comment.

I had copies of mine with me and gave him one but he didn't, so I ordered one from Amazon. It was a propitious encounter indeed; he's very personable and knowledgeable.As part of a larger context, my book devotes only some 40 pages (with no graphics) to the evolution of the Universe, Sun, Earth and Life. Altschuler devotes 240 pages interspersed with many colored photos and drawings. I highly recommend reading his fuller descriptions and explanations from the Big Bang, thru star, planet and asteroid formation, to the emergence of Life and the prospect of our foolish arrogance extinguishing it.

Tim Steele brings comfort, completion, and tidings to those of us who prefer the artistic value of metrical and rhyming verse. His inclusion of nature and the everyday enable the concreteness of his verse to be felt more with each read. Prepare to keep this book at your bedside for continued reading, and obtain anything and everything you can by this timeless poet.In this collection, his rhyming verse is the most resonating, but his blank verse is stirring in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Timothy Steele gives us an excellent collection here. His use of meter is masterful. These poems are truly unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking back and doubling over","review":"This book is an excellent example of why Justin Wilson should have retired years ago. With the release of 'Looking Back', Justin is milking his fans one last time. These recipes are reprints of recipes that he has put into his other books, and are just plain not that good. His humor has gotten worse over the years, so you feel almost a sense of sadness when you try to read his little stories. Save the money and your health."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Cookbook to Read and Use","review":"I bought this book after seeing reruns of Justin on TV a couple of years ago. He has folksy comments about a variety of subjects on most pages. I have tried a number of recipes and had some tasty results. There are lots of family pictures sprinkled among the ingredients and instructions. He starts out by explaining how to make roux. I never could understand why anyone would buy it ready-made.Some of the ingredients may be difficult to come by in some areas, but you will find plenty of recipes with common ingredients. He likes his dishes spicy and uses generous amounts of wine and Louisiana Hot Sauce in some. There's nothin like a Jambalaya that makes your hair sweat!You will also have an enjoyable book to sit back and browse through in your favorite comfy chair. Be sure and bring a glass of that beaujolais drinkin' wine - I garontee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cajan","review":"no I am not cajan but love the cooking ...oh the trinty or just a seafood delight ...I like to cook and love to eat...this cookbook is a easy to read and follow book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious but it fails to provide new synthesis","review":"The book is encycolpaedic in its survey of earlier scholarship--that is its strength. But it leaves out crucial new evidence from the fields of history of science and astronomy in India, and from archaeology that compel a fresh look at old assumptions. For example, the Sarasvati river is now believed to have dried up around 2000 BC and a pilgrimage to its tirthas by Balarama is an important episode in the Mahabharata. Brockington nowhere examines such issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apologists for public schools get an \\"F\\" in research.","review":"It is typical of our marginally educated educators in this country to bungle their research. Carnoy's book is an example. They make absolute comparisions of student proficiencies after controlling for the some of the demographic and socio-economic effects but in so doing they leave out the most important factor of all: How did the students compare with their regular public school cohorts when they entered charter schools? Perhaps lost to these ed-researchers is the fact that charter schools attract low performers compared to the public school alternatives. The real measure of a quality school is not children's absolute performance, but how much do they improve year over year. On that measure, charter schools are signficantly superior to their regular public school counterparts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set","review":"My only complaint is the CD was a little hard to use because it went through everything at a breakneck pace. You can't use it much without the book. Each chapter has only a few minutes of audio and I was always rewinding. That's not to say it wasn't a very useful addition to the book, especially for something as hard to learn to pronounce as Norwegian. It's just not something you can use in the car.Overall though, the course is very well done and is a great deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to learn Norwegian","review":"I think it's the best way to learn norwegian by yourself, and for a cheap price.The lessons are easy to understand and every unit ends with exercices to make sure you learned everything well.With the CDs, you'll get use to hear the Norwegian langage. Of course, they speak slower than norwegian people having a real conversation, but you are here to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teach Yourself Norwegian","review":"When trying to learn a foreign language while at home the great challenge is to hear the target language spoken, especially with a language like Norwegian that is in no sense an international language. In the Teach Yourself package you get 2 CDs and a ridiculous amount of space on them is wasted by the English chatter of the teacher. Also, the tone of voice in which she constantly whines \\"Do you understand?\\" ought to be a hanging offense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple installation","review":"I've installed a few faucets over the years, and this one was by far the easiest to install.

I think everyone should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK I EVER READ, what a disappointment!","review":"I didn't want to give this book even one star, but that doesn't seem to be an option here ... in a word, this book was AWFUL. Sure, it has a catchy, clever title, but that is IT! I was disappointed after a few chapters, but kept going since it was a fast, short read, and also was hoping and expected so much more. Where were juicy details about the protagonist's crush on GB? Hardly anything, and her encounters at the end - left me flat. There was too much about the quirky yet boring details of her daily existence, which was weird to say the least. Per the title, the premise of the book could have had potential, but the author blew it. Just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny--Fun-neee!","review":"And I thought I was bad. Leave it to my neighbor to once again come through on an excellent read. After reading GEORGE BUSH, DARK PRINCE OF LOVE, I realized my [slight] obsessive personality trait pails in comparison to Rosemary's, George Bush's obsessive, white-trash, obese, yet determined, dream-lover. Watch Rosie obsession progress from GB's inauguration, through the Persion Gulf War, and finally to GB's last days in office. Her slightly demented logic and determination won me over instantly. This novel is all laughs. Millet's narrative flows from one chapter to the next, never missing a beat. The way Millet uses the events occuring during GB's term in ofice to construct Rosie's life is sheer brilliance and fun. Lover's of George will most likely hate this book. But those who had secretly hated him in office will appreciate this book, no doubt. Can't wait for the next installment.

I would highly recommend!!","review":"I have struggled with my weight since I was a teenager. I have tried everything: dieting, running, aerobics and now weight lifting. Weight lifting is the only thing that showed be immediate (within a month) results. I used to go to the gym and simply mimick what others were doing. I've learned that there are a lot of people out there who don't have a clue about what they are doing. This book shows you exactly how and what to do, to begin your work out program. You can target the areas you feel need the most work or follow the total body workout. It is very flexible-I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the right way to lift weights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted at all","review":"This may be a good book for someone who is just starting out in weight training, but even at that I don't think it's worth the price. Most of the book is charts for you to fill in with weight lifted and reps during your workouts, which you could easily make yourself on a spreadsheet. There are relatively few exercises described, and really no workout options to speak of. If you're ready to slavishly follow this author's ideas (which aren't backed up with any evidence in particular), then it's a complete package deal. I prefer to have some evidence to convince me that one strategy is better than another, since exercise books differ so widely in what they tell you.You could get much more and better information for planning a workout routine, and far better descriptions and pictures of exercises, for free at exrx.net."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter book","review":"This is a great book if you are serious about lifting.

Also, this book doesn't go into the reasons why you should be doing what you're doing. It just tells you to do it. I don't like that approach but some people might. I bought this book in conjunction with 'Bodybuilding a Realistic Approach : How You Can Have a Great Body' by Frank Melfa and liked the latter one a lot more. The latter one is appropriate for the beginner to somewhat knowledgeable person interested in lifting weights. You will surpass James Orvis book in about 1 month (if not less) so save yourself the money and get the other, more complete book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted $14.95","review":"This book was recommended when I ordered Frederic Delavier's \\"Strength Training Anatomy\\" (which is excellent).Unfortunately this Orvis book is extremely basic, meant for those who know nothing about weight training.

If you have already been lifting six months to a year and are looking for fresh workout ideas, I wouldn't bother buying the book. There are better books (and web sites) out there for your needs.My biggest gripe is that there is only one 12 week workout plan.

The workouts are fun and I keep looking forward to what I get to do next. And unlike when I was training before I am not over working or getting bored of doing the same workout over and over again. That means that I have been cosistantly training, I am just about done with the 12 weeks and plan on graduating to book II.

Padding is good but could be better under the gear . The wheels could be a little bigger. I can't fit my MacBookPro into the computer pocket, so I tuck it inside the camera compartment where it's nice and snug, does put some stress on the self healing zipper (zipper needs to be bigger).

The premise of this movie is that the princesses have to escape the cruelty of their soon to be step mother and go to a magical land where they are free to dance all night. This movie is especially disheartening and scary to children who have a sick parent as the father is in this movie. The evil mother attempts to poison the father so she can gain control of the kingdom. This does not sound like something a 5-9 year old should be watching. I have since tapped into the Holly Hobbie dvd's and my 8 year old loves them and I love the solid family values and great role model that Holly is.

While the princesses are away their Aunt tries to poision their father ,so she can have the kingdom for herself. Will she succed or will Barbie and her sisters find a way to stop her? Watch BARBIE IN THE 12 DANCING PRINCESSES to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"Not one of the better Barbie movies. Some parts dragged -- prior Barbie movies had much better action scenes and more suspense. This movie had too many obvious components and left nothing to the imagination. The evil cousin who attempted to take over from the king was not a great villian. The scenery in the magic 'dancing' land was very pretty but the story line was just too dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Barbie movie out there!","review":"This movie has a wonderful story line. It is not musical like Princess and the Pauper or Island Princess, but it remains my daughters favorites. If you are wondering about Barbie movies and want to try one, I would start with this one. I like how Barbie is portrayed as the hero in all of the films. She uses her brain, good manners, and compassion to overcome challenges and is dressed modestly. I highly recommend all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and fun","review":"Never having seen a Barbie video, I was very skeptical at first but then was pleasantly suprised at the quality of the animation and the plot. The music which sounds familiar, I think is from Celine Dion and fits beautifully with the story. If you have LCD, the animation is crisp, clear and brightly colored. The scenery dazzles. With all the dancing scenes and a great plot...it makes for great entertainment for any barbie fan. Be warned if your little ones don't have Barbie dolls yet, you may find yourself shopping for one after this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie dancers is awesome....","review":"Great good hearted family fun for children, I love the ballet Barbies the best.... much better than Mermadia and Fairytopia....

The evil cousin slowly poisons the king making him very ill. There is also a battle scene where the princesses throw rocks at the soldiers trying to capture them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dark and disturbing","review":"While other reviewers gave this high stars due to coloring and dancing and ability to capture attention, most are completely leaving out how dark and disturbing the evil character is! The duchess, in charge of grooming the princesses on proper decorum, whom I believe is their faher the king's own cousin, is secretly poisoning him in an effort to take over! Reminded me of the movie The 6th Sense! It is sad and very disturbing. Try explaining that to your little princess! I was apalled to see this dark undertone while watching with my 4 year old daughter. Just not appropriate!! Totally unneccessary disturbing content!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I was not too pleased when my daughter started showing interest in Barbie in general..or Barbie movies. I gave in and we got this movie from the Library. Turns out I loved it and all my old love of Barbie kind of came back to me. I'm still not interested in her having a lot of Barbie stuff but I love the movie. I think there were points where I was more into it then her. It is a typical kind of predictable movie but with some interesting twists.

Our original Uverse Modem that had two phone jacks which worked great for our phone and fax, but it died. They replaced the old modem with their newest version that has only one phone jack (boo!), so we had to manually plug in the fax line every time we wanted to fax something. I initially tried the little plug-in splitter and it didn't work. This little switch does work. It works perfectly with the flip of the switch. So basic, but SO good.It's very easy to set up. I used my label maker to make a \\"Phone\\" label and a \\"Fax\\" label and stuck them in the area provided next to the A and B on the switch front panel. That way I never forget which is what. :)I highly recommend this little gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"RJ11/RJ12 Switch","review":"Arrived quickly. Well constructed to spec and works great.

Yes, 1960's technology, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, high-quality switchbox!","review":"I stopped by the local RadioShack to pick up one of their A/B Phone Switches, but to my surprise they have quit selling them. Well, after finding this switch here on Amazon and getting it installed, I'm happy that RadioShack stopped selling their overpriced little inline switch.This switch is simple and of very high quality. It's also a great value and the seller, Cyberguys!, shipped it very quickly and securely. I couldn't be happier with this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allowed me to get rid of one phone line","review":"I was paying Verizon $16 per month for my fax machine telephone landline, and I rarely get faxes anymore. With this data switch, I am now able to use one phone line for voice and fax (switched to position \\"A\\" 99% of the time). If my clients need to send me a fax, I switch over to the \\"B\\" setting the fax comes through. The cost of the box (with shipping) is exactly what I was paying Verizon monthly for my fax line. I now save $191 per year. Nice.I would have given it FIVE STARS, and this is perhaps quibbling, but the box is bigger than it needs to be.

See if they remind you of Jabba the Hut from Star Wars. Do you know a kid like Mike? He becomes his own hero. Maybe there is some connection to real life in this movie. We love the happy ending and resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Collection","review":"As my expectations were much higher for a widely distributed DVD of numerous bellydance performances by varying artists, this will be an unkind review. So here goes: Bellydancing is basically a series of fluid, serpentine movements enacted through the rhythm of music. Serpentine-snake or snakelike. Now, how many fat snakes have you ever seen? I know, it's mean; but I bought this with the impression that there would have to be at least one good dance. Not for me. Actually, I envisioned two good dances, as two future Bellydance Superstars are on this DVD: Sabrina Fox and Elizabeth Strong. Not to discredit them, as their performances on BDSS are great, but they should've been allowed to perform solo, rather than with one or more other dancers. Maybe that was their downfall here. The company that released the DVD isn't necessarily bad; Tribal Revolution had several good dances-notably Zoe Jakes and Ariellah. I recommend that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"I really like this book. It's informative, intresting, and facinating. I recomend this book to people who are quite advanced in the study of Black Magick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a gem!","review":"Certainly , this has stood the test of time. Phil had a great rock voice and was a knock-out drummer and singer with Dwight Twilley. \\"Precious To Me\\" and \\"Let Her Dance\\" were perfect vehicles for his strong vocal talent. The production is a bit light, as the guitars lack grit, but it was a good start for his solo career. So sad as he died tragically too young. At least we have this document."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of the cord","review":"For those of you who are looking for a wireless thermometer, this is a fine unit but has some issues... the largest is in my opinion is the probe and cord. I bought my first one a couple years ago, loved it but then it started reading 159 degrees when it should be just room temp. Well the problem was the probe I was told, and the probe is not covered by the warranty. Evidently any bend in the wire can ruin it. They also mentioned that any water on it would ruin it..... how can we wash it then???? I couldn't find a replacement probe so I got another one, and it lasted two weeks. Again they would not cover it under warranty. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate by 54 degrees","review":"I received one of these for my birthday and really liked the concept of monitoring the meat temperature away from the grill while mingling with guests. Well, it turned out the beef we served was way too raw. I boiled some water and the probe recorded 156 degrees when an old analog instant thermometer registered 210. It is now in the garbage can. This is not the first Polder product we have purchased but it will be the last. A Polder temperature fork was also way off. If it was from a local store I would take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recivied order???????","review":"i order awireless thermometer last December2002 and have not recived my order. so i wouldn't recomand to purche any thing that they SELL???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD","review":"First do not be confused : This DVD is a documentary, not a show !Second : It last 28 minutes, and this is about thier tour in CaliforniaThird : There is only one song on this DVD which is Viens DanserFourth : I hope you understand French well (I Do...)I hope this review will be useful (as a warning !)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent attempt....but with a major problem.","review":"Focusing primarily on the rarely-seen Fleischer/Famous Superman shorts from World War II (which, like most of the war cartoons produced under the Paramount banner, features the Japanese), this disc has about the best video possible for a public domain release of these classic cartoons. Problem is, this company has arrogantly decided to add their own sound effects in addition to (and sometimes over) the original soundtrack. What could be a reasonably affordable holdover until Warner Bros. restores the cartoons turns into a colossal waste because of the audio equivalent of graffiti. Additionally, the beginning of the final cartoon, \\"Terror on the Midway\\" is nothing more than a series of freeze frames, implying that the publisher didn't look too hard for a decent print. Definitely not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reproduction, but poor sound quality","review":"i bought both Superman vs. Monsters and Villans and Superman vs. Nature and War. not bad, and they are a slice of Americana, but the sound isn't very good.the sound in the Batman cartoons remind me of high school, watching those movies in class on a reel. the cartoons are excellent, but again, sound is pretty shaky.Look! in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's SUPERMAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessary resource for those who enjoy creating their own toy puzzles from wood","review":"As a longtime subscriber to \\"Journal of Recreational Mathematics\\" and a reader of puzzle books, I have seen many puzzles that involve dissection and reassembly. Therefore, I took an immediate interest to this book when I encountered it in a used bookstore. It was designed to be a book of problems for students in a woodworking shop, and many of the creations are identical to what I have seen in print.The puzzles start fairly simply but quickly reach the point where significant woodworking talent would be needed to make them.

The first DVD is confusing to some (especially the first episode) but if you ride it out it becomes a wonderful experience. The concept is complex and the characters are multilayered, you can't help but fall in love with them.I really felt what all they were all feeling. I personally enjoy the mystery and the dark ideas about the end of the world but its all underlined with hope, even if it is a little hard to see. Even, in the end, if you dislike the show you can't deny that the music is beautiful. It was probably the first thing that attracted me to it. All the songs transport you and make you feel the emotions.(Extra note: Though I do not usually recommend one or the other. I suggest watching this subtitled being as the story is so deep and complex that a lot of the richness of dialogue is lost in the dub.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow....","review":"... I've seen the movie and I thought that the movie was great, although mooshed together. Its sorta like the Utena Movie and Series, the movie is the entire series in under two hours, but still pretty.

Given the gravity of the subject matter the wry wit and sarcasm of the author failed to entertain me. And while he succeeded in presenting the UN as the punching bag and scapegoat of the superpowers, he failed, due mainly to the constraints of the 'Beginners' format, to sufficiently forward discussion of what the UN and its member organizations due well.

I had never heard of Niels Bohr, but as the quantum revolution unfolded, he too made a key contribution. Einstein and Bohr fought over quantum physics: Einstein a realist, Bohr a pragmatist.

I found the author's style, however, very annoying. He does not keep to a timeline, but meanders off in five different directions page after page, and digresses left and right before telling what happened. The book reads more like a chat with a slightly tipsy gossip, who has to bring in every little bit of juicy information about the neighbors and their cats before relaying the main story. I finally gave up when the author tried to explain quantum theory by the properties of springs in the mattress where Einstein is supposedly making love to an actress!

The game only lets you go through the deck twice and then you LOSE! WHAT is this!!! Instead of letting you select different cards/backgrounds/music it should have given you more options for your actual game! After wasting thirty bucks on this I gave it to my sister and went back to my old gameboy two color cartridge.Also, it seems like they could have made the cards a little bigger and had less background. Have the makers seen the latest reasearch on the number of adults playing video games? Also that the adults preferred games are card and puzzle games?

I wish it were more like Yahoo spades with more options in the menu so I could play double nil passing and suicide. Also, I would like characters with different difficulty levels, because I have only lost 1 game so far. I play on a regular Gameboy Advance, and I have found that if I create too many faces (3) and save too many games and settings, the game will freeze up. This can be corrected by going to the options menu and erasing your saved stuff. And I agree, there really isnt enough female faces. They all look like men. I didn't dare make one for my wife either! But, nonetheless, I love this game, as does my wife (gin rummy). I can't get the gameboy away from her! Hearts, Poker, Blackjack, Crazy Eights, and Go Fish are excellent.

I bought some Valeo 600 series (bracket style) and they work perfectly and are almost half the price.The 900 series work better on my Lexus IS300, but if it is really cold the contact won't be perfect either.

Please don't buy this as it is a serious security issue when driving in rain.

There are two advantages to this: 1) The wiper makes better overall contact with the windshield. This is because the wiper comes pre-contoured such that when the wiper arm presses down on them they make even contact from end-to-end. 2) No more wiper blades to rust. Metal wiper blades generally rust early in the life of a car due to the continual wetness on their surface. These frameless wipers are almost entirely polymer materials. The wiper blades are no longer needed and can be permanently removed from your car. These Valeo blades fit perfectly on my 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder (24\\" driver, 22\\" passenger) and took 5 minutes to install. No more threading a wiper refill into the wiper blade. Simply remove the existing wiper blades and snap these onto the wiper arms. Done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I purchased the 24\\" and 18\\" Valeo Ultimates from Amazon about 3 weeks ago. They worked fine at the beginning but now they are useless.

All I here is SQUEAK-BANG-SQUEAK-BANG... the under portion of the blade vibrates and squeaks across the glass.I decided to try to contact Valeo but it seems that they don't have customer service. I've called multiple times and it tells me that there is no one available to answer the phone. It then goes on to tell all the places you can purchase the wiper blades (just what I want!).

I sent them an email to request the part since it was only 6 weeks old and received only an \\"message received\\" email in return.

I love the idea of saving your first kiss, but this book didn't approach it in a way my daughters really related to it. Also, the drawings of the men that court the young princess were really a show stopper for me and my girls...she is young and the men are all old, ugly and completely undesirable--not quite what they're going to find in the real world...yes, there will be undesireable young men, but they probably won't be as blatantly obvious as the pictures made them.

I too think the metaphors are a little racy (if not gross). And without the moral, the story is rather stupid. My toddler kisses all her family and friends, she would not understand what \\"saving it\\" would mean.

Teach your girls to love themselves and grow up smart and confident and they will have all they need to make that decision when it comes.

Never mind that the concept of purity is reduced to having had sex or not having had sex, never mind that Christ's death on the cross for our sins (and the purity that comes from forgiveness) is equated with a single act of sex. . .MIND, instead, that this book is written for babies and pre-schoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect gift","review":"I have recommended this book over and over again...almost as many times as my daughter has requested this story as her nighttime read.

If you're careful though you can use one probe for quite some time -- I'm into the 8th month with my current one, using it at least twice a week.It's important to note that, even if the air temperature inside your cooking device may not exceed the recommended range, the metal where the wire makes its way out of the device can. I use one quite frequently for grilling -- I run the wire out through one of the rotisserie holes -- and it's important to make sure the wire doesn't contact the grill bars themselves. For an oven at 350 degrees or less I've had no problems at all.When grilling, I also don't actually insert the probe until I know I'm close to finishing cooking -- this helps keep them alive.And, when they do burn out -- they're fairly cheap to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polder please design a better probe!","review":"When this probe is new, it functions flawlessly.

Those with mesh occasionally kinked if abused by the user, but they never totally failed to give a reading with such short life. The mesh ones were good for one or more seasons. I am thoroughly dissapointed with Polder's \\"new and improved\\" probes. This, of course applies to any of the Polder products shipped with the new worthless probes.

I don't know why it has that odd taste--the vinegar, the particular mustard seeds?--but I put this on a sandwich and hated it. Then I decided to try again, a different day, and again, scraped it off the turkey. I could not bear it.I threw the nearly full bottle away.For now, it's back to non-organic mustard until I can taste other organic mustards and find one that doesn't make me wanna spit out my food.Pity.Mir"},{"rating":"1","title":"It tastes off..","review":"You would think that something as simple as yellow mustard would be impossible to ruin, but this company seemed to do so.

I have never read a book that made me laugh and cry in turns. This book succeeds on several levels: as a cautionary tale against drug-taking; as a look inside the empty, meaningless 80's in Hollywood; at the life-altering experience of anti-Semitism (his childhood); as a testement to the redemtive experience of being a parent; and as a prime example ofhow to write a memoir. And frankly, I have to come back to my original point: the book is hysterically funny -- Jerry Stahl survived because he's big enough to be able to laugh at himself.

It sets out to achieve a seemingly impossible task, which is to list and comment on all tax havens on the planet. Whilst I can't be sure if it was successful at achieving this objective, I definitely know that it has covered 99.9% of these tax havens. Many of the havens I have never heard of and talking to my colleagues who specialise in taxation for some of these havens, I found that the information was accurate and up to date.

There is no question that Jeromeskee can move, but the instructional aspect of the video is minimal. By the time the narrator has verbally explained what to do and you begin to do it, Jeromeskee has already gone onto the next step. I'm no pro dancer, but I'm also not uncoordinated either and it was frustrating to not be able to keep up at all. I'm going to break the rewind button on my dvd player pretty soon. More time could have been spent explaining in detail where to place your weight, when to shift feet, etc. rather than just showing it and not giving enough time to figure it out before already moving to the next step. Slow down!

I like the fact that I can easily switch between metric and imperial, and it has the tare feature, which I think is essential to be able to use a scale effectively. I also like that it turns itself off after a couple of minutes of inactivity, since I would probably forget and run down the battery. As it is, I'm still on the original battery. The Polder is compact and easy to store. It's also more reasonably priced than most other scales I've seen.

Such an achievement would be remarkable. I wonder whether some reviewers are more interested in showing off their knowledge than in a reasonable assessment of the work in question.Given the limited scope of the Osprey format and the general nature of the series' reading audience, Latimer has done a superb job of outlining most of the important aspects of this campaign and of pointing the interested reader in the direction of further, fuller accounts.

Page after page of hints, insinuations, and woeful angst over a climax that is paltry at best. If one of the main characters got a hangnail it would incite tremors of disaster and foreboding for at least 10 chapters. Portions of the story reminded me of Pat Conroy, but Morris doesn't follow through with a truly horrible event that rightfully shapes (or mis-shapes) the characters' lives. Morris moans on in an overly flowerly prose about nothing.

My dogs are not big chewers, so these work well, but any heavy chewers would distroy them quickly (although they are sturdy for a plush toy). The sound box is durable (some over a year old and still going), but does not last forever (one gave out after about 8 months of use).

Unfortunately those expectations were dashed. While this book was a decent read, it is not a book I'd recommend. The primary reason is its slow pace. The main plot was interesting -- the police procedural side of the story, the subplots -- dealing in romance, etc. were not. While there was a small bit of action and alot of investigative activity, there was no excitement or tension associated with it. The book just plodded along spouting out one boring detail after another about the characters' dreary lives. It got so bad that I began daydreaming towards the end of the book (on the last tape) and I missed how the villain arrived on the scene for one last try at eliminating anyone that could reveal his/her identity.

I'd daresay he's inspiring in that pose.The only question unresolved with this figure is if there is a variant or not. If you compare the packaging with the figure, Captain Britain's union-jack uniform is the updated one, and not the uniform he wore when Excalibur was formed - which is on the package.

That aside We Sold our Soul for Rock n Roll is a good first purchase for those curious about Black Sabbath. With the CD version there are 14 songs, if you look hard enough there are cassette versions with 16(Warner Bros)and 17(NEMS)tracks on them.The first two Black Sabbath albums are covered in great detail, and the remainder of the album captures highlights from the other 3 Sabbath albums out at the time. The main problem with the album is that the five albums covered by the complation are the Black sabbath albums that you'll want to own in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best single disc collection.","review":"This could be called \\"The Essential Black Sabbath\\", because it's pretty much the best of the best. Of course there are killer tracks missing, like \\"Into the Void\\", \\"Planet Caravan\\", and \\"Supernaut\\", but it is just one disc. However, the recent 2-disc collection \\"Symptom of the Universe 1970-1978\\" has twice as much, but obviously costs more. This does though include the classics \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Sweet Leaf\\", and \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", among others. Overall, it's a great intro to \\"Sabbath\\", and perfect for the casual fan. If you like \\"Ozzy's\\" solo work, this is even better. It's the beginning of metal as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad. some important songs are missing","review":"Like i said in the title, this compilation is great. But obviously it is missing many important tracks. If they want to have a greatest hits album they have to take tracks from the greatest studio albums. right? But there are only 2 songs from Sabbath bloody sabbath and sabotage. WHAT?! that is crazy talk. the other songs are absolutely crucial in greatest hits for black sabbath. This really should have been a double disc album. I would have included Megalomania, Hole in the sky, Symtom of the universe, Killing yourself to live, Sabbra Cadabra, Cornucopia, wicked world, and maybe into the void.

What it comes right down to is that Black Sabbath didn't release any songs that were less than excelent.

I was making headway though, but the pieces wouldnt fit together as they were (aparently) supposed to, not in any other way. The plastiv 'doorway snapped as I attempted to snap it in place. I was not being unduly rough, in fact was being quite gentle in consideration of the fragility of the materials.Had it fit together in the proper manner (which it never did) it would not have held the weight of more than a small kitten.Thankfully Amazon is reliable and I received a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea Gone Terribly Wrong","review":"I threw this product away 15 minutes after assembling it.

No waxwork figures here! The breadth and depth of the portrayal of life in those ancient times rivals the scope of classics like BEN-HUR and THE ROBE.At times the narrative suffers from \\"overwriting\\" (a common problem in Evangelical Christian fiction), but Perpetua's path to martyrdom challenges, enlightens, encourages, and awakens the Christian reader. You see a real person here, and by the end of the book, I found myself bringing my faith to God in prayer, wanting to be stronger in the cause of Christ. A truly worthy read!---Jeri Massi"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fav","review":"This is my favorite Dean Martin album. Admittedly, Dino is a bit obscure by today's standard, but I like his type of crooning, and refer the Great American Songbook to contemporary music. That said, this album ( I have it on vinyl -- a real album!) features a nice quartet with the intrepid Barney Kessel featured on guitar. Not so much overpowering brass, just a nice, intimate setting, some great musicians, and a very sophisticated voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward Feeder Problem","review":"Yes this machine shreds, and cross cuts too, at the same time, BUT ----- the feeder is awkward so that you will find yourself re-feeding the same stack of sheets several times.

It starts off with the author's early life (as one might expect), and moves on to her study of French language. Indeed it appears this became a bit of an obsession with her; to speak (perfect) French, AND be perfectly French. Indeed she suggests she almost became an alien in America. All this is fair enough, but along the way the author wanders off into discussions of the minutiae of French grammar, pronunciation (and just where exactly the intonations sit in the sound production process).Perhaps all very interesting - but in another context. Here, in a \\"memoir\\", it is seemingly irrelevant prattle. I did persist to the end, but ultimately I felt I knew very little about the author and what motivates her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leash broke dog fell 200 ft off gorge trail!!!!","review":"This should be a 0 rating but not an option.BEWARE DO NOT BUY THIS LEASH!!!DO NOT BUY THIS LEASH!!!!

Put simply, Danko Jones rocks. I got turned on to Danko Jones after hearing \\"We Sweat Blood\\". (If you don't own it, buy it. Now.) Predating \\"Blood\\", \\"Born a Lion\\" rocks just as hard (although it has a couple of the same songs). This band is extremely tight. The lyrics are smart and often hilarious. Fun Stuff.

They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad.

I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't. I just wish it was easier to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations Never Delivered","review":"The Week of Salvation never satisfied my expectations oflearning the Traditions of Holy Week. Only few were mentionedby the Author. Instead, he quoted several Bible Verses in thiswork. In a sense a mini New Testament. It is a waste of moneyto buy this book. There are books reprinted and really worth ofbuying.Some months ago, I made a review of this book, but one manquoted that I was anti-catholic. Obviously, he equated myviews with that of Anti Popish movements. This is a gross error.Telling the truth is not an offense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and accessible","review":"This is a very interesting, easy to understand summary of what Christianity means and how it compares to other religions of the world. It is on a par with C. S. Lewis's series of radio broadcasts that became his important book, Mere Christianity. Tom Wright is engaging, friendly, and even (as my wife says) cuddly in his explanation of the history and teachings of the church. If you want to understand more clearly what Christians believe and why, this series of talks is the best way to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely delightful.","review":"Probably the funnest read of my life. I read the Elric series as a young boy growing up in the seventies and enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed the Star Wars saga. Stormbringer was the best, followed by The Sailor on the Seas of Fate. This is escapism which unxepectedly raises very immediate and philosophical contemplation. After years of reading (culminating in a useless degree in literature), I still feel that this book has the best ending of any I have ever read. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Stormbringer is analagous to expecting a 300 gram fillet steak with all the trimmings and getting a 50 gram beef patty from your local takeout joint instead - all promise with no delivery. The author takes us on a long meandering journey through the life of Elric while attempting to weave a profound commentary on the human state. I found the book to be boring and repetitive - after the first few chapters you get a bit tired of being reminded that the sword \\"drinks souls\\" and is an evil twisted object of power with its own dark agenda. The book is superficial while maintaining a facade of depth through the use of obscure words found in the English language. My recommendation is not to bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Threadcutting in the Lathe","review":"While grounded in the practical methods for cutting single and multiple lead threads it also makes the theory and math involved in determining change gears need for non-standard threads understandable. As a plus it explains what is required in plain language to modify one's own lathe to use some of the bag of tricks high end tool room lathes use when cutting threads by the practical experience modifying his own Myford. Well worth the money for the person with a metal working shop at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is exactly what it says it is.","review":"It is the only book I have found dedicated to the important practice of screwcutting on a lathe. Most of the subject matter is very clear and well written for both the novice as well as a journeyman. I gave it a 4 of 5 only because I think there should have been more detail. But given that it is the only book dedicated to the subject; it has a whole lot more detail than anything else on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- You Could Learn More From Watching Free YouTube Videos","review":"This DVD is rather disappointing because the author (Rick Russell) spends more time standing behind a PODIUM than showing footage of actual offroad situations.

I was hoping this video will SHOW those concepts and mix it up with some exciting 4 wheeling examples.

Other books are more colorful and flashy, but Kevin Smiths' Bookbinding for Book Artists is the best book on the fundamentals of bookbinding on the market today. The book is clear, concise, challenging, and creative. A beginner can understand and implement every project described, and Mr. Smith shows you how to make and, as important, how to THINK about making books simply, artfully, and beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey! Bookbinding Without Tools!!!","review":"True to the synopsis of this book, it gives full instructions in how to perform bookbinding without any special tools. This book, in spite of avoiding custom tools, gives the best treatment I have seen on techniques for leather binding. It also goes into quite a bit of depth on sewing, knocking down the spine (for rounded spines, folks), repairing old books, hinging techniques, etc. In fact, this is one of my favorite books on bookbinding and I refer to it frequently. Definitely a must have on any serious bookbinder's library shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for basic conversation practice","review":"Most Chinese textbooks that I have seen focus on grammar and writing Chinese characters. This is fine if your focus is academic. However, for those who simply want to acquire useful phrases via short dialogues, Putonghua: A Practical Course in Spoken Chinese would probably be useful. Dialogues are presented in pinyin, with the hanzi (character) equivalent at the end of the book. There are also short lists of related vocabulary opposite each dialogue page.The weak point of the book is that there are almost no grammatical explanations. You have to induce grammar rules from the dialogues. Also, since the book is called Putonghua, the characters presented are the simplified hanzi, not the traditional forms used in Hong Kong and Taiwan.Anyway, for the price, it's not a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more beautiful that they look","review":"I love theses pens.

He is a fantastic singer/songwriter who continues to produce quality music, catchy tunes and an overabundance of amazingly original songs. Some of my favorites from \\"Transatlantic\\" include: \\"Hot Shaved Asian Teens\\", \\"Lost in Space\\", Hostage\\", (Glenn's vocal's in this song are so beautiful, I like to just close my eyes and listen), \\"Neptune\\", (which he admits is about Chris Difford), and the first track, \\"Unforgetable\\". I just saw Glenn in Ann Arbor, MI last night and he put on a really great show. What an amazing guitar player!! He really likes to interact with the crowd too. I look forward to more and more great music from the indestructable, unforgetable Glenn Tilbrook."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Glenn's Goodness...","review":"A brilliant follow-up to his first solo release (The Incomplete Glenn Tilbrook), this album showcases all that's great about Glenn. His impeccable guitarmanship, slightly off-center sense of humor, and his amazing, sweet-as-honey voice are all in abundant evidence here. This album is full of instant \\"earworms,\\" and I challenge anyone to listen to it and then NOT spend the day humming or singing snippets of one song or another. My current favorite is \\"Lost in Space,\\" although \\"Untouchable,\\" \\"Hostage,\\" \\"Neptune,\\" and \\"Genetalia of a Fool\\" (despite the title) are all closely tied for second place. The bottom line is this: I love Transatlantic Ping Pong, and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as its reputation","review":"\\"Rumours\\" is undeniably a good album, but not quite as great as its sales numbers would indicate. The best songs have flair and drama, but others are inconsequential.The best two songs on the album are a hit, \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" and an album track, \\"The Chain.\\" Both fuse good production with a strong sense of drama surrounding dying relationships. \\"Go Your Own Way\\" has a bone-crushing vocal hook and \\"The Chain\\" is one of the most brilliantly bitter-sounding songs around. \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" has some of this drama as well.Other good songs are the bittersweet \\"Songbird\\" and the overplayed \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Dreams.\\" The hit \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" isn't very strong.The rest of the tracks, from the slight \\"Never Going Back Again\\" to the overdone \\"I Don't Want to Know,\\" unfortunately lack anything to make them memorable. They are fine as filler, but every song is not as wonderful as some would make them out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Rock that still rocks about 20 years later","review":"This is classic as far as rock music.

I bought it because I heard 'Dreams' on the radio and loved Stivie Nicks voice and thought that was one of the best sogns I had ever heard, but when I got the album and listened to it I enjoyed it but is was to soft for my taste. The Song 'Oh Daddy' I think is just really really bad I cant stand to hear it! 'Songbird' gets on my nerves. I cant stand a few other songs either but I will tell you abotu the good things now. The first five songs are all great! Ten 'The Chain' 'You Make Lovin Fun' and Gold Dust Women' are all somewhat good songs. But I will tell you this album gets old after a while.

Compared with what I remember the vinyl sound, this shm cd has a slightly smaller high and bass/drum sound (especially the bass). and the speed of the drums playing is a little.. unclear...or slow to me at times. To me, the secret 'weapon' of Rumors is the marriage of the bass and drum...they are so tight, and so good together, so live together from the speakers.

I heard sounds and voices that disappear on the album. The sounds in \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" are chilling. And the harmonies, my God, the harmonies! If \\"Songbird\\" doesn't make you cry, you have no heart! In addition to the songs from the album, there is a \\"Making Of...\\" which is pure gold to any Fleetwood Mac Fan. I cannot gush enough.

Couples: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, and Christine and John McVie had broken up. Mick Fleetwood had split with his wife.

No, it's not. Just ANOTHER compact disc.","review":"I much prefer my original vinyl over this crap. I am SO tired and fed-up with seeing \\"Deluxe Editions\\" being released and only two that I know of include an SACD (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery is phenomenal!!). Why just release yet another CD? It's not like there's a lack of them!!I just don't get it.Music companies have NO idea how to run a business and give people what they want. And they do not monitor or audition recordings before they are released. That is painfully obvious.Just because a person has a \\"name\\" in the business.... does NOT indicate quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Key part of any collection","review":"Apparently recorded when the band weren't getting along, 'Rumours' is such a masterpiece that you wouldn't have guessed. Such is the display of brilliant songwriting, it's no surprise that 'Rumours'is a famous album.My favourites are more the album tracks than the singles including 'Old Dustwoman', 'Chains', 'Oh Daddy' and the beautiful 'Never Going back Again'.I originally purchased this album on cassette when I was. The cassette eventually fell apart from extensive use, and was replaced by a second hand vinyl. I now own a much treasured CD of Rumours. The vinyl was passed to my older sister who rates it as one of her top ten albums of all time.Most people will be familiar with 'Rumours' as many tracks were lifted as singles including 'Dreams', 'You Make Loving Fun', 'Go Your Own Way' and the incredible 'Don't Stop'.Add it to your collection today, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 100 best rock albums ever","review":"A rock music classic. Extremely well done. An essential piece of a great music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I was surprised to find that of my DVD-A purchases, this album was among those that benefited most from the new format. The multiple channels were used to great effect and added strong new dimensionality to the music. Not among my favorite albums, but among my favorite DVD-A's. A great listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Recording Rematered by Mick Fleetwood","review":"One of their best albums remastered by Mick Fleetwood...I heard things on this that I had never heard before and it sounded sweeter on my Home Theater/Multi Channel (5.1 Klipsch Heritage) \\"stereo.\\"...No Movie or Video on this one just nice music perfectly recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Peter Green when you need him?","review":"Fleetwood Mac were so good in the late '60s, why did Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have to ruin it?? Dreams? Say You Love Me?? This is [terrible!] I can't believe Mick Fleetwood and John McVie stuck around for this embarrassment. At least Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan had the sense to leave the band before things got this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so...","review":"Hmmm...Let's see...22 years later and the band of such talented musicians had no alternative but to get together and rehash former success to feed themselves. This album is so unimportant I'm not sure why I even feel the need to write this. Not even from the comparison standpoint, because The Beatles are nothing like Fleetwood Mac (thank god). I just can't think of anything this album influenced. Now you know...;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega WTF!","review":"I listened to this album, and my eardrums popped. Stevie Nicks' vocals are so high, he sounds like a girl. Seriously, sing like a man, like Chad Kroeger from Nickelback.Oh, and another thing wrong with this album is that there is no 'U' in 'Rumors.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly a Classic","review":"The Rumours album is clearly a classic and a must-have for any pop-rock collection. However, the recording itself - in digital form (i.e., on CD) - is substandard. Hopefully, the powers that be will get their act together and realize how much money could be made if the album were remastered and rereleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the classic it started out as!","review":"What can I say?

It's still as fresh as ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT SONG BANK!!!","review":"\\"Rumours\\" should become a must-own CD for all who listen to great music.

Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Rumours, you MUST own this audio DVD","review":"On every track you'll hear many new sounds and instruments that were buried in the two channel mix. The difference is as huge as going from a mono mix to stereo. Absolutely fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SELLER!!","review":"This album deserves to be a classic. With the song \\"The Chain\\" Fleetwood Mac' whole life ahead. And been sworn never to break it. Some of the songs on this album aren't as much appreciated. \\"I Don't Want To Know\\" was one of them. Nicks' song was wonderful whiched got was supposed to be \\"Silver Springs\\" but that song was released as the B-side of \\"Go Your Own Way\\" in 1976. \\"I Don't Want To Know\\" didn't get much credit but I think it should have. This album holds a special spot in most music lovers' homes. I have it on Cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album ever?","review":"i certainly think so. takes some breaking in--because the sound is truly different than anything most people are used to. it sort of goes beyond a purely musical concept of pop music--more than anything else, i think this is an album people can truly bond over, that friends can celebrate together. exquisite, graceful, and timeless, it will always be my personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the \\"remastered\\" CD?","review":"This is a great CD. I've owned it on cassette, 8-track, vinyl and CD since I was about 8yo, in 1978. What I was wondering was...why isn't there a remastered version of this CD with \\"Silver Springs\\" on it. On the classic albums DVD, it was stated that the took the song off because of time constraints with vinyl records. Well, here it is in the CD age and we have yet to see this song surface other than on the so-so live CD \\"The Dance\\" So if you are reading this and you work warner bros. records, please get your head out of your you-know-where and re-release this cd with \\"Silver Springs\\" on it. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect DVD-Audio, but too bass heavy","review":"I cannot believe I wrote that title, but it really is true. The bass is WAY too loud (turn DOWN the gain on your LFE speaker if you can). Otherwise this DVD-Audio is darned near the best incarnation of this recording ever. The ballads are the most incredible. You will fall in love with Fleetwood Mac all over again and remember why you ruined the groove on your LP copy of this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD AUDIO VERSION REINVENTS THIS CLASSIC POP","review":"This is on of the best DVD audio/5.1 audio CD's I have listened to. The well produced, squeaky clean quality of the original recording is signficantly enhanced on this five channel DVD. The rear channels are significantly and consistently deployed throughout, as this five channel version makes these classic pop tunes comes alive with new vitality and energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Stop Trying To Compare Fleetwood Mac, to the Fabs","review":"I like Rumours, always have. It's not in the league of Pepper, The White Album, or Abbey Road.People need to forget instrumental virtuosity when it comes to writing and recording rock and pop songs. The Beatles strengths, as well as Fleetwood Mac's, were in arrangements, vocals, and writing melodies. The finest songwriters aren't necessarily the best instrumentalists. Fleetwood Mac is an example. No standout musicians, just great songs. Same with the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIE-HARD FLEETWOOD MAC FAN!!!!!!!","review":"Rumours is the BEST album ever recorded. I have 4 children ranging from 5-10 in age that love their music.

Rock on, Fleetwood Mac!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost PERFECT album","review":"I am only 14 years old, and some people think I'm a little strange, but I can't get enough Mac. The enchanting voice of The Great Miss Nicks just hypnotizes me. Shure, these new bands are great(Sugar Ray,Everclear,3EB),but they will NEVER compare to Fleetwood Mac. The lyrics are absolutely legendary, take GOLD DUST WOMAN for instance, these lyrics blow my mind, I know I can't do much better. This album along with all of the other Fleetwood Mac albums are MUST buys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but........TOO MUCH AIRPLAY!!!!!","review":"This is a fantastic album, and it shows in quality. Problem with that, tooooooooooo much radio play made this gem a COMMERCIAL sucess, I would rather hear Dreams every now and then instead of every day, if you know what I mean. Highlights for me on this album, You Make Loving Fun, love the keyboard, guitar, bass, hell the whole band on this number, best song on this album. Always thought Nicks was overrated, always liked McVie better, but what do I know. Anyways well worth getting, just too bad it gets played too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, yet way too overrated, album","review":"Should Mac's fans limit themselves to declare this is a good collection of finely crafted pop songs, I'd be more than happy to agree with them.But when people rate this as a larger than life American classic... whoa, hold on a second.It sold a couple gazillion copies because it was tailor-made for radio airplay. But after listening to it a few times (you don't even need to buy the record, just tune to your town oldies station and one of its songs would pop up anytime) it becomes a tad repetitive, tiresome. There are not that many ideas in the album.Very well played and sung though, but undeserving of the oversized hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD but not so great DVD Audio","review":"I have nothing against the music of Rumours -- it's certainly a classic Fleetwood Mac composition. However, this DVD Audio does not give a significant audio improvement over the CD version. Since DVD Audios cost more than CDs, I would go with the CD instead. Although I don't know all the details that go into making a DVD Audio, I would think the quality issue would be influenced similarly to AAD vs. ADD vs. DDD on CDs. Old albums that were recorded analog that later get converted to digital for CDs never sound as good as those that were recorded digitally. I suspect this is why Rumours did not really show any superiority over the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumours","review":"I bought this CD 3 days ago at The Wal-Mart.

Rumours have been known to destroy others many times in the past and this case is no exception! This album,(and the induction of Stevie-(Baaaa)- Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham into Fleetwood Mac), killed this Great Band starting with the pop tripe of 'Rumours'. \\"Heroes Are Hard to Find\\" was the last \\"REAL\\" Fleetwood Mac album, which also proved the title point. Nicks and Buckingham were no heroes! A ham sandwich any day of the week.Those who still relish the rock blues sound that WAS Fleetwood Mac until 1974 know what I mean. The Albums- Fleetwood Mac, Mr. Wonderful,Then Play On,(particularly),Kiln House, Future Games,(WOW!),Bare Trees,Penguin,Mystery To Me,(double WOW) and Heroes Are Hard to Find complete the must haves of the band I LOVE!

From Lindsey Buckingham's energetic \\"Go Your Own Way\\", to Stevie Nick's haunting \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" to Christine McVie's beautiful ballad \\"Songbird\\", you're sure to find a song that suits you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Includes bonus cd","review":"Fleetwood Mac is a powerhouse of talent, musical gifts, and not least of all, emotional turmoil. \\"Rumours\\" showcases why Fleetwood Mac is so spectacular and why they have it all -- the powerhouse rhythm section of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, the quirkiness of Lindsey Buckingham, the elegant musical stylings and graceful keyboard/piano playing of Christine McVie, the etherealness of Stevie Nicks. The 1976 Rumours collection was their lives laid bare for the world to see.The cd is available in an enhanced version and an expanded extra tracks versions. Both aren better than the original but only the expanded version has a bonus cd with alternate takes and demos. If you are huge Fleetwood Mac fan, the expanded version is worth it. Otherwise the enhanced version should suffice (and its cheaper)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of the best albums of all time","review":"What is there to say?

The first time I used Item 4850, it was soft, supple and had plenty of stretch. The second time around, Item 4850 is stiff and has very little give.

My friends hyped up on testosterone and various other things would sing all these songs at the top of their lungs building up their macho confidence for when the girls showed up. I once even had a girlfriend whos \\"CB Handle\\" was \\"Rock Candy\\" My mom was so glad when I didn't marry her!All these songs are great, (remember the stero effects? start with guitar on one speaker, then go to bass on the other speaker) I gave this to my oldest son when he \\"Was Seventeen\\", a few years later he was able to have something to talk to Sammy Hagar about when he met him. Hagar then had my son help him with the sound check before the show.

It is organized by in the traditional cookbook fashion of appetizers to desserts. Some of the recipes are very simple and some are compound recipes (recipes that rely on the recipe of another dish).

This would be a good book for people interested in learning about asian cuisine, or those looking for more recipes to try out.

Yes you can use your pastry brush to coat your pan with butter but with just the head you have more control :) I don't know I just loved it for that purpose and yes you can use this for everything, sealing your dough or brushing your bake goods. This is well made high quality brush head and best of all made in U.S.A I tried to kind of run my hand to see wether if the bristle will come off like my old brushes but no bristle came off. I'm pretty happy about that. My only complain with this brush is I wish that the bristle is a little bit softer.

No two voices can come together like Ashford & Simpson and sound like heaven, except maybe Roberta Flack & Donnie Hathaway. The memories this album (CD) evokes in me are so wonderful....I can't help but sing along. Of course, my favorite track is Bourgie Bourgie - both versions (the original and extended). If you don't get up and move to this piece, you are dead! It's love, passion, joy, titillation, melancholy - all at the same time.

Right now it's a basic coax cable, but no matter what channel, when it messes up, the whole TV is going haywire. After turning it off and then back on it fixes the problem, but only for a minute or so. After multiple experiments, it stays on for about 30 min after sitting turned off for an extended period of time, then after turning it off and on, it will only work for about one minute after....I did that about seven times and every time the sound messed up.

The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY: Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress. The \\"Piano Black\\" case on this tv is a nightmare! It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.

Nearly six years later,he put out his first compilation,this album. Here are his best from the Warner Brothers era. This album would be his last on the label. The title track from his debut album is cool. HOW SWEET IT IS TO BE LOVED BY YOU is awesome. That song,originally recorded by The Miracles,was later covered by Michael McDonald for his MOTOWN album. YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND is a cover of the Carole King recording which she wrote(on her 1971 smash debut TAPESTRY which JT participated on). FIRE AND RAIN,another 1970 hit,is cool. I love MEXICO. That song would be covered by Jimmy Buffett. DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT was later covered by Eric Clapton with The Impressions. All the other songs are cool. This album could have used MOCKINGBIRD which he recorded with his now-ex-wife Carly Simon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better composer than singer","review":"These compositions are excellent, even if you may have a problem with Taylor's nasal whine of a voice. He was one of the most successful folkies or singer/songwriters of the early 1970s - not only did he have huge hits with Carolina In My Mind, Something In The Way She Moves, Fire And Rain and Sweet Baby James, but Carole King took his song You've Got A Friend to number one. Poetic lyrics and sensitive, though sometimes complex, melodies made for a distinctive style and Taylor could also rock out as demonstrated by Steamroller. My favourite song is Fire And Rain with its enigmatic and evocative lyrics - it's been covered by hundreds of other artists, some sounding better than the original. I rate Taylor's composing skills higher than his singing, but this is a great and enjoyable collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"best music place","review":"I love amazon.com, i get whatever i want on here, i just recently purchased james taylor music.

The hauntingly beautiful song \\"Woodstock\\" (not on this album) was playing in the background. Immediately, I went out to buy some of J.T.'s music and picked up his Greatest Hits CD.Every song is so beautifully performed, both in lyrics and melody. Simple yet highly evocative -- you feel like you're walking in the Berkshires on a perfect summer day when listening to \\"Sweet Baby James\\".

Real bad. I don't even think it deserves 1 star. No real animation, like the description says, it's called comics animation. It's where the images you would see in a comic book is moving some but there is no motion within the subjects of the film. But what makes this title even worse is the acting.

The website indicates that the product includes sound effects and actors' voices, which means, even if it is a video comic and not a feature-film animation, it will still, nonetheless have the feel of an animated feature film.

It has a small cast so no one stumbles over one another and you really get to know the characters.Enough people have commented on what the film is about so i'll just skip that. The reason why I didn't give it a whole five stars was because the cinematography was too nice for this kind of film and distracted me from the story somewhat. I noticed a lot of people commented on the cinematography. It is really nice. They capture some breathtaking scenes. In the end though if that is what stood out most out of the story then the filmmaker hasn't accomplished what he set out to do and that is to tell a story and get the audience to listen.I still recommend this film.

It's a \\"Hey stupid, don't open that door\\" situation.I found this mildly creative spin on the Frankerstein/Zombie genre a bit too contrived.Also, the two main actors seemed ill- conceived for their roles.

Adam Schmidt (Christian Oliver) becomes a guinea pig in this experiment as he is repeatedly killed and revived in a remote snowy cabin. It was cute and clever the first few times, but the interest of this new technology and Adam's \\"Gary Mitchell\\" contacts becomes boring as you wait for some new revelation that never occurs.The film has a slight twist, although by that point I had lost interest. The acting was decent in what was basically a two man play. The movie is more interesting than entertaining.Parental Guide: 1 quick F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you can't die...","review":"An update on Dr. Frankenstein's monster with a living twist at the end:the subjects are 'voluntary'.

My wife and I sign off most nights watching As Time Goes By. Having great admiration for Judi Dench, although not familiar with her husband, this seemed like a sure winner. We tried our best to get into this show, but failed. I fear the title song heard too many times in a row would drive one mad. Spend your money elsewhere, this one is in the back of our closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Time Goes By, but nice to watch","review":"A previous reviewer had noted that it was too hard to believe that Judi Dench's character would fall for Michael Williams' character. This might be helped along by the fact that the two were very happily married in real life for many years until he passed away last year.I really enjoy this series, but feel that many people came upon it looking for something more after loving the As Time Goes By series. The dialog and plot lines don't compare, but it does share the sweetness and simplicity. It is a bit slow-moving, even for its genre. Still, it will provide a supplement for those deprived of Judi Dench's wonderful acting now that As Time Goes By has completed its final season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good crash course book on Sunday school teaching","review":"I bought this book for the Sunday school volunteers at our church because it's easy to read and practical. I don't necessarily agree with all the points of the book but it's a good basic book. The author does seem to come from a more fundamental background (see the chapter on \\"How to Lead a Student to Christ\\") and therefore may not work with all churches or you may have to talk theology with your Sunday school teachers but it's a strong book in other areas as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Motivating","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone preparing to become a Sunday School Teacher or to those who want to enhance and sharpen thier skills and methods of teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for new Sunday School teachers","review":"This book helped clarify why I wanted to be a Sunday School teacher.It help me with focus on weekly objectives.It maintains that we are making disciples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a good book and it's short. Its concepts are very elementary. Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to be reminded about some of the key areas of importance from time to time. I do wish the author had emphasized that teaching Biblical truth always trumps trying to be an entertaining teacher. However, he did hint all around it. Unfortunately, our culture seems to emphasize that it is a requirement that teachings and teachers must always entertain first (often to the sacrifice of getting the truth out). Nevertheless, I do recommend the book. It does have some good and practical ideas that can and should be used to teach truth while working to maintain student's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide for Sunday School Teachers","review":"I am so glad I found this book. It is an easy and is very encouraging with a lot of practical things every Sunday school teacher should know. I highly recommend this book and look forward to other books by Elmer Towns. I am using it too teach my Sunday school teachers and myself. I plan on ordering copies for every teacher. We even adopted the theme that Mr. Towns proclaims, \\"That they may learn.\\" I really cannot say enough good things about this book, the practical wisdom Towns provides is worth its weight in gold and makes you wonder why aren't all Sunday schools like that? If you are religious education professional you need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"....and that 4th Star is for \\"Entering Your Heart\\" alone!!!","review":"Overall, if you're a Roxette fan, this is a good CD. It doesn't go anywhere they haven't been before - it is, actually, a step backwards from \\"Have a Nice Day\\" in terms of musical experimentation. \\"Real Sugar\\" and \\"The Centre of the Heart...\\" are standouts among the 12 tracks contained on the standard release...BUT [bonus track] \\"Entering the Heart\\" steals the show!!! I can't believe this was left off of the North American release - it raises goosebumps the way that \\"Fading Like a Flower\\" did the first time I heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basic, but not really...","review":"I'm a big fan, so I bought this album as soon as it came out and was far from disappointed. Roxette went back to the kind of music they made in the late 80s and early 90s and added (quite) a bit of today's sounds. A mix of uptempo pop songs and beautiful ballads. Personal favorites: \\"Fool\\" and \\"My world, my love, my life\\". If you like Roxette and their kind of music, you'll love this album. Recommended for every RoxFan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pop album in many years...","review":"What would happen if the best pop duo in the world made a comeback, and no one was there to hear them do it? Apparently the United States is going to miss out on Room Service for the forseeable future. What a pity, since it is perhaps the finest pop album released in almost a decade -- in fact, since Roxette's last major U.S. commercial success, Joyride.For those who are familiar with Roxette's previous work, I can say that Room Service is their most consistent and balanced album since Joyride. Crash!Boom!Bang! was too long and too extreme, with the ballads too soft and the rockers too raw; HAND had WAY too many ballads, despite their being generally very good. Room Service is like those last two albums, plus Joyride and Tourism, wrapped up into one great CD.I especially recommend \\"Real Sugar,\\" \\"TCOMH,\\" and \\"My World, My Love, My Life,\\" but don't be a fool. It's all good, so come on and rejoin the Joyride!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With \\"Room Service\\" Roxette delivers another great album","review":"What can I say other than 'WOW'? \\"Room Service\\" delivers the best album from Roxette since \\"Joyride.\\" Not that the others weren't good, but Roxette's driving beats and softer songs have been masterfully used on this album to give us some of their best work to date. I rate this album a 4 of 5 b/c one or two tracks weren't that great, but the rest of it is SO worth the buy. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of business","review":"This company has gone out of business, so the tags are of no value.

Further investigation revealed that the company had folded with no notice to customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pleasure","review":"I have never tired of this CD, although I've listened to it perhaps 30-40 times. This is in the style of a live worship service during the week of Advent; which is a month or so before Christmas. Superb and not often heard Carols & Hymns, interspersed with readings from Scripture. One or two Carols are familiar such as \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\", however, so many of these Carols & Hymns are less well-known, that I found this CD the kind of recording I could listen to year-round. Some of the readers are excellent, and easy to understand (even those with various English accents!) HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not as good","review":"It is tough when your 5 year old observes that \\"they don't make games like they used to.\\" Atari has slowed Pajama Sam down to the point of tedium. The gameplay is very slow and no longer features the ability to skip scenes already played through by use of the ESC key. This leads to a lot of staring at the screen waiting for something to happen or rote repetition that is no fun for anyone. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"My 4-year-old son and I both love the \\"old\\" PJ Sam games. So needless to say I was very excited to see the new software in store. I picked one up and gave to my son for Christmas and much to my dismay, it just wasn't the same. Moving from scene to scene is so slow. It seems like the new game is less sophisticated than the older ones. Very disappointing for me and my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atari and Sam have both suffered greatly","review":"The system requirements for this game specify a 1.3 GHz processor, and indeed it runs miserably slow on a 1 GHz machine. This is absolutely absurd for a such a simple, cute little two-dimensional game. Along with poor voice acting, lame jokes and trivial easter eggs (compared to previous Pajama Sam adventures), it appears that Atari no longer stands for quality gaming and poor Sam has had to suffer for Humongous Entertainment's acquisition. It's especially sad to see this decline, given how much fun the previous Sam programs were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed and buggy.","review":"My 4 year old son has the previous Pajama Sam games and enjoys them a lot. They run directly from CD-ROM, are very smooth and have excellent gameplay. This game needs to be loaded onto the hard drive (takes 500MBytes). The voice is out of sync for the entire game. There are numerous times when the game will pause unexpectedly for several seconds while the game loads from disk. When Sam moves from one screen to the next, he will freeze in mid air, only to appear several seconds later in a different screen. As a result, there is absolutely no continuity in the game. Frankly, I am shocked that this game was published at all given its incredibly unpolished state. It is a very poor effort; especially since Humungous used to be capable of executing games close to perfection. I won't be buying more Pajama Sam products from Atari. I suggest you save your money and prevent your childs disappointment by not buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This One!","review":"I bought this game for my 5 year old twin granddaughters, who have loved all the Freddi Fish adventures, and who enjoy playing Pajama Sam Games to Play on Any Day. They hate the Life is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff adventure. It is very slow moving from screen to screen. It freezes the computer repeatedly. It is a major disappointment. I expected far better from the folks who have provided untold hours of fun with Freddi Fish. I know they are capable of better quality than this game provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically poor","review":"I, too, wish I had read the Amazon reviews before I purchased this for my son. The game is so-o-o-o slow, when Sam moves from scene to scene. The dialog is out of sync with the pictures. And the biggest drawback is that there is really only one game. The Shoe, Shirt and Socks are always in the same place and need the same things in order for Sam to retrieve them. The other games had variations to challenge our 4 year olds. I wish that I had never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atari messed up Pajama Sam!","review":"I am so disappointed! My children and I love all the Humongous Entertainment titles. They are so clever and well-executed and I was so happy to see another Pajama Sam out. What a mess it is, though. The voice is completely off-sync with the character's movements and the screen freezes every time you want to move from one scene to the next. My 5 year old actually got up from the computer the first time she was playing it and said it was no fun. (and she's a hardcore fan of Putt Putt, Freddie Fish and Pajama Sam!) If they don't put out a patch, and soon, I will never buy from Atari again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing game redux","review":"I fell in love with Pajama Sam #1, so I thought this would be a slam-dunk with my three kids. Boy, was I wrong! In three plays, all of the items were in the same location each time, with the exception of one minor move, so there is no replay value. It is a huge file that wouldn't fit on my kids' computer, and there is no autorun feature so I had to load it on mine. It moves very slowly and the transitions between scenes are amateurish.I will take a chance on #'s 2 and 3 based on other reviews, but this game needs work. Don't be the first on you block to buy it!*************Now that I've tried games 2 and 3, I have to downgrade this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atari ruined Pajama Sam","review":"My daughter and I have loved the Pajama Sam games. We've waited months for this new one and what a letdown. As soon as Sam opened his mouth my daughter knew it wasn't the same voice. It feels amateurish considering the awful transistions between screens, the jerky animation (on a fast computer!) and the hopelessly out-of-sync dialogue. Having waited for the new Putt Putt as well, I can only surmise that it will be as bad as this one. Stick to the first three Pajama Sam games and hope that this will be the end of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you haven't played them, PJ Sam 1-3 are better","review":"The other pajama sam games are lots of fun for kids, but you might as well skip this one...The lip-sync is so bad...It doesn't even look close. You might think you could ignore that but there's more...The transitions from area to area are slow (about 5 seconds, sometimes more) as well, for us it always crashes at a certain point near the end.The sound is kind of slow, and P.J.'s voice doesn't really sound genuine, unlike the previous games (for instance, he pronounces \\"book\\" with a diminutive k, which makes him sound very un-kidlike).Plus, I think the puzzles and overall feel from the previous games is far superior as well. Trust me, the old ones, if you can get your hands on them, are a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDS A PATCH!!!!","review":"We love pajama sam, however this game (the first I have bought since it was bought by Atari) has a huge glitch which locks up each time you go to a certain screen, and you cannot complete the game without that page.

Usually, it's a few years wait. I have to say that I am utterly disappointed in the latest release of Pajama Sam. Humongous has such a great following with their line of children's software. How did this product ever get passed the testing group? Perhaps a big company like Atari doesn't have one??? Hard to believe. (...) I hate to see this series end.

I bought this game for my 6 year old nephew to play when he visited. He was so excited when we loaded it onto the computer. He was excited when the screen came on. Then he started playing the game. There were constant interruptions in gameplay no smoothness of movement between scenes as we have come to expect from the other Pajama Sam games. We adjusted the computer running speed to see if that would help, it did a little bit. However, when he completed it the first time, he decided to try it again. The only change in location of anything was the jar for the fireflies and the trading cards within the scene. No other changes were apparent. He gave up after two times and has not touched the game since. After purchasing this game, my nephew says that he \\"likes the first ones better\\". We will be sticking with the first three games, thank you very much. Very disappointed in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible follow up","review":"I ordered this for my five year old against the advice of other reviewers. We have all of the other Fredddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Putt Putt and Spy Fox games and my son loves them all. I felt that I should keep his collection up to date, so ordered the new PJ Sam. It's awful. Sam's mouth doesn't match the words, it takes far to long to get from location to location, and it took forever to load into the computer! My nephew, who is eight, attempted to play this with my son because he loves to play my son's games. Both got tired of it very quickly. Instead, we all played a game I had found in a store for $4.00 (Hokus Pokus Pink - a Pink Panther game) It was similar to the Humongous games and a lot of fun. I hope Atari makes some improvements and continues producing these games the way they were made before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the OLD Pajama Sam games- NOT this one!!","review":"My 5 year-old son absolutely loves the Pajama Sam series of games by \\"Humongous Entertainment.\\" He received this most recent (and much more expensive) Pajama Sam-- \\"Life is Rough\\" for Christmas. It is extremely poorly made compared to the previous versions of PJ Sam. This is also the first Pajama Sam I have seen made by Atari. The screens do not move smoothly, Pajama Sam's voice is not in synch with the movements on the screen, and the general flow of the game is cheaply done. The makers of the first few Pajama Sams did some wonderful work- smooth scenes, cute characters etc..., and it is very clear that this latest version by Atari was made in a rush and the final product is clearly lacking as a result. If you are considering buying a great kid's computer program, skip this one... Try the \\"Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightening Aren't So Frightening\\" or find the Pajama Sam that came free in kid's snack pack boxes about six months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this game. Not as good","review":"As other reviews mentioned, the game is choppy, the sound quality is terrible and it takes forever for the character to move from place to place. In addition, neither my child or I could find half the objects! For instance, we found the jar to put the fireflies in but it said that there needed to be holes in the top first. But, there is nothing that is sharp that you can find to make the holes! And, you can't get into the cave without the jar of fireflies. Very few places to visit in this game and hardly anything to do in most of the places. No hints about where to look for things or what parts are even needed! Disappointed as the other Pajama Sam games were so easy. This is a child's game?

The selection of repetoire is an interesting blend of familiar test pieces and the unfamiliar, especially of Rossini's opera buffe. This makes for enough variety of mood and tempo to engage interest in the procedings, even if the singning wasn't so good. And good it is. Mei is the possessor of a pure voice, even in its registers and cleanly used. No aspirates, a fine trill, an excellent if not perfect legato, and an innate sense of style. She is a sincere interpreter if a rather superficial one and my only complaint is that a bit more spice could have been brought to some of the livelier numbers. But this clean, unaffected yet touching singing is the perfect antidote to Renee Flemings recent mannered efforts. Brava!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Brava to Ms. Mei!

If however, you would like to know something about the Gospel of John, I recommend you try another commentary. Carson is almost maniacal about defending Baptist belief and therefore rejects the sacramental teaching of the fourth Gospel. He writes in a chatty style, using the lingo of a pseudo intellectual guru.

Written clearly in the good traditions of the Annales school, it is more of a sociological study into the society of the Middle ages. So, if you want the usual narrative about what happened when, then perhaps this is not the book for you. However, as an insight into the culture, social organization and general life throughout the Middle Ages, this is by far the best book one could find. I thought it was very well complemented by \\"Mediaeval Callings\\", a book edited by Jacques Le Goff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible synthesis of history...","review":"I'm not an expert. In fact, this book acts as the foundation for my understanding of Medieval civilization. Nothing I have found anywhere else in history or in current observations of the human condition has substantially refuted the findings of this book. It does bounce around a little and does require Google for a lot of the places and names that you are assumed to already know. That makes it a slow book to read for the layman but it is what I wish every history book was. Far better than just trudging through the stories of the leaders and elites in chronological order, it delves a lot deeper and the analysis, at least to me, is always honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Survey Text","review":"I happened to see this text in the publishers store new in hard cover.

Ecological enthusiasts and apathetic individuals alike will enjoy this read. The characters are nuanced; their moral ambiguities ring true to real life. The delicious heroine, Terry, is a Holly Golightly for the nineties.

The author chose a great deal of topics to write about, but because he never went into any of them in great detail, you kind of got the feeling you were reading a Made For TV movie.

I don't know where they found all these alternate master tapes, but the CD insert mentions using 4-track masters. Certainly the sound quality confirms this, as these tracks sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. Many of the tracks include studio chatter before and during recording. Tracks 19 & 20 are duets with Ann Margret. This is the first time EVER that a stereo version of Jailhouse Rock has ever been officially issued in stereo, even if it is an alternate take. The original version of Jailhouse Rock has been floating around in stereo on the internet as an MP3, but has never been issued by RCA.Anyway, this is an excellect addition to an already existsting collecton of Elvis.

I don't agree that Inge Nielsen does \\"just fine\\" - rather more like \\"just OK.\\" I'm not Nilsson's biggest fan, but she really carries the vocal demands better than Nielsen.

In my opinion, it's trying to be two different books: a memoir of therapy and an informal history of the relationship between dogs and people. The jumps between the two genres are awkward and disorienting, and often have the unintended effect of trivializing the very serious issues Wells is discussing. In the midst of a moving description of a session with the therapist, she will suddenly shift to discuss some particular breed of dog. It's almost as if the dog stuff is there to distract her (or us) when the material gets too heavy.I also would seriously question the ethics of the therapist in this story, but given the way the story ends, that's a cheap shot on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lessons in Self-Absorption","review":"The author of this impossibly self-absorbed little book spent a day in the library -- compiling a list of historical and biological facts about dogs -- and uses these to pepper a story about her own life and woes. \\"Pepper\\" is exactly the right word too, because a little bit is seasoning; a lot becomes an irritant.Even without the distracting arcana & ephemera about dogs this book is annoyingly whiney, with the author essentially asking \\"Why me?\\" everytime somebody dies in her life. It's hard to lose loved ones, 2-legged or 4-, but the author's own little disfunctional family is hardly unique in that regard.And as to \\"Unconditional Love\\" I don't think the author has a clue -- she lets her dogs run undisciplined, and her relatives live unmoderated, and then moans when bad things happen.

I still don't get why this was labled as a \\" Special Edition\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the Mark","review":"Very dissappointing and bordering on revisionist history. The author makes a point of letting us know that the Jewish girl really doesn't practice religion. These events were driven by racism and religious oppression. By focusing on the character's lack of religion, it looks more like a modern day political perception rather than an historical account. I'm sorry to say we did not share this book with our daughter, but threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another great book from the Dear America serries","review":"This book is now among my favorites in the serries(although almost all of them are among my favorites, I love the serries). I think that Julie is a realistic girl, although she sounds a lot like Ann Frank, and she has a nice life in Vienna then everything is ruined but the second half is nicely done and not depressing...although the chances of it happening I think are slim."},{"rating":"2","title":"one eye laughing the other weeping","review":"This is the story of Julie Weiss who is in Vienna, Austria when Hitler takes over.

Interviews,photos and personal quotes of servicemen and civilians who secretly retrieved Koga's Zero from the bogs of the Aleutians and of those who tested the aircraft in San Diego, after restoration, was a fantastic story. Their collective work saved many lives and helped the U.S. win the air war in the Pacific. We developed tactics and aircraft to overcome the Zero's superior aerodynamics.An outstanding history which should be in every WWII history buffs collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pivotal to winning the Pacific war","review":"The incident of the downing of Koga's Zero was the topic of an email sent to me. I got online and found the book.Koga was a Japanese petty officer pilot whose plane was hit by anti-aircraft in the attack on the Aleutians -- part of the Battle of Midway. He was killed when he crash-landed his plane in what he thought was a field but in fact was a bog on Akutan Island. His wingman was ordered to destroy the plane but fearing Koga was unconscious he disobeyed and returned to his carrier.US intelligence analysts recovered the plane, learned its strengths and weaknesses, and saved many American pilot lives by teaching them how to defend against a Zero on their tail.Good book. Quick read.

The Malian Bambara language lyrics touch upon themes vital to Africa today, including the value of facing challenges head-on at home. In Koite's own words, \\"People here in Africa are willing to risk death trying to leave for Europe or the USA, but they are not willing to take the risk staying to develop something here in Africa.\\" The powerful, positive messages are carried through acoustic sound, including some traditional instruments as polyphonic hunter's horns, the balafon (wooden xylophone), n'goni (Malian lute), and Habib's well-known voice and guitar. A welcome contribution to international music collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid ground and bluesy sound","review":"More Blues You Can Use picks up where Blues You Can Use left off. The two books are a great combo for self-teaching blues electric guitar. In this second book, Ganape puts more focus on rhythm guitar than in the first book, with each lesson including a rhythm lesson that is very useful. The scale portion of each lesson is also much more instructive--he gets beyond the (necessary and useful) pentatonic pattern inculcation of the first book, and into lead patterns and runs that can help in building new, improvised solos and licks. The solos are now generally two DIFFERENT choruses, which adds to repertoire and illustrates more of the principles of improv and lick playing. And more important, the solos are (as they were in the first book too) tasteful and progressively more challenging.You can actually learn a lot from this book in practical terms and principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Blues than you can use.","review":"Every picture tells a story, don't it?

The authors definately did their research, as most information is accurate. A novice could even use this as a good starter guide to the world of firearms. Descriptions of many calibers are listed, and many guns are illustrated, most of which are hard to find. Since I really know nothing about RPGs, I can't rate it in that regard. As a book on guns goes, this one is good. Many exotic and hard-to-find firearms are included, descriptions are accurate, and illustrations are generally very good. My only complaint is the M-16 being drawn a little disproportionate, and one of the ten-round internal mag SKSs (type 56 carbine) is drawn with an external magazine. An unusual little book worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Musical Journey!","review":"Ford's debue novel is an exciting and insightful story that would appeal to music lovers & history buffs alike. Told through the experiences and observations of one displaced and self-doubting American during the end of the East/West German seperation, Ford weaves politics, sociology, and musicianship into an exciting and unpredictable tale of discovery. Professional musicians will find themselves wrapped in his description and emotional pull for all things musical. Historians will drool over the struggles and social complexities brought to light by Ford's characters as they try to mend and rediscover thier own identities following the end of Communist Germany. I have never read such an accurate tale of what it means to connect with a piece of music, to fear and love one's mentor, or struggle to make an identity for one's self. The Student Conductor is a must read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It wont work","review":"I am now writing this review because we bought this game at a book fair I hate to say almost 5 years ago or more.

So I think the software must be defective. We have backpack and lost city also - they play well and my son (2.5) likes them both, but i found that with lost city all the games were about numbers - ignoring other concepts like colors, letters and shapes. Try this software at your own risk, maybe they will fix the bugs. I found tech support to be a frustrating, time consuming experience with an automated system that was confusing and annoying. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun with Dora","review":"My 2 year old just loves Dora so this was a BIG hit. She absolutely loves playing the games.

It is the most scriptural view.The views are presented with thorough research behind them, and presented fairly. Those enjoying this book most will be those who espouse the futurist position, and would like some ammunition against other views.For a very simple and much less involved commentary on Revelation, may I suggest one written especially for TEENS and NEW BELIEVERS: \\"Dragons, Grasshoppers & Frogs!\\" (ISBN: 059536668). This is the most practical book I've ever seen on Revelation--a book that few relate to everyday life.All in all, this book will do more to convince you of what you already believe on the Second Coming rather than change your mind on any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four views only confuses the issue.","review":"'Four' different views on 'one' subject might be helpful to beginners, on the otherhand it might also be confusing for them.There can only be 'one' right answer concerning the interpretation of the Book of Revelation.

The historian view, historically held by many, was not included because \\"it hasn't been able to predict the Second Coming\\"--as if any person can! Although I do not support the Preterist view, this book had a convincing argument for that view. The essay on the classic dispensationalist view put me to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a Buy!","review":"Today on The Food Reviewer, we're reviewing Fruit Gushers.

It is a lame pastiche of other (mostly bad) fantasy novels, poorly written, with cardboard characters and pedestrian prose. The story is horribly paced and never comes together at all.The author wastes ridiculous amounts of time on horribly written and unbelievable romantic entanglements, and his \\"world\\" is as crudely fleshed out as the map at the beginning of the book.

This overstuffed tome is packed with all the usual fluff: magic rings, power-mad sorcerer kings, reluctant young heroes, and all the rest. It's like someone took all these elements and threw them into some Fantasy-o-Matic machine and \\"The Fifth Ring\\" plopped out the other side. No, it's not the worst fantasy novel I've ever read (that distinction falls upon Dennis L. McKiernan's \\"Iron Tower\\"), but it's generally boring and fails to accost my attentions. How anyone could compare this newbie author to better ones, like Terry Brooks, is beyond me. It is passionless dribble, better left sitting on the shelf. I hate to bash a first-timer, but this is exactly the kind of work this genre does NOT need. Fortunately we have George R. R.

I recently read a review from Parrot and have no idea what he or she is talking about. I know LOTR and the Wheel backward and forward and this book has nothing to do with them. It's always amazing to me how some people can ramble on about topics they know absolutely nothing about. It's obvious from the comments they couldn't have read the book.To be sure many fantasy books share common elements, particularly where an epic journey is undertaken, but The Fifth Ring is a standout because it is largely character driven and has an excellent storyline.I absoultely agree with the reviewer who wrote that Mitchell Graham is a master at action/fight scenes. Conceivably these are among the best ever written. My book club picked The Fifth Ring out as a main selection and everyone I know has raved about it. You'll be selling yourself short if you miss this fine story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orlocks and White oh no Rose Gold","review":"Take a number of classics, fix them up into a story and then there you are.

In my opinion, the tournament lasted a little too long. As the story unfolds the pace does pick up a little, but there are still slow parts and overall the book is a little short on interesting dialog. The final battles are okay, but the ending came from out of nowhere and really wasn't an ending at all, but the setup for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Robert Jordan","review":"I loved this book.

I'm glad I did. While it wasn't the greatest fantasy I've ever read as some reviewers have written, it was an extremely entertaining book. The characters far and away carried the story and my guess is Mr. Graham has a bright future ahead of him.I'm definitely going to pick up the second book in the trilogy, The Emerald Cavern which is out tomorrow according to the press releases. My local store already has them on back order. I liked the fact that Lara, Mathew's love interest, is not a whimp nor is she one of Jordan's perpetually bad tempered females. She can hold her own with most men and gives as good as she gets. The giant Gawl is a lot of fun and I just fell in love with Father Thomas.

However, I would limit my negative feelings about the prose to the character dialogue and as this was a first novel, I can forgive the similarities to other series and books. After all, we can't even write a theoretical research paper in school without using references. Hopefully, Mitchell Graham will develop as an \\"original\\" writer as he gains more notoriety, self-assurance, and more creative freedom.This book had some of the BEST fighting descriptions that I have read in a very long time. As Graham is a fencer, I think we will see more of this in the later books for the series. The books are worth reading for the fights in the first half alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun for all","review":"One of the better books I have read in a long, long while.

HA HA HA! It doesn't . The world seems to be full of sales people who'll tell you any lie just to make a sale.Well HP, my fancy AIO printer is on it's way to bin, followed by the useless upgrade kit. What a waste of time and money.I'll be waiting for Apple to come up with a very thin AIO MACBOOK that wirelessly prints, scans, faxes and whips up a cappucino while I get ready to spend some quality time at home. Anything else is just not worth the effort. MAC for president!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undisclosed Limitations","review":"This product may be fine for use with just one computer but it does not work as well with multiple computers. The product has two pieces one that attaches to the printer the other that attaches to a computer. if you have multiple computers they can all print to the printer without additional hardware. HOWEVER, the printer with the adapter must be on. This is setup is fine if there is one computer in your system that is always in place (e.g. a desktop), but for a system where multiple family members have laptops, this does not work well because the laptop with the adapter may not be on (and may not even be in the house)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't set it up, sent it back","review":"I spent more than an hour trying to set this up, but I kept getting messages saying 'Unable to connect to printer'. I also found the manual difficult to follow - it was not written for averagely computer literate people like me.I went to the HP website, which told me there was no telephone support for the product. I tried chat support twice, but each time there was no reply after about ten minutes.To be fair, I did get an email apologizing for the fact that I couldn't get through and asking me to try again, but I had better things to do with my time.

I uninstalled it and completely started from scratch, but it still didn't work. The PC adapter no longer recognizes the printer as online. And the upgrade doesn't recognize the printer itself.

Inserted disc into laptop and directed to download drivers for Vista from internet. Before doing so, took to Internet for further research on product, only to discover the following:- will not work properly on my brand of computers (which are not HP)- prints two to three pages before sending job into hang mode- may bluescreen computer- will not work with Vista. They might have mentioned that somewhere on the packaging.- frustrating waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This device is very inconsistant, works fine with just 1 printer and with Vista. Directions are garbage, no messages to tell what is going on, software only installs if you can access the printer. I normally like HP products but this is the worst I've ever encountered and HP just ignores your support request.Update, after talking with a really helpful support rep at HP I got it working. It just took too many e-mails before I was put in contact with this person.You may be able to do accomplish the same result by sharing your printer from the PC it is connected to.

No conflicts, no printing problems, nothing! I also bought two of these for my father's home office using two computers. He uses it with one laptop connecting to one HP printer and the other computer uses the kit with a Minolta Color Printer. Again, no problems with installation or use.

Here's why I don't recommend it:1. Special software needs to be installed on each computer in order to connect.2. It only supports one PC/Laptop at a time. If you print from multiple computers, only the first connected will be able to print.3. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect is that the reliability is poor - that is, it constantly needs to be reset. Most of the time, its faster to attach the laptop directly to the printer. I have not spent any time with firmware updates or troubleshooting, but shouldn't have to.It could be ok if you have just one computer and a lot of patience, otherwise save yourself the headache and spend the extra money for a bona fide print server."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product when it worked","review":"Amazon was great with the service aspect. the product arrived on time with no problem and installed quick but after a few days stoped working. in the process of trying to report the problem to HP to get a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!","review":"Piece of JUNK!

Not compatible. 45 minutes on the phone with HP Support so that the tech could explain to me how to buy a longer phone cord - which wasn't my problem in the first place.

Long story short, after working correctly 1 time only- all three of my computers (2 of them HP) they can not connect to the wireless printer anymore. Money down the drain.My wife is furious with me that she can not print. I want HP to personally refund my money with an apology. If anyone buys this and ignores this warning you are in for a surprise.PS- I wonder why the price went down from $99 to $40 in 1 week?

The sections are succinct and strike a fair balance between archeological/anthropological fact and general interest. The time frame and breadth of countries are far-reaching. However, I thought the author was adept at linking it all and keeping continuity in a \\"plot line\\" that spanned nearly a millenium.The book is well illustrated and as much time can be invested in addressing the illustrations as reading the text. Essentially the book explains the provenance of those with Western European roots and underscores, again, how markedly the Roman Empire influenced what was to become modern Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no place to hide!","review":"At long last, Marvel Masterworks finally reprints some non-superhero comics! This book features the first 10 issues of Tales To Astonish, which was a sci-fi/fantasy anthology. Beginning with the fifth issue, the comic began to regularly feature giant monsters on the cover. Most of the stories are five pages long, and feature a \\"twist\\" ending. Some of the twists are predictable, and some of them make no sense, but they are still fun to read, usually with good artwork by a comics legend. As Stan Lee points out, nearly all of the stories are told in the first person. This allowed the comic to use attention grabbing titles like \\"I am the Giant From Outer Space!\\", \\"I Became a Human Bomb!\\" and \\"I Dared Defy the Floating Head!\\". Reproduction of the comics is good. If you are interested in pre-hero Marvel Comics, you should consider getting this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, with a lot of food for thought","review":"This was Skipp & Spector's last work, and it's a bit uneven to me.

It felt... unfinished, to me, as if there were something more that should have been done but wasn't.However, it's still excellent by most standards, fast paced and fun to read. It only pales in comparison to some of their earlier works.For an interesting comparison, read this and then read Nancy Collins' Wild Blood.

Not joking, literally. It's hard to believe that the same Gould who wrote an amazing book like Dazzle wrote this piece of dreck, but that's what it says on the cover.The plot of this book is basically that one woman is dying and she wants to hook her husband up with another chick so he can be happy and have a family after she's passed away. The dying woman hires this chick to decorate a grotto, and you will never forget that there is a grotto, cause it's all they bleepin' talk about when they aren't talking about orchids, equally as boring a subject. Where is the human drama? Oh, that's right, it's non-existent. Even when issues come up it's as if they're not happening, because none of these characters are the least bit real.

When they say one size, they mean one size if you are average sized. I am a size 10-12 with DDs. I put the teddy on very carefully and was pleased that it seemed to fit; however when I went to adjust my boobs, it split under one arm, and being made of pantyhose material, it ran all the way up and down that side, so that even if I sewed the armhole, it would still have a huge unsightly runner in it.I gave the hose to my daughter, who is very slim.

Secondly, a lot of references are to quite obscure. Finally, there is no advice at all, it is purely a listing, and thus no value is added by the author.

This current DVD was in stark counterpoint to that in that the stakes for Shostakovich were those of life and death. I really learnt a lot from listening to Michael Tilsen Thomas's explaination of the background and reasoning behind the 5th Symphony of Shostakovich & I thought the performance of the piece as part of the 2007 Proms was outstanding. I want to see and hear more - Mahler's 1st, Brahms' 2nd, Sibelius' 4th all would be welcome additions to this series. Many thanks SF Symphony and MTT."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTT Keeping Score Shostakovich #5 DVD","review":"Fantastic! Much like Bernstein and the Young Peoples concerts, just better.

I am no stranger to soldering, and I could not get this thing to make a single joint. I tried lighter and lighter gauge solder, smaller and smaller joints. The best I could do is make some blobs of solder drop off the end of a length of solder.The copy in the manual made sense (I am an engineer and saw nothing that defied the basic laws of thermodynamics, what I consider a sure tip-off that something is a scam), the rest of it all looked OK.

Almost all the material with Asta Nielsen is excised. The disc lists the runtime at 90 minutes for some reason. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this version","review":"This particular version of JOYLESS STREET is described as running 126 minutes, which is the running time of the best-restored version of the film. However, in actual fact, this VHS from Timeless Video is the truncated 60-minute version. SO DO NOT BE FOOLED. JOYLESS STREET features the stories of two women: the daughter of an immpoverished army veteran and the daughter of a retired civil servant. Both have fallen on hard times in the post-WWI era and both feel responsible enough for their families to compromise their morality in exchange for food and the trappings of wealth. Greta Garbo plays the daughter of the civil servant, and, after she moved to Hollywood and became famous, the film was re-released to feature her, practically eliminating the second and far more tragic story. So, while I highly recommend the fully restored version of the film, I want to warn buyers to be sure that that is the version they are getting.

This part of the book is dedicated to the history of mead and related alcoholic drinks. Naked racism, extreme conservatism, snobbism, awkward language style, low readability and long, boring historic reviews are characteristic for this part of the book. The Lt. Colonel speaks of great English civilization, wonderful Aryan race and superior Anglo-Saxon race, trying to bring enlightenment to the primitive and degenerate other human races. In this part there is not even a trace of any knowledge about mead making necessary for those who would like to do it.The last 10% of the book - Brewing Mead - is written by Charlie Papazian. This part is too short and too general to make a useful contribution to a beginner. The recipes are not precise and not detailed enough for a real success.If you are a historian interested in racist theories centered on the English and the Aryan myths, this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting history of mead but a bit dated","review":"If you are a real fan of mead and mead making you might want to add this to your collection simply as an interesting read into the history, conjecture and ups and downs of mead over the centuries. Well researched and interesting. Predominantly a scholarly look at the history of mead. The last few pages have some recipes and they are sound. So, if you are fascinated by mead then this is a great book. But if you want to learn how to make mead this wouldn't quite be the right book for you. Should be on any mead makers bookshelf though. You can't get this information about the nectar of the gods anywhere else.

No, but it is intertaining.Is the acting legendary? No, but does it matter?Are the special effects the best I have ever seen?

I felt like I wanted a refund for going to see it. Having read all of the original R. E. Howard material, I have to say that this effectively misrepresents the stories. Kull shouldn't make jokes, shouldn't speak perfect English (he's a barbarian, for god's sakes). Not enough realistic violence, too much humor, too light-hearted, not enough suspense. Not satisfactory.

There's no other way to put it. Director John Nicolella can't do much with an amateurish screenplay that could have been written by a twelve year old. The cast suffers even more, with terrible and wooden performances delivered all throughout the torturous 90 minute running time. Kevin Sorbo delivers the closest thing to a respectable performance, but even then he's forced to say some really inane dialogue and do some really stupid things.Action-wise, Kull is definitely not something to put on top of your list for adrenaline-pumping fights. Everything in such a straightforward fashion that all the fights and moves are predictable. Granted, it's not badly choreographed but it's not much fun, either. I have a lot of other things about this movie to complain about, but I think I've made my point. Kull is simply an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"Two words: Full On Demon Makeout. OK so that was four words. Retarded right?

However, it's not bad enough to surive in that collection of classic klinkers. When I saw it in the theater, the best line was actually delivered by a theater patron who, seeing Kull engaged in combat with a burley foe, suggested that Kull, \\"Bite his ear!\\", an appropriate allusion to current events at the time.

As a matter of fact, it just broke again for the fourth time today. The case though is very good looking and protects your phone way better than the holster. The clip will break in like one month tops. You should wait until Samsung corrects this mistake, just like one of the previous reviews said. One more thing that Samsung might want to take into consideration is adding a space on the bottom of the case so that you can charge your phone while in the case. I had to take a knife and scissors and cut one out myself. All in all, it's a pretty sturdy case except for THAT DARN BELT CLIP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't argue with facts.","review":"I've had my case for over a year now and am just now having to get back online to check out the reviews and put in my two cents worth. This case was great and it was only just 2 days ago that the clip broke; and I can understand why as I was quite persistant on clipping it over my belt as apposed to something thinner.So regardless of the clip breaking, this was probably one of the best cases I've had for my phone. Basically I think the clip is less likely to break for some rather than others depending on what expectations one has in mind for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Protection, Nice Looking","review":"I found this to be a great case. I am using it with the new Samsung a610. I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about when they call this a cheap, flimsy clip on the leather case. It is just fine! These guys must use it as a hockey puck! We're talking about a $250.00 phone here folks! Perhaps a little extra care might just be in order? It also has the nice feature of allowing removal of the case from the clip with a push on a very solid spring release. Great case. Not cheap and flimsy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A book on Buddhism I can understand.","review":"This rather confusing topic was presented in a light-hearted and personal manner I could understand and appreciate. I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro, IMHO.","review":"I make no pretense of having prior knowledge of Buddha or Buddhism. All I know for sure is that this book explains the subject concisely, in a very accessible manner. I burned through it in a few scant hours of reading, and it gave me some interesting things to think about. It also provides a good, quick history of the origin of Buddhism and clarifies the differences between it and other religions from the same region.I feel that this book addresses Buddha's teachings as a philosophy rather than as a religion, as the author notes that modern sects of Buddhist religion evolved/diverged from the core teachings contained herein in various ways, and I don't get the impression that it is practiced as religion in this basic form anywhere.I would recommend this book to anyone. If it inspires you to learn more about Buddhism, so be it. If nothing else, it may introduce you to a different point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but inaccurte","review":"Although this book provides an interesting introduction for novice to Buddhism, it does not provide an accurate picture to the later development of Buddhism. It appears that the facts are based on some layerman introductory literatures, but there seems to be insufficient research into the topics in depth. At least, in my opinion, not sufficient to provide a non-biased introduction for beginners and layerman. It appears more as a criticism against the later Buddhism than to provide a objective survey of the subject. There are ample literatures that discuss later Buddhism in an entirely different light from the author depicts in his work. I suggest readers should be cautioned that some of his observations are subjective rather than objective and factual."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"I hardly know where to begin with how disappointed I was with this book. I actually checked the original publish date sure that it would be around 1950, and was surprised that the first printing was this century! The dialog and writing style was almost archaic, making the characters cardboard. With conversation such as \\"You disapprove of me, don't you, my stern little secretary with the golden eyes?\\", and description such as \\"Which exposed a V of tanned flesh and dark curling body hair.\\" I thought both the H and H were prigs, which I suppose means they were compatible, but not people I wanted to read about. Needless to say, I deleted this one from my Kindle pretty fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stooge poster creased","review":"Nice poster, but shipping was rather reckless and bent the box in the middle.

It's hard to believe that this was the author's first book! It's very well paced, original, and presents a story that'll stay with you for years. This is the type of material the Sci-Fi channel should be using to create its original movies. I think the story could easily be adapted into such.

This Bald Guyz sunscreen lotion works well and it's both cooling and invigorating simultaneously. My only complaint is that at $10.00 a bottle it's not that great a bargain--there are other (widely available) sunscreens that serve the same purpose at lower prices. Nonetheless, this is especially formulated for the scalp and is worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penetrating eye-watering cheap ladies' perfume odor","review":"Don't use this product unless you enjoy smelling like a bordello.

The correspondence between this beloved Saint and a wonderfully ordinary priest washes away the mystique of St. Therese. What it reveals is a very human woman who through the love of Jesus helps another human being find the love God wants us to share in. It is very intense and emotional. You will find it difficult to put down and easy to re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd like to give everyone I know a copy of this book!","review":"This is the only book I've ever finished and started over again. I didn't know much about Therese, and less about Maurice, but this book makes you want to read more about Therese. One reviewer called this book a \\"gift,\\" and I couldn't agree more. The story of a cloistered nun in 19th century France might not seem very relevant today, but God's love is, and that's what this book is about. If Therese had one message, it was \\"God is love.\\" We need to hear that as much now as a hundred years ago in France."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most beautiful love story....","review":"I read The Story of a Love while waiting for the Story of a Soul to arrive, and after reading the Story of a Soul I appreciate The Story of a Love that much more.Patrick Ahern beautifully tours us through a God-centered, God-inspired, holy love between a nun and priest who became dear friends despite never meeting each other. The Story of a Love will inspire you to treasure and place God at the center your friendships. This is a must read that you won't be able to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truthful look at the beauty of her soul","review":"Having read this book several times I am continually inspired by the fervor with which St. Therese insists on lifting her charge from his self-pity and reproach. Regardless of what was revealed to her Therese repeatedly pleaded with Maurice to see his worthiness not through his own merits, but through those of Christ. An amazing message to take to heart - especially for those who struggle with their own worthiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"a better kind of love story","review":"Maurice & Therese is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two people connected by a common passion of reaching the world for Christ.

The handles are also shaped like more useful pliers, with a concave profile and wide stance.Both handles are slightly crooked. When closed, it just looks like junk.It is hard as heck to open, but one of the smaller screwdrivers tends to flop open.I had one of these many years ago, when it was \\"Sebertech\\". The old one was not junk like this. \\"IDL Tools\\" apparently has low standards, which is too bad because they have a superior design.The competing SwissTech is of slightly higher quality, but it too was once better.If you want this as a gift for someone, the Swisstech looks much better.

I was curious so I put the original batteries (the ones that came in the package with the battery pack) in a battery tester and got some really strange results...the tester gauge started bouncing all over the scale! It seems that the included batteries are funky in the sense that they don't supply a steady source of power. My new batteries, in the same tester, move the gauge and it STAYS PUT, rock solid.

It was predictable, story lines were not in depth, and the whole book was just flat. It sounded like it would be a good read but then just fell far short of my expectations. I read the other reviews praising the book and calling it charming - I guess it's charming, but not much more than that. There's no sizzle and no suspense.

Wish I could have liked this one a bit more.PROS I liked the characters, but didn't really find out too much about them; they needed a LOT more \\"fleshing out.\\" The story itself had promise, but we are left to guess the why of so many actions of the characters.CONS Um, wow, where to begin ... example: they used \\"mute point\\" instead of \\"moot point\\" (way too many of those types of errors.) Heroine makes a reference to something being in her genetics ... ah, Mendel didn't come up with that theory until 50 years after the action in this story. And then the use of \\"okay\\" and other words that were definitely NOT in the English vernacular in 1808.Fine for a quick read if you're not fussy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Accidental Plot","review":"I read other reviews of this book that were unfavorable but I bought the book anyway.

Some of vegetable salad recipes involve flowers, tongues, livers, fruits such as apples, grapes, etc. I thought they were too weird. I never eat flowers, tongues and livers nor do I put grapes or apples in my vegetable salads. It could be that I'm very old fashioned. I love classic salad recipes that you usually hear about or eat at the restaurants. Too bad, this book lacked in that area. Though, it does include 200 new/different recipes. If you want to try out new/different recipes, then you should buy this book but if you want a book filled with classic salad recipes, then I highly recommend \\"Joy of Cooking: All About Salads & Dressings\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"For the price of these sockets they can't be beat!

One could easily overlook the cheesy special effects, but the horrible singing and dancing can not. With the quality of kids informational dvds available today, its a wonder this dvd is still being distributed.

He then stopped and realized that he knew the distance the Sun is from the Earth. What a seamless way to teach kids without them realizing it. I give this DVD high marks for being original.

The book although full of details, the writing moves the book along avoiding the weight of tedium, (I was able to read the book in a few days). At the end is an admirable attempt at assesing not only the historiography of the Vietnam War but also the evolution of popular depictions of the war and American/Vietnamese relations during the intervening 25 years. This last section could have been a little more clearly written.

Despite these being my favorite bras and I LOVE THEM, I've encountered two major problems and figured that I would give a heads up:1) After washing, the straps get all wiggily. Note that they were hand-washed and air dried. Wash 'em even once and they've never laid flat for me again.2) Just in the past year, the black ones that I've purchased have been dying my skin. Yes. Lightly tinted purple boobs. :::facepalm::: The dye is clogging my pores too. Sometimes every pore is a little black-purple dot after wearing. I've washed them multiple times and with no avail. However, I've bought these in black and only have had this problem recently, so hopefully I got a bad batch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-Loved Folktales of the World","review":"What a wonderful collection this is!

Or maybe it was the over-authoritarian BIG VOICE with which George ordered him to the potty. Or maybe it was the rewarding of the eventual pottying with a hug (the only apparent display of love or support in the book).The running for the potty when he realized he finally had to go was cute, but doesn't make up for the rest of the book.

The lyrics are ridiculous; they are childishly simple, primitive, illiterate, loosely rhyming expressions of immature feelings.Rock and roll destroyed the lives of a billion people, encouraging wonderful young ladies to become trashy sex objects, encouraging everyone to destroy their minds and their lives through drug and alcohol abuse, encouraging immaturity and irresponsibility and self-indulgence. The premier rock and roll band was The Beatles, and this album contains their most popular music. Therefore, this music is not only poorly written, but morally evil. In view of both aesthetic values and moral values, this is the worst collection of songs in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"Every song sounds great! The cd was great!

There is action and there is intrigue but it is rather understated. This is understandable as this is obviously a first novel in a proposed series. Even without the action I found myself interested and engaged. I found myself caring about the characters and the Empire as a whole. The author even managed to instill in me a sort of Xenophobic Human pride. I found myself being offended that Earth was a backwater planet and humanity nothing more then one more cog in the giant Empire of Species that is the Praxis.As usual I do not wish to give too much of the plot away so the review lacks some specifics but trust me when I say this is a novel well worth reading and an author well worth watching. The only reason this is four stars versus five is that I don't believe it transcends the level of very good to great. This may change as we see the novel fit into the matrix of the series as it is written."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Well written? Yes. Character development? Oh yes, way too much. In fact that is the entirity of this book. Plot? Yes there is a plot but it is background for hundreds of pages of character development. This book is 400 plus pages long, at page 250 the only thing that had happened was a rescue of a racing ship, and a boring rescue at that. Had I not mistakenly ordered the second book in this series I would not have finished this book at all.

I want to like it, but I cannot seem to get past endless balls/dinners/social scheming. The author spends pages on stuff that has nothing at all to do with science fiction, and everything to do with a human soap opera.

It's like they all had tunnel vision.And humor is (nearly) entirely absent.I would have somewhat enjoyed the basic \\"war story\\" premise up to age 14 or so.

When I was younger, I would finish books no matter how bad they were.The action is way too slow, there are really only two action scenes. The flashback story with Caro was interesting, but I figured out the twist way before it happened. I found the technology in this book really dull.

He is at his best when using humor to laugh at the managers and employees in large organizations.Yet he has his critics. The loudest criticism comes from a self-confessed enemy of management, Norman Solomon, who discovered, belatedly, that Adams is not a fellow traveler.Adams has been such so successful criticizing managers, that many are shocked to find him in favor of efficiency.Large organizations create work for themselves, and people working in them know this.

As others have stated, the DC adapter works OK, but the pass-through sound is terrible. The built-in amplifier picks up a severe alternator whine off of the DC line and amplifies it, along with the audio from the iPod. Why Belkin didn't include a simple, effective, L-C line filter is beyond me, but its absence renders this product useless. Save your money. By the way, there's nothing wrong with my car's wiring system - my late model Volvo V70 T5 Wagon's radio plays flawlessly and noislessly, even on the AM band, so there's no reason that Belkin shouldn't have been able to design a suitably quiet product."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool product","review":"i bought this product despite the reviews cuz the majority of people reviewing this product used the fm transmitter. i don't use that thing. i use a genric cassette adapter and works like a beauty. i reccomend this highly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good fit for my BMW 325iX","review":"I've have two bad things and one good thing to say about this product:1) The plug is not a tight fit in my car's cigarette lighter (BMW 325iX) ... as such my iPod turns off everytime the adapter is bumped, which is very annoying.2) There is a high-pitched whining noise when I accelerate ... I've read that I can fix this by purchasing some additional parts, but please I shouldn't have to do that.3) The volume control / line out is a very nice feature ... without it the signal from the headphone jack is too weak and makes switching between my iPod and the radio dangerous (i.e. too loud), however with it the volumes are more similar ... nice.So overall I'm in the process of debating if I can deal with the bad in order to have the good.

It's not so bad in my car that I'm \\"listening to my spark plugs\\", but it's clearly there. It's also a very low frequency, which bothers me more than radio hiss would.3) It's not well behaved - if you unplug the iPod it still sucks juice, so I can't just leave it plugged in somewhere (well, maybe I could, but I'm not willing to test how much it pulls vs how strong my battery is) and just use it to plug in the iPod when it's in the car with me.Overall, a frustrating buy.

They should of left \\"Muskrat Love.\\" to the Captain and Tennille.This album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end. The problem was that there was their first two albums, ( America and Venture Highway) and there was their others.My recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"One reason the 70's have such a reputation for lame music","review":"America is one of the reasons the 1970's have such a reputation for lame music. It isn't just the dopey gimmick the group had for having the titles of their albums all begin with the letter 'H' (a practice thankfully abandoned at some point) but just the whole \\"we're so laid back and cool\\" persona they tried to project.Although imitation is supposedly the greatest form of flattery, Neil Young said it best when he said of the song \\"A Horse With No Name\\" \\"that's the song about the guy who THINKS he's done acid.\\"To be fair, not every song here is a total dud. \\"Lonely People\\" is a pleasant relic from a simpler time, and even the most die hard rockers will confess that \\"Sister Golden Hair\\" is catchy enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure. But this does not excuse such dreadful cuts like \\"Tin Man,\\" \\"Woman Tonight,\\" and a candidate for worst song ever written \\"Muskrat Love.\\"All and all, leave this one back in the 70's where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Magic Found in History: Greatest Hits","review":"I'm serious here.

Get the other one.SML"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and uncompelling","review":"America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music that makes me want to put my head through a brick wall","review":"There are lists of Desert Island Discs, and there are lists that have this godawful album on this. I had a college roommate that played this garbage far too often, and I found myself welcoming death after a certain point. Horse With No Name? Muskrat Love? Are you kidding me? Does it truly get any worse than this? What lunatic considers these songs noteworthy other than for their sheer awfulness?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soft rock albums of the 70s!","review":"This compilation was released in 1975 during their peak. All 12 songs made the charts, 6 were top ten hits, and two went all the way to number 1. The album was produced by legendary Beatles producer George Martin, and went multi-platinum. No 70s music collection is complete without this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic collection from the band's peak period","review":"A superlative collection of pop/folk/rock hits from the early 70's. Massive kudos go to the producer, who manages to mold these bright little songs into exquisite audio confections. And for once a greatest hits release really is packed with great material. Dewey Bunnell has an amazing talent for writing lyrics that just verge on making sense without really saying much. The secret is in the imagery: \\"alligator lizards in the air\\", \\"eagle in the eye of a hurricane that's abandoned\\", \\"soap glass green light bubbles\\". In less capable hands, these bits of nonsense could come off as silly; here they create a sense of mystery, one is tempted to say complexity, that's otherwise lacking in the rather simple sentiments these songs express. The only downside to this CD is that it's been obviated by more recent collections that include the same material plus tracks from the band's later releases. But this one still represents their very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My History Lesson","review":"Being a child of the 80's the 70's always seemed bland and stuffy. One day I lugged my guitar to work and a co-worker knocked out some beautiful chords and warm lyrics. I was impressed and asked who the artist was and the name of the song. He said \\"Lonely People\\", by America. So it was not long before I got ahold of a copy, and went with this greatest hits. There's alot here and a good entry into not just \\"America\\" but into that 70's groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering America","review":"One of the premiere bands of the early '70's, the group was known for it's acoustically oriented songs. This seminal work covers virtually every pop hit recorded, and gives the listener a complete overview of the band's work. For fans and those wishing to familiarize themselves, this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"America","review":"This cd is really nice. It gives a history on the group and has most of their hits. One drawback is that a few of the hits are missing. Otherwise. I really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth psychedelica?","review":"Finally I got this album, which I absolutely love. Most people seem to consider the work of this band soft rock, or some kind of CSN&Y rip-off. I don't even like them so I don't have that problem. Simply put these songs flow together and can create some amazing imagery, and although not really psychedelic that is how I tend to think of it. Mostly I wanted Horse With No Name, which still blows me away, but I was surprised at how many other songs I recognized, such as Ventura Highway, Tin Man, and Sister Golden Hair, especially since I wasn't around when these songs were written. Simply put, these three crafted some amazing songs with a soft touch combined with intense imagary that can really take you away. this really is the perfect album to put in after a long day to ease your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite collection of 'wimpy' music","review":"I like hard-core metal and grooving classic rock, and listen to it quite often. But there are times when I feel the need to drop the aggressive tunes for a little while. You know, cool down, and get mellow. Time to make a trip through the neigborhood of James Taylor, Barry Manilow... and America. That's when I reach for this CD.America's Greatest Hits are among some of the most mellow tunes I've ever enjoyed. 'Horse With No Name' is, of course, their most recognized track, as well as one of the most listened-to tunes in recorded music. But my favorites are 'Ventura Highway' and 'Sister Golden Hair', two songs I didn't even know America recorded until I heard them on this CD.Now, if they ever consider adding 'You Can Do Magic' to this release in the future (as, say, a bonus track? Hint hint, wink wink), 'History' would be absolutely perfect.'Late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"America, here we come","review":"It's funny to think the band isn't really from America. You'll find that out when you read the band history inside the cover. Though the album is short, it's filled with entirely listenable songs from the 70's. Soft rock at its best. Sometimes moody, often times just easy listening.Often sounding a lot like Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, America manages to escape the similarities with plenty of hits and beautifully-written melodies that never seem to grow old. Though a very short disc, America: History- Greatest Hits is a good buy. You'll be sure to recognize more than a few songs on here, I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like classic rock?

Sister Golden Hair2. Lonely People3. Sandman4. Tin Man5. Ventura HighwayThis cd is soooo worth 11 bucks. press \\"add to cart\\" now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Believe This Album is 25 years Young","review":"\\"A Horse With No Name\\", America's most popular song, opens this album that reminises the style that brought early 70's music into popularity. The music still has a timeless sound today compared to much of other early 70's groups. Favorites here are \\"Sister Golden Hair\\", \\"Ventura Highway\\", \\"Lonely People\\" and \\"Tin Man\\". The album is mostly soft rock with a relaxed feel. The only complaint I would have about this album is that two other great songs are not here, \\"You Can Do Magic\\" and \\"The Border\\", but those songs came after this album came out so its excusable. Highly recommended as one of the 70's best \\"Greatest Hits\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the 70's","review":"This is a great CD! I find myself playing it over and over. \\"Horse With No Name\\" is one of the greatest pop songs ever recorded and there are other tasty selections here too...\\"Lonely People\\", \\"Don't Cross The River\\" and \\"Sister Golden Hair\\".

Throw in \\"Ventura Highway\\", which always gets you smiling (I think it's the image of chewin' on a piece of grass, walkin' down the road, nothin' to do). And of course, the incomparable \\"Sister Golden Hair\\" with its universal plea of compromise (\\"will you meet me in the middle\\"...). Get this one, and put the CD player on shuffle.

This material, if mastered, will give teachers and other school support personnel working in regular, special and resource classrooms, as well as specialized educational environments the necessary skills to effectively manage the behavior of acting-out children as well as that of less disruptive children\\" (Walker ix).

There were trading links between Roman Britain (present day England, Wales and southern Scotland)and Ireland but that's all. The Romans maintained that they could conquer Ireland with one legion, but they never put this claim to the test! And I really wish non-Irish people would stop trying to \\"do\\" an Irish accent - there are many Irish accents depending on location, but actors always manage to invent some new cringeworthy one. I found myself watching this series in the same way that I'd watch a horror movie I don't want to watch but can't look away from -with a sense of horrified fascination.

This is a writer who relates to his real-life characters, revealing their otherwise unspoken fears as they face an enemy superior in numbers, equipment and training. Yes, you must separate out patriotic fervor to meet the objective descriptions sometimes hidden just below the surface. And thankfully it's not another action book, loaded with nothing but sensational battle descriptions that eventually dull the senses to otherwise vital character and storyline development. There is a reason why Max Brand is one of America's most prolific writers of a vast span of subject material - he is simply a professional who produces readable prose. If you want Star Wars, look elsewhere.

This book is absolutely a terrifying book to be given to children. The idea that somehow children should be happy or even excited with their parents \\"unmarriage\\" or divorce is completely dillusional. As if kids whose parents are going through divorce need the added pressure of feeling they must behave the same way that Paula and Demetrius do. In addition to that, most kids may wonder how come, unlike in the story, their parents aren't living next door to each other and that they can visit them anytime they please.

He is a recovering alcoholic and has spent years trying to graduate from college and at 32, still hasn't. Rinehart does allow Andrew one redeeming quality though and that is his longing and striving to make a family of his stepsons and of course, his wife.Throughout this novel you get the nagging feeling that Rinehart's heart isn't in it: nothing much happens, he has little sympathy for his hero and in the last 5 pages Andrew gets an unwarranted comeuppance and put down.At best the prose is good but many pages go by with Andrew droning on and on making petty and minor observations.

This book seems to use some violent words such as \\"stuid\\" in it which I don't think that children need to be calling other children.

The tone is warmer and creamier, and the words are treated with great care, without falling into the mannered style of Schwarzkopf.

I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.\\"Enjoy Life\\" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor QA/QC etc","review":"I have bought quite a few of these and other of Enjoy Life's bars in the past. I'm planning on curtailing my consumption of them since: 1) I received an empty, but sealed, box 2) There are quality and consistency problems. (e.g. bars with debris or other food material on them; bars of varying sizes; inadequate or sloppy packaging) 3) varying quality of customer service (e.g. was supposed to receive a coupon for the empty box, but haven't etc.)They are, however, a very convenient snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"i was very disappointed by the very small size, but i was shocked by the brick-like texture of a bar that has chewy in the name on the box. it tastes good, but small size and very hard texture were not what i had in mind. i called amazon with my complaint and i received a full refund. thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The chocolate ones are much better","review":"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions. Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry. I threw them away. I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great company, not our favorite item","review":"I really love Enjoy Life's line of allergy-friendly products... their dairy-free mini chips are a staple on my pantry! I was excited to first try out these bars, as they're nut-free and would thus be appropriate for school snacks and lunches. Sadly, though, neither of my kids liked the flavor. My daughter also lamented the texture, which I have to agree is a little bit mealy. I know some love these, but I have found there are many other gluten-free snack bar options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy camper!!!!","review":"My son does not like this new recipe. There aren't many snacks foods that he can have and he really enjoyed the old Caramel Apple Bars. So I bought a case of them thinking they were the same bars but in different packaging, I am very disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GF snack","review":"I LOVE these and never leave the house without at least one in my bag.

My favorite flavor is the apple and nut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hater of women","review":"Rarely did I disagree more with an author. Unless this is a book written intentionally to startle and create sensation, I could not help to ask myself \\"Where did THAT one come from?\\" According to Mrs. Vilar, women are some sort of profiteering cold blooded reptilians unable of feelings (!?) They managed to piggyback their existence on the backs of men, who are the only driving force of society. Make of it what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight to a woman's thinking","review":"This book gives great insight into how a woman thinks and how they use and manipulate men. This should be required reading for all men. I wish it was still in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Manipulated Man","review":"I was manipulated by a cult that used this book as their Bible more than I was ever manipulated by a woman. They claimed to have a way of life better than any other, but it turns out they are con artists and scumbags that just use people to satisfy their own sick needs for approval, power, sex, money, and attention. They go to AA meetings and preach this book behind the scenes, and try to control others. They are dangerous psychopaths. Beware of anyone giving you this book and giving you advice on how to live. Now, I am free and live my own life without relying on extremist views or cons artists who only want to control me, not help me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes so much sense!","review":"I read this book after hearing about it in an online debate. I was curious and decided to give it a try. This book is like a hand grenade in a feminist collective. Never have i heard a woman tell the truth about her own gender before.What i found reading this book was that every couple of pages or so i would have to stop and think and inevitably i would realise that the manipulative behaviour she was describing matched my own experiance with women. It's like David Attenborough had done a feild study of women and written up his findings in a much angrier and more sarcastic manner than usual.I recommend this book to all men."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bible","review":"The truth contained in this book is the most difficult thing for a man raised in the US to accept. Every cell in your body will recoil at first reading. You will think of every excuse and exception imaginable to not accept the simple truth presented in the pages. You will never get much support from either your male or female friends; However, if you dare to accept what is plainly in front of your eyes, you will be rewarded with a life free from bondage and filled with self esteem. I recommend this book very highly.. Read it at least once a week for a year. Slowly but surely, you will see the truth everywhere around you. You will wake up to many unpleasant facts about society but also realize the many wonderful choices available. My life has gotten better ever since I read this book 5 years ago. Best of luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too true to be good...","review":"A truly eye-opening read, and miraculous it was even published. However, it actually SHOULDN'T be read by men if they don't want to end up as monks. Ask yourself if it's better to be enlightened and angry, or enslaved and slightly happy and viewed as 'noble, sacrificing, mature', etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Transforming!","review":"So I got this book on a friend's recommendation and little did I know what I was about to learn. Yeah sure, it might sound a bit misogynist to start with but we are talking about generalisations here. All our lives as men, we are trained to please women in everything we do. The job we have, the car we have, the cologne we wear and so on, this book will set you free. After reading this you will start to see the true world with full knowledge, just as Neo in the movie The Matrix. Since I finished this book, I have placed more value on myself as an individual rather than thinking about the opinion of the current female in my life. This is book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another confused female author","review":"I had expected to like this book because I had heard that it is anti-feminist. But in fact, it is not. Just like feminists, the author believes that men and women should be basically equal. She just has the insight to realize that men are worse off than women are in modern society. So she basically just rants against women. And while I share with the author a general disgust for modern women, I have nothing against traditional women. Just like feminists, the author is hopelessly confused by failing to understand the fundamental differences between men and women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Out-of-Date","review":"This book is a revision of a German edition first published in 1971. If that were not enough to put the book out-of-date, the author's writing style certainly would. Her prose is \\"romantic\\" English: \\"She offers him [a man who changes her flat] 'tyre' an embroidered handkerchief, which he politely refuses. He makes no reply and, as she gets back into the car, gallantly shuts the door for her.\\" (p. 4). To the extent that the author received death threats, one may have come from a paperback writer whose books sell best in drugstores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adesso 17 LCD Tablet","review":"I returned this product as it was not compatible with my Intel iMac (2.1GHz) running Mac OS 10.5.5 - the current OS. The tablet software would not install on my computer. The device itself will connect, but it has only VGA output - so the screen resolution is not great. Kind of defeats the whole 17 in monitor idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Not a Wacom, but it is worth it, work just fine, I only wish i would have more information on the web about calibrating the monitor and advance software to control it and the pen also. Maybe more support from the developers or a fac section or blog or something on the web site.I still have not calibrate correctly wih the mini software it comes with it, but in fact I get use to work with the pen not well aligned to the mouse pointer. Other thing when you draw, using pens pressure produce lines with a lot of arefacts, neither straight or smooth, so you have to work with a lot of zoom to get it properly well. It is a good cheaper option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Story About Worrying","review":"I bought this book for my 7 year old son who tends to be a worry-wart.

It would be perfect for girls ages 4-7 years, especially if they are prone to worrying/anxiety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"This is an OK story. However, it does not offer any real help for kids to deal with their anxieties, so I did not find it to be a satisfiying purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes all new concerns for little ones","review":"I really disliked this book. We have read others by the author that we've liked. While I know what his message was here, I really felt the \\"school will be okay\\" message was overwhelmed by the pages upon pages of things to worry about. My daughter is 2.5 and having trouble adjusting to preschool. This book seemed to concern her quite a bit. Another little boy I read it to asked me WHY did Wemberly worry so much. She worries about the way the playground equipment is put together, the crack in the wall at home, and so on. I think the book created more concern than it took away. A much better book (in my opinion), on this same topic is The Kissing Hand. My daughter has responded nicely to that one, and it seems to be helping. She referred to it today as she went off to school without tears (a big achievement around here)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable and Very Helpful for a worrier or not","review":"We bought this book for our son, who had begun to worry a bit more about school, and all the what if's, etc.He loves this book, and points out the fact that little Miss Wemberley worries too much.He laughs along with the story, and loves to even act out some of the scenes.Delightfully written, and appealing to young children, and parents.Kevin Henkes is a wonderful children's auther- writes excellent stories for our kids.A keeper! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to Kevin Henkes, he's done it again!","review":"Add Wemberly to the long list of Kevin Henkes' loveable characters. She worries about lots of things, but finds in the end, that her biggest worry (SCHOOL!) is nothing to worry about. Children of all ages will identify with Wemberly's knack for concern, but will enjoy experiencing the lovely way the adults in her life help her cope. Thank you Kevin Henkes, for another book about real feelings disguised in adorable entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"engrossing","review":"Kojak is cleverly unique.

I like what I pay for the price and the ingredients. It's not the best top shelf ingredients for cat food, but it's better for the other brands in the same price range. My kittens love eating it straight up and I feel better about feeding them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it's stale.","review":"When the box arrived, the bottom was open and the bag of cat food was open inside of the zippered plastic bag. I think it probably fell out of the box causing the bag to open or something. It took about a week to get here so I don't know how long it was open. The cats still eat it but I don't know... I just get a feeling that they don't think it's as good as it usually is. I hope there is no penalty if I cancel my subscription for this. Something like this though is why I was worried about starting Amazon subscriptions to things. I've started to buy a lot of every day items through Amazon after I found out I could have them delivered to my home so conveniently, but I am still a fairly new member."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TO READ","review":"A great book to read if you've ever wondered about our universe.

I agree with the other reviews that this mouthwash is nice to use. But I won't be buying it again for 2 reasons....1) It has Sodium Saccharide in it. I looked everywhere for ingredients before buying this but decided to just get it. I'm still going to use it but I was wanting to avoid certain ingredients in getting a good quality mouthwash and this was one of the ingredients I was trying to avoid.2) I can't pour with this bottle. The bottle is glass and everytime I try to get out a few drops... I end up pouring way more than I wanted, probably like 20 drops.If those 2 aspects don't bother you, I think everything else about this is great. It leaves the mouth feeling great and refreshed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Do not waste your time or money on this POC. Apparently Atari bought Humongous and then created this game as a follow on title to the popular (deservedly so) Putt-Putt series. There is NOTHING in this game that even remotely resembles the fun problem solving activities present in the earlier titles. Purely arcade type, and extremely boring at that. Stay Away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Putt-Putt Enters the Race Instead!","review":"Pep's Birthday Surprise is a definite let-down from Putt-Putt Enters the Race! The major flaw in the software is that the game is less open-ended and too full of animated scenes ... the charm of the Putt-Putt games is that kids are encouraged to use critical thinking skills and to figure out (sometimes obscure) problems. These features are curtailed in this particular game, as if the designers have lost faith in their audience's ability to problem solve and to do multi-step reasoning ... A minor but disconcerting feature is that Putt-Putt's voice has dropped in pitch, which will prove very distracting to Putt-Putt parent veterans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stepford Putt","review":"We had to install this on an XP account with privileges, and we still have no confidence it will not bomb. We gave up trying to install on Windows 2000 and 98 systems.It takes forever to get through the scene chat. Our children are really patient; this is the first time we've felt compelled to use the Enter key to end the character chats.The bonhomie is missing. Even down to the choice of Putt's voice. Putt used to seem about 7 years old, and now he sounds like his voice is about to change.Putt used to be an innocent little guy, helpful and kind, but in this game, he must constantly get rid of Pep in order to discuss the party with co-conspirators. In most scenes, you must first click on Pep so that Putt-Putt can tell him to \\"go play with your friend\\", out the door, unsupervised...Better to buy \\"Enters the Race\\" first, then try \\"Zoo\\", \\"Circus\\", \\"Moon\\", and \\"Parade\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed properly for XP","review":"My 3 year old son loved Putt-Putt enters the race, but I'm disappointed with this game and Window's XP. I had to install the game as Administrator, but my son's account is set up as a limited user to keep him from deleting important data from the computer. The game does NOT work properly from limited accounts and I can't find a patch to fix it. So far it runs, but you can't save/load any games. A simple bug that should have been fixed in normal beta testing. Good ideas, neat pictures - bad programming.Update: I contacted their technical support. They gave me a useless response and didn't offer to help me solve it. Fortunately some web searches helped me figure out how to fix this.BAD Technical support for this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaay too slow","review":"This game was unplayably slow on a computer that was adequatefor previous Humongous Software games.Humongous is clearly capable of making playable games, so theremust have been something different about his one.The alliance with Atari is new to me, as is their use ofBink Video and Miles Sound System from RAD Game Tools.Note that \\"Pajama Sam: Life is Tough When You Lose Your Stuff\\"also has complaints about slowness on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"My four year old and I played this, and neither one of us could wait for it to end. The game takes a long time to change from scene to scene, so much so that we thought that the computer had frozen. The game is not challenging, fun, or educational but is in fact very boring and basic. Definitely not what we have come to expect from Humongous Entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY for Putt Putt!","review":"I was worried, because Humongous hasn't put out any new Putt Putt or Pajama Sam games for a while, but now there are new ones of each, and they are just as wonderful as all the others. Pep's Birthday Surprise is very sweet, and very simple, but is extremely entertaining and funny. The characters are really cute, especially the big hippy VW Bus named \\"Sunshine\\". The game changes a bit each time you play it, so it remains entertaining and challenging. Also, there are tons of different things in each room to click on, as well as some really fun mini-games. I buy these games for my nephew, but I always end up playing them myself. Definitely a bargain for some of the best children's software you're likely to find anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is life, let it seep into you...","review":"I've had this album for years and it continues to amaze me.

The lessons and ideas aren't bad, but could have been planned out better. Ofton I had to read and re-read a section to understand what was going on, since the ideas presented are in story form, not lesson form.I don't really use this book at all.

However, besides the history and background of Reiki, you also get the autobiography and self-promotion of William Rand. Some may find this a welcome addition to the book, but it may be a distraction for others. The book is not well edited and in some parts it's like reading the work of a high school kid still learing how to write. If you look past these problems, there is some useful content in the book about Reiki."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last the latest information on Reiki","review":"I love this book as it contains an up to date history of Reiki including the latest information from Japan, the Japanese Reiki Techniques including how to do them and the Hayashi Healing Guide. Along with this is a clear and meaningful explaination of Reiki including an indepth understanding of the Reiki symbols and all the western hand positions for treating oneself and treating others.

The inclusion of recent research on the real history of Reiki, as opposed to the mythology which apparently has been taught in American Reiki circles, helps to set the record straight and adds to the credibility of Reiki and the book. Unfortunately, the book does not contain pictures of the Reiki symbols, which however can be seen in Diane Stein's Reiki book and in Diane Shewmaker's book on Seichim. While the book becomes too aggressively commercial at times in the promotion of William Rand's Reiki center, the author has a real connection to the loving, powerful energy of Reiki, and the book is well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Product","review":"Pros: It's an amazing card and you will certainly receive what you're expecting, graphics wise of course. I've tested several new games on this card and it rocks performing, you can maxout everything.Cons: It's a huge card, you for sure need to check your case space.

I'm glad that Liz isn't acting so straightlaced and that she's breaking out and having a little fun. I have to say, I'm not that happy about the Will/Jessica thing. I wish she was still with Jeremy- he's a lot sweeter than Will. I'm a bit disapointed with the way some of the people overrate looks. They think that all that matters is a person's appearance, and they seem a bit shallow. Also, I'm getting a bit sick of Maria.

Also unrealistic is that all year, she's let her grades slide & has been going out on school nights, then when her guidance counselor calls her to the office to discuss her grades & contacts her parents, her mom nearly has a fit. Then she forgets an appointment with her counselor & her parents get hysterical & ground her. And of course by that time, Liz is feeling rebellious & sneaks Megan into the house. Naturally her parents catch her & yell at her. Then a ludicrous & rather funny part is that she sneaks out of the house & goes to a party & gets drunk...then, of course Conner shows up to the rescue! Conner's getting rather annoying & his lame, cynical \\"tough guy\\" attitude is so old.

All of the early Sabbath albums are solid pieces of work and this one is equally as powerful. I was skeptical buying this because i hadn't heard much about it, but it was worth it. The only weak song is the last one cause i think the drummer sings it. All the other songs just flat out rock like you'd expect. Sound quality is very good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sabbath Album","review":"OK, so I might draw flak for saying so, but in my mind, this is Sabbath's best work. It's so melodious, so innovative, so beautiful... there are seeds here that lead to Osbourne's solo career. Now I should say that I'm much older now than when I first started listening to Sabbath (when I was 12, back in the eighties). This is an album that may have more appeal to older listeners like me, whose musical tastes have refined somewhat--- no offense to you pure blood metal fans--- but I listen to jazz, classical and world music, too, and I find this Sabbath album has so much more musical richness than their earlier albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly underrated","review":"black sabbath's last studio album with ozzy osbourne sounds very different than any other albums with ozzy on vocals.this cd is not nearly as heavy than the other sabbath albums but still i love this cd.the best songs on this cd are never say die,junior's eyes,air dance and swinging the chain with bill ward singing lead vocals.swinging the chain and junior's eyes being my favorites.this cd however isn't flawless over to you is a rather weak track,a hard road isn't all that great either.how about the instrumental breakout for a black sabbath fan who never heard this cd just heard this track they would never guess it's sabbath.this is a sabbath cd that some[fans}tend to overlook and that's a shame.there is some great music on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY HARD TO LIKE IT !","review":"IT's very hard to enjoy a CD once you know that the band recorded it at their worst phase with Ozzy, and when the musicians themselves say this is a recording they want to forget about.

I used to think my LP was a bad press, but then years later I bought the remastered import on CD. It sounded thin and weak, too. The sound quality for me makes this CD hard to listen to, even though I really like the album content. I would really like to hear this album not just remastered, but remixed as well. I doubt that would ever happen. It was cool to hear Megadeth's version of \\"Never Say Die\\" on the second N.I.B. album because you can get an idea of what the song really should sound like. It would be awesome to hear of other re-makes of songs on this album. My personal favorites are \\"Hard Road\\" (which I can listen to over and over) and \\"Shock Wave\\" (Cool riff at the start, and then a very complimentary riff on top of that). I would love to rate this album higher than 2 stars, but the sound quality is horrible.

The title track has always been a favorite, and I find some interesting moments with \\"Swinging the Chain\\" sung by Ward, and \\"Air Dance\\". Hard Road fittingly has the whole band singing as sort of bon voyage, but the Greatestness of Sabbath died after Sabotage. I wish the original singer on this album got his shot. Ozzy was the band's worst singer, though the one that defined them.My greatest fear right now, is that the band will stop suing one another and reunite, but if they do, it should be with the understanding that Ozzy will sing Digital B*tch from Born Again. That would be some justice. Dio is dead and so is Black Sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"2,5 stars","review":"Only Never say die and Juniors eyes worth a good rate.

Not one song can pretend to be among the band's best. Even what may be the finest track, 'Junior's Eyes', isn't particularly memorable. It just gets lost amidst all of the mediocre material. Ozzy is particularly unimpressive, and even Tony Iommi seems uninspired. The original US cd release sounds lousy so avoid that one. \\"Never Say Die\\" is better-sounding on the UK remaster, and the notes are interesting as with all of the remasters. The best-sounding version of \\"Never Say Die\\" is the 1993 cd (Spectrum 550 131- 2) from the Netherlands. This one may be hard to find, but for some reason it sounds splendid. For an album as inherently weak as \\"Never Say Die\\" is by Sabbath standards, it helps a lot to hear a good version of it, believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Track Rocks but not much else","review":"I love the Title Track but I think that the rest of the CD is plain and has no punch.

The band would boldly move forward and record with Ronnie James Dio and produce a fine first album with him (Heaven and Hell). When listening to this album, however, one can clearly see (and hear) the cracks in the machine. However, this album isn't without some very good songs. My personal favorite is Junior's Eyes, which has a nifty guitar solo in the middle and is raw heavy metal at its finest. I also like Over to You, which has a similar sound. Air Dance is an unusual number, and I can remember my nephew rolling around in the snow on a cold night while listening to this one (long story). I've always wondered how and why Iommi went with a most unusual guitar sound with this album. It almost sounds garage-like. Still, it's unique, and overall I think the album works. It's certainly not vintage Sabbath, but can hold its own nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Heaviest Metal","review":"Some of Tony's most impressive guitar work.

Again this series may not before everyone but is worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not read","review":"this is very degrading these \\"men\\" need to see a therapist. no woman would stay with a man after he just screwed his brothers girlfriend and came to her house to shower then tells her he loves her then sleeps with her!! this series is a no go"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque!","review":"Need I say more. This series is, literally, nothing but trash! Brothers, really, yuck! I am all in for fun, but being coerced into having sex with not just the guy I love, but his brothers, too? Could I be such a moron? There isn't enough steamy anything to make this series worthwhile. I deleted it off of my Kindle. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...yeah...NO","review":"I love Lora Leigh's books first off but holy hell this series is just ew. No means no...hell no means no. No in any language means no but the characters in this book brow beat the girl into submission. Ew. Also the whole brother rapes brother thing skeeved me out and the we need to have sex with the same woman ALL TOGETHER...is crap. It is the utter male fantasy written by a woman. If they werent related, if they didnt have such a icky past or use that crap of an excuse on why the share the same women I might have enjoyed it. But yeah this book was just nasty and not in the good way. I love smut as much as thenext girl but this was incestuous and left me feeling dirty afterwards again not in a good way. So I strongly suggest you skip reading this series....but please read Lora's Breed series or Nauti Series. Steer clear of the incest fest that is The August Men 1-3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read 1/2","review":"I read all of Marley's book and 1/2 of Sarah's book. I could not stand anymore. There is no woman in their right mind who would be led around by such a heavy hand. I would call the cops and have these men arrested. The erotica is great but if you can not stand any of the characters then it is pretty hard to read the sex scenes. I have LOVED, LOVED, LOVED most of Lora Leigh's writing. But this series SUCKS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"Ok, I like erotica (or romantica, I think is what the romance genre is calling it these days) as much as the next woman and the erotica is the only reason this gets 2 stars. I was so distracted by the ridiculous storyline that I couldn't even finish this book. I don't know what Lora Leigh got this madness. The plot is simply beyond ridiculous. I tend to read books out of order so this was the first I'd read in the Men of August series.

Lora Liegh draws in her charters keep pulling into the story more so then book 1 and 2 of this series. I enjoyed the book.Holly Kruper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah's Seduction","review":"This story is just as steamy as many of Lora Leigh's other adventures. From start to finish, you entangled and snared into the world of the Men of August series. The characters are strong the story line is both suspenseful and anticipatory with twist and turns of the events in process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by an educator","review":"I recently read Slow Death and thought it was a fun book to read. The book hit on many topics that adolescents can relate to such a peer pressure, feeling alone, anddeveloping empathy for all groups of people, including seniors, ethnic background and races. Josh, the main character, really discovers what kind of person he is when he has to start his life over in a different part of the country. He relies on his basketball skils to forge new friendships and self-confidence. I would recommend this book for any parent of pre-teen or teenagers or educators as a read aloud. This book will draw and keep the listener or reader's attention throughout the story. An Excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult book to read","review":"Needed for my daughter's college class. Bought here used and saved a lot of money, so that was great.

It's a good read, but doesn't get me excited about a prayer room.I don't think that we need a prayer room to meet God and that many people, after reading this book, feel that a prayer room is the ony true way to find the essence of God. It is not.I am a Christian, but am not moved by this book as other people are. I didn't cry, I just read and even got a little bored in some chapters.Kudos to those who love this book.

I would definitely purchase books from this seller in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay down!!","review":"I bought this to replace our aging toaster that was fine except too small for things like bagels and could only toast 2 slices at a time. I figured this looked like a good deal and I trusted the cuisinart brand name. From the first time we used it the toaster activation slide wouldn't stay down. We would have to push it down 3-4 times at least before it would stay down. Many times it wouldn't even work so we would give up. I ended up having to take the toaster apart myself and sand the carbon buildup off of the contacts so it would work at all! When the toaster was gracious enough to work it would generally burn one side of the toast and undercook the other. This is a prime example of trying to make something simple too complicated and then not being able to perform the function it was designed for in the first place. I guess I've learned that I don't care how many microchips and settings my toaster has if it won't even stay down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is not your momma's toaster....","review":"I got this when it was $10.99 and did not expect all of the features that it has.

Great for differant size breads and frozen breakfast items such as waffles and pancakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you be any slower?","review":"I've had this model (purchased new) for around 3 years and have hated it!!!

How difficult would it have been for them to clean the damn thing before shipping? I plugged it in and immediately realized it was broken before it was even shipped. The plunger handle used to lower toast would not stay down, and it made this constant clicking sound when held and the lights kept flashing on it. I put bread in it and tried it again. Still the same thing. So I printed out a UPS label and I am returning this piece of [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, and perhaps great would better describe it","review":"The reviews here were so mixed, that it was with some trepidation that I ordered this toaster. I found that it makes excellent toast, considering that only three of the four elements heat up reliably. Sometimes all four, but I can't count on it. It arrived very clean, looks nice, and I still consider it a good deal for the price.July 2007: At some point it started working reliably and has made consistently excellent toast using bread or bagels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Customer Service & Warranty","review":"Well, my toaster was defective.Since it was still under warranty, i called their customer service at 1-800-726-0190After 30 minutes of holding,A CSR picked up the phone and say \\"We are very busy, can I put you on hold?\\"I replied, \\"I've already beeen on hold for 30 minutes\\".She replied \\"Well, there are many people ahead of you, I have to put you on hold.\\"It's not like I have a choice, so I said fine.Then I hold another 30 minutes, then I finally get to talk to another CSR about my problem.After speaking to them, I realize the warranty did not cover shipping, not even one way. They want me to send the defective item back at my cost PLUS a $10 check to cover the shipping for them to ship it back to me. Hmmm, I bought this toaster for $20, and why would I want to spend $20 on shipping?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I bought this toaster after Consumer Reports rated it a \\"Best Buy.\\" At about $60, it was the most expensive I'd ever purchased, but I thought it should probably be worth it with all its features. What a huge disappointment! The selection buttons seem to be for decorative purpose only. Choose defrost - full power. Choose bagel - full power on both sides (I called Cusinart support and the rep checked with his supervisor and came back to tell me that \\"yeah, the bagel feature doesn't really change anything.\\" Add to this that it was the slowest toaster I'd ever had and I realized I'd made a bad buy.I gave the toaster to a charity (should I be embarrassed?) and bought one from Black & Decker for half the price. The B&D; toaster does everything that the Cuisinart doesn't - and much more quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cusinart toaster","review":"Toaster would not even turn on.

A real time saver in our family as we were still using (and still are as fate would have it) a two slice toaster. So on the day it arrived, I cheered! excitedly unwrapped the package, set up the new \\"super\\" toaster and popped in my first 4 pieces of bread! My husband, the humorist, walks by as I proudly reached in to pull out the toast and asked, \\"Did you pay extra to have it only toast on 3 of 4 sides?\\" What a disappointment......I guess we will stick with the two slice reliable $9.95 toaster in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster Has Uneven Performance","review":"I bought the new version of this toaster about six months ago and I have been disappointed in its performance. The toaster gives very uneven results, often almost burning one side of a slice of bread while leaving the other side barely toasted. The adjustments to allow different settings do not seem to correspond to the results -- the toaster continues to almost burn one side of the bread even at lower settings. One advantage of this toaster is that there is enough space for larger items such as bagels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I hit the one click button before reading the reviews and thought OH NO! Then I decided to give it a try. I purchased a reconditioned Kitchenaide stand mixer and have been happy with it for 12 years. I believe with reconditioned items they are gone over by an actual technician and not just kicked off a production line and you have a good chance of getting a high quality product. Well, I immediately went out and bought, bread, bagels, and muffins to try in my new toaster. I am extremely impressed with ALL the results as is my husband. The only thing I haven't tried is the defrost feature. I am very happy with this product. Maybe I got the other reviewers reconditioned unit. Works for me :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Price Low Performance","review":"Toasts bottom of slice - top remains pale. Returned it and received another.

It had not been reconditioned, and 1/2 of the burners did not work. Hence, it made 1/2 toast, which is not even 1/2 good. I resent the waste of my time that this transaction created and will never, under any condition, buy another Cuisinart product, nor any other not-reconditioned item via Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart is not testing these toasters...","review":"I saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.Cuisinart is not testing these toasters. It took 10 seconds for me to see that the inner elements are not heating up. They are cleaning them, possibly changing the elements, and shipping them. My guess is that it is just cheaper not to test them. Big mistake. It's harder to win back customers than to keep them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Cuisinart cookware, but not toaster.","review":"Even though this toaster worked marginally well during its first four months of use; toasted unevenly but it did not burn, it now(in its sixth month, is now sparking and shuts off automatically).

Will not buy a toaster from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely functional but not reliable","review":"My first Cuisinart 4-slice toaster developed a dangerous problem after the 3-month warantee period: it started heating when not turned on, and made strange clicking sounds. It never had toasted very well, and only toasted lightly on the darkest setting. To their great credit, Cuisinart replaced the toaster for the shipping cost alone (although it took 3 months). The replacement toaster also toasts very lightly, very slowly, but at least it's not an immediate fire hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of reconditioned items,","review":"I returned this toaster because it was rusted, dirty, and scratched.

After I took a knife and shaved off some of the plastic, I could get the front to clip onto the back, but it's still not a very solid fit and I worry about it falling off. Meanwhile, the included screws are apparently made out of butter; using an electric screwdriver, I stripped the head of the first one so badly I had to use pliers to remove it, and then using a normal screwdriver that fit perfectly and being very careful, I was still barely able to get the other screws in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare","review":"The first thing I noticed when I received this doorbell is that it appeared to have been opened by someone before me.

A world of difference this unit makes. The unit does a great job of boosting the sound from my media player, enabling me to comfortably listen in my car without distortion or sound loss. It did take a few minutes to discover the right media player volume setting to maximize sound quality output and balance it with the car stereo's volume for meaningful volume adjustment. I only have one very minor issue with the unit. The unit is \\"On\\" whenever a stereo plug is inserted into the top \\"in\\" port, not whenever a media player is attached. As the unit sits in my car, the extra step of disconnecting the cable from both the media player and the Boostaroo is needed or else the batteries drain overnight.

I am 22 and an avid collector now. If anyone knows a good source for finding them, then let me know. The whole series is wonderful for young adults (guys and gals)and is exiciting as well as entertaining without going either the sex route or the violence/blood route.This particular book happens to be one of my favorites. Trixie, Jim, Honey, Brian, and Mart journey to the Ozark mountains to stay with the Belden's Uncle Andrew (The Happy Valley Mystery).

Great product....I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading, but could be more elaborate","review":"Mr. Bauer describes a very interesting view of the political and business environment in Latin America, during the chaotic years of the 70's and 80's. His experience with the bribery schemes and military officials turned into wanna-be executives was very typical of the region. The stories are sometimes hillarious. I was born and raised in Brazil, and I saw a lot of this happening all around me. It is still normal and acceptable to depend on connections in order to obtain (unfair) competitive advantage. That explains a lot about the struggles of LA in the last 20 years. Overall, it is a very good reading, but I was disappointed with the grammar errors in Portuguese and Spanish. A quick revision would do it. I recommend it to anyone interested on a quick lesson about LA history and the commercial airplane business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this because it was super cheap. I skimmed through it, and everything was garbage. I kept it on the coffee table for clients to flip through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I ordered this because I wasn't sure if PSP accepted normal USB cables. This thing doesn't work, and it's definitely not user error at work here, given the fact that I used a regular mini-USB cable from a camera I own with my PSP immediately afterwards, having no problems getting my PC to detect my PSP. I still couldn't do the transfer, because the Media Go software (which has no effect on this review, FYI) is freaking terrible. I'd only suggest using a cable if you're going to manually transfer content through your PC operating system's file browser. Even then, don't purchase this cable. Just use a regular mini-USB cable. You probably already have one lying around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I think this is a fabulous book. It comes with demonstration versions of 5 legal software programs including three litigation support programs, a time and billing program and a case management program. There were a number of in-depth, hands-on exercises for each program, so I really got to learn about each type of program by using it. Also, although I have used Access, Word, Excel and Powerpoint before, I liked the fact that there were in-depth exercises for learning legal applications for each of these programs. This is a very practical book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but.....","review":"I purchaed this book for a Paralegal class. I had two very bad experiences with the book. First, the first copy I received had no Appendix in it, so I had to send it back. It was unfortunate, as I needed the Appendix to do an assignment. Secondly, the software that was provided was expired when I tried to load it into my laptop to do homework. I called the publishing company and they promised to send me a new disk; two weeks later and I still have not received it.I will keep it as a reference source, but I hope that another book will be written for future students.

Well let me be the first to say that it is a total waste of the [money] I paid for it! It is filled with typos and instructional errors. Before I can learn the software it is supposed to be teaching me, I have to first decypher the directions. I may as well just wing it, the book is no help.

He assured me that there was no blood/gore in the book, and as he is a former minister, I bought the book. My son was upset to see that the characters often said \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" (two words he knows he is not allowed to use) as well as taking the Lord's name in vain, and stories set in bars. My son was uncomfortable reading the book, and refused to finish it. I am disappointed that the author felt he had to resort to this type of language in a children's book, and I will not be buying anything else by him. I guess a book written by a minister is still not a guarantee that the book is appropriate for children. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, cute and original","review":"Okay, so a book that shows the numbers one through ten is nothing to get really excited about. Still, I really loved this one.

The game itself is repetitive and boring. After 90 minutes, you will have seen all there is to see and be frustrated by the sameness of everything.

I made my connections and almost immediately, I got a hum out of my amplifiers speakers. I tried a different amp with no success. So, I put back my original cable and the hum is no longer there. This cable is horrible, however if you are into the hum scene, go ahead and purchase one. I will say this about the cable, it does look like it is solid or put together nicely. Too bad, I am getting this hum, I was looking forward to to hearing my daughter sing.I am packing this cable as I speak and will be returning it for full refund.I am a technical person, have been a systems consultant for 30 years, so I know a little about cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cable","review":"This cables has just work fine for me trough many years, Stable connections and very resistent plugs.

I don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not, or if they were and I just didn't see or pay attention to them, but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child. The necklace may be 18\\", but the pendant itself was so small, not at all what I was looking for. So i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece. What I was really wanting was a larger, heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult.

I love it. It's small, delicate, simple and pretty. I've gotten a number of compliments on it. I wear it quite a bit, and I've had it since last Christmas and have never had problems with the clasp or the chain. It seems to me to be a very sturdy chain and a good necklace. I love it, quite personally. I found the chain to be a nice length, but I can see where some might want it just a hair longer.In my opinion, this is a good buy. You are getting a beautiful little necklace for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and pretty small","review":"I am glad that I bought this for my daughter as it is quite small, smaller than I expected and the chain can be shortened to an appropriate size for her.

I think this should be listed as a young persons necklace/pendant...maybe for a petite teen or someone. I gave it 2 stars only because I think a teen would love it, and the fit would be more appropriate.

Well I do: I wish to promote the critical reading of books like this, that make grand assertions from a position of profound ignorance, with no substantive evidence to back them up.If you believe this book, you have to believe that every theoretical physicist in the world is either a dupe or complicit in a giant conspiracy. That is both insulting and ridiculous, but what can you expect from a man who thinks that iron is a product of photosynthesis?And this supposed international conspiracy hasn't managed to stop him selling details of his 'free energy' device for $10 a pop to anyone who wants it?

Up to know a little hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is opinion of the author, unconnected to Tesla","review":"I bought this book because of amazon's recommendation expecting it to be based on the work of Tesla. What you find instead is that this is a mix of the authors own theory of atomic physics (introducing a new subatomic particle called omnion at the outset) as colorful support to presumed discoveries by Tesla himself.It could be an interesting book for anyone looking for Occult/Physics but I resent the extremely thin factual connection to Tesla's work and feel the poor man is being used again by this author very much as he describes corporate interests did with Nikolai's inventions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occult Ether Physics:Tesla's Space Propulsion System","review":"This is a poorly written book about highly technical subjects. The author has a degree in Fine Arts, which doesn't qualify him to describe a highly technical subject (gravity, free energy, electromagnitism, etc). The writing style is rambling, sometimes incoherent and he uses words which aren't in the dictionery. I am unaccustomed to reading a paragraph of 8-10 lines which is only one sentence. He is discussing subjects which are related to quantum physics and similar energy fields, in which I think his research poorly defines the subject he is trying to describe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Physics Book I Ever Read!","review":"Occult Ether Physics is the best physics book I have ever read. The author explains the original ether theories that originated in the 1880s very clearly. And the author explains how manipulating the ether could be used to propel a spaceship. This book is a paradyne shift back to the way scientists used to think about physics before relativity came along. I think all physics students should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used mine in my bathroom","review":"I think I originally bought mine at K-Mart more than 8 years ago.

Every time i increase the magnification its hitting all over the place. I went through almost 2 boxes of ammo just to prove to myself that this scope cannot hold zero when you increase the magnification. I don't really care about the red/green dot.

The Phenolic was very easy to work with, I used a jigsaw to make a rough outline of the throat plate and then a trim router to have it fit precisely.

Like The Book of the Dun Cow, The Book of Sorrows has the flavor of a fairytale or fable, with the intensity of a Shakespearean tragedy. The rooster Chantecleer and his hens have survived an epic battle against Wyrm, the personification of evil, and now they are facing the aftereffects of the battle and the deaths that bought their victory.Much grimmer than The Book of the Dun Cow, this story deals in guilt, grief, loss and destructive pride & isolation. It made me weep. I would not recommend it to a child. But for an adult, it's absolutely worth following up on The Book of the Dun Cow with this powerful story, which ultimately makes a case for the triumph of good through the redemptive power of repentance and forgiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A painful, yet hauntingly beautiful, tale","review":"I've read the prequel - the Book of the Dun Cow - over a dozen times.I have only been able to read the Book of Sorrows twice in the past 15 years. It is a gut-wrenching tale, all the more so because the author is so eloquent in his prose that I feel I know the various characters personally (that they are animals is irrelevant) and the pain they feel and the sorrows they endure hit me at a deep level.I'm a guy, and very few things would make me cry (such as the loss of a loved one). This book did.I'm steeling myself up to read it again this year, and then it will find its way back onto my bookshelf for another 5-10 years before I have the strength to get through it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR CHILDREN","review":"Not for children, not for the weak hearted, not for the empathetic. This book pulls no punches and is more full of hurt and gut-wrenching violence than many others known for gratuitous violence.It certainly is moving and leaves a lasting impression - I wish I hadn't read it because I can never erase the terrible images from my mind. I didn't find it uplifting, only disturbing, and I wish I had had someone to warn me before reading it.Sorry but I'm giving it only 2 stars because, while the author's writing is superb, the rating should reflect that the content is not appropriate for everyone.I strongly recommend reading the author's *wonderful* book, The Book of the Dun Cow, one of the best and most uplifting I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Drawer Pinball!","review":"I'm no expert, but I've bought most of the available pinball games and Avery Cardoza's Slam-Tilt Pinball is definitely in the top ranks!

Big mistake, it is nothing like the discontinued Redenbacher kind. There is not even a good cheese flavor, it's just horrible. The bad thing is when you buy this you get 36 bags of popcorn, so if you don't like it you're stuck with a ton of bags.If you really want to try this stuff, I would suggest buying a small box from a grocery store to try it first, and then if you like it, come back on here and buy this lot of 36 bags.I give this popcorn 2 stars out of 5 since it's at least edible.....barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy about being 'the odd man out' but......this IS terrible!!","review":"This has got to be the LEAST cheesey flavored popcorn we've ever tasted.

Instead of the usual extreme treble increase, Jazz has had a major cut, leaving it dull and lifeless and with no high end to speak of. The gold standard here is the Mobile Fidelity LP, which IS a little warmer and smoother than the domestic CD, but the vinyl is still very clear and detailed.

I like the retro look very much and find it to be an asset to the appearance of my kitchen. As far as toasting performance, I have only positive things to say. My bagels come out evenly toasted every time. The cancel button works well if you think your breads are getting overdone. I've never had anything spring out with such force that it landed on a counter or floor but my breads may be weightier than your average store bought bread.I am surprised to read some of the less than satisfactory reviews but perhaps it is the luck of the draw.

The Cancel button elegantly ends the toasting without shooting the bread across the room. The Reheat button prevents hot-but-extra-crispy syndrome. There is also a Defrost button that I have never used. The Dark/Light settings (from 1-6) appear to run pretty dark. My setting of choice is between 2 and 3 for an allover medium tan.

You get the same slots over and over at a different play scale ( $1.00,$5.00,.25, .10, $1000), but the play scale does not influence the pay rate. You can play for hours and never get a win over 50 coins. Hours is an exageration because you run out of money (can borrow up to $4,000 at any one sitting)quickley no matter what denomination you use, .10, $1.00 it doesn't matter. Playing the max amount ( what else would you do)with returns of 2 for 3 or 3 for 5 is a bummer. I would not even try to re-sell my disk to an unsuspecting buyer it is so bad.

I don't do as well with the slots but never did in Vegas either. I wish I could parlay my bankroll into real cash! There do seem to be some defects within the game program itself. For example, one night, whenever I got a full house, the game only recognized three of a kind. That only happened once though. Another time, the \\"expert\\" gave the same advice all evening as if he were on automatic pilot.
