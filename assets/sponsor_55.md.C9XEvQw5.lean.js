The trouble with this album is that it's so different from the previous one. It's like we're in an alternate dimension and SBL is the same in name only. If you liked the debut album, and don't like disco/70s-funk style music, then don't buy this album. The melodies are forgettable, generic and derivative. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"run of the vanilla mill","review":"I loved the first album, and was expecting big things from their sophomore effort. SBL did not deliver. This sounds like every other neo-lounge release out there, and I just hated the James Bond vibe. Go buy Shirley Bassey stuff for that; at least she's the original. There is nothing inspired, unique or original about this album (again, unlike their first release). Whatever influence the departed members of the band had, SBL needs that back, and badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first album","review":"If you liked the first album, don't buy this one.The first album was really lounge-like--cool and laid back just like the picture on the cover of the album.This album has a horrible cover that reminds me of an adult contemporary album from the early 90s.

This band was so good, and now...they leave much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never the same band twice....","review":"I wrote a longer review but I guess \\"they\\" don't want to post it.

You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere nearly as good as the debut...","review":"They lost that edgy, modern sound in exchange for a more disco/funk theme. The debut was a lot more...innovative? The only standout tracks on this CD are \\"So Much More\\" (has that awesome trip-hop beat to it, sorta like some of the works from Lamb), and maybe \\"Rock And A Hard Place\\". The others are okay, these must be tracks that take a long time to get used to. If you wanna check them out and have neither album, definitely check out their 2000 self-titled debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I love the first CD. I was really excited when I saw a new CD in the store. There was no listening booth like with the first CD so I bought it without hearing anything. Sorry to say it was not what I was hoping for. I'm not sure why but the songs all feel the same. Something about the tempos maybe. Some, ok most, of the lyrics are really silly too. The music is not as layered or exciting as the first CD. There are brief moments of \\"this might be cool\\" but it losses it either by awkward vocals or the music not moving on to something bigger. I would call this CD a well produced Demo. A test of \\"new\\" style. But do people really want to hear disco re-done? Or Trip-Hop held back? Not those that know what this band was capable of giving us. Maybe the next CD will show us better where this band is going. Until then I'm only a fan of disc #1.Just because I have to...personally everytime I hear \\"freezer\\" I crack up.

I got itimported from Los Angeles in May 2005 and to tell u the truth THIS ALBUM IS DA BOMB!!!!!!!!! This album has got a very seductive, tantalising, sway of unique beats. I have this album and also the Self titled album. I am really impressed how both albums compliment each-other with beautiful bass lines, SLINKY and twisted flavours to it as-well. My favourite song of all on Divine Operating System is ''TOUCH ME''. I love the female vocalist in this song because she adds carisma to this song by her voice. This song also has a very cabaret, slinky house,strutty, bar culture to it.I personally recommend this Album to any person who is in to Deep House, Lounge and Bar Cultured-type music.I am a fan of this artist all the way from Surfers Paradise, on the Gold Coast, In Australia.

It's interesting and different and adds some pizzazz to a desktop. It stands up so you can staple by holding it in the grip of your hand. Or it lies down so you can use it in the same way you use a conventional stapler. It takes standard size staples. It's got gray rubber gripping surfaces on both sides. Using it as a one-hander to to do some serious repetitive squeeze-stapling can strengthen your hand (or leave it aching if you do too much too soon). I can tell pretty much by looking at it that it'll likely hold up a whole lot longer than that cute little pink and orange Swingline Tot Stapler I bought recently that called it quits after only about 30 days, but left me with a good stash of leftover bright green staples that work just fine in this one.

It had issues the first time I had to replace the staples, but we got that sorted. Both staplers have gotten jammed and had to be fiddled around with to be fixed. One of them we decided not to waste our time fixing anymore so I'm going to buy another- a different one. The other one doesn't have much life left (it's been 4 1/2 months for both).

Some interesting insights, but not many, unless your interested in researching Assyrian theology or other obscure quests for clues. This is a good book if you have nothing else to do with your life but contemplate JKR's use of words or the frequency of various types of words. I did read some of it, but most of it was worthless since I don't have the time to read thier list of 40 or 50 novels inorder to find the clues to thier hints of clues.

As it was, the hints were too vague and arch (as in mischievous, saucy) for the non- philologists.

Speaking of the boards, here's a link that will take you to a discussion of Galadriel and WWF on The Sugar Quill.Galadiel Waters and her team have spent a great deal of time on this quest, but IMHO, the WWF books are for the Hermoines of the world who solve every problem by going to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the wait worth it","review":"This book is fantastic. This book came out 3 months after OotP as a clues only guide and right away it challenged the Harry Potter lover in me. No matter if the clues are right or wrong, I can spend hours debating them with my family, making it a FANTASTIC book to read with everyone. Its even helped my turn some of my more skeptical friends into sleuths! I recommend this book for all ages and fan levels.

What really gets me is that people like you people who go out and buy this book and give this woman more power to do these books.

Some of the author's theories are really far-fetched and I could see no connection between some of the clues and why it was so important. For an example, why is it so important that the readers remember Dudley's best friend's name (Polkiss and Piers)? What does that have to do with clues to reveal book 6? Also the author really emphasizes that Neville has had a memory charm oh him! The exapmle they used did not make sense in my head and I saw no connection to it pointing to Neville's memory being modified.

The information was general and filled with cute bits of information. The book has a funny way of its paper. Its frilled at the ends. I do not know why they did this. I was hoping for more information and more substantional information to read. Overall, I felt that this was a good book with limited information. I thought that the analysis on book 1-4 was much better and filled with more data. The price is not worth the book. I did like the cut out tab of the last page.

But unfortunately I was quite wrong in my hopes that it would be good. Most of the hints and clues given requires us to do our research to what things mean using other books and references. This book is in a different format than the first as well, it doesn't have little sections reviewing what just happened in the book, and it jumps ahead pointing out things that happen 20 chapters down the road... All of the hints and clues are just very vague, leaving the reader needing to buy the all of the books that are listed as references or be left in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless waste of pulp","review":"This book does nothing but pose a lot of questions (many of which are obvious) and suggest a lot of far-fetched theories. The book is a model of disorganization. The author states that she has written the book as a \\"hints only\\" guide to allow you to have fun figuring things out on your own. Well, do you really need a guide to do that? Doesn't that suggest that either this is a lazy attempt to capitalize on Rowling's success or that the author has no answers (or correct ones anyway)?

I had high expectations when I ordered this however, after hearing them, I am quite disappointed. I find the concertos not too interesting and the violinist lacks finesse and polish. The violinist, Mauro Rossi tends to egg-shape many of the notes which is very distracting and this disturbs the musical line. Not being able to hear snippets before buying this CD, I thought the last concerto (A Major) was the very same concerto I have with Herman Krebbers playing however to my disappointment, it is a different concerto altogether. By the way, Mr. Krebbers plays much, much better. I think I'll squirrel this one away in a cabinet and forget about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if you understand the basics","review":"This book would be great if you have no knowledge at all to with regards to anything dealing with research papers.

The way it begins makes you feel like you've missed an hour. We're basically plunged into it. The story and character's were not fleshed out at all. I felt no connection with them or what was happening in their lives. I felt nothing for them at all. Well except for Anne. The character of Anne was very unlikable. She came across as very arrogant, cynical and forceful. I couldn't understand where she was coming from. She was a real turn off.

It also comes with a nice hard case.Unfortunately, the dust collection system is completely sub-standard. It's impossible to keep it firmly attached to a shop-vac. Amazingly, it doesn't even work well with a PORTER CABLE shop-vac. Additionally, unless you hold it on with your hand, the dust canister continually rattles off during use.

You would hope that the plot could save this book, but even the plot is amazingly dull - Dinah is suffering from PTSD and needs help getting over it.

On the HD channels, the picture is simply wonderful. This set also has some really nice features, like DVI high definition terminal connection, subwoofer output, and the ability to use the tv's own speakers (which are good) as the center channel.

Each week Philips tells me the part will arrive next week (well, there was one time that the part was arriving that day, but then the next day it wasn't there, so it would be another week).So Philips somehow keeps manufacturing and selling this model, but they don't have the part to fix my defective set--after almost four months.

It was worth the wait. My dog thinks this is a treat and she eats her daily pill without a problem. With my cats I have to use deception by smashing the pill into powder and putting it in wet food. So far I have noticed the dog and the cat that did eat it are not scratching like they did. The cat that refuses to eat it, is still scratching. He must not like the taste of liver.

This looked like a pretty interesting one; I mean how cool is it to re-imagine all of the Marvel characters in 1602? Overall it was entertaining. The story was excellent and the drawings fantastic. I am a new-comer to the Marvel universe and as such I think I missed some things that a more comic knowledgeable person would have grasped. At times I also thought the story line jumped around a bit too much.Overall though I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this is you are a Gaiman fan or a Marvel universe fan. Some of the ways Gaiman adapted the Marvel heroes to the 1602 time-frame were very interesting and creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing re-telling of Marvel Heroes","review":"I bought this graphic novel because of Neil Gaiman. He never fails to amaze me with his stories - I have read most of his work (SANDMAN, his Novels...). This has to be one of the most inventive work ever done on Marvel superheroes. There are certain parts in the story that you are just cringing to find out what's next? When do we see their powers? Very very good. Art here is nothing short of amazing. The covers were done to look like wood panels - again very novel.I recommend this wholeheartedly! Brings back the good ol superhero days..:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"As a first time reader, I found the artwork to be spectacular. The story was very interesting but difficult to follow. I had to keep flipping back to remind myself of characters and story line. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and entertaining","review":"A neat idea, placing familiar Marvel superhero characters in Elizabethan England. It was definitely fun to see how such figures as Dr. Strange, Nick Fury, Daredevil, and the core X-Men could fit into that world. Neil Gaiman does some very nice imagining (sorry... but I can't really call authoring a comic book, which lacks descriptive prose and has rather truncated dialog, \\"writing\\") of characters and setting. The artwork is superb as well.I have to say, though, the conclusion of the story was a bit of a muddle. Gaiman places these fictional characters in a fictionalized past, then feels like he has to come up with a pseudo-cosmological reason to explain how they got there. Seems silly and distracting. Seeing Daredevil backflip over thatched London rooftops or the X-men being imprisoned as \\"witchbreed\\" by the Inquisition is reason enough for this comic to exist. It doesn't need to make any more \\"sense\\" than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"extra-ordinary","review":"I bought the comic book issues and was amazed how the story was well written by Neil Gaiman, even though I was never a fan of his work. What I find it interesting is how the Marvel characters intertwine in the past circa Victorian era. The art was simply superb done by Adam Kubert of (origin and X-men) fame. If you are a comic book lover or a Neil Gaiman fun then this book is a must have, however if you just want to buy something super-hero especially geared towards children then I suggest you look at the X-Men or Spider-Man section since this is much more applicable to mature audiences with its thematic approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for Marvel Fans!","review":"I just finished this work and absolutely loved it. Admittedly it has a somewhat limited audience, since the story won't make much sense to those unfamiliar with the Marvel universe; however, if you are at all familiar with X-Men, F4, Nick Fury, etc. then you absolutely have to read this book. The art, graphical style and dialogue are great. What impressed me was the strong historical reference and how this book is more of a \\"what if\\" on King James and America's colonization. After reading this I suggest going to www.wikipedia.com and reading the article about Marvel 1602 if you don't get all the history. I also love Neil Gaimen's ode to the Watchmen (argueable the best comic book ever) in that there are no Silver Age comic goofiness, even if that's the basis for the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Gaiman's MARVELous history lesson","review":"1602 is a great history lesson combined with an elsewhere kind of/What if tale of Marvel Universe. In the hands of DC Comics Sandman's creator Neil Gaiman, this superheroes version of the history in the time of Elizabeth is a (dare i use the pun) real MARVEL. 1602 is both memoriable and an amazing piece of graphic literary work. And the art matches the words in scope of the text, without taking away from Gaiman's interweaving sub plots.Most of the marvel heroes are here in names similar to their current incarnations. Matt Murdock is still blinde, Nick Fury and Dr Strange are still at odds with each other. Peter Parker is still a younger man learning what powers he has. Wolverine is her in all his spendor too.Under Gaiman hand, this graphic tale is well done. It is what a graphic novel should be!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining comic book","review":"Drawn to this comic by my love of history and a good story, I walked away content with my experience. Gaiman uses the characters of the Marvel universe in unique and interesting ways and it is apparent that he knows the time period well, as he is able to bring true historical facts into the piece. The art is fantastic and this is a very approachable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read!","review":"I spent a nice late summer afternoon reading this and think is was very well spent.

How important is it to read several times about his fear of becoming like his mentally ill sister? Quite. Now how important is it to hear that he wrote home for money at least thirty times during the course of this book? Wouldn't it make more sense to have said that throughout his lean years, there were constant pleas for funds from his mother and grandparents, than to go into detail about each one?A good editor was sorely in need.On a positive note, Leverich treated Williams with respect, but never let his admiration minimize his shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulsating rhythms....","review":"This is yet another gem, by Lost Witness..their previous single\\"Red Sun Rising\\"...by far the best, and which was released in the UK and Australia only.

Buck Dich and all. A rammstein live show is a theatrical experience, made more so by the fact that they don't really pause between songs, there's no political diatribe or \\"Hello Berlin Are you ready to rock\\" crap. They come out, assume their characters and play. Buck Dich is one of the most fascinating parts of the show, and it must be experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIVE AUS BERLIN: GOOD CONCERT BUT BAD SPECIAL STUFF","review":"I love Rammstein, but I think they should have hired a professional to their DVD:The Multi-angles on certain songs(Du Hast, Rammstein und Tier) are nice but please no slow-mo shots of the action, it detracts from the action, also no POV(point of View) angles of Flake(synth) or The Drums, maybe we want to see how that's played also no constant close ups of the guitar work either. Nice to put interviews & other things though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some corrections to make.","review":"The above review by Sam Sutherland compares Rammstein more to a grim sort of band than it should be thought as.

Portofino is about a religious family and their summer vacations in Italy.

Calvin, a young boy, just wants to go out and hang with his vacation-time girlfriend. His family often embarasses him with their \\"wittnessing\\" and long mealtime prayers. Calvin hangs with an Italian family and is friends with a local Gay artist who gets the young boy drunk. I couldn't stand his sisters, but they were perfect members for the family the author has designed for us. An interesting twist is thrown in having to do with his Mother! You'll be surprised!

Calvin spends a lot of his time trying to gauge Dad's moods. Calvin is left to ramble on his own a lot of the time, and in his explorations comes to discover the pleasures of alcohol and women. Watching as he tries to permit himself to enjoy the world without outright lying to his parents is hilarious and very touching.

The proper affect was difficult to execute using an ordinary flashlight. The direct beam of a flashlight washes out the images. A more diffused light source is needed. The only solution I could find was to use a box with a cutout window and a light mounted inside not directly in line with the window. Using the indirect light source allowed a more diffused light which was able to create the shadow affect.

What a massive letdown Omnifix proved to be after the other books. Hamilton and Morgan know how to deliver interesting characterizations, page-turning plots, and are conversant in the fields of science germane to their respective novels.Omnifix's characterizations are juvenile, and calling major stretches of prose \\"stilted\\" is an understatement. Adding insult to injury, the plot is at best snore-inducing; at worst, outright silly.This book needed an editor in the worst way.Placed roughly 400 years in the future, the technology descriptions made it obvious that the author is woefully lacking in the science background necessary to make a hard science fiction story believable. The explanations given for the \\"nanogens\\" at the heart of this story are laughable.My advice: look elsewhere for reading enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are all too forgiving","review":"I blame the editor/publisher for this book. It either should be marketed as a 'young adult' book or it should go back for a massive rewrite.

People start to respect him at a military ceremony that honors him for his bravery.It's really cool that he can adjust his eyesight and hearing to extreme levels.

You feel like you're one of Ryan's followers through the airport. I liked this book. I liked its weirdness and what flying around the country all the time can do to a person. Up in the air is a reminder of life before 9-11. When [...] aol dial up internet accounts, netscape, the NASDAQ at 5000 mark, and millions of consultants was important. It is almost a forewarning of the current state of society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Short Story","review":"Funny premise, and a frequent business traveller will want to read the first 50-60 pages.

It's almost always the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penance for a steady diet of airport pulp fiction","review":"Like many business travelor reviewers, I connected with Kirn's \\"Airworld.\\" I too have moved anonymously through its corridors, a smeared reflection in a universe of frequent flier clubs, play-acting flight attendants and half-watched waiting area televisions. Travelling, I read what comes first to hand -- usually the latest pulp from a journeyman pulpist. Recently I redeemd myself by consuming \\"Up In The Air\\" on a single cross-country jag. It is an even, sad book that puts up a cracked facade of humor. It takes a less ambitious walk down the same path as Donleavy's \\"Ginger Man.\\" Do you have an enduring suspicion that something is fundamentally wrong? Generally speaking, I mean?

An eighth shows a trail of smoke behind him and has crashed and is burning. Right under this figure on the cover is the name Walter Kirn. He is the author of this mess and all I can say that from the cover itself, the reader is fairly warned. Christopher Buckley, who may be singularly responsible for the early success of this book by writing the feature review for the NY Times Book Review a few weeks ago, must have been suffering from some bad gin when he favorably reviewed this. Then perhaps, I am not avant guarde enough to appreciate it, but I found it a monumental waste of time and money.

It is very boring, very tedious; just a chore to read even 10 pages at a time. \\"MythTech\\" is the only interesting idea in the book, and it is not explored until about 80% of the way through. Seriously, this book is in my top 3 of worst books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw Up in the Air","review":"As a consultant who has traveled weekly for the past 6 years, I was looking forward to this book. Wow, was I dissapointed. Mr. Kim rambled and wandered as few writers can. The plot (if there was one) was painful and the character development was poor. I really didn't care about one singel character in the story. It wasn't surreal, it was just bad. What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a good plot.","review":"This book started out with promise. It's supposed to be about a guy who is obsessed with getting 1,000,000 frequent flyer miles. Unfortunately there also seems to be a hidden agenda. Well, by chapter 2 it wasn't so hidden. I couldn't understand how Mormon-bashing had ANYTHING to do with the plot. I thought, \\"Well, maybe it will get better.\\" To give Kirn credit, the concept of the book is very interesting. But when I reached chapter 4 and the Mormons had been ripped on for the fifth time, I put the book away. All the time I kept thinking: WHY? What does it have to do with ANYTHING?Anyway, I won't be finishing this book, as I have no reason to believe that the gratuitious jabs at Mormonism will stop. What a pity, because I was really quite interested in the plot. Fortunately, I had already skipped ahead and read the last chapter, so I know how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Horrible Book","review":"As a frequent business traveler, I loved the film Up In The Air. When I saw that it was based on a novel of the same name, I picked up the volume eagerly and read it. Very rarely is a movie better than the book, but that is the case here. Do not bother. The names are the same, and the protagonist of the book flies for his job, but that is where the similarities end. The novel is basically a week in the life of a self-absorbed business traveler obsessed with gaining one million frequent flier miles. There is no wedding, no tag-along business trainee, and barely any Alex. The screenwriters for the movie did not adapt their screenplay - they rewrote it, to much better effect. I am amazed that this novel was even published, and it is a crime that it is again seeing the light of day due to the excellent film. Do yourself a favor and give this garbage a pass. There are many, many books out there that are a much better way to invest your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A post-modern turkey","review":"I bought this book, fortunately in a used bookstore and as a paperback, because I was so impressed with the movie. Well, the book is nothing like the movie. Maybe Kirn's writing style may work for a short-story in a magazine like \\"The New Yorker,\\" but I found his too-clever observations and mental twists and turns, unsuspenseful plot, ambiguous characters, and forced dialogue to be tiring after reading more than a chapter or two at a sitting. Save your time and money and avoid this crappy post-modern imitation of a real novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie, don't read the book!","review":"I am the type of person to watch a movie and then read the novel because I tend to find I don't get disappointed that way since books are always more descriptive. I hands down loved the movie Up in the Air. I thought it was witty, comical, and refreshing since these days all movies seem predictable. I expected all of the above and more from the book, and sadly didn't get it. The book really isn't about anything from the movie at all. The relationship between Alex and Ryan is non existant and his loveable business partner from the movie? No where to be found here. The book was all talk of business and less talk of \\"air world\\". I say don't waste your time, because the movie is truly the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the reviews on this one BEFORE buying it.","review":"As a former road warrior myself, who loves hotels, airports and the perks of airline rewards programs I love the general concept of this book - a man in pursuit of hitting the one million mile rewards mark. But, beyond that, this book just doesn't deliver.There's no real story behind it, just a man meandering around trying to overcome the guilt of his job helping fire people and trying to figure out how to do something else. It's written in a scattered way that's hard to follow, and even harder to care about the unsympathetic characters.I have to agree with all the other reviewers that say the movie was far better. In fact, other than the general concept the book and movie have very little in common. Normally, one would expect this to be a good thing. There's so many more opportunities with a novel to build a richer, more complex tale. But, it just doesn't happen in this case.BOTTOM LINE: Skip the book and rent the DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart midway through","review":"Like many others, I saw the movie first and bought the book because I enjoyed the movie. I think the plot in the movie is much stronger, in part because because of when it was released; it more accurately reflects the sad reality of today's business climate and post 9/11 air travel. Both offer a cynical look at that business climate, but movie does it better. The secondary characters particularly Alex, are more vividly portrayed in the movie.The book starts off fairly well, but starts to fall apart midway through, and by the end, it's a confusing and uninteresting mess. The characters have become caricatures. The finale is particularly disappointing. I don't mind an unresolved ending (such as in the movie version of Sideways), but here, too much is unresolved, nor is it believable. Not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-sense, would give it zero stars !! Don't read it !!","review":"Unfortunately I got this garbage book because of the movie version of it, but hated it. The book is totally, utterly nonsense and it got me thinking \\"why did I do to deserve such piece of trash in my hands?\\". I'd give it up were not for my obsession with books, even bad books I usually read till the end, otherwise I feel like I have not completed a journey (good or bad). Anyway, I hated the main character, hated his way, his behaviour, his thoughts, his stupid attitude towards sex and relationships. I hated having read this book. I don't understand how this stupid book turned out to be a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having read the book I still have no idea what it is about. I await the movie to explain it to me.","review":"Why I read ItI heard a segment on NPR about the Toronto Film Festival in which they praised the new George Clooney movie based on this book. I always like to read books being made into movies so I picked this up.The GoodThe character was engaging and I like the idea of following a person who is a consistent air traveler.The BadThe plot was all over the place, and only took shallow dips in each location.The Ugly (my opinion)Having read the book I still have no idea what it is about.

If Clooney acted in the movie as Ryan did in the book, the movie should have been a disaster. Get the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR disappointment","review":"As a frequent business traveller, I was excited about this book after reading the strong review in the NY Times. What a great premise! What a terible book! The characters were completely one-dimensional and the \\"insights\\" into corporate America were trite at best.Like a couple of the other reviewers, I considered putting this book down, but kept plugging away to see what would happen.

Unfortunately, my compulsion was not based on a positive experience. Rather, it was in the hopes that I could spare other readers from the agonizing and utterly disappointing experience or reading this book.Until the Academy Awards, I didn't realize the movie was based on a book. As the books are almost always better then the movie, I eagerly ordered Up In The Air and started reading immediately wanting to finish it before I saw it on the big screen. I have to say, this book was ENTIRELY disappointing and I can only hope the movie is better. The plot was all over the place and indulgent. The characters were poorly developed and self-centered. I am not sure what the author has against the Mormon faith, but his comments were degrading and completely unnecessary. My recommendation: don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon should create a Zero Star category for this book","review":"This book IS as bad as the 1-star reviewers describe it.

No story after the first quarter or so of the book, and I didn't give a fig about Bingham's character or anyone else in the book. All directionless and idle dialogue and monologue that added nothing, not furthering the story, characters or their relationships.As an avid reader, I have seldom *not* finished a book, but unfortunately Up In the Air will join the small handful of books on my \\"worst ever\\" list that I will never finish.

This game is one of the best ever with the Legacy of the Jedi MOD (Spork 1.2) and some of the gun packs available. I definetely reccomend it and it is an awesome game to play on the Microsoft Gaming Zone. There are many available extra levels and it was pure genius of Lucas Arts to allow this game to be easily hackable, since there is always a new program, MOD, or level available that will make the game new again!

The levels are designed very well and never seem to \\"feel\\" the same way twice.Of course one of the best parts of this game is using the lightsaber in regular gameplay or against six Dark Jedi. No other Star Wars game has been able to capture the feel of the lightsaber like this one.The sound effects are very good and the soundtrack is classic Star Wars with perfect timings to get the right music for what you are doing.I can't think of anything more to say than, if you haven't already played this game, you are missing out on one of the greatest games of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but the levels stink.And the weapons are very bad.","review":"I love the star wars games from x-wing to the phantom menace. I have them all. But there is one game that is not worth it,and that is jedi knight dark forces 2. The story is not exciting. (But it would make a good movie) This game should have been a movie. Not a game. The weapons are very bad. Very bad detailed weapons, bombs,explosions. The explosions suck! Very Very bad! Mysteries of the sith should have been the first part of the game, and jedi knight should have been the add-on. And multiplayer is ok not very good. This is what I don't like in multiplayer. Some players join and mess up the fun in it. Lucas arts allows hacks in games (or cogs) which is bad. The skins are not good and detailed. And thats what I think about this game.

After the initial tragedy and subsequent move, readers over the age of 16 may begin to find it a bit dry. It is obvious that the author took great care in detailing the events of the 9/11 tragedy as it changed the life of a young girl. The life journey that ensues due the event evokes many different feelings within this young victim.

Here you will find some string backings which don't add much, and some 1970s-style studio drumming licks, which take a little away from the mood.

It is well known that dim sum chefs will not truly tell all the methods/secrets of making the items and this is true with this book. I have a culinary background and my grandmother knows how to make some of these dishes. It seems as if the author purposely left out the correct ingredients or had incorrect measurements.

There's just no spark here, not much that's original or interesting. The prose is dull, and the characters are unimaginatively drawn. For example, the African American judge, and D.A. J.Stanley Edgerton's relationship with the judge, are very similar to what we saw in Grisham's \\"The Client,\\" especially the Susan Sarandon movie version; and of course Grisham does it way better. The plot (father kills his young son's murderer) is transparently similar to an actual case where a father killed his daughter's rapist, a case that has been on TV shows like American Justice many times. The subplots, too, were trite and did not compel me to keep reading.

Not only did it tell me a fascinating story about a man whose life span the century, but it moved me deeply. It's not a funny book, but it is a riveting one. Rather than pretending to know it all, the author takes her reader on an investigative journey: Who was the true Bettelheim?

This man did a great deal of harm to the students attending this school and was not the savior which Ms. Sutten would like him to be potrayed as. His methods of treatment can be compared with how the German Nazis treated their concentration camp victims. He did beat the students a great deal and fear was a common, shared, feeling which most of the kids felt towards him. His use of imtimadation towards the children, as well as the staff, was complete. Since Ms. Sutton was not a student at the Orthogenic School, of course she would not know the things that went on there.

White insists that whether Tantric practitioners themselves accept his characterization of their tradition does not matter, and he is right in taking metaphors to be the literal truth when he chooses.

Elle stays stupid throughout the book, not passing law school because she buckles down (as in the movie) but because someone else is feeding her the answers. Most of what made the movie good wasn't even in the book - I'm guessing the producers saw what could be a good idea - a girl follows her boyfriend to law school - and really improved on it.

It's horrible that Intuit has done this to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Version of Quicken Yet!","review":"This software has gone from great in the 90's to terrible for the past few years. In 2004, there are NO OPTIONS for register colors - just all white. There are NO program color schemes. There is advertising at bottom that cannot be removed. While using splits, the error of not being able to open the category list, that appeared in the 2003 version, has not been fixed in 2004! BEWARE - files updated to 2003 or 2004 versions will not work on older, MUCH BETTER versions. You will be stuck with having to use the worst versions yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very poor quality product","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. I had been a quicken user for a long time. Since I upgraded, I have had nothing but problems! Their program is buggy as heck and they make you pay for their garbage. I am looking into alternative programs as we speak. Do not waste your money on this product. The $24 some odd you may pay for the product is nothing compared to the technical support you will be paying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intuit has lost the recipe","review":"As a devoted Quicken user since 1995, I was just a little annoyed when Intuit told me they would cut off my online access for Quicken 2000. I bought 2004 Basic thinking I might at least get some improvements. After using 2004 for a short time, I was shocked at both the reduction in ease of use and the many blatant bugs I encountered.In addition to the program being much slower and creating much larger files (slower backups), simple operations like copy/paste of investment transactions are no longer available. The worst part is the bugs. They can't even manage their windows correctly with some getting stuck in background or foreground. I've also had several program lockups. The help files, which in 2000 offered some explanation, now yield absolutely no new information over the dialogs they purport to help with.This software is a total disaster. I reinstalled my 2000 and will do without online service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Quicken 2001","review":"I've been a Quicken user since 4.0, and this 2004 version is awful (I upgraded from 2001). The new program is hard to use. I wish there was a way to convert back to 2001. Also, technical support via Chat is awful; the end conclusion for every problem is that you have to reinstall the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diminishing returns with Quicken program","review":"As a user of Quicken since 1991, I am surprised and appalled at the poor quality of each year's subsequent version. One has no choice but to upgrade, since the earlier, more stable versions will no longer be supported. Important, simple features, such as right-click pasting in the checkbook, are now unavailable. Intuit is more interested in selling you mortgage services and providing car loans than the ongoing development of what was once the best financial software package on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Piece of Garbage","review":"I have been using Quicken since \\"Quicken 4\\" on my Mac. It WAS a great program. This version is okay except for the investment portfolio. It is full of bugs, and is not at all intuitive (ironic, eh?). Further, you cannot simply \\"fudge\\" and enter your historical transactions ... so my cash balance is wrong, and impossible to correct. After researching online, it is clearly a bug that Inuit will not even acknowledge.Hopefully they will get their act together for 2005, otherwise, I'm out of there!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Cause","review":"As with previous reviewers, I was a Quicken 99 user and it was a waste of time and money to do the upgrade. Intuit clearly has lost touch with their customer base and fails to incorporate any value into their new, updated products. One would wonder who actually is at the helm of their product development department. Obviously, customer satisfaction takes a serious backseat to corporate profits. Sadly, their consistant downslide and destruction of what was a superior product is an embarrassment to Intuit. As a corporate professional, I would wonder why no senior management officers haven't stepped in to stop the demise of product quality and image. Quicken 99 WAS excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less for more","review":"I too was forced to upgrade from Quicken '99 and did so begrudgingly. When I received my copy of Quicken Basic '04 I realized that much of the functionality (downloads of stock prices, etc.) of my old Quicken Basic was now only available in Quicken Deluxe for an additional $20. I returned my Quicken '04 and will continue to use my '99 version, even if I have to input daily stock prices by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Displeased with discontinuation of support","review":"I have a very minor problem with Quicken 2000. It is very functional for all my needs and I am quite perturbed that to get technical support, I am forced to update. I don't need an update. I do need a very minor fix to my present system. Quite simply, the system somehow changed the opening screen and I can find no way of putting it back where it is when you first start using Quicken. I reloaded with the old disc and got the screen I want, but I have to the accounts list under the old load to find prior transactions. As for help, even the 900 number has been changed, so I can't even pay to get this rectified. What a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Automatically \\"discontinues\\" after 3 years","review":"Don't buy this product!!I have used Quicken for years but now they have a policy that their software online access for getting stock quotes and your financial data automatically discontinues after 3 years and you have to buy a new version of Quicken.Quicken 2004 will no longer work for online services after April 30, 2007.Forget it!

I too, have used Quicken for many years and would upgrade every other year. Well, after reading all the reviews, I think for the time being I will stick with my 2002 version. I can still backup on cd's the long way around. What can these companies be thinking of when they cheapen their products, hire people who can't speak with you for support, etc.Thank you all for the warnings. I believe my money will be better spent somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to its title","review":"I found this book very disappointing. Its title is 1001 more humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking.I found a lot of the content is not suitable for public speaking unless you are a preacher. A lot is in preaching. But I doubt whether many preachers would want to use it.I wanted to use it in my public speaking club. Much is not appropriate for that setting.I found it bemusing that quite a bit of the book is not appropriate for a preacher to use either.Although the book was only published in 1998, it had an old feel.I would not recommend this for public speaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different from the normal bike porn","review":"I did not know much about the international or even the national mountain biking scene when I first watched this film. I had heard of Adam Craig and that was about it as far as American XC cyclists go. But it's a testament to the film that I wasn't discouraged, and even my wife found it extremely watchable -- and she barely tolerates my discussions on mountain biking! Like all great documentaries, knowledge and an appreciation for the subject matter at hand is not necessary for you to enjoy this film. I would recommend it to any fan of documentaries or individual sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the \\"behind the scenes\\" or mountain bike junkie","review":"A very interesting behind the scenes look at what it takes to make the Olympic Team...it just so happens to be about bikers, but would appeal to those not necessarily interested in biking.

Filled with VIVID photographs, this guidebook is compact and durable and begins with a short introduction (a few pages) devoted to teaching about anthropods in general. We use this book all of the time, from identifiying bugs on neighborhood walks, excursions to area parks, or just in the backyard (and sometimes in the house). I can also credit this book for curing my son's phobia of insects. When we saw a bug he was scared of, we'd grab this book and identify it. Looking at the bug and identifying its parts and then being able to call it by name did wonders in alleving his fears! I do wish that this book had more information associated with each insect...such as what it eats and what eats it. But, as a beginner guidebook, this one is exceptional!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't care much for this expansion","review":"First let me say that I love Gloom and some of the other expansions.

I bought it in 1997 and still love to play and design new levels for it today in 2000. I cannot understand why Lucas Arts refuses to make a sequel to this game. It has almost a cult following on the web. There are many Outlaws websites and fans all over the world. You can play the Main Game (which is a great story), or you can go bounty hunting in the Historical Missions, or you can play against real live opponents or friends over the internet or modem. You can also download a level editor called LawMaker from the internet and create your own levels, which is almost as fun as playing the game. The game is easy to use, has some nice configuration options, and never crashes. Sure it is not flashy, sophisticated, or futuristic, but that is what makes it so great. If you want to have some good old fashioned fun, buy and play Outlaws.P.S. Wake up Lucas Arts and make a sequel to Outlaws instead of all of the Star Wars crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I reccomend Outlaws to all my friends. They made this game in the late 90's so it is extremely hard to find in stores. If you like adventurous, shooting games with overall PERFECT music, then get this. The levels gradually get harder and you will find yourself looking at a strategy guide once in a while. An awesome game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outlaws","review":"Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a dated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design.

Outlaws is very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST GAME EVER!!!","review":"This game was so amazingly bad that i almost threw my computer out the window.

I found it riviting and was unable to put it down except to eat and sleep.To be sure I am a Cape Codder, and the fact that I am familiar with the locale and have served on a jury in the courthouse described perhaps heightened my interest but I can assure the next reader that the author has done a marvelous job of setting the scene, establishing the characters, and spinning a yarn that very likely could have happened here.

This time, HKU Press has done a fascinating job in publishing an in-depth study on Wong's Ashes of Time and Happy Together. Jeremy Tambling is an expert in gender studies. In the book, he analyzes the film by using theories of allgeory. Besides, he also reads the film in relation to homosexuality (as expected), Hong Kong's postcolonial situation, melancholy, the American road movie genre, the meaning and tradition of tango and he also suggests the impact of choosing Buenos Aires as the setting of the movie. Tambling has included interesting and impressive perspectives of reading a movie, which brought Wong Kar Wai a best director award in Berlin Film Festival.You may not buy Tambling's arguments on reading the movie as you may say the author has over-interpreted it. However, what he has done in the book definitely enriches the genre of Hong Kong Cinema criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very creative and entertaining for child","review":"I found this book at a local store and fell in love with it.

Park knows how to write a novel--that's for sure.

Definitely, a novel of great achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"The Annunciate is really an exceptional book because it combines a fascinating and original SF universe with complex characterizations that are problematic in our own world. Although I'm a fan of Nicole Griffith and other writers who emphasize gender issues, Severna Park assumes most of these issues as a starting point and doesn't shrink from the honest appraisal of the most anguished and perhaps insoluable dilemmas in personal relationships among any gender. While this book is well worth reading simply for the surface fiction, I find its underlying psychological aspect to be its most fascinating aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insubstantial...","review":"Here's a story with a potentially great premise, a society stratified into three castes largely by virtue of their access to technology... but the story really never goes there. The society acts as a canvas backdrop on a stage that consists of one actor, three cardboard cutout characters, an alien, and a few assorted props.The story was not compelling, the heroine seems (in a nutshell) to go out and get into trouble and then watch what happens. The supporting characters were ill-defined and generally unlikeable. The alien was kind of neat but really a stretch on the suspension-of-disbelief. Everyone and everthing else was just paint on the background. The story had a couple of mildly tense moments, but I cared so little about the characters that even those moments were largely uninteresting.It's readable but if I didn't own it, I wouldn't go out and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real SF is not dead","review":"I think of genuine SF as having neat scientific extrapolations with well-rounded characters in dramatic situations that, altogether, helps us examine what it is to be human.

A parody is supposed to exaggerate some existing characteristic of its target to the point of absurdity; Wodehouse instead introduces a brand new absurdity, the peaceful but childish conduct of nine separate invading armies. Except for one brief joke about the London County Council which will resonate with modern residents of London, it fails completely to grip or to amuse. Wodehouse's very next book, _Mike_, was a turning point in his career, with its introduction of the character Psmith.

His tales of pursuit and conquest are the closest thing in print to a real affair.He genuinely loves women -- all women -- and his desire to possess all of them is startlingly real and musky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping OVER the Dirty Parts","review":"The other reviews about this book are eloquently accurate. \\"Whisper\\" is an erotic novel about a man who claims to love women but the amateur Freud in me suspected early on that some of his obsession was PTSS from Vietnam. Maybe if I were younger, I'd have hung on every word, but eventually the sex -- lovely as it was -- bored me and, unfortunately, so did the relationship: alas, he couldn't be the savior she desperately needed and in fact may have made her worse. So -- I can't believe this!-- I skipped the dirty parts to see how it ended! However, the enthusiasm expressed by other reviewers for this writer's work impels me to try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"**SIGH**","review":"You won't find a more excruciatingly boring novel anywhere. Butler, a Pulitzer Prize winner, could do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erotomania gone wild","review":"It's hard to read a book this narcissistic and obsessional without bursting out laughing. When he says \\"they whisper,\\" he's talking about the women's private parts. They talk to him. Seriously?Many of the reviewers seem to identify Butler as Ira, but I hope we're talking about a narrator, not a writer, because Ira seems to believe that his tumescent longings and fixations give him insight into the inner women with whom he is obsessed. I could forgive that in a character, but in a real man? Oh dear.He imagines that the women he pays for sex are as transported by the transaction as he is, despite the hardship and war that force them into the sex trade. And Fiona is a ridiculous, unbelievable character, a drawn-out nightmare that could never really exist, except as a way for a man to justify his withdrawal into fantasy over reality.The whole book is a fever dream and I just wanted to wake up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a 3-month old","review":"My son just turned three months old, and he enjoys this toy a lot to practice his brand-new grabbing skills.

I agree that it could have had added texture to make it better, and the vibration part is pretty uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not into it","review":"i thought baby would be much more interested in this. it's colorful and easy to grab -- but for some reason, it's a non-starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"really not that interesting, neither one of my kids really cared for it much, not very stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought some other toy","review":"My daughter who was 5 months old when I bought this ball, didnt like this ball. She does take it and try to play with the small ribbon ends and the knots which the worm has. I found some black strings in her stools, which are actually the threads of this toy which come out from the knots and she swallowed those, as she is exploring everything with her mouth. I should have bought something interesting with $ 13. This toy is not worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my 4 month old son. I am not impressed. I thought it would be a great toy because I love the Whoozit but it isn't that great. The \\"tag\\" fabric is the same as the fabric for the handles and it appears to be like very thin windbreaker fabric. It doesn't rattle or make any noises that are easy for an infant to initiate. The dangling star on the inside is on a very short string, about 1 inch, so unless you pull it out on the side it is sewn on it won't hang outside of the ball. You have to pull the Whoozit from the inside which is also on a short string to get it to vibrate. The whole ball doesn't vibrate, just the Whoozit. And it's not super easy to pull on either. On the opposite side of the vibrating Whoozit is a squeaker. I'm going to see how my son reacts to this toy but I'm pretty sure I'm just going to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Altoona?","review":"The author needs to update.

It has in some ways inspired me to even try out some brush techniques on some jobs in the future.If you're serious about graphics, I'd say buy this book... it's good to know everything about your industry regardless of whether or not you do it yourself.

The volume control has proven itself surprisingly useful many many times. I don't use the little foam pads, they're a pain, but the ones that came with these were relatively good. You'll never use the case. And that's ok because the coating on the wires is the \\"right\\" kind, so they're extremely easy to untangle if you just stick them in your pocket. The wire also doesn't get all bent-up after leaving them wound for too long like some headphones I've had.Sum-up: you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality and practicality of these headphones, despite them being extremely cheap.My next pair is going to be the mx-660s.OUT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less than I expected from Sennheiser","review":"Poor sound, poor quality.

When the violins come in, it's like musical wrecking crew tearing down everything that you thought you knew about structure. The bass lines are otherworldy and the vocalists sing like their lives depend on holding the audiences' attention (In fact, on traditional song involes all of the instuments fighting for the audiences' attention) Is it Folk?

The potential for satire is bottomless, but the author does not explore it. I am a Russian immigrant of the same generation as the author, so I can relate to and understand many of his references to Russian language, slang etc., but I can imagine that being difficult for American readers. Apart from a few lucky passages, the book is not funny, and I am hard pressed to find any satire, clever or otherwise. In my mind I pictured the author as an American Pelevin, but was disappointed. After reading the piece in the New Yorker and seeing the book in the top ten books in the NYT, I gave it as a gift without reading it and am now ashamed about it.

I struggled to decide if this character was bathetic or pathetic. Unfortunately, there was nothing at all sympathetic, likable or intelligible about this character or what passed for a plot, so he, and the book, were pathetic. I don't know if you have to be a Russian emigre to appreciate the purported humor, but being two generations removed from my Jewish Russian roots, I could not find the humor. The crude offense, however, was easy to find; rarely a page without some. I should have followed my instinct and quit on this book half-way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorful but Empty","review":"Okay, mad props for the author's wild imagination. He maps his own weird land where ethnic rivalries of the Caucusus collide with hiphop and Halliburton. But after a while, the comedy gets heavy-handed, and part of that is the sense of willed hilarity. It's as if someone sat down with friends and said, \\"What if we updated Confederacy of Dunces? Dude, let's make him not just grossly fat and slobby and obnoxious, but Jewish! And Russian! And better than that, he likes hiphop! He even calls his sweetie Boo.\\" You get my drift. We travel many miles in this book, from the Bronx to St. Petersburg and back and to the shores of the Caspian, but while the world around him goes to pieces, nothing changes for the narrator, despite a half-hearted attempt at epiphany on the author's part.

All regret and no anxiety make John a dull boy. Absurdistan still likes going out, having a few beers, and talking to women. It doesn't have a mortgage and certainly no children. It's not quite into gardening (though it appreciates rare beauty wherever it's found).While many writers try to let the white space speak louder than the words (this is called \\"depth\\"), Gary lets the words make some noise.

I do not enjoy reading bad language and sexual references. If this is what the top tens are about, I'll stay away from them. I paid good money for a book I had to throw out; I deserve at least to get my 2 cents in for a review. Maybe I will save someone else from throwing their money away like I did.

I bought the book following the short story and was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche","review":"Couldn't finish reading the book - as a Russian, I find it to be trite and cliched, characters lacking imagination. It sounds as if the author just found a few generic trends and stuck to each person, without thinking too much - the rich daddy, the hooker with the heart of gold, the spoilt rich brat.But that by itself would have been fine, had the writer not positioned himself as a \\"Russian\\". Instead, he lacks deep understanding of Russia, its culture and people. One example is his use of Russian curses. I find his overuse of Russian slang and curses to be extremely offensive - no real reason why almost twice per page the writer puts in these words in his text - they may sound interesting to a foreigner, but to a Russian this is extremely unpleasant to read.Overall - I stopped reading this \\"book\\" midway, and hope that the author refrains from writing anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"He only thinks he's clever","review":"Snore. As you read the book, you could care less for the character. The author makes it quite obvious when you're supposed to laugh at his clever and wit. It's so obvious and self-congratulating. He also likes to use the same type of joke throughout the whole book - maybe a small smile at the beginning but it only gets worse. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.

It is a distraction from the main idea of the novel. Also, the author fails to resist the urge to use vocabulary whose definitions only a wordsmith would know and not the majority of the general population. Using uncommon vocabulary ruins any chance that the reader can get absorbed in the story.

It is, at best, juvenile, self-aggrandizing, pompous, culturally insulting, pretentious and complete drivel.

You're better off spending your precious reading time doing something else more entertaining, like going to the dentist or mucking out horse stalls.

This is why Absurdistan is on many Ten-Best lists. However, the author is just not talented enough to pull it off - a John Irving wannabe.Second, depiction of the grotesque is risky business. As odd as it sounds, it must be done with finesse or it becomes virtually unreadable (which is the case here). For a positive example, check out Salinger.The only true appeal I could discern was the setting. Eastern Europe in the 21st century is a very interesting part of the world and it ALMOST makes this novel worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I Don't Get It","review":"I bought Absurdistan chiefly because it was one of The New York Times' 10 best books of 2006, but also because I had just returned from a visit to St. Petersburg and had recently read three books with locales in Azerbaijan. I thought that a highly-recommended book about a St. Petersburg native, who is educated in the US, and ends up in what sounds like Azerbaijan, would suit me just fine. Instead, I found a trashy narrative about a frankly disgusting, self-absorbed, age 30-something juvenile, which abounds in glutinous overeating, pathetic sex, drugs, and existential moaning on virtually every page. The \\"hero\\" or \\"antihero\\" is about as unappealing a character as I can remember forming the subject of any recent fiction I've read. What the NYT found to be \\"smart, funny and, in the end, extraordinarily rich and moving,\\" I found to be repulsive, repetitive and boring. I guess it's a matter of taste, and since I'm not the authority on these things, let's say that I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Have you ever read a book with the expectation that it will eventually become good (especially when it's on the NYT top 10 list)? You know, the ones where you keep reading and reading, hoping that the next chapter will be the one that brings everything together and allows you to feel good about the time spent on what you considered a piece of literary trash. But then you finish the book, and you really don't even want to tell people that you've read it. Well, this was Absurdistan for me. I would have burned this, but it's on my Kindle, and now Amazon will keep it on my purchased list forever, reminding me of the hours wasted. My recommendation is to not waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny for the first 50 pages, painfully boring after that","review":"The author's writing style is humorous at first. I was reminded of Confederacy of Dunces, and recommended the book to some friends. Now I'm ten pages away from finishing the book, and struggling to reach the end. The jokes have been recycled 100 times, the plot is completely uninteresting, and the political insinuations extremely cliched. Thus, I'm left with nothing to be gained from finishing this book. I've since retracted my recommendation to my friends to read it, but told them it's worth borrowing from me to read the first 50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, VERY shallow execution","review":"This novel probably sounded great when Shteyngart was first thinking through the setting and the characters. Even the core plot likely seemed interesting when it was loosely outlined.Unfortunately, that was likely the last time any real thinking happened in the course of executing this novel. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is trivial. It seems to want to be a broad indictment of globalism, capitalism, and turn of the century greed. Unfortunately, it fails.I am always a bit piqued when a book is as over-hyped as this and executes poorly. Like the \\"Rule of Four\\", this is just a simplistic book with a cool setting. It is not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"For some reason, modern writers think if they are really vulgar that somehow this makes them great intellectual writers. The author of Absurdistan takes this approach. His main character is thoroughly disgusting with no real redeeming qualities. The author describes in detail the protagonists' private areas and events associated with it as well as his bowel movements, sexual encounters, eating and drinking habits of this grossly overweight man. Even worse the story does not really go anywhere. When the book finally finished I was like well that was pointless.The one redeeming factor of the book is it gives a pretty interesting portrayal of some Russian and NY cultural phenomenon and the interaction between the two. Not recommended unless you are a hardcore Russophile, and even then its not your best bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally cliche and uninventive","review":"I was quite disappointed in this Shteyngart follow up. Not nearly as funny, clever, witty, or original as his debut. I think he needs to come up with some novel ideas instead of ripping himself off, and badly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful & Witty? C'mon, now!","review":"So here you have a silly novel by a Wannabe Vaudevillean, it would seem, inventring a grossly obese anti-hero who somehow is irresistable to Latina and Russian nymphomaniacs. Wearing the armor of \\"silly me\\" charicature, he proceeds to insult all ethnicities, but reserves his principal villification for the \\"Golly Burton\\" subsidiary KBR, supposedly attempting to obtain an (actually illegal) cost-plus U.S. LOGCAP contract to support a future American invasion of a hypothetical Orthodox Christian tribal country squeezed between the Moslem nations of the Caspian Sea litoral, a place supposedly with exhausted energy resources. Fairly good writing, but a nonsensical plot. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even clever.","review":"A sophomoric attempt to create a humorous reflection of world events and situations. It has sloppy development, poor pacing and the characters are paper dolls. I hope this is the author's first book, because he has nowhere to go but up. Sorry for the rough critique, but I hope the author takes it as a challenge to improve his style and skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"Insufferably precious here, bold and assured there, this ends up a fairly middling read. Shteyngart pours on the provincialisms and cutesy characterizations, but his themes are strongly developed.

Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle, and Sam and Max Hit the Road all rank among some of the finest no-typing adventure games of modern day computer gaming. All of them offer liberal doses of humor, lots of replay value, and more entertainment than can be found in most titles. This is definitely a collection not to be missed by adventure game fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, classic, classic games","review":"Indiana Jones and Day of the Tentacle are the most hilarious and amusing games I've ever played. Who thinks of a little tentacle that sprouts arms and tries to take on the world? The best thing is that these games don't make you panic; you can choose whether you want to fight or figure in Fate. You use your brains and wits which have got to be pretty strange to figure these strange games out. Sam & Max is fun as well, although the other games are somewhat tedious, but Day of the Tentacle and Indiana Jones more than enough make up for them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Labor Pains is a Hoot!","review":"Lindsey L is not my favorite actress, but she really was quite hilarious in this well written and stylish film. I really enjoyed the story and really laughed at a number of scenes, especially the birthing class scene. The supporting cast is suburb and Cheryl Hines is particularly hilarious. Chris Parnell is very strong and the setting is true LA at its best. I particularly loved the sound track and story line. I am now a fan of Lindsey's and highly recommend this fun film for any group of expecting women looking for a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!!!","review":"I thought this had a really good and funny plot. Lindsay Lohan did an awesome job. Lohan stars as a secretary named Thea Clayhill who is about to be fired by her very stubborn boss. She is soon forced to lie and tell him she is pregnant.

Lindsey did a great job on her role. There were many funny moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I read reviews that really liked this movie and there are some of Lindsays that I really like so I decided to watch it. I would like that time back. Some aspects were interesting but overall not something I liked nor will I watch again. The main character was just unlikeable and unrelatable at all parts of the movie when it shouldn't have been that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsay Lohan.","review":"Lindsay Lohan delivers a great performance in The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, and now Labor Pains. This is a REALLY smart and funny film--well worth seeing and far better than the usual comedic maternity genre. Rest of cast is excellent, as well. Haven't heard of Lara Shapiro before, but i want to see anything else she's written or directed. Gold! I have been Team Lindsay for as long as I can remember and this movie just all the more confirms my choice. This is a REALLY smart and hilarious film, I think it would have done wonders had it been given an actual theatrical run. However I love this film never-the-less. A great watch primarily for women of all ages, but it will also serve as a perfect \\"date night\\" movie.

This book is a must-have for both the fan and fanatic. The writing is well-done, the subject matter well-handled.

As she colors, she says the French word. So she gets to add to our lesson, and is most likely absorbing the Flip Flop French lesson as well.

The guy who played Daniel was okay, but most of the movie centered on Brian. Honestly, at times, I was really hoping Brian would get killed off.On top of all this, the first 20 minutes or so had almost no dialogue. Again, I realize it's a zombie movie, but some dialogue is better than none, especially when the first 20 minutes are flat-out boring.The only reasons I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the setting was different and the special effects for a low-budget film were pretty good.

For the first ten minutes, it lived up to the hype. But I slowly realized that I didn't care at all about the stock characters, and that, although there was some good old-school gore, the majority of the effects budget was spent on colored contact lenses. The movie gets very, very repetitive: guys drive through the desert, slow down for some reason, zombies wander in and are killed with boring shots to the head, guys drive away through the desert, repeat, repeat, repeat.This could have been a decent movie, but it is hamstrung by a low budget, phoned-in performances, and zombies which differ only in how much fake blood was applied by the person doing makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story whatsoever","review":"Some people go their whole lives and never figure out the difference between stuff happening, and actual story.

Not in the least bit original - is anything in the zombie genre - but quality. What separates THE DEAD from other rehashed zombiecinema, is the location. The sweeping scape of carnage against the beauty of Africa is unspeakably beautiful. The performances are quality, too. What the film suffers from, and the reason it is lacking a star, is that the story is a been-there-done-that zombie story.

Its bascially white contacts and face powder with a splash of fake blood. Really? I cant believe a tv show \\"The Walking Dead\\" has such amazing make up affects for zombies and this craptasctic film had zero.

The Ford Brothers use the zombie infestation almost as a disturbing backdrop, deciding to focus on the bonding of its two focal characters who break dialogue when another flurry of exploding heads is required to remind us it's a horror movie. The main problem with THE DEAD is it's just dull and boring. Of all the venerated horror genres, zombies are the most limited and tiresome. Only the zombie films that infuse self-deprecating humor like ZOMBIELAND and SHAUN OF THE DEAD have given new life to a tired subject.Ultimately, THE DEAD is mainly recommended for zombie die-hards."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and boring","review":"I just kinda thought not much happened, there was no intensity. I always wonder in movies like this how people can't get away from slow moving zombies?

The beginning was amateurish at best, the plot holes were bigger than Kilimanjaro, and the lead is not exactly a 4 star actor. I would rather watch Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things 100 times before watching this once because at least that movie has a cult campy thing going on, along with groovy pants (haha).I've noticed a trend on these Amazon movies, that they get many rave reviews no matter how bad they really are. This movie falls in that category. I have to wonder if Amazon encourages people to hand out good reviews to make their stock look better than Netflix's stock? They suffer from the same issue too, btw."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was really excited to see a new zombie movie coming out and with all the good reviews it was getting, I thought alright......finally one that might actually be good. But to my dismay, this movie was BORING....no plot, no character development, no NOTHING!!!!! The only good thing about the movie was the few really good special effects scenes in it. I couldn't believe I sat through an hour and forty-five minute movie that just literally bored the hell out of me!!!! Yes it was that bad!!!! I would not recommend buying this movie...if you want to see it, rent it through Redbox before you do, so you don't waste your hard earned money on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it really hurt my artistic sensabilities","review":"You are given money adn you give back dog poo, I never get how this si allowed to happen.

What this movie turned out to be was for me to watch two guys taking a Sunday stroll through zombie park. Bummer.

It is really awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest most Boring Zombie Movie Ever","review":"I think the intention of this film was to show the emotional impact on the survivors rather than just the constant barrage of flesh eaters. If so, it failed miserably. The actors were wooden and one note and there just wasn't much action of any kind except in small spurts when the truck broke down or got stuck. It was slow, almost crawling and so you think eventually there will be a payoff - some big meaningful ending, right? Not really. The main actor had fewer expressions than Kristen Stewart and none of them seemed to fit the situations he found himself in. He just looked perpetually confused. Zombie movies are not usually stellar cinema, let's face it, but at least they should be entertaining. The name honestly describes the film better than I will be able to - it's dead and not in a good way. Just skip this one altogether. You'll thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it over already?","review":"There is one thing that you will not like about this book. It will have you wanting MORE at the end. I do not mean that the story is lacking by any means, though. I mean that you will want to know what happens next to the characters and hear more of their stories.This is actually two books in one. Half of it takes place in Tobyn Ser revolving around Jaryd and the other half in Lon Ser revolving around Meylor. I found it very amazing how Coe seemed to change the characters (there is a ten year period between the happenings in the first book and the third) while keeping them the same. Coe's ability to tell a story is one of the best. You will not get bored or recieve any filler all the while being on they edge of your seat.

It contains a lot of my favorite songs by TMBG. It even has the great \\"Dr. Evil,\\" song from The Spy Who Shagged Me. I esspicially like \\"Stormy Pinkness,\\" which is Live on this.

Most songs will stick in your head for decades - trust me.For fans, this album contains simply the best TMBG songs out there and is worth it to have all of these songs in one place.

The problem here is not the cast or the performance, but the shoddy job of transcribing done for this recording. Besides being poorly remastered, it is running fast, a whole half-step high in pitch which distorts the voices of the principals, making them sound pinched and nasal which they were not. Shame on Gebhardt, which is usually very consistent in their reissues, for miserably botching this recording. Unless you have a variable speed cd player I would suggest you stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an undiscovered gem in social literature","review":"I have seen this title often but there are so many books about childhood incest, that I made the mistake of failing to look closer. The writing style of Helen Bonner is insightful, yet slightly detached as she tells of recovered memories surfacing as she taught literature as a college professor. Bonner veils her painful recollections within the stories of literature and her world as a professor, becoming angered at the mores of the past and present social structure that can allow a woman's worth to go unnoticed...then as the story unfolds like a mystery, Bonner addresses the real dragons in her life, the painful truth about her incestuous past and her recovery. The tone of the book is intellectual, mentally stimulating and emotionally engaging.This is a profound book, for both victims and anyone who appreciates good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Story","review":"It took a lot of courage for Helen Bonner to write this book! The story is at times difficult to read because of the topic and the events the author is revealing. The writing is superb. The story will keep your attention and remain in your memory for a long time. Abused by her father at an early age, a member of a dysfunctional family, Helen has persevered in life becoming an extremely effective professor, speaker, and courageous role model for women who have been forced to walk the path of life she reveals in this book. This book should not be overlooked by anyone in modern society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time is short. Don't waste your time on this book.","review":"I don't usually read a book and feel ripped off (from my time and money). Since I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, I promptly threw it away when I was finished. Helen Bonner seemed to simply wander through her life with no particular direction. I was frustrated with her inability to stay the course on any one subject. I bought the book because it was marketed as a book about incest. Her sexual abuse comprised about 2% of the content. It was not a book about incest. It was a book about the craziness of the 60s and 70s with free sex, drugs, and self-absorption. If you are looking for a book on incest, you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottom line on this book, imho:","review":"If you're an incest survivor, you might find it worthwhile, because you'll relate to a lot of what's there.If you're just looking for a satisfying read, skip this book - it's poorly crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Laid Daughter\\" - Don't bother with this book.","review":"I love reading.

I will not deny that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults. But I cannot stomach his pretense that this Western diatonic scale rambling is being linked to the actual activity of the chakra system. This is the stuff confusion is made of, and Halpern would deserve more than two stars if he simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces, not calling it music with actual ability to heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book is short, simple and to the point.

There's alot of good dialogue, good acting, very well done dark sets, and sexy dark eroticism. Plus, this isn't hollywood glamorized vampires, they don't even use that word. And there are no fangs, just bloodthirsty immortals who don't really understand themselves what they are.

There was no super-natural power scene, not even hand-to-hand combat. This movie delivered nothing but urge to fast forward.

All I can say is, that's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. (Or maybe it just felt like two hours; Amazon's listing puts the run time at 94 minutes, oy.) The plot is predictable, the dialogue, cringe-worthy. RISE is just bad enough to be an exercise in banality; but not awful enough to elicit (unintentional) laughs.

I listen to it at work, and I think I'm more productive when I do. It truly is effortless!

Sure enough, his \\"rocker\\" side is represented here, in several soft rock numbers which bring to mind, perhaps, Gilbert O'Sullivan, or Bobby Hebb, backed by a sedate Brazilian version of Tower of Power. Pretty lightweight by North American standards, although this does include several of Carlos' most famous tunes, including \\"Oh! Meu Imenso Amor\\" and \\"Sua Estupidez\\" (a longtime favorite of Gal Costa's). Also includes an early Tim Maia song which is mildly \\"funky\\".

While I don't listen to it every night, I do listen to it probably 4 - 5 times a week and in the 2 months I've had the CD, I can count the number of times on one hand that I've actually heard the 3rd song - which is amazing considering it usually takes up to an hour (sometimes longer) for me to fall asleep.While I haven't gotten all my energy back (I doubt that will ever happen..... :) ), I do have more energy now than I did even during the supposed \\"honeymoon\\" second trimester."},{"rating":"2","title":"works wonderfully for the little ones too","review":"We have had trouble with our 2 year old staying in bed.

We've had the stockpot for less than a year, so it's pretty disappointing, especially since we haven't had any problems with our other Calphalon things, (all our pots and pans are Calphalon One, just like this one). My assumption is that someone used metals utensils without realizing it -- so I would say in general, with Calphalon One, be sure to use the correct cooking implements.However, with all that said, I have to say too that until our stockpot met its untimely demise, it really was a great piece to have in the kitchen.

It did not. What a waste of my time. The movie is about psychotics and the storyline is absolutely meaningless. The acting was great by Joaquin Phoenix, just the story itself went absolutely no where. The character of Freddie Quell, was suffering from PTSD, delusion and alcoholism. He found himself aboard a boat with psychotic cult members who worshiped \\"The Master\\". The Master influenced them all by hypnoses and delusional ideology.The story never had a basis or climax other than Freddie Quell wondering his way with this strange cult. I gave the movie a chance because I do like Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

The screenplay is awful, the cinematography is cramped and nauseating and the acting is terrible. I am a huge Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan, but he just seemed constipated.

Do people read four page reviews? Great acting (lipstick on a pig) in a horrible, boring and silly movie. I read a review in the New York Times that stated this was an \\"actor's film\\". I laughed my ass off. It is an actor's film because the only people that gave a poo about it were the actors in it.

Perhaps that IS the point, but it didn't make it any more enjoyable. The leads are flawless as is the cinematography, but this appears to be little more than an oddball character study. I like most of Anderson's work, so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I didn't enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spiritual Search of the 1950s","review":"This film portrays the beginning of a \\"self-help religion\\" in the American 1950s when people were searching for something more spiritually. It highlights the charlatan qualities of a master who knows how to control others. This is an excellent film for those working with victims of spiritual/religious abuse. However, there are a few scenes that portray nudity and sexually explicit themes, so viewer be aware of those scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy smokes, you guys.","review":"This was the best film I saw in 2012. It uses a fictional proxy for Scientology as a springboard to explore ideas about faith, control, and a person's power to redeem and be redeemed.

It is an extraordinary piece of work, maybe Anderson's best, and I'm excited to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it","review":"The actors were great but the material was not.

Whatever movies are supposed to do, they must not bore the viewer. Nothing saves this movie from boredom, although the production design is excellent and the mid-twentieth century of America is well evoked, and although the actors deliver fine performances. Unfortunately, all of them are trapped in a narrative that is tedious and directionless.In 1964, Andy Warhol mounted a movie camera on a tripod, pointed it at the Empire State Building, and let the camera roll for eight hours of slow motion footage.

The other man is smarter, so smart in fact that he sees beyond the first, beyond his drama into the void itself. He is so smart that he knows life is meaningless and armed with this understanding proceeds to destroy himself. The first man senses the depth of the second and seduces him into a brief affair that is the pinnacle of both lives.This is the story of L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology. Phillip Hoffman does his very best work here. It is a gentle story about the tragedy of sentience. It portrays Scientology not as an evil cult but as something light and whimsical and it has the ring of truth. But it also paints tragedy onto the lives of ordinary people and it offers no answers. It is a bleak and dark film without hope and with much truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 2 hours and 17 minutes back!!","review":"That's right. I have just wasted 2 hours and 17 minutes enduring possibly the most boring, disjointed and incoherent \\"thing\\" that has ever passed itself off as a movie. Let me break the silence, Academy voters, this picture was completely pointless and an awful waste of resources...right down to the oxygen the editor was breathing as s/he struggled to figure out how to create a logical story sequence while wondering whether they could ever list this project on a resume and still be taken seriously. The biggest shame, however, was the amount of effort expended by the production designer, set decorators, artists and costume designers who beautifully recreated the 1940's settings.

I regret spending two hours watching Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman try to one-up each other's performance. Joaquin is on the comeback trail after spitting in the face of Hollywood but this performance is too excessive for the role. We know he can act but it is apparent that he is trying too hard to prove that he is the \\"best\\" actor in Hollywood. That chip on his shoulder is clearly getting in the way of his acting. Hoffman does quite well as \\"Master\\" but, again, his attempt is more than what the role calls for. Amy Adams is amazing and it is apparent that she has checked her ego at the door, unlike Phoenix and Hoffman. I recommend The Master for those who are fans of period pieces, notably 1945-1950, and over-acting; otherwise, skip it and watch one of the other movies that came out this year for a more enjoyable evening (Argo, The Avengers, Pitch Perfect, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master = not masterful","review":"really a very weird and boring film-- confused, oddly disquieting, acting is good I suppose ,but script and intent border on the incomprehensible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange movie","review":"Not sure I ever figured out what was going on.

Other reviewers seem to want to decipher the film, psychoanalyze it. If I wanted to do that I'd say the characters in the film are all manifestations of The Master. Or that it was a dream, a nightmare. But really, besides Joaquin Phoenix's performance, it was the most boring, painful film ever. The sound track made me uneasy throughout the film. I was thrilled to finally, after an overlong film, be allowed to leave the theater. I checked my watch after the first half, thinking maybe I'd just leave, but stayed thinking that it must be almost over. Sadly, it wasn't. The hyped \\"thinly veiled take on Scientology\\" was a no-show. The movie was so incoherent, it was hard to tell what it was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. Boring, boring, boring, boring, with brief breaks to be disgusting before it returned to being boring. After reading all the rave reviews, and having spent time in a somewhat cult-like religious atmosphere myself, I expected to be entertained and enlightened. I so much wish I could get that 2 1/2 hours and $7.50 back. Horrible, disjointed, ridiculous movie. The only good thing is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who never disappoints with a performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE Movie","review":"This is easily the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen. It's slow, pointless, and B O R I N G! There is almost zero plot, so it's hard to describe this movie to someone who has not seen it. At one point in the movie, Hoffman has Phoenix go back and forth in a room touching 2 walls, while asking him to describe what he feels. This scene lasts for over 10 MINUTES and it is repeated several times in the film.This movie is truly awful. I don't know why it's getting such rave reviews. I want to scream at those enamored by this film, WERE WE WATCHING THE SAME FILM?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I really enjoyed this, perhaps because I'm pretty fascinated by cult movements. Though it's not an exact depiction of Scientology, Philip Seymour Hoffman does an amazing job playing the Hubbard like cult leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgence Personified","review":"I have seen all of Anderson's films and loved every one, but this one is a navel-gazing, self-important hot mess.

Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Walking In The Dark lost For 2 Hrs","review":"this was the most boring movie,please dont tell me i just dont get it,theirs nothing to get,just plain stupid,no real plot or point to get,the movie was like it wasnt even edited just shoot then print.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of celluloid","review":"Safe for Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance, this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.

I don't write reviews that often but this movie needs to have light shone on it for what an absolute piece of garbage it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"What were you expecting?","review":"Sure, this film is meandering and vulgar, filled with deeply unlikable characters and an imperceptible plot. It's veritable mind eff. An open vein of pathos, psychosis and fear. With arguably the best performance Joaquin Phoenix has ever or WILL ever give. He is utterly remarkable. Brilliant, even. The dialog between he and Hoffman is maddening and filled with a ton of inexplicable subtext. It's thrilling to watch. The Master is a perfect storm of literary skill, deft direction and transcendent acting. If Beckett, Bukowski and Kubrick had a love child = PT Anderson. I loved it, but I hated every. single. character. Truly, I wanted to punch each one of them in the face. Repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Sequences of Epic Nothingness","review":"Let me first say, that all of these actors are strong. The characters they portray are deep, insightful, and refined (in the acting sense).....however....There is no cohesion to this story whatsoever. I understand what the movie is meant to be, and say, and leave to the imagination, but it's just not a pleasant ride to get there.There is no benefit for the audience to know what the characters do or do not discover within themselves.This movie failed to realize what it was trying to say..... I really did give it all the way until the end, waiting for 'Aha!', but honestly, it was only a yawnSorry, not feelin it"},{"rating":"2","title":"2/3 Of A Perfect Movie","review":"I watched imagining L. Ron Hubbard's downfall and scientology's rebirth 30 years after this story ends. This disciple figure is increasingly mystified instead of clarified. Somebody in Hollywood should have had the guts to convince Anderson that the last acts diminished rather than inspired the viewer's curiosity. It's still worth watching for the flawless cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be too high-brow for me","review":"My husband and I LOVE all aspects for movies, from directing to writing to editing to sound and then down to acting. We are definite cinema folk. However this movie was WAY too over-the-top for us. My husband kept nodding off and I kept hoping it would get better. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing, as usual, and Amy Adams is great. But other than the individual performances, we found this move to be a big mess. I'm not a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (didn't like Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Magnolia), but I was hoping I'd like this film. Evidently I need to just stay away from his movies altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, creepy journey to...nowhere","review":"The \\"Children of the Corn\\" eyes on Amy Adams and the creepy music throughout....add these to a plot that seems to build into a better understanding of cult behavior..but it doesn't.Since there were nominations for this movie, etc, I assume there are many who found this movie to be essential.

I managed to fix them myself, but I don't want to be doing that as I read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners beware...","review":"I bought this book with a fairly good grasp of C++. It started out ok, but quickly got very complex, and alot of the detail about what's going on in the programs wasn't covered. I was doing fine up to bitmaps and surfaces, but when he started going into animated sprites, he lost me because it seemed like he jumped from one thing to the other without first explaining what he was doing. There were new lines of code introduced that weren't used before, and he failed to explain what they were for.He also failed to give any answers to the end of chapter exercises, so I was left wondering how to solve the more complex problems.Also, some end of chapter questions were about topics covered in later chapters, so I ended up beating my head against the wall trying to find the answers.I just ordered the Sams beginning game programming book, and hopefully that will shed some light on what I've read so far with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and not very well written.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. There was insufficient instruction regarding the installation of the DirectX SDK. Most of the source code is incompatible with the included compiler. After manually entering the source code into the Visual C++ IDE, most of the programs would not compile. Thinking I may have made some typographical errors or overlooked some of the code, I then copied the source code directly from the included CD and became even more frustrated that this code would not compile either. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Jonathan S. Harbour is an excellent author. His books are very informative and very easy to read. He has a knack for taking subject matter that would put you to sleep, and making it fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable and Worthwhile Book","review":"I liked this book. Don't be fooled by the author when he says in the beginning that \\"This is a book all about game programming\\". It seems like its goal is to do everything with DirectX but make games. You spend the first 9 chapters making neat little programs to demonstrate basic Windows code and the various components of DirectX. However, the games come eventually; you make a sort of Pong clone in chapter 10, and a 3D version of Breakout to finnish the book. You also walk away with a fully functional game \\"framework\\" you can apply to your projects for a while to come. BE WARNED: the compiler included with this book is Dev-C++, an environment I have found very difficult to use with DirectX. Your better off using MSVC (the compiler that is actually covered in the book). To sum up: I gained a knowledge of how to make games with C and DirectX from this book, so I'm satisfied. Definitely valuable, worthwhile, and a great place to start for the novice game programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book but some BIG drawbacks","review":"Besides the few mistakes that make it difficult to compile code etc. the book is very good for beginners. It starts with the basics of windows programming framework then adds DirectX, onto 2d graphics then finishes with 3d. Each chapter has questions to test your knowledge and it CLEARLY states the answers are in the Appendix which ISN'T included. I have contacted them and they just state, \\"nope no appendix sorry\\". So if you are unsure of an answer your never going to know the answer. It also has a program he uses called meshview which doesn't come with ALL SDK's (maybe I have a newer one that has it removed). So the whole section on optimizing mesh's is worthless to me (I have searched for it on the SDK ON THE BOOK's CD!! and online to no avail) Things like that throughout the book make it just a so so book to me. Anyhow don't expect a complete 100% thorough book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fragile surface","review":"I bought this pan about a year ago and loved the way it looked and cooked. I guess I got it a little too hot on the burner or didn't wash it correctly but after a while it stopped being non stick.

I'm very tempted to put it in the garbage but I need it to remind me that just because something is expensive it doesn't mean it's top quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and Disruptive","review":"I found the music to be irritating - sharp pitched notes would disrupt my chain of thought. Perhaps if I played it quietly it wouldn't be as bad, but I need white noise to cover other people's noise (vacume cleaner, loud TV, etc). All in all, a waste of money, since I have other programing to listen to when I'm not studying. I'll stick to Kelly Howell (Deep Learning), Brainwave Mind Voyages (Subliminal Learning Genius), Global Hypnosis (Super Learning, Malibu Hypnosis (Study Smart Study Longer Self Hypnosis Sound Therapy), and Dr. Rick Collingwood (Super Study [Volume Sixteen]) - Sorry, Amazon dosn't make product links for mp3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I expected to hear music that would help me stay focused and concentrate while reading (as the other reviews state will happen) but I didn't notice much difference, and some of the titles were hard to listen to - annoying actually.

I started reading his new book, but I moved before he finished it. I've kept in touch since I moved, so that I can read it when he finishes it.

To my nose, the fragrance is remarkably similar to Jean Nate, though much more expensive. This body wash is Okay, as body washes go. However, what scent might be in the wash disappears rather quickly. Actually this is a good thing, as I find this particular scent to be rather strident. I far prefer body washes which are far less costly and which don't have any fragrance...just a nice clean smell.The 4711 bar soap is actually rather pleasant, and has a fine lather, not enormous bubbles as do some soaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not what I as expecting.

I was hoping that the dance sequence would show the way they did with their chair dance in \\"Buttons\\" or at least the fast moves they did.

I am fit, and in my early twenties and every time I dont the dvd I sweat through a shirt. It really gets ur heart rate going. My thing was that the first time you see the routine it is freaking hard to keep up with... i recall being in such a rush i tripped over my feet, but after u watch it the second time you really start to get the hang of it.You need a large space to dance in.And you have to actually try, you get no where in life doing the bare minimum.This is a five star workout dvd....

Second - the routine only lasts about 10 minutes, so you don't even have time to work up a sweat. I actually laughed so hard at myself for even attempting to take this seriously, and that may have burned off a few calories.Save your money.

The authors take a dispassionate, methodical approach, buttress their points with plenty of case evidence and examples, clearly have a grasp of the subject and communicate detailed knowledge of great value to those in the field. Unfortunately, their style is plodding and clinical, replete with passive constructions and impersonal, generally soporific sentences.

The cast is lousy and the actors stink. The sound is horrible and some of the cast members are shouting there dialogue instead of speaking loud and clearly. There is a difference in speaking loud and clear or just plain shouting. It's hard to watch because of the lack of structure-In short this stage play is a HOT MESS!! Don't waste your money on this one. Do not rent or buy this dvd if you do you will be highly disappointed. So if you must see it borrow it from a friend that will probably thank you for taking it off there hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time.","review":"I may have bought the wrong show, as I saw a play called Beauty Shop long ago and really enjoyed it. This couldn't have been it. I was disappointed in this production. It seemed poorly put together. There was no real plot or point, and most of it was boring and lacking depth. Some parts were just plain unnecessary, but apparently put in to create excitement, but it didn't even succeed at creating any. The acting wasn't too bad, for the most part, but I question the intention overall. The play seemed to end almost abruptly without any real resolution to any issues brought up. I only paid about two dollars for this, but it wasn't even worth that, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddities by Boris","review":"In general I find Boris Tchaikovsky compulsive listening - the piano concerto, the Sebastopol symphony, the chamber symphony, etc. Every encounter with his music is surprising; his inventiveness seems to have been practically unlimited - each work a new start.This film music is surprising too, not least because after a while - incredibly, for this composer - it begins to pall. It impacts like something between big-band jazz and musical, with a touch of Russian whimsy and soul. It's reminiscent in places of Kurt Weill, but Weill's irony was sharper; at times it sounds like Nino Rota, but Rota's \\"circus music\\" was more playfully ambiguous; and the jazz elements in Bernstein are more authentically swinging, of course.I'm sure this disc will hold great appeal for some - it's a curious sort of \\"niche product\\", but it presents a decidedly odd aspect of this still underrated composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"in love","review":"I bought this for my son.

It seems like Deepak Chopra doesn't get that. There are a couple of very nice pieces but the album is mainly formulaic rather than insightful and I am dismayed to say leaves me feeling like I just listened to some music and nothing else.If you like nice unhurried music that creates a relaxed atmosphere, you can't go past Cafe Del Mar.

Unfortunately, it's clouded by the author's apparent dislike of dealers, fellow collectors, and the Homer Laughlin China Company itself.The book designer's work is exuberant and cheerful, much as is Fiestaware; however, the author's text is mean spirited.

Certainly, the author adds many personal stories to the book, but actual content about Post 86 Fiesta is lacking. The photographs in the book leave much to be desired. The colors are not true and vary from picture to picture in the book itself. A true book about Post 86 Fiesta should include complete listings of all items available. The section on decal and specilaty pieces, i.e. the Warner Brothers Fiesta, is sadly lacking in information. For example, there is no information on what pieces where done with the image of Scooby Doo. Sadly, what could have been an excellent resource book for the Post 86 Fiesta collector is lost in a world of stories, poor photography, and side-line commentary by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"It looks cute but it is cheap plastic and a piece of paper for the picture, very chinsy looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"twice the price","review":"Seasons 1-4 individually: $16.99Season 5 : $21.99Total Individually: $89.95Now, what was that price again? $174.99?riiiiight"},{"rating":"2","title":"South Park rules but box set is $20 more","review":"I placed all the single volumes in the cart and the total price ($156) was $20 less than what this box set is priced at now ($175).

It presupposes that the reader is well aquainted with Gramsci's notion of mass media and the Frankfurt school borne out of this belief of hegemony perpectuated by a controlling elite. The author also takes liberty that the reader is aquainted with research methods using coding to differentiate subjects responses to pictures portrayed. Lastly, the author's use of interviewing technics and the subsequent interpretation of those responses enables the reader the opportunity to realize how the geographic and social background of the readers influence the perceptions people have when encountering this quasi-scientific journal. As an anthropological study this book illuminates the ethnocentric idealations of the Geographic's demographic readership, that is upper middle and middle class white euroamericans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break...","review":"Quite simply, I don't buy into 90% of the authors claims, and the authors seemed to be completely blinded by their own preconcieved ideas that they can't be at all objective in their interpretation of the subject matter.Ultimately, this books is nothing more than rhetoric about \\"white male dominated racist Western culture\\".The authors clearly had this notion in mind when they wrote this book, and it taints virtually the entire book to the point where their conclusions aren't even remotely believable as being the result of objective research."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO LOUD!","review":"Bought this clock to hang in my son's nursery.

The brush is also difficult to fold/unfold because the rubber base material is very stiff. After a few weeks of use the bristles have already begun to snap off, and the rubber base has completely split (see uploaded image).

They are great - simply elegant to go with your decor, heavy and thick walled for durability, and the right porportions for kitty use. They go in the dishwasher for cleaning and sanitizing and right back on the floor for breakfast/supper. One negative - if you use one of those abrasive pads, even the one for the glass, you'll scratch the glaze up. A good 10 minute soak in hot-hot water will loosen up any stuck-on food and you can wash them right up for the next meal. They're heavy enough that kitty can't drag them across the floor too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about a book","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a book about a book (3:16). The last chapter and the panel discussion form the meat of the book. What is more, existence of God is an axiom, and words like \\"God' will\\", \\"God's children\\" are tossed around frequently. If you are uncomfortable with that and have come to this book hoping that a world reknowned computer scientist would share his thoughts on these fundamental questions (such as whether God exists and if He does, does he have a plan for us etc.), you would be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"My husband uses this when we go on vacation and it keeps his insulin downright cool all day long.

First, the thing weighs more than a solid lead plate and is made of the finest paper with the best color reproductions I've ever seen outside of an expensive art book, so it is well worth the money in just the quality alone. But turn in to the oversized pages and you will find the densest, most detailed information on these four \\"black\\" planes you will find anywhere. I have many books on the SR-71 and a few on the F-117, but these contain far more information than any other titles I own, plus way more incredible photos. There are more pictures on the B-2 than I've seen in all other books combined! \\"Blueprint\\"-style illustrations show full layouts of planes, and wing/squadron information and color patches are also displayed.There are so many small details covered it isn't even funny. This book is simply mind-blowing from cover to cover for the airplane enthusiast. I expect to be reading this over and over for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"I really liked this book. The pictures are great and there is alot of good history on the development of the airplanes. Plus the diagrams and the list of units using the aircraft add some extra pop that you do not normally see in other books. Some good companion books for related planes are The Skunk Works by Ben Rich and Lockheed Stealth by Bill Sweetman."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's by the Gaiman.

Marvel heroes in the age of Elizabeth? But this series really delivers. There are dozens of characters, so there's a good chance that your favorite character gets significant treatment, but more importantly, the story is fresh and exciting, with just the right combination of mystery and intrigue. I especially liked how the books focused on the characters, their relationship to each other and to their time, and not just on set fight-pieces, which, in my opinion, dominate too many superhero comics. The action sequences are there and they're good, but they don't distract from a terrific story. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel","review":"bought for my son, and by his comments the book is fantastic! Now he wants more!

The fact that I had a second though about whether or not to capitalize that last phrase should tell you where I stand w.r.t. comic culture. The book it an interesting take on the characters and the history that the book covers.My limited knowledge of the bulk of the characters comes from the movies put out by Hollywood and I could smile at the re-figuration of the myths surrounding the characters and Gaiman handled the melding of the actual historical fact of the comics with the created history in an interesting manner.A small problem in basic understanding might arise if you have little familiarity with English history of the period or the history of the Church in Europe and Asia, but the acts of the plot are not entirely dependent on this knowledge. Overall, a fine way to pass an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"To my knowledge this is the only Marvel book Gaiman has written. It makes me wish he'd written more, I'll try to be spoiler free so here's the bare bones concept: For some reason the famous silver age characters of marvel are coming into being in the seventeenth century.There's a lot of puns and nods and gags based on continuity.Most of the characters get a great representation in the story. Two are a bit under used or used in a way that would disappoint die-hard fans of the characters: Spider-Man and Hulk.It should be noted that Peter Parker though does get a lot of character time though, but Banner is in the background for much of the story.If you're a fan of Marvel comics and have more than a bare passing knowledge of the continuity you should check this story out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to a Nap !!!","review":"This one starts slow and ends slow...a big zero in the energy department!!

So in order to play I will have to find an old version of windows, repartition my hard drive and dual boot my computer. The description should advise you of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME BUT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER.","review":"I love this game. It's very addictive, once you learn how to play it. There are some things that could be added to improve on the fun. Like having an experience rating for fighter squadrons (like Rogue Squad or the IMP 181ST), capitol ships, and other forces. Also, having more characters to start out with, as well as increasing the character lineup so there are alot more wouldn't hurt. Having to deal w/ main characters as spies that join your side would also be cool. You should also be able to combine your squadrons after taking losses. Having alist of names for ships, squadrons and other forces would be helpful for those that like to name their ships from STAR WARS databases. And for those more tactically minded Grand Admirals, better battles couldn't hurt, including: improved space battles,having planetary bombardments, and having planetary assaults. These are some of my suggestions, otherwise this is a must for all SW fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"another misused label","review":"I've had Rebellion for quite a while now and I'm still not quite too sure how the game works. It seems like a couple of the things that you could do that were advertised are completely nonexistant. Also, the game requires you to have some amazing micromanagement skills to play when you get near the end of the game. All those windows that pop up while you play won't make things any better. Perhaps the worst part of this game is the so called \\"space combat\\". The graphics, the controls and the concept of being only able to maneuver in a cube are grossly outdated even when the game came out. Yet for some twisted reason, once in a while, I'll get a feeling that I want to play the game, unfortunately this feeling will stop when I launch the program and all the bad memories come flooding back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Game","review":"This one is an oldy but goody, to be sure. It certainly doesn't possess the technology of today's games (one can still hold out hope of there maybe someday being an updated sequel...), but it is the only Star Wars game of it's kind. This strategy game emcompasses not just one army or one world, but the entire galaxy!You have to use worlds with high resources to boost your supplies, use diplomacy to gain the support of more planets, and build up armies of space ships to defend your planets and conquor your opponent. The ultimate game of conquest, don't expect to complete this game quick! The first time I played it all the way through it took me a couple months, playing for an hour or so each day! The game requires patience and dedication, but if that's your cup of tea, you will be well rewarded with Rebellion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I expected a lot more from this game.

Much like the upcoming Force Commander. Also, a lot of characters and ships to command. multiplayer is fully supported, and you can chose your difficuty, galaxy size, and play both sides. The empires forces do seem not much larger than the rebels. Also, the idea of force rulling is made impossible by the rebellions on the planets. You get several permanent characters, plus some radomly selected ones too. You can also recruit and send people on missions, like rescues and assasination attempts. Overall, a good game.

Iggy Pop fans may enjoy this one since it seems most of the recordings were made out of love and respect for this rock'n'roll icon. Many of the artists covering Iggy tunes on this cd are ones I have had the privilige of seeing play live and know they have a certain reverence concerning Iggy's music. This is what constitutes a good tribute for an artist. A few of Iggy's lesser known tunes are on this and thats cool.

When Jim Henson tragically died on my birthday in 1990, the world lost a genius. The Muppets now a days aren't as funny as they used to be, and Jim Henson's loss is the reason for this.

From ancient China to modern day Britain he emphasizes that cultural traits and values, rather than resources are what make or break a country. Landes argues that those countries which value ingenuity, thrift, hard work, etc. have consistently surpassed others throughout history. Candid and sometimes quite hilarious, he writes in a way that makes world history incredibly interesting. For all seeking to understand macroeconomics and its applications to nation-building this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to have on the shelf.","review":"I started this book with great relish, but found myself skimming faster and faster as the centuries progressed. It's chock-a-block with pertinent comments and interesting history, and the reader who follows Landes' innumerable footnotes will find no end of fascinating trivia, but what's lacking is a central thesis. We read what happened, but we don't gain any theoretical tools to learn why. Most disppointing for a book completed in 1997 is that the whole matter of globalization is summarily dismissed. The final chapter, begins with the premise that \\"...we have become a world of nation-states....\\" This is more true than not, but Landes is ignoring one of the most interesting trends of our day -- that the nation-states of the world are clearly losing their autonomous control over economic matters. I'm sure I'll refer to this book frequently for historical background, but as a read-through, it was far from satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting economic world history","review":"This is a very interesting economic world history. It is clearly written and can be enjoyed by the general public, as well as by historians. Professor Landes, shows why the poor countries of this world are the way they are. He makes a strong case for the importance of cultural factors, as well as the existence of the rule of law and of a non-corrupt government as factors that make nations rich. It is no accident that Japan, with little in the way of natural resources, is wealthy, while many countries in Africa that are blessed with greater natural resources are so poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' economic determinist bile!","review":"The last time I checked, the \\"progressive\\" nations and the sick industrial complex that props them up were grovelling at the feet of the boys with the big money caps.

Basiscally western culture's prosperity was built on the back of free labour provided by the slave trade, the conquering of indigenous peoples (including the American indian) and generally the rape and pillage of economic resources of a large part of the world.Mr. Landes neglets the fact that the countries that industrialised during the industrial revolution all had the economic benefit of colonial resources. Those former colonies today trying to industrialise don't have this particular \\"cultural\\" advantage of having areas to conquer and exploit.Sorry this book is at best naive, at worst self serving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Europe is great!

I am lucky because I only read a copy from library . I pity those of you who have to pay from your wallet to get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for real scholarship look eslewhere","review":"This book is a horrible and pretentious work of historical fiction. Poor Mr. Landes, as an Ivy league history professor, has vested so much of his life teaching and perpetuating Euro-centric history. I am sure it now infuriates him that real scholarship has destroyed this neo-colonial view of the world. This book proves that he will go to any lengths now to justify this Victorian perception of history. He really needs to lift his own veil of ignorance and racism and admit that those cute little Asians ( whose little fingers make them so adapt to work with small parts)did have one or two great ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"bigotry embedded in economics/history","review":"I am struck by how a \\"respected\\" author can resort to flagrant bigotry of other cultures, specifically Arab-Muslim culture, e.g. reference to boys having \\"golden penises\\". It is crass, uncouth, and resorts to anti-Arab stereotypes. Would such crass stereotypes be made of other ethnicities, the book and author would have been excoriated- not so here.It is really part and parcel of the systematic denigration of Arab-Muslim culture that one finds in such bigots as David Pryce-Jones, Mark Steyn, Daniel Pipes and Victor David Hanson and other neocons who are putative experts in Arab culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.","review":"Okay, I have to admit I haven't finished reading this book yet.BUT I have one small thing I must point out. When Landes discusses the quincentary of Columbus' landing (in 1992), he implies that \\"celebrations\\" of the European discovery of the New World were totally quashed due to being seen as politically incorrect.One of the specific examples he cites was the \\"1492\\" exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, which he describes as \\"ABC--Anything But Columbus.\\" Uh--I WENT to that exhibition, and it was ONE-THIRD European art (in addition to 1/3rd Asian and 1/3rd Pre-Columbian). Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!I know it's a small point, but I think it illustrates that a) the author has a tendency to rely on his faulty memory instead of the actual facts and b) he does so because he is eager to push his own views.I'm being nice by suggesting it's faulty memory rather than outright lying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Very good book. Logical, factual and thorough research. The conclusions are not tinted by political opinions. Gives an honest, even maybe harsh, reasoning behind the current state of economic developments throughout the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serpent eats its tail.","review":"If, as Landes says, tolerance was what made the West great, then his book shows we are reaching the end.Yes, the West may have possessed -- and seized -- some of the assets that led to its triumph. But there's an even more important question than why the West dominates today's global economy: Is that economy (which is wasteful in resources, natural and human) sustainable? If not, we may have more to learn from other cultures than Landes recognizes.Contrary to Landes, multiculturalism is not totalitarian \\"political correctness\\" (red-baiting pun on Parti Communiste); it's an urgent attempt to learn, for those with keen eyes and ears not just loud voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"book is a personal commentary, but not good history","review":"This book is a commentary, and however amusing it may be to some, it is not \\"good history\\".Landes brutally manipulates his citations throughout to support his views, which are so eurocentric and narrow minded that they are frequently insulting to anyone of intelligence. Scholors aware of relevent facts so obviously ignored will be frustrated, and those without this level of knowledge will be frightfully misinformed.Don't let the number of citations fool you; this is not reliable information despite the author's Harvard credentials. In an effort to sell another book, he bulldozes over the truth and fertilizes his garden of bunk to feed his sensationalized thesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book of great integrity","review":"Landes shows very convincingly, that cultural values have a large influence on the economic success of a society. Explaining somebody why he is poor, in contrast to yourself, is generally not received very well, as is evident from some of the comments. But a good medicine may be bitter! Landes clearly shows that, although not everything can be controlled, there are cultural values that do make a possitive difference: education, curiosity, a liberal spirit, and hard work, and that there are human vices that drag down any society: corruption, fanaticism, narrowmindedness, intolerance, laziness, racism, lack of responsibility. Just look at Africa! Spanish and Portugese readers will get tears in their eyes when reading this book; it must be embarrassing. To those who want to learn some hard but good lessons: read Landes' book and go for it. The rest can go back to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"I would say this book is one of the five best I've ever read. I has a large amount of insight and shows up the poor analysis of some other economic historians. I found it fascinating, and it taught me a lot. Many of the political and economic leaders today could stand to read this and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY FUNNY !","review":"Mr. Landes started this job already with a definited purpose: to make poor people accept the fact that they are poorer because they are dummier. Since the beginning of the book, Landes tries to demonstrate his \\"theories\\" about the white civilization superiority above the rest. In other words, North is better than SOuth. The book is full of prejudice, hidden meanings, pro-liberalism. One step more and we could have listened the American anthem playing on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book does not answer the question posed in the title","review":"Rather than discussing the \\"why?\\" most of the emphasis of this book is on the \\"how\\". Overall it is fairly entairtaining but lacks cohessivness. The authors seems to be very selective in the statistics he uses. It is very dishartening that a presumed scholarly work fails to follow the simplest rules of scientific investigation. If the answer to the question still intrigues you, I sugest that you buy a different book. Guns, germs and steel by Jared Diamond is far superior and rigourous in its approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading","review":"This is one of the most narrow analyses of history that I have ever read. The author deals with an extremely selective range of history and rather than seeking answers to the question posed, the book is a pulpit for the author's personal opinions which are passed of as historical inevitibility. It is the worst kind of history - result based and biased. The author seems to endorse every historian prior to 1940 - basically colonial, while dismissing any modern analysis as tainted by political correctness. Lots of facts, no analysis and a mere expression of opinion- a much better book on the topic is Jared Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel, which takes a much broader view and offers scientific fact based causes rather than vague \\"culture\\" for disparity in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"A thick book, nicely written and full of information. I could notput this book down once I opened it. It will be of use in mynext college course on international relations. I do recommendthis book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallowness masquerading as intellectual depth","review":"This book provides an OK overview of the divergent economic histories of Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa. The author basically argues that Europe (and now the US) has triumphed in economic competition primarily because of superior culture, economic policies, and institutions. As a pretty conservative believer in the need for free markets and other spurs to innovation and effort, I can support that. However, the author constantly overgeneralizes and presents his own ill-informed prejudices as substantiated analysis. The real kicker is this: he claims the recent success of Taiwanese and Korean firms in high-tech manufacturing is due to manual dexterity gained from years of eating with chopsticks.For a much more worthwhile (if intellectually challenging) book on this subject, read Michael Porter's \\"Competitive Advantage of Nations.\\" After reading that book, you will feel like you really learned something profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"tripe","review":"Chief problems with Mr. Landes' oeuvre are not its' amazing dishonesty, lack of basic erudition or blatant racism (although he's got a good deal of racism that amply compensates for other deficiencies, such as the lack of sound historic knowledge). Main problem with this book is the terrible fact that it actually became (very) successful. It sells well. That is a real pity, because the Wealth and Poverty is an imposter-sort of book. It pretends to be what it is clearly not. Like being a good history book.The Wealth and Poverty of Nations is an ideological propaganda piece. Like other works of this genre, it carries main ideological concept (dogma, belief, albeit an irrational one) and \\"supporting material\\". Because it is virtually impossible to prove this kind of ideological belief from scientific standpoint, beliefs are beliefs, and facts and figures are lacking, then other methods are applied. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a serious book, mostly subjective","review":"The author pretends to spend hundreds of pages giving his \\"opinion\\" on why some nations are rich and others are poor, but in reality he judges from his own subjective opinion the history of the nations, without any serious criteria. For instance, when comparing the spanish conquest of Mexico and South America, and the British conquest of North America, he says \\"If I had been a native, I would have preferred to be killed by an english than by a spaniard\\". The rest of the book is like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because Europeans are Superior","review":"Old wine in new bottle.It is not in the genes - it is in the memes.Boring............"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eurocentric hogwash!","review":"This is the least radical history book written in the last half century.

The work is mostly rhetoric. Though I agree with some of his conclusions but his arguments are almost always fellacious. This is my first history reading and I have almost no background on the subject. Still after few chapters it became clear that the book does not meet the criteria of an academic writing. It is a shame for Harvard that Landes carries its credentials!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"We're reading this in my Business in World History class.

Comprehensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a load of crap!","review":"It seems that Landes' idea of scholarship is forming a theory first and THEN find all the evidence/stories that support that theory and ignore the rest. So, medieval Europe was actually a crucible of ideas, compared to the rest of the world, because of the invention of the eyeglasses and the clock. And due to utilizing animal power, Europe didn't need as many people and hence had lower population density. This may be true, except Landes hasn't given out any evidence. One can easily counter argue that it had less people because of its lower productivity could support less people. This is true of many of the other assertions in the book.Bottom line: biased writer with shoddy scholarship. If you want a good euro-centric read, I recommend The Rise of the West instead. McNeill at least is knowledgeable and insightful within his area of expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amaizingly poor historic review","review":"History analysis will always require knowledge, basic fairness and certain degree of logic, to properly dig into all the conflicting sources.Mr Landes may well have the very first of all these basic points, so as some fairness to his account of history, if just for a few parts of his long book.On the third one, we can only wonder how can he possibly assume as certain, facts based on such thin historical support, to say the least. The whole book seems filled with an amaizingly unsupported conclusions, varnished with a coat of historic references.Regretably, !84 pages! of bibliography does not necessary add to some historic logic.Is not that WASP thinking is wrong. It's the need to force conclusions, 500 pages filled with them, which may well be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of prejudice.","review":"I found this book full of prejudice, full of value judgements,and only slightly scientific. I would only like to put out this question,was Spain responsible of the poverty of all South Europe, Center- and South-America ? Fortunely there are much more historians who go beyond this limited book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I am extremely disappointed by this book. I wonder how a renowned scholar could write such a bad book. The book contains some interesting (anecdotal) facts but totally inadequate to support the author's grand theory about why some countries are so rich and some are so poor. Reading this book is a torture (if not an insult to your intelligence) - it is full of anecdotal facts, unsupported theories, unbearable conclusions, and, to make it worse, full of Eurocentric prejudice. I think the comments made by Faruk Ekmekci (March 30, 2005) sums it up very well -- this book is a science (I am not sure I can call it a science) of obsolescence... I would recommend those who are interested in this subject read the books recommended in Frank Ekmekci's comments instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"an alternate title: Culture and Progress","review":"If you are interested in the question of how it was that western Europe and then the United States led the world in developing science and technology, and are now consequently leading the world in economic development, then this book is for you. For example, what were the social and cultural conditions that allowed the Industrial Revolution to happen first in Britain? What was different in China, or in France? Geography plays a role, but so do many other factors. By comparing and contrasting western Europe and the United States with other cultures, David Landes suggests some answers.I loved this book!My only complaint is that the author does not always write in complete sentences. Some missing verbs. Others are missing other parts of speech, such as nouns, conjunctions. However, other readers have found this style refreshing, so it must be a matter of taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Summary Of The State Of The World","review":"This book must rate as one of my all time favourite works of non-fiction. As a western expatriate with nine years experience of third world countries, this book explains the atrocious state of countries such as India, and the lamentable state of the whole African nation.If you want to read unvarnished truth, read this book, if you prefer political correctness, stick to comic books. This book talks of the state that the world is in now-and the reasons for it, and does not waste space talking about how we would like the world to be.A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I found the title of this book quite misleading as the narrative fails to answer that very question. There is no clear thesis and argumentation and the book is rather a long series of individual stories in praise of the achievements of Western culture or heartbreaking accounts of the misery elsewhere (the Japanese wife!).My two stars are for the fact that I still found some of the stories well researched and interesting seen by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is absolutely brilliant and thought provoking.","review":"I read this book after reading Paul Johnson's \\"History of the American People\\" and I wish I had read this book as a prelude. The two books absolutely complement each other. David Landes writes in a very clear easy to understand manner. It is a very enlightening explanation of how the World's economys evolved through history. It is done in such a manner in which I have never had it explained to me by any previous professors or teachers. If more teachers could teach Economics, Social History and World History like this more students would be excited about these subjects. Every student or world citizen should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of prejudice, no big conclusions","review":"Your read, and read, and read, and you wonder: what is the conclusion of the writer? I don't know. What is his \\"great\\" theory to explain the tittle of the book? I don't know. Yes, it was great research for a accomplished historian, but nothing more than that. It superficial, full of prejudice (like...\\"North is better, that's why people move to it . It is true, but why? The question is not answered!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Calvinist Determinism","review":"The problems with Mr. Landes' book are many.First, he absurd cultural and religious determinism accomplishes little more than stoking the fires of already rampant antipathy. What little historical merit this book might contain is swamped by the Landes' insipid and hackneyed tropes of Calvinist value supremacy. Anyone seeking to read the basis for the next in a long and infamous line of Western self-concratulatory texts should pick up Weber, \\"Protestant Ethic.\\"Second, Landes' whitewashing of European and American military and economic imperialism allows him to pity LDCs for their cultural inadequacy alone. Forutantely, he offers the salvation of the neo-liberal economic paradigm and of Christian values (as if either of these would prevent IMF austerity measures or the landing of the 81st airborne).Why read the whole book, when you can manufacture the idea from your weekly sermon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This book compares very poorly with the entertaining and well thought out Guns,Germs and Steel. Landes book is a anectodotal ramble. It contains little in the form of a central thesis or argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent text tying together Economics and World History","review":"David Landes is an enjoyable story teller and writes in a very readable manner. He explains, with amply researched proofs, why various countries have developed the way they have. I learned alot about world history as well as economics and how geography, culture and government have all interacted in the world to explain the economic history of the world, why some countries are rich and others are poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview of How Societies Developed Differently","review":"This book was my favorite book in university. It goes over how the different societies of Eurasia developed differently, and how they ended up in vastly different places. Who knows if it's right or not, but it is VERY well written and the argument is logical. I recommend this book for anybody who likes modern world history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing to the max!","review":"I fell in love with the Music of the Spheres wind chimes after seeing them on display at Silver Dollar City. They are 'quality built' and have such a soothing, clean sound. Yes, they do cost more than your average wind chimes. But the resulting sound is worth every extra penny. Amazon had the best price I could find on the internet. The only difficulty was choosing which one to go for. I chose the Alto. I'll be saving my money to buy a Tenor next year. Treat yourself and get one of these wind chimes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get rid of the \\"Assault Gunboat\\" and you've got a good game!","review":"There's some great game play involved in \\"Tie Fighter\\". If you loved \\"Star Wars\\" and would love to take part in it too, then this is a game for you. You can get some wonderful stella dog-fight action and have plenty of interesting missions to choose from supported by a not too imposing story line. My only complaint about it is that for far too many of the missions you have to use the \\"Assault Gunboat\\" which is basically a slow piece of junk with no fire power and weak shields. It doesn't even look like a Tie fighter and it's presence in the game is unnecessary! Whoever designed the game thought it would be really neat to have the \\"Assault Gunboat\\" in it, but it's actually really naff. Somewhat of a disappointment as it is almost impossible to do any of the missions without geting blown up. It would be much beter if you could decide for yourself what you want to use. Get rid of the \\"Assault Gunboat\\" and you've got a good game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated graphics...Outdated sound...Just Outdated!!","review":"I'd like to consider myself a Star Wars fan, so I was looking forward to getting this game. Even though, I was expecting \\"okay\\" graphics, I thought \\"it can't be that bad\\". But after watching the opening sequence, I have concluded that this is by far one of the worst Star Wars games, in regards to graphics, that I have ever seen. It was enough to turn me off completely and curse the day that I had bought the game. Even the music, one of the things that makes Star Wars \\"STAR WARS\\", is horrible. Forget the orchestra! You'd be lucky enough to get a synthesizer!! *Please note: this review is based on graphics and sound alone. I am still in the disappointment phase so I haven't really gotten into the storyline of the game. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan and can tolerate crappy graphics/sound, buy this game... at your own risk! If not, don't waste your time or money. In either case, you'd have more fun playing with the actual toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from being Ultimate at all","review":"It's no secret I'm not much of a fan of Marvel's Ultimate line (besides Mark Millar's Ultimates that is), and this collection (which collects the 4 issue mini-series of the same name) helps me prove my point. Taking place in Marvel's Ultimate universe before Matt Murdock became the horned vigilante and Elektra became a cold hearted assassin, this mini-series is an origin story/love story turned tragic; but the story doesn't go anywhere special, and while writer Greg Rucka is a solid writer in his own right, his story just can't compare with Frank Miller's epic, classic saga of years back. The art by X-Treme X-Men artist Salvador Larrocca is his typical style while he makes Elektra look simply gorgeous. This book also contains issue #9 of the regular Daredevil title by David Mack and Joe Quesada which is the beginning of the \\"Parts of a Hole\\" story. I suggest picking up that book instead of this one, and leave this in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!","review":"This game had me in stiches the second I started watching the intro, and it only gets better. Truelly one of the best games I have ever played, I have yet to find a game that makes me laugh as much as this one does. Add to that spectacular, beautifully animated graphics, easy interface and awesome characters (I especially digged that \\"scary\\" skull, Murray), not to mention an amazing musical score, folks, we have a winner here. Treat yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short","review":"I thaught this game was an exelent third part to the triliogy, unfortunately it was to short to hold my attention. Certain neccecary items are almost inpossable to find, but if you backtrack they come around. The quirkeyness and graphics are its greatest atributes. I would recomend this only to those who are die hard fans, and if you have seen Lucas's films. You may be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pallid imitation of what once made the series great.","review":"Just about everything that made the first two games in the Monkey Island series great is missing in The Curse of Monkey Island. The Curse of Monkey Island isn't downright awful or completely without worth--it is a thoroughly polished and professional game. It simply has nothing to do with the games that came before beyond the names of the main characters. The characters seem like different people, the nature of the puzzles is different, the artistic style doesn't seem to work for the game, and the game seems overall quite dreary and less lively than the others in the series. It even does its best to ignore the ending of LeChuck's Revenge (the second game in the series), which anyone who played that game should know shouldn't be possible. The Curse of Monkey Island is best played by those who either didn't play or have no memory of the first two superior games in the series. This one simply cannot compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series","review":"All three games from Monkey Island are great, but this one is the best. It is witty, funny, has unique characters and the graphics are so well made. And who doesn't love pirates!

The Rock Climb segment is a condensed version that originally came from the Hard Bodies DVD. The Naughty Neighbors segment was the same as the Karen McDougal-Daphnee Duplaix segment in the Girls Next Door: Naughty & Nice DVD. Even the Virtual Girl segment with Shauna Sand came from the same DVD.Of the remaining segments, only one segment called Touch TV was really good, with some nice girl-girl action.For those interested in this title, rent it first before considering to buy it. If this is your first Playboy DVD purchase, then all of the segments will appear as new to you, and it might not be a bad purchase for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorcraft condenser","review":"The same part you would buy from your Ford dealer at a much cheaper price.

Then I unplugged everything to install a stereo cabinet and put the components in the cabinet. Once assembled, I plugged the HTS 3600 back to the same wall outlet. No lights came on. A couple of minutes later I smelled and saw smoke. It had burned itself up. It hadn't even been turned \\"on\\" or had any components plugged to it yet. I won't buy Monster again to manage power, it can't even handle being plugged in!Also noted: the Monster looks good but feels cheap. Plugs from components fit very loose in the the HTS 3600 outlets and I also noticed that the outlets themselves are flexible in the HTS 360 - like they are only screwed in from above but not below so the whole plate that holds the outlets bends upward a bit as you plug in a component."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome power center","review":"I wanted to get the best, and here it is. I have not seen another unit like this, and it really does work to the advertised. While a bit on the pricey side, compared to others, I figured that my system was worth it. We live in an area where the power is fairly clean, but the override and filtering of this unit are superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Useless & Unreliable","review":"My girlfriend got this as part of a home theatre system. It failed after about a year, leaving the whole system dead. The internal power supply had melted down. It's really low tech inside. Basically, this is just a fancy voltmeter with some small surge absorbers and filter networks inside a large bulky cabinet. A cheap $30 surge absorber/power distribution strip from Walmart works just as well and is probably 10X more reliable. As far as the filtering, it's a complete waste of money, since all new electronics equipment must already meet stringent FCC regulations for electrical noise emissions. Don't waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Job","review":"I bought two Monster HTS 3600's to protect my stereo. One of them blew up 30 days after the warranty ran out for no apparent reason. I wish I had understood the warranty was only a year. The length of the warranty is not on the Amazon site. Clearly I should have done more research. Buyer beware --- and wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!","review":"WARNING - this product is a piece of junk. I've owned this model for 15 months now, and recently it's begun to hum terribly loud. The humminng / buzzing is constant at considerable volume. It's so loud one can hear it over the stereo and TV.

I don't know about the internals, but the exterior is plasticy on the 1800 whereas this feels like a tank. You can adjust the brightness of the voltage meter, but not the other led lights on the front which are distracting when the lights are off. That is my only gripe however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work just fine!","review":"I wont get into the debate as to whether or not there is a noticeable difference in picture or sound quality. I bought a new TV (70\\" Sharp) and Receiver (Onkyo TX-NR 809) and wanted to make sure that I had a good power/surge protector.When this unit came up for a Gold Box deal, it seemed like a no brainer. I paid less than $100 more than what a basic surge suppressor was going to cost me. My biggest worry was the \\"hum\\" some people had to deal with. I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and I haven't noticed anything.The unit has a pretty long main power cord which allows a lot of flexibility as to where to put it. I really like all the power outlets and then add to it the insurance if something does get fried.....I'll add to this review if anything else arises, but so far it works as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic animation","review":"Once again, a wonderful story animated beautifully!

NOT!Alchi is every bit as sophisticated, refined and important as the Sistine Chapel, the Pompei frescoes, etc. that we in the West are already familiar with.Seeing Alchi in person blows you away - you're amazed that something this precious and beautiful exists, and, miraculously, has survived so many chances at oblivion. Go to see it - or, failing that, buy this book. You can't take pictures inside anyway, so either way, buy this book.

Sidebars of information are included giving growing tips and historical lore for selecting the best-tasting heirlooms for each recipe. Davis-Hollander uses carefully selected and saved tomato seeds to produce exquisite tomatoes for his exotic recipes.

I did tire of the endless-seeming arguments against the rationalists who think in terms of a unified universe, however; I know that giving them a bad time was the point of James's book, but about halfway through his arguments began to seem polemical to me and I almost got bored. Nevertheless, I do recommend this, especially if you're looking into the radically empirical and pluralistic side of the philosophical house."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was horrible","review":"you took a good movie that was made a long time a go and you totally screwed it all up..

Mick covers new ground with new ideas and new ways to look at traditional improv thought ie Truth in Comedy. It cleared up so much that I found foggy about my formal training and provided me with so much to move forward with. This book is a must for anyone with a desire for quality work. Well done Mick. My thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvise","review":"In this irreverent, honest, and no nonsense how-to-tome, Mike Napier offers candid advice to beginners. He also does a fantastic job of putting gas in the tank of every longtime improvisor who may feel stuck or ready to move in a different direction. My favorite chapter includes at home exercises sure to fine-tune your improvisation technique. Improvise is a fantastic tool when you can't practice regularly with a group.Dallas Travers, Author of \\"The Tao of Show Business - Actor's Edition\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Napier","review":"Is among the best teachers of any topic, period. Buy this book, you young improv kids moving to Chicago, you'll look way less stupid. I promise. Also, Mick once forced himself on a neighborhood stray dog. That is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it is","review":"I read this book while I was taking an improv class, in order to help me with my scene work. If you can get past the author's rambling (it would probably have been a 10 page book but for the pages of stream-of-consciousness writing), it is clear that the author has a great deal of improv experience. Many of his suggestions come from a beginner's point of view, which is very helpful. It also is based on the concept \\"truth in improv\\" and shows the reader that it is not necessary to be funny, but merely to be something. I would suggest this book for anyone who is trying their hand at improv and needs help getting out of their head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for new improvisers","review":"I was not impressed with this book. I think there is a lot of advice here that is bad for new improvisers. It may be useful for more experienced improvisers to give them ideas of something else to do and think about while on stage. I've never seen the author perform, but his transcripts of \\"good\\" improv scenes sound like boring ones. It's a lot of people standing around asking questions to each other until they figure out what the scene is about. I prefer to \\"get to it\\" more quickly. I found the tone of the writing very patronizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Experience","review":"The order process was fast and I received the book in a timely fashion. I would do business with this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a strong book for the advanced improviser","review":"There is a depressing lack of books written for the advanced improviser. It is not too hard to find books for the beginning improviser, and there are some that benefit the improviser, no matter the skill level (Johnstone's Impro, in particular). I read Improvise about a year ago, right at the time that I found myself thinking the same thoughts as those that Napier puts forward: there is too much stress put on the \\"rules of improv\\" as impenetrable commandments. Napier postulates that over-stressing these rules actually get an improviser more 'in their head' and out of the scene, limiting their capability to react moment by moment to what's actually happening moment by moment.Clever and to the point, I recommend Improvise for improvisers of any level - though its usefulness to the advanced improviser ought not to be underestimated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book is great for anyone venturing into the world of improv and I've had Mick as a teacher before so the man knows what he is talking about. The book has some games for the improviser to practice by themselves and hone your skills a bit. For example you will be asked to come up with at least five objects in the room and remember where they are, because if you are in a scene you need to know where you placed the damn things so you don't walk through them. Believe me the audience will know where you put the large shark pit you made up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Came just in time","review":"I'm about to start directing in my professional improv troupe, and this book came just in time.

It made me feel alive. There were surprising insights and emotional discoveries in every chapter. I admire and respect Dick York for being so honest. It's obvious he had a huge heart. The four themes of this book are basic to being human: love, loss, survival, and hope. If any of those themes interest you, I say read this book and live life in Dick York's shoes for a while. You'll be enriched and inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected. Illuminating. Ennobling.","review":"An irreverent first-hand account of the life and times of a uniquely gifted man. As a fan of Bewitched, I was glad to see this book available in print. It makes a great addition to any classic TV fan's collection. My only wish is that it had included more behind-the-scenes info on the Bewitched set, but he can hardly be faulted for not focusing on one small aspect of a long and varied career.What struck me most about this book was Dick York's candor. The unflinching way he lays his life bare is most refreshing. Clearly, he was as open and honest with himself, as he was with others. In a strange sort of way, this book taught me almost as much about myself, as it did about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"An extremely moving and searingly candid account of a life lived among peaks and valleys.

I love Bewitched and I liked York's portrayal of Darrin very much, far more than Sargent's, but the man was out there in real life. It is very hard to follow this book, see or understand his growth and development. It is very hard to understand what the story is in this book. And as a father of four, I have to say that while York's trying to help others is commendable, charity begins at home and he should have been more concerned with providing for his family, rather than letting tenants skip on their rent month after month until the family lost everything. It is just difficult to make something out of this book. But if this was his real self, he was a brilliant actor because his portrayal of Darrin is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this CD for a special church project involving kids.

This is not the case with this drink holder. I searched around a bit to find a metal drink holder, in this style, because I have had that type before, and they work fine. I gave up trying to find a metal one and bought this one instead. I installed it and took out out for a test ride. The cup holder slips into the plastic mount. Unfortunately, there is no way to make it stay in the plastic mount. On the first bump the cup holder came out of the mount and Pepsi was everywhere. I guess I could use an industrial strength glue and permanently attach it to the mount, but I shouldn't have to. It should stay put together until I want to take it apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Good for a Lesser Known Brand","review":"The deciding factor in purchasing this unit, which should be more widely publicized: there is noticably less movement blur. The refresh time on this unit is 5 ms, not 8 ms, as in most other current units.The picture is startling sharp, as sharp as any I have seen. 900 x 1400 resolution, not the 768 x whatever on most other units. I live within a mile of the broadcast tower, and I am amazed at the quality of the picture--using fifteen year-old rabbit ears!Perhaps some oversaturation of the colors, but this should be easily corrected, as the television offers a choice of \\"viewing modes\\", as well as the ability to individually correct the colors.Obviously, after three days, I cannot report on the durability of this unit. So far, I am very pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This TV is a lemon","review":"I purchased this TV about 9 months ago. I turned it on one morning and the sound came on but the video flashed the Polaroid banner and then went blank. A call to Customer Service was very unhelpful. In hindsight I did web research and found this TV has a sytematic problem with its power board. What a name that is suppose to stand for imaging quality, you would think that Polaroid would show more regards for their reputation and take responsibility for this lemon. Instead they have taken the approach of let the buyer beware. I personally will never purchase another Polaroid product and I will warn as many people as I can. Everybody makes mistake, great company accept responsibility for their mistakes and provide their consumers with an acceptable solution. Polaroid did not take this approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price (& Size) are Right!","review":"Living three flights up tends to limit some of the purchases I make; the Polaroid 19\\" HD TV fit the bill perfectly. At around $200 from 'the Great Wall', it was an absolute bargain in my book, and light as a feather. Not a whit of trouble in set-up, especially with an HD cable system, and it connects so easily to my laptop for better definition when editing digital images.I'd tried 2 other LCD TVs from bigname manufacturers, and both had pixels out as soon as I got them home. Not the Polaroid. Hopefully, this one will last like that TV I bought way back when that hung in there for almost 20 years (and this one is SO much lighter than that behemoth!).Why can't gadgets last like they used to (I'd settle for lasting even half as long, really, but going out anywhere from a day to a month past warranty is simply too suspicious).I'm so impressed, I'm going back for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating tv!","review":"After about 2 years the tv audio would clip out.

After a bit of research online I found that not only was this a problem with this model but that many others felt that dealing with customer service was a nightmare.Yes, it is an inexpensive t.v. But I expect that even an inexpensive t.v. would last longer than 2 years with only occasional use.

We thought it was our cable service - until we turned on a TV in the other room. The periods of time that the sound would cut off got increasingly longer in duration until - eventually - we had no sound at all. We contacted Polaroid. They wanted us to ship it back to them (paying for the shipping) PLUS send them $155.

I think he has done a wonderful job of offering a tremendous amount of info to the reader.I love the fact that the proceeds of this book go to a non-profit organization to help our nation toward disease prevention and wellness care rather than the disease care system we currently have that is skyrocketing daily in both sickness and national debt.I applaude this book and its program to help us americans become healthier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Joe Saves the Day!","review":"When was the last time you read a book thatdesigned by a doctor with your best interest in mind?Devoid of commercialism, this text rocks.Review the comments here carefully...What did the comments from those whoread the book and \\"religiously\\" followed its counsel say?Yes!

If I wanted recipes I'd buy a cookbook. Just a warning to those who are expecting more.Also, the few questions you are asked that tells you if you have a protein, carb, or mixed \\"metabolism\\" you could figure out on your own.

She writes like a seasoned pro. Her historical knowledge of medieval Scotland woven seamlessly with a beautiful love story make this novel a must-have for any die-hard historical romance fan. This novel doesn't just sweep you into another time and place, it transports you there. You can smell the heather and be a part of the Celtic rituals. The love story between Challon and Tamyln - a love story that defied the time period - will make you believe that true love can surmount any obstacles. The author switches gears for her next novel - The Invasion of Falgannon Isle - by writing a contemporary. I, for one, know it will be another winner for my keeper shelf. I have no doubt Ms. MacGillivray could write the phone book and make it an award winning classic. Expect fabulous novels from this writer in the future - she won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I tried to like it, but the characters are not engaging.

I can't really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book. Unfortunately, that was far from the case. I am generally a fan of this genre (who doesn't love a Scottish accent?!?) but found the plot line to be boring and awkward. I did not feel there was any character development. The heroine was stupid and irritating and the hero overbearing and irritating. The paranormal aspects of this novel felt like they had been thrown in at the last second so that this novel could be classified as both paranormal and historical.I also found the writing style of this book to be unpleasant to read. The way and style in which a book is written have just as much (if not more) importance than the plot. Is this a high-school aged author? I am hoping this is an anomaly and that there are not multiple novels available that are this poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"I tried really hard to like this story. In the end, I didn't care about either the hero or the heroine. She was weak and he came off as a jerk. If I had as much power as Tamlyn is suppose to have, I would have turned Julian into a toad, warts and all. It would have been so much better if spells were cast, magical beasts were seen, and more acts of magic performed. But none of that occurred, leaving me very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me restless to read another book","review":"This was a book from my TO BE READ pile and I finally got to reading it, It made me a restless reader since I kept reading only three pages and would get frustrated with the author's ideas about the power of destiny. It seems that the absurdities in the storyline have to be accepted because of destiny. I also did not care for the heroine Tamlyn, for a woman who comes from a clan that has empowered women, she is entirely too submissive and that turned out to be quite annoying. Another annoying idea in this novel was the clan traditions, the traditions got in the way of the romance and character development, due to this the actions of the characters were dictated by the traditions that it made the main couple seem like zombies to destiny (as you can see that again is my point of annoyance) that I did not care what ending was written for the character because destiny had already decided for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get if from the library, if at all.","review":"I realize that some repetition of theme and storyline is an acceptable risk when one reads many books in a single genre. But the things that keeps me reading romance are the different twists an author takes on recycled stories and the individuality of the characters involved, which should never be recycled.I felt like I'd read these characters a million times before, heard the same cliched dialoge twice that much and really didn't care in the slightest what happened to any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wrestless reader","review":"My good buddy Troy loaned me a Deborah Mac Gillivray book last Valentines day and I liked what I read enough to purchase A Restless Knight with my hard earned money. I cant tell you how much I feel let down by this book. The characters are flat and dont act like real people would except for julian, he was a little more real. The ritual under the tree was kinda cool but as someone who has banged a broad under a tree, I can tell you, it aint that grate. Grass itches if you know what I mean.I love romance novels, I really do, but this book just left me hot and bothered with no satisfaction. Writing is hard. I should know, I've been making a living as a author for years now but you really have to try and do a good job when people are paying for your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, I can't finish it","review":"After reading so many glowing reviews of MacGillivray's books, I purchased 'Restless Knight' and delved in. At first, this book had a surface resemblance to Elizabeth Lowell's 'Untamed'. There was the conquering Norman knight and the 'witchy' lady of the manor, who was coerced into marriage for the sake of her people. I loved 'Untamed', but this book wasn't as captivating.I got bored of Challon, the hero, constantly saying, 'I belong'. Saying it once was enough for me. The attempt at a mystical connection to the land and the woman, Tamlyn, was overdone and lacked passion.After page 250, I gave up trying to plow through this book and moved on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oof, couldn't even get halfway through this dreck.","review":"My upstairs neighbor's a huge fan of romance. So when she recommended a 'great author with a lot of authenticity', I was tempted.Lo and behold, the book was written by Deborah MacGillivray. Unfortunately, none of the compliments applied to this book. I myself am equal parts Irish and Scot, and neither of the sides that liked authenticity could find much in the chapters I read...honestly, there's more authenticity in the spelling. I'm glad to see she can use a dictionary, but I'm sad to note she doesn't write very well. I couldn't get halfway through it----maybe a third at most, and I'm a voracious reader.I'm sorry I bought it, but I wasn't sorry when I tossed it in the barbecue pit. That made up for the fiver I spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable light read.","review":"I thought this book was a very light and enjoyable read. I am shocked at the harsh reviews. I can't find anything so bad that it requires such negativity. It is not a stellar book, but I did enjoy it. The beginning immediately got my attention, and I found myself wanting to read to the end. I am also very interested in the next story. Damian and Aithinne are both interesting characters and I am excited to see how their romance unwinds.Not the most renown romance, but pleasurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as some previous books she wrote--in fact awful","review":"I won't repeat the plot synopsis since many have already done so and I'll keep this short.

I even tried to read another of the authors books, hoping that this was just a miss, but they all seem to be the same- not terribly creative, some seriously overused plots, awful dialogue, and nothing new or interesting. Personally in this book i hated Julien- hated his attitude, hated the way he treated everyone- if i wanted to read a 'true to life' book about how men treated women, i'd have went to the nonfiction section.And, just as a side note, isnt it weird that all the people that give this book great reviews are in this authors book club, and thanked in her book for their support. And, also, how a lot of negative reviews seem to be disappearing?

I highly recommend Osprey Publishing titles. This volume is a much needed one about Rudolf Berthold and his command of J.G. 2. Manfred von Richthofen and Oswald Boelcke draw much attention from aero historians and other aces like Berthold get somewhat neglected. This is a very valuable history that Greg Van Wyngarden has capably preserved. I have read many of the author's works, have met him in person, and know that he is a passionate, dedicated and impeccable researcher. Rudolf Berthold, victor in at least 44 contests, was wounded multiple times. He was a difficult opponent to keep down and was an inspiring leader! Like the other Osprey volumes Greg Van Wyngarden has authored, this one will definitely not disappoint! I would recommend these additional titles:'Richthofen's Circus': Jagdgeschwader Nr 1 (Aviation Elite Units)Jagdstaffel 2 Boelcke: Von Richthofen's Mentor (Aviation Elite Units)andJasta 18 - The Red Noses (Aviation Elite Units)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing version of a grand romantic ballet","review":"I've seen Bessmertmova's Giselle on this video and on stage, simply disapointing.

The story is set a few years in the future, and it's about how a former baseball player is sent from Heaven back to Earth with special powers that allow him to be the best hitter in history. He uses his ability to win over fans, especially when they find out he has insisted on a long-term contract that pays him comfortably ($500,000 a year) but keeps him from cashing in for the millions that lesser players are earning. Naturally, there are people who don't like his anti-greed stand, and they make life, or rather, the after-life, difficult for him.

But as a teacher, you would have to \\"act out\\" these scenarios- if you are not the one who oversees his daily activities. I am teaching my grandsons. It was fun for them to pretend they were waking up or dressing to go outside in the hot/cold weather, but it was not frequently repeated (and therefore reinforced) because I am not part of these routines.

However, I do use it as a teaching tool in that I am the one who listens to the CD (for familiarization of implementation and immersion) and then present the information to my children (in the appropriate setting), at a slower pace. I do agree that Ana Lomba and Marcela Summerville speak at a speed that non-native speakers will find very rapid.

Although, the grief experienced by him was understandable in the circumstances, I would still have wanted him to get his 'just desserts'. Overall, I recommend this book, the underlying material for which the story evolves is an 'eye-opener' for what is happening in some parts of the world today.***Great material Diana, more power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother!!","review":"Why can't women have a spine in fiction?

It hung up all the time and then you had to start over. Every once in a while you would stumble over something and think, \\"Great, now we're getting somewhere!\\" alas, then it went back to boring and repetitive. I will say that it was 'spooky'. And I really wanted to know the ending. I did finish it and then sat there and wondered how it ended. It just seemed to run out of steam and a lot of the things that seemed so interesting were just dropped. Never explained or 'wrapped up'. It was like taking on a complicated jigsaw puzzle and getting to the very end only to find that too many pieces are missing to complete it satisfactorily.Maybe I'm too critical or expect too much but I thought the ending would be a WOW rather than something so mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't no download","review":"I have tried several times and I could no get this game to download on my computer.

I have found that because the pan has a shiny surface, you cannot tell with the naked eye if cleaning it is a snap. I always go over the surface at least three times, then do the finger squeaky test to be sure there is no oily residue. Maybe after just once wiping it may do the trick. In any event, this 12 inch pan is hefty. It is probably really not going to get the kind of rough use that it was commercially designed from me. I wanted a non-stick skillet as part of my cookware for fast meals. Reading care instructions makes it clear there are many things not to do with this pan, use any metal or sharp objects on its surface, never use brillo pads to clean it and clean only in hot soapy water. Cold water will cause its aluminum interior to warp. Would I recommend this pan. Yes, but the caveat is that care will be needed to insure a long life of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Priests","review":"The PBS presentation of this concert was excellent.

Most beginners would not even realize what was incorrect about the photos (hence, all the good reviews), but after years of Bikrams dialogue drummed into my head, I am quite surprised that she even published these photos. If you are looking for a book to help you with an activity you can do at home, alone, in your own time, please know that it would NEVER substitute for a regular practice in a studio.

However, all of the recipes appear to use whole eggs in place of other books that put emphasis on only using the yolk. The other scary part is that the mixes with raw eggs are not cooked. With no cooking, the possibility of Salmonella could occur.A much better book is \\"The Perfect Scoop\\" at 256 pages vs the 128 for Ben & Jerry's. Plus the cost of the \\"The Perfect Scoop\\" is about a dollar more making for a best buy rating. i.e. prices may varyIf a person is even more serious about making home made ice cream, then take a look at \\"Ice Creams, Sorbets & Gelati - The Definitive Guide\\" by Robin Weir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great recipes.","review":"Enjoyed reading the book very much.

You can't go wrong with this cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite ice cream book!","review":"My boyfriend goes through a couple pints of Chubby Hubby a week, so when we got on an ice cream-making kick I figured I had to buy him this book.This book WON'T tell you how to fill pretzels with peanut butter to make Chubby Hubby, but it does make really simple and awesome ice cream that can be tweaked in lots of ways. Unlike pretty much every other ice cream book out there, Ben & Jerry stand by making homemade ice cream with raw eggs, which has gotten me by far the best results. We have a few other books on making ice cream, including Lebovitz's \\"The Perfect Scoop,\\" but I feel like this one has the most straightforward and reliable recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"Bought this book with my new Cuisinart ice cream maker (see review). Thought the ice cream maker was mediocre after using ice cream recipes from this book (haven't tried the sherbert or sorbet recipes yet). While the book had good ideas, the ice cream tasted just OK. Tried a few other recipes with similar results. Again, blamed the machine. Then we hit on Christopher Kimball's recipe in the Desert Bible. At last, great ice cream. Not icy, but creamy. Full of flavor. Takes a bit more work than the recipes in this book, but worth it.Buy it for ideas to use with other recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Necessary!","review":"If you have an ice cream machine (I highly recommend the Cuisinart one), you MUST get this book!

Another hint: DON'T use the recipes in the ice cream maker instruction booklet -- they'll make you want to return the machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Recipes are Outdated","review":"I purchased this book along with an ice cream maker for a young adult. While the book is attractive and nicely illustrated to appeal to a young audience, I was disappointed to see that many of the ice cream recipes incorporate raw eggs. This is an outdated practice - raw eggs haven't been used in recipes for at least 20 years because of the risk of salmonella . The ice cream recipes using raw eggs in this book need to be updated or at least include a warning of risk of salmonella contamination inserted."},{"rating":"1","title":"health safety problem","review":"I love Ben and Jerry's ice cream but am very disappointed in this book. It includes a basic recipe mix that calls for egg but doesn't call for cooking the mix. Raw eggs always represent a potential health problem and freezing doesn't make eggs safe. Any ice cream recipe that includes egg should specify either using pasturized eggs or cooking the mixture and then cooling it completely before churning. Beyond the basic mix recipes, this book is mostly about crushing various things, like cookies and candy, to add to the basic recipe. I don't need a book for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"rich, rich, rich","review":"These recipes are incredibly rich; my lips were greasy after trying a basic vanilla recipe.

I was VERY disappointed that this book, published in the 1980's, features many recipes that call for whole raw eggs that don't get cooked !! Was there no problem with salmonella back then? I would have expected them to update the book or tell the home cook how to make an acceptable substitution. Better yet, when we buy Ben and Jerry's I can't believe the FDA allows them to sell a product that has uncooked eggs in it. If they have made adjustments they should have let the book buyer in on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This book is a waste of money.

I leave the eggs out of my ice cream and I find the ice cream is still very tasty and scoopable, though as other reviewers mentioned this book was published way before we were worried about salmonella, so if you like to add eggs, just purchase the pre-pasturized eggs and you'll be fine.For $10 this book is really a bargain, I have found books that were triple the price with less than stellar recipes.Buy this, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ice cream recipies","review":"I received this book with the replacement bowl for my Cuisinart ice cream maker and it came in a big box where it got a little crumbled - because its a soft cover. That was kind of dissapointing for a new book.Nevertheless - the recipies are good and it is entertaining. But a little too much drawings and designs for my personal taste. (I like pictures)When you red this book you certainly can use it for any other ice cream flavor you might want to try out.I made some really tasty ice creams - raspberry being my favorite - but I also made banana, chocolate, mango, pineapple and peach ice cream - all very good.I love them when they are not all the way frozen.

Also, once you get a sense of how to add the ingredients, the possibilities are endless.I'm making a list of what flavors I'm gonna make next!Enjoy!Oh, I used egg beaters instead of eggs......I have a two year old so I didn't want to use raw eggs. Granted, I never made it with real eggs to compare the end product, but I'm so satifisied with how it came out with egg beaters, there's no need (in my mind) to even try it with whole eggs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes & tips on coming up with your own ideas.","review":"This was my first ice cream book when I first bought my machine. They have recipes for many of their most popular flavors, plus a few you don't see too often. They also talk about the basics of ice cream & its components, so you can come up with your own creations. My only complaint is that they often call for raw eggs in recipes that aren't cooked.

The Great Escape is great for people who have faced a difficult moment in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, Unclear writing style","review":"Wonderful to read about the contributions of Hungary and these Hungarian Jews, in particular. However, I stopped reading the book after the second chapter. The author starts discussing a topic, and then digresses, and then digresses on the digression; the original topic gets lost this way. I found it very frustrating to want to know more and more about what the book has to offer, but finding the book written in an annoying and unclear style. Was there an editor???"},{"rating":"1","title":"painful, but historically pleasant","review":"This was a real difficult read to get into. I was expecting to read about the life altering journeys of these nine men as they escaped the hands of the Hitler regime, but it just never really happened. It spent most of the time talking about the Hungarian lifestyle, the entertainment business such as film and production as well as photography and also a lot about famous people such as Einstein and movie actors long since dead. Although this in itself might have been an interesting read to many, I was really looking for the plight of freedom from the German devastation. One thing is correct though, the people in this book definitely left their impact on this world, but it could have been written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Escape","review":"Learned much about these people that I did not know...Kati's knowledge of the era is based on her family history and shemakes it come alive and so believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hungarian refugees and how they changed the world.","review":"This book was very moving, especially as it caused me to wonder how many equally or even more talented people of all religions and nationalities were lost to the world by the evil destruction caused by Nazi Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collector's Item","review":"This is a different voice than you hear on recordings of \\"The Three Tenors.\\" Of course, it's his earlier years, but the light, lyrical quality of his voice is amazing.

It's a compilation with similar-sounding tracks drawn from a wide variety of his albums, like Radiance, Inner Peace, Ancient Echoes and Spectrum Suite so it all hangs together nicely. There's lots of ethereal choirs and spacey melodies. My favorite by far is the uplifting, even rousing, Pachelbel's Canon and the delicate Eternally.

The CTA batteries seemed as good as my original Canon-brand battery at first. After about 10 or so uses and recharging cycles of the CTA battery, it began to hold less and less of a charge. All three reacted the same way. After about a year of occasional use, they finally would only hold enough charge for about 10 pictures on a \\"full-charge\\" while my original Canon-brand battery is still performing well. I don't know if this is a problem of the CTA brand, or of replacement brands in general. Given the cheap prices, I assume they all may perform similarly. I notice that a lot of the 4-star and 5-star reviews posted are posted by people who have just received the batteries and tried them for the first time. They are not people who've owned and used them through many recharging cycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bad","review":"After no more than 10 to 15 recharging cycles the battery doesn't work anymore.

Marcia really got on my nerves in the first season, she cried all the time, she was bossy, and had no personality. Thank goodness her character became more outgoing and likeable and even Jan was more sincere! The first season is messy and silly, the rest of the seasons had better and funnier storylines. I do have some favorite episodes from this season which include: Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Katchoo, A Clubhouse is Not a Home, A-Camping We Will Go, and Lost Locket, Found Locket. Season 1 is good but not great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first season--and full of some surprisingly solid episodes","review":"\\"The Brady Bunch\\"'s first season, on 2 discs with Sherwood Schwartz commentary on the pilot, and Barry Williams(Greg), Susan Olsen(Cindy) and Chris Knight(Peter)commenting on 2 episodes(one of which, \\"Peter the Hero\\" is one of the best examples of teen-greed and youthful ego that any sitcom of this era ever put out). With it's huge, modern set, canny usage of primary colors, and a distinct, undated style, the show looked fabulous(even Olsen comments on how colorful the camping episode appears--she says \\"they used great film stock on us\\"). This must have sold well, Seasons 2 and 3 are already in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set to have","review":"I must say that this dvd set is way cool. The picture is amazing and the episodes are uncut(I have actually never seen them uncut). Season 1 is indeed the best season of the Brady Bunch. One reviewer states that the only episode worth watching after season 1 is the Grand Canyon episode. I have to disagree. The Hawaii vacation sticks out in my mind. I love those episodes. Also remember the great UFO episode.. lol...I also remember the Trip to Kings Island where they Got Mike's plans confused with Jan's poster.. There are many great episodes after season 1 and I will probably buy them as they come out on dvd.. However, Season 1 is a MUST HAVE....Oh, you can't beat the price of this dvd.

They usually end up boring me and become dust collectors.The Brady's is one of those DVDs I pop into the machine especially after a long, hard day in the real world and am instantly taken back in time when life seemed a whole lot easier. This show will actually bring back memories of my childhood that were long forgotten. I once even remembered a blue summer sky and the smell of freshly cut grass :)I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who was ever a Brady fan. You will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fun!","review":"Good clean family entertainment! My kids, ages 3,6,7, and 10, all love it, and there are valuable lessons to be learned (hokie as they may seem to adults).

I highly recommend this along with the second and third seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"The booklet smells like farts","review":"Question. Does anyone elses booklet smell like farts?

Everyone who knows that Getulio (one the most popular presidents Brazil has ever had) has commited suicide, would buy the book only because of the title. This history behind this novel is very broad, and only Jo Soares could fit the character on many real facts in a so perfect and funny way, making the reader think that Dimitri realy took part on the scene, like everyone who really did. It's important to point out that \\"those who really did\\" are important characters of the world history, such as Al Capone, Mata Hari, Franklin Roosevelt, among others. The fact that Dimitri was kind of clumsy, or I might say \\"not so lucky\\", makes the hole book really, really funny. I recommend this book to any reader who enjoys any kind of history, and of course, to every who enjoys commedy (who doesn't?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Sherlock","review":"The first 100 pages of this picaresque are hilarious, then it begins to run out of steam. The running joke, that the protagonist is too incompatent to carry off any assasination, is not funny enough to carry an entire book. After Dimitri bungled his second assasination attempt I became bored sensing that there were no more surprises in store, and there weren't. Some of the historical references are interesting and others are flat. People who have never seen Zelig or Forrest Gump might find this story original, but it isn't. There is a theory among Brazilian television comedians like Jo Soares that there are only a limited number of jokes in the world and that they can be repeated over and over again with slight variations and people will still laugh. 12 Fingers suggests otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivpop Seller a Bummer!","review":"I would rate this book if I had gotten it.

The quality is terrible, it looks like a photocopy of a memeograph!The title itself is quite misleading. This is not investigative reporting, there is no semblance of research and no attempt to learn anything about nudism first hand.

But other than that this book was not very helpful at all. The author seems unwilling to accept that Kierkegaard was a Christian and therefore presents all of Kierkegaard's religious work as worthless.

This book is an example of that. Pastor Rogers takes deep theological positions such as assurance and eternal security and really helps the reader understand his position. You may not agree with all he has to say, but his way of simplifying God's Word for new believers is powerful. I plan to purchase this book as a gift for some of my friends in the church who are new in their Christian walk.I am glad my wife bought the book...and she wishes I would give it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting read","review":"I took awhile to read this book.

As a bi-racial child, I had seldom seen images of bi-racial families growing up, much less one so like my family (my father is white, my mother is black)! Even at 17 it felt good to have such a beautiful story reflect my own heritage in such a positive light. I am now 22 and have finally bought myself a copy for my own bookshelf.

It talks about an African American mother cooking fried chicken and corn, a Old African American man playing a pot, and white man cooking hamburgers.

It's a fat little book with very short pages so it's difficult to open it wide enough to read easily.And you're going to want to open it wide because they pack alot of info in there. The book is broken down by weapon type (pistol, rifle, light machine-gun, etc.) and you will find most of the well known weapons in here with plenty of weird one-offs and forgotten ancestors.The basic info for each gun is mostly complete and the text and photo is generally well-done. The typos are frequent enough to annoy and there are some obvious errors including the wrong weapon description being used for one entry.Still a very good addition to a basic library on firearms because few are as comprehensive and feature so many good photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gringos in Paradise","review":"This book was what I expected. I was completely entertained by it. Their experiences building their home were halarious to read.

Golson writes in a witty, down-to-earth style that engages the reader and leaves you wanting more. So many of the \\"American moves to paradise\\" authors come off as either arrogant or complaining know-it-alls. Barry Golson is neither, and his zest for participating in the very life of his adopted second home is refreshing. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gringos in Paradise","review":"If you are thinking about retiring south of the border, you should read this book -- a very humorous and informative take on living as an expatriot among the locals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look from the emotional side of leaving the country.","review":"While I agree with others, a few more figures would have been useful, but leaving the numbers out does make the writing a little more timeless. For example, the community the Golson's chose was already feeling the rampant growth that happens when we gringo's discover a town when they got there. They probably paid more than an early arrival, and clearly a lot less than a more recent one.What I loved about the book was it spent a good bit of time talking about some of the other challenges faced, and the emotions that evolve from that. Early in their adventure they had a couple of experiences with the health care system, and they talked about the incumbent fears. Very useful, and also very comforting.I'm glad I chose this as my \\"first\\" book as we approach a decision in the next few years. It took me out of thinking of it only as a \\"numbers\\" game, and helped us work through some of the deeper issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"STORY OF OUR LIVES","review":"From Page 1, this book is the story of our lives and reinforces our decision to also move to Mexico! We will live down the road from Sayulita in Puerto Vallarta (June 2012 here we come!) We chose Mexico because of the people and the \\"ritmos\\" of the Banderas Bay on the Pacific Coast...not to mention our retirement dollars go much further in Mexico! We LOVED this book and the accuracy of actual life in this area. Read the book, then take the leap! Life on Earth comes with a deadline so we chose to fill in with adventure and spirit. After fifteen years of researching the Puerto Vallarta area and visiting 20 times (we don't make hasty decisions) we decided to stop thinking about it and do it. Letting go of \\"stuff\\" and packing the cars to the hilt with crock pots, books and bathing suits, we're off! Adios and thanks for this book! It is written well and will make you want to follow your dreams!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Retiring in another country","review":"Following in the footprints of other authors that have bought homes in other countries, the author, Barry Golson, shares his adventures in relocating to Mexico. Mr. Golson wrote an article for AARP Magazine about American retirees in Mexico. While there, he and his wife, Thia, were so taken with the Pacific Coast area that they bought a lot for building a future home.When he and his wife semi retired, they headed south to Mexico to build their dream home. This book is the story of their first year adjusting to their new life and neighbors while building their house. Even though I'm not a numbers person, I, too, would have liked to see more figures just to have a ballpark idea of the costs involved in making a similar move at this point in time.The book is great for anyone considering relocating to Mexico. We're not, but it is still an enjoyable read of the adventures and challenges of adjusting to a new home and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"Great story on early retirement in Mexico, especially the pros and cons of buying a home south of the border."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gringos in Paradise: An American Couple Builds Their Retirement Dream House in a Seaside Village in Mexico","review":"This book reads more like an adventure trip of Ricky Recardo and Lucy. Don't get me wrong, there's certainly some good information, and it's entertaining, but I wasn't quite expecting a day-to-day travel log. My research into Mexico is more focused on differences in areas, prices,costs of living, american enclaves, housing, land, cultural aspects, climate, etc. But, there's been a lot of effort put into this and it does provide one couples experience, which does provide value when evaluating such an experiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of the Three Investigators Series","review":"Back when I was a kid in grade school I valued the weekends so I could read the series of the Three Investigators.

There are approximately 450 people on the advisory board and a list of contributors in the back (with addresses and telephone numbers). I have found the information contained reliable.

While this information is not detailed enough to actually use for appraisals, it usually gets me headed in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Flash at all","review":"The book is so badly edited as to chop off the conclusions of some sections. Not surprisingly, several exercises make no sense whatsoever due to this (and are of no use to anyone).The book is visually quite tough to use. It is hard to find a particular item. There are far too many typos and discrepancies between screengrabs and copy. Also the download page must be one of the oddest looking (and sloppiest) pages on the web - not a good advert for a company selling design books! Shame on you Osborne. What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized...","review":"I found this book to be very poorly organized and written. It seems to jump from one concept to another with no cohesion from topic to topic, let alone chapter to chapter. For example, to extract all you need to know to create a simple motion tween you find yourself flipping back and forth and using a fairly useless index. Most any other book will properly place all the needed information together, and all the previous chapters give you the needed background, this book does not.The information you need seems to be there, but it's so hard to get to it that this book isn't worth the money.

As a few reviewers have mentioned, the organization is atrocious. There are sections on putting Flash on the web before you learn ANYTHING about Flash.

This goes on and on, with words spoken both directly to the poor boy (Matthew) and behind his back. It gets to the point where the main character actually detests Matthew simply because of this problem. In the end, the main character softens, but it is not enough to alleviate all of the damage that has been done throughout the book. I cannot fathom why an author would think this would be good reading for first through third graders.

I found the \\"Action Pants\\" EP shortly thereafter and after one listen I was hooked by their quirky pop songs with straightforward rock arrangements. The Archies meets the Velvet Underground. The only low point on this CD is the last song (\\"Open Up and Say Oblina\\") which doesn't seem to go anywhere.

I got a reply that sounded as if it's my puppy's problem - not a product problem and that the designer would need to contact me.

I have the other versions, and I must agree with the listener from Raleigh--I was blown away. The singing is great, with the lines shaded subtly to perfection. I had never heard Thomas Quasthoff before, but he is perfect for this music. Anne Sofie von Otter is as fantastic as usual in her recent albums--she always finds something new and interesting and enlightening to do with whatever she sings. Abbado's, and Berlin's, accompaniment is outstanding--they find just the right turns of phrase to convey this quirky music. This is an album you will treasure for years, returning to again and again (on the assumption that you like Mahler). The recorded sound is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mein Gott im Himmel!","review":"If you have the slightest susceptability to Mahler or lieder or people screaming (and whispering) in German, I can recommend this CD.

I mean what's the point? Just paint them in if you're not going to light them. I was really hoping they would light them, because that would have been a fantastic effect for a beautiful design (I always hated the Enterprise D. It always looked like it belonged underwater to me, not in space).Now, I'm anxiously awaiting the 1701-A.

If your a half way serious hunter, I highly suggest you bone-up and spend the extra cash for a higher quality brand of binocs. I have other BARSKA products and they are great, just this line of binocs has poor glass or prisms or something. I dont know.I must say, the return policy and procedures with AMAZON! is great.

My first take was: these people are brilliant! My second take: after five minutes, they are also close to unlistenable. For anyone with a decent ear, it quickly becomes painful hearing Jo barely missing the notes and Weston messing up the tempo. I guess it might be fun to play ONCE at a party, but I think a much better investment would be to buy any of the Jo Stafford reissues (there are excellent and cheap boxed sets available) and marvel at her superb musicianship. Listen to Stafford and you'll understand what being really \\"on pitch\\" is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Hits","review":"The music in this album was un-listenable garbage.

I'm sure that when the Edwardses are singing for real, they sound good. Once I figured out that the Edwardses were not bad singers but people making fun of bad singers, the joke was no longer funny. As a listener, I felt as if I were helping the Edwardses gang up on the Florence Foster Jenkinses of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Mishaps of a Vocalist and Pianist","review":"This CD, as well as the also available Vol.2, are for people who enjoy a humorous take on bad lounge singers and instrumentalist. Darlene (actually big-band singer Jo Stafford, a great vocalist) hits just about every note possible if not always at the right time or exactly on pitch. Jonathan (the pianist-leader of the small ensemble are \\"played\\" by Jo Stafford's real-life husband) just can't seem to get a hold on the rhythms or tempos yet he plays and conducts with gusty. These characters were created by the famous couple as a party joke and eventually they recorded many songs as Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. From music of the 20's, to disco, they remind us that not everyone can sing or play in tune or in rhythm, but everyone can enjoy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've Gotta Be Good to Make It This Bad","review":"As a student in the 60's and 70's, I recall teachers who used the orignal album, \\"Jonathan & Darlene in Paris,\\" as an example of the extraordinary talent and control required to absolutely crucify classic songs. Jo Stafford's renditions are about the most painful thing your ears will ever hear....or worse, if you've any musical training whatsoever.In particular, her interpretation of \\"It's Magic\\" remains my favorite and can reduce me to tears in the first few notes.

His struggle as he grows in this country and becomes more \\"americanized\\" contrary to the expectations of the older generation is honestly expressed.

The one reason to choose this CD over the Silver offering is the fact that this one contains 3 whole masses - Byrd, Josquin, and Palestrina; this allows for some delightful comparison of 3 masses composed at different times and under differing circumstances in this era.Enough said - do yourself a favour and have a listen - you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money.","review":"Never could get the software to work and was completely unable to locate anything online in English.

Unfortunately the captions refer to this as the 1964 Worlds Fair. They even claim the parachute jump was from the 1964 World's Fair! It certainly was not. The panoramas of the rides in the fun zone are captioned with misinformation about Walt Disney using the rides in Disneyland. Wrong again about that date.The segment of Boardwalk and Baseball the defunct park in Florida fails to mention that it was build from the remains of Circus World, yet another failed park.

A previous reviewer found fault with the balance between piano and orchestra; I do agree that the piano could loom somewhat, though not much, larger in the performance, but I could certainly hear it. The only drawback is that the sonics of the recording itself could be brighter, though again, not much, and one has to walk a fine line with lushly orchestrated pieces such as these. All in all, I would recommend this recording of the Warsaw Concerto, but if one is looking for the best performances of the Rachmaninoff concerti, I would advise purchasing the Ashkenazy/Previn rendition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Cooking for a Large Group","review":"Made to typical high Calphalon quality standards, this griddle works well on our smooth top stove, but would likely work better had we \\"bridge\\" elements between the main elements.

There is not much to write about this particular product since it is only a charger.

This is utter nonsense without any true historical relevance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voodoo inside - not for Christians","review":"I am a Christian and would not have purchased this book if I knew it had a Voodoo doctor. The children in the book are afraid of the Voodoo doctor but it later portrays him as friendly. He tells the girl in the story her painting talent is a \\"gift from the spirits\\". I would say it was a gift from God. Voodoo is evil. (We adopted four children from Haiti. The older children in the orphanage were afraid of Voodoo. One of our daughters told us every time their neighbor practiced Voodoo, her birth mother started praying to Jesus.) I wish Voodoo wasn't in the book, or at least not portrayed in a positive manner. My daughter is very uncomfortable with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bad guys deserved to win","review":"I did not like this book. In previous reading I liked her Flesh and Spirit, Breath and Bone - the lighthouse books. Her stories are apocalyptically ominous and the bad guys are scary evil, but in the light house duo there was a sense of possible redemption to sustain you, and the other worldly part about the Danae was unique and compelling. Not so with the Son of Avonar books. This first book devolves into a half a book long chase scene where the enemy Zhid are so constantly a step ahead of our heros that by the time a possible redeeming outcome developed I'd lost all heart. If the bad guys are that powerful they deserve to win. It was depressing. The magic in the book seemed too powerful and the story line too convoluted to allow forgivable suspension of disbelief.There is a strong female heroine in the story, and if you are looking for a strange fantasy romance story the book might work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Fantasy","review":"Although one who likes the more fighting fantasy, this one did keep my attention. The characters are some of the better, more realistic ones than I've read in many a story.Seriana Marguerite, who entered a life of exile after her family was murdered. During her exile, she meets a stranger named D'Natheil. An odd and mysterious figure, he and Seriana don't initially get along and it takes some time before they come to an understanding of sorts. Perhaps it was the mysteriousness of him that drew her, but for whatever reason, she is drawn to find out more of his past.A good story if a bit on the romantic side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags","review":"This book was replete with historical details of multiple characters and groups; definitely a laborious trod through too much information and detail.

From there on it's a comic mystery. The information about the Seventh Avenue and Greenwich Village fashion scene was interesting. There's a wonderful snooty law firm that presents a facade of upmarket efficiency but where nobody really knows what they're doing. (She fakes her way into a job there and pretends to be operating a computer). I was reminded of Sparkle Hayter by the downtown Manhatten milieu, and, to be honest, by the tendency to substitute eccentricity for characterization. (\\"Slaves of New York\\" had another Greenwich Village hatmaker).The plot is fantastic but tight and logically coherent.I enjoyed this and will be looking for more. The missing star is only because Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton write within this same category and something has to be reserved for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The series has potential, but the first book was very lame.From the weak plot to the one-dimensional characters, the book lacked any depth. There was so much silliness -- from the cops who \\"forgot\\" to withhold something from the public to the way Brenda finagles her way into a temp job at the law firm to the private eye wannabe ex-boyfriend -- and it just kept getting more ridiculous as it went along.I certainly hope this series improves as it goes along, because it really does have potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could resist?","review":"Since beyond memory, the flesh of a mermaid is sought for those seeking immortality. \\"Partake of it,\\" the legend says, \\"And you shall be granted life eternal.\\" My favorite Takahashi series ever without a thought, Mermaid's Scar was the first offer to suck me into it's interest.

I would recommend buying this album for white, suburban, high-school-aged wannabe gangstas, so you can ridicule them even more. Also, die-hard fans of Vanilla Ice and Snow might really enjoy this album.I will admit the production is decently done, but no amount of studio work could make up for the lack of writing talent and delivery.

True Hollywood Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of gossip; little philosophy","review":"Well, Strathern is certainly entertaining, if not informative. He gives us the dirt on each philosopher, tells us who was overweight, ... pushed people around, etc. This would be great if we were reading about movie stars or politicians but I bought these books in order to understand something about what these philosophers thought. He does reserve a few pages at the end of each volume to tells us one or two of their ideas and gives us a handful of quotes. A total waste of money unless you hate your philosophy classes so much that you want to hear how awful the personal lives of the philosophers were. A new low in publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Give me a break! You will not understand Kant by merely reading this book. A better starting point would be the book Kant by Roger Scruton (another short book, but much better than this one), then read Kant's Prolegomena for his epistemology and Foundations of a Metaphysics of Morals for his ethics. After that, sink your teeth into the Critiques (I am, as of yet, not that knowledgable concerning Kant's aesthetics, so I can't make a reccomendation in that area)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography not Philosophy","review":"I should have been smarter that one can not understand Kant in 90 minutes but even than the name of the book is very misleading.

There were maybe two or three songs that were enjoyable to listen to. Usually one song that I would put on repeat. This CD is a very different story. I can honestly say that this is one of the best CDs that I currently own. It is a refreshing new approach to displaying Natalie Grant's undeniable vocal talent, which is to sing great and memorable songs. I have also had trouble with shallow lyrics in her past albums; this CD is very deep and theologically sound. A few songs stand out: \\"The Real Me,\\" \\"Held,\\" and \\"Make me Over\\" are beautiful and touching. I would recommend this to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what talent!","review":"I was fed up with the secular junk on the radio and was determined to find some Christian music, though I had never bought any before and I didn't have any recommendations or anything to go by, except for the little song clips that amazon has. Since I wanted something to replace the radio, I wasn't looking for a hymn sing exactly. My main requirement was that it not sound like a church choir. Well most of the first cds that I clicked on had great song lists, they were hymns I was familiar with- then I heard the clips and it could have been our church choir singing. If I wanted that, I could just bring a little recorder with me on Sunday. no thanks. Then after a bunch more clicks, I heard some of Natalie's and ordered Awaken and Deeper Life. I was extremely joyful to receive them, I played both of them all week and they were so incredibly inspiring, encouraging my faith and inspiring me to grow closer to God and giving me strength to live for Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put it Away!","review":"I am addicted to this CD. I was wary of buying it because I only knew a few tracks and I wasn't sure I would like the rest of the CD. But after only a few sit downs with it at the office, I was like, I want to go back to that song, or the one with this line or that sound... What is so great about this CD is that the sounds are distinct. You know what song you're listening to even if it's in the background. And lyrically it is a powerful CD with tracks like \\"The Real Me\\" and \\"Make Me Over\\" that are the kind of song you listen to and wish you had written.

Man, it sucks!!! There is no value in that additional recording and I can't believe that even one member of Kansas thought this would be a good addition to this otherwise flawless remastering.I'll stick with my imported CD sans the rehersal version, and I would recommend you do the same. Of course this is just my opinion. I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Kansas Album","review":"Masque has been my favorite Kansas album since I purchased it on vinyl back in 1975, and it holds up equally well today. It's a much more polished and cohesive effort than the previous two records (which are certainly good), and sets the stage for the hugely successful follow-ups 'Leftoverture' and 'Point of Know Return'. It has a great mix of rock-radio oriented songs ('It Takes A Woman's Love', 'Child Of Innocence', 'It's You'), and progressive rock masterpieces ('Icarus', 'Mysteries and Mayhem' & 'The Pinnacle'). 'Child Of Innocence' was my first-favorite Kansas song, and got a good bit of AOR radio-play in it's day.The CD reissue sounds great. I'm under-whelmed by the bonus material though, the rehersal recording of 'Child of Innocence' and the demo version of 'It's You' don't add much, but are easy to skip past.If you like 'Song For America' or the mega-hit albums, you should add Masque to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty great album","review":"Get rid of the opening song which sounds like generic Foreigner and you have yourself a solid commercial progressive rock album.Kansas seemed to focus more on a standard style of songwriting on Masque and ignore the prog rock elements the band preferred on the previous two albums. Not really a BAD thing of course, because most of the time I find myself loving the vocal melodies. The instrumental chops aren't there though, which is slightly disappointing to me. Oh sure \\"The Pinnacle\\" has plenty of instrumental parts, but it's a long wait to get to that song.Still, Kansas knew what was going on- they were becoming popular and gathering more and more fans with every release, so they probably needed to release an album like this with a more straight forward commercial edge. I'm just happy the songwriting doesn't suffer as a result.Also, \\"All the World\\" sounds religious which is cool. Love the vocals. \\"Icarus\\" is awesome too.

The author's clever wit pokes through often, twisting a cliché here and there and making the story's outlandinsh events still be something the reader can relate to.

It does not take on a more liberal hermaneutic, but stays within an evangelical framework.I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not compelling","review":"I approached this book hoping that it could give a biblical rationale for egalitarianism, but it couldn't. Instead it gave the same old philosophical tirade: different in role = different in worth. When are folks going to figure out that the argument just doesn't follow? Economic (role) subordination does not necessitate ontological disparity and ontological equality does not necessitate functional sameness. The only thing that writers could do is try to re-interpret Paul's words in a way that they clearly weren't written. It was an unfortunate read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christians and non-Christians must read","review":"This book truley explaines where women fit in in the church."},{"rating":"1","title":"No color change at all","review":"This henna is of very poor quality, it's gritty, has twigs in it but the worst of all, has no dye release - no change in color was observed at all after 2 hours.

Find good quality henna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money spent for nothing!","review":"I have light brown hair with some grey ,not that much. I got this color,because didn't want to become red-haired. It didn't really change my real color,which is rather strange. The worst part is that it didn't cover my grey hair. So,I simply lost the money. I followed the instruction ,and kept it on my hair for about 3 hours. This henna is good for nothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Women who broke barriers","review":"I enjoyed this book because, although I was fairly young during the Vietnam War, it's events shaped my generation....The book is interesting because of the different experiences & writing styles of the nine authors. And, yes, all of the authors have definite opinions as to the role of the USA there.Although it is short & easy to read, I found it taught me a number of things about the people involved; the military, journalists and civilians caught in that mayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was real and intense!","review":"I am not an avid book reader but I did stick with this one.

My eyesight is quite good howevcer I had to strain just to try to read a page ot two. I ended up not reading it because of this because it was just too difficult to read the small type.

We gather in my home each week and read from this diary and discuss the wonderful insights that it gives. It is a springboard to great discussions. I act as the facilitator, moving the discussion along. The first time we studied it, it took us 2 and 1/2 years to complete. We went on to study other books, but then returned to this Diary to study it a second time because so many wanted to return to it. Other books we studied and gained a great deal from are, \\"True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" by St. Louis Marie de Monfort, \\"The Imitation of Christ\\" by Thomas a Kempis, \\"Humility of Heart\\", and \\"Hungry Souls\\" by Gerard J.M.VanDen Aardweg.So consider gathering in your own home to study such works which are sure to benefit your soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important Christian books","review":"It is almost impossible to fully communicate the absolute importance of the Diary of Saint Faustina. It is possibly one of the most important messages Christ has given to mankind through one of His beloved mystics. It takes time to fully understand the message but \\"blessed is he who ponders the laws of God day and night\\". If you know in your heart who Jesus is, then this book is essential reading for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"advice for salvation","review":"This simple diary gives clear instructions for salvation in these dire times. It isn't a \\"feel good\\" or \\"nice\\" or \\"interesting\\" book. It relates the true life experiences of St. Faustina's relationship to Jesus Christ in light of our dire times. Her story was fulfilled when she was canonized as a saint by JPII. The feast of Mercy is the first Sunday after Easter, it was established by His HOliness, John Paul II. Prophecy fulfilled! Other interpretations do nothing to describe the great grace granted by Jesus if a person approaches the fount of Mercy through the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist. I encourage all who read this to explore and seek the truth and act upon the words of St. Faustina and follow the path to Medjugorje. The Holy Spirit will do the rest. God Bless all who read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska: Divine Mercy In My Soul","review":"This is a wonderful book. I read it as a non-denominational Christian pastor. The book is very enlightening. I learned much from this book. Also, I was interested to learn about St. Faustina's experiences. Very, very, interesting, indeed! I was interested to realize that the words given by God many years ago to St. Faustina today still apply. God is a loving, merciful God, who wants to be merciful to mankind and spare him of the coming Justice of God if he will only repent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"St. Faustina has a beautiful way of sharing the thirsting love of Jesus and His desire for mercy. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to seriously deepen his/her personal relationship with Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prima Games title this is not...","review":"This book serves the purpose of listing all available moves for the preset roster and shows all available storylines in the game. That's about it. No instruction on Create a Wrestler, or for that matter, create anything. In fact, the previous two items I listed (moves and storylines) are pretty much the only content in this book. I don't know; maybe I'm spoiled by Prima and the good job they do writing for PC games. They just could have included a LOT more content, that's all.

The first time I discovered Jonny was in Sleepaway Camp as Ricky then when I discovered that he's now a singer, songwriter and guitarist I listened to a sample of his solo song \\"Heaven\\" on the internet and it blew me away and had to order it! So far that song is at his best with his powerful vocals. I also liked the heartbroken ballad \\"She's Lost\\" which he plays the accoustic guitar on as well as the jazz flavoured \\"Sidewalks\\" which has great saxophone playing. Yes sir, this is the album to buy! I also enjoyed him in the folk-rock band \\"Bambi's Apaprtment\\" and can't wait to hear tracks from his new band \\"Ten Tiers\\" he'll also return as Ricky in \\"Return to Sleepaway Camp\\" which I'm looking forward to an hopefully he'll do the odd acting gig although his music comed first in life!

It is subject to some of the same things that people will find annoying with many magazines for the most part. Yes, it has changed with more advertisements, but many magazines have had the same thing as they try to keep going. The subsciption is reasonably priced and they need to stay in business.Basically you need to look past that and read the articles. There is alot of valuable tips and very good information about yoga in the pages that will benefit you and makes it worthwhile. Every month I glean one or two things at least that I find personally worthwhile and it keeps me up to speed about yoga in general.

This is a light-reading magazine that you can pick up at the breakfast table or read on-the-go.If you are looking for a journal with fresh insight, well-researched articles, and literary merit, look elsewhere.

Neill does not write as tight a story as L. Frank Baum, but he does create characters as delightful as any developed by Ruth Plumly Thompson. Davy Jones, the wooden whale who befriends Bucky Jones and starts him on his quest, is one of the best. As with all Oz stories, getting there is all the fun. Bucky and Davy have a great time and so will you. Neill was the illustrator of Oz books for 40 years and this book contains the last views that he gave us of this magical land.

It's about a kid named Peter Stokes who is delighted when his sister, Jenny, tells him that his Grandpa Jack is coming to live with them. But, his smile turns into a frown when he's forced out of his bedroom onto the stinky 3rd floor, so Grandpa can sleep in Peter's room.

Peter starts a war with his Grandpa. Peter's \\"war\\" is really just he and his Grandpa playing tricks on each other. They are doing all this because Grandpa moves in and takes Peters room. Peter wants his room back and tries to get it by going to war with his Grandpa. The book is easy to understand and very detailed. This book really takes you into the mind of the character. After I finished this book I felt happy that I read it. The characters are Peter, Grandpa, Jennifer (Peter's little sister), Peter's friends, and Peter's parents. I especially liked the funny things Peter's friends said about his \\"war\\".

I loved all of the recomendations the book offered while I was in Costa Rica: places to visit, places to eat, places to stay, etc. So, when I planned to return to Costa Rica I consulted the book again. However, I do not suggest using Americas Tours and Travel to buy tickets to Costa Rica, as the book suggested. I did, and I regret it. This is my only complaint about the book. Otherwise, it is the best that can be offered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...still pictures and limited-to-no narration","review":"Simply horrible. The instructor doesn't bother to instruct.

I formerly did T'ai Chi, so it was with interest that I discovered the existence of this videotape. But I had reservations, too; could a seated T'ai Chi form replicate the many benefits of the original thing?So far, although I have used the video for a limited period of time, I am convinced that it provides a good T'ai Chi experience, and real and satisfying exercise. The motions I went through with the instructor were the motions I remembered so well. Even with my limitations I was able to do most of them, and the tape left me with a pleasantly raised pulse rate and a desire to continue using it on an everyday basis. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in the Extreme","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY. This video has very poor quality. There is way too much text printed on dark backgrounds making it virtually unreadable. When the instructor shows the movements she is in the shadow of trees so you can't see what she's doing. In the background is the noise of a babbling brook. Suppposedly this is to be calming. In reality is is annoying as all get out since it's hard to hear what is being said. Later in the video are charts showing a body with written material telling you things to do, but it's impossible to read. I am extremely disappointed and this thing deserves no stars at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right item","review":"If you are expecting a 30 Pin DVI M1 converter for your InFocus Machine this is not it dispite the picture.

When Fireball went off the air, I was despondent until the release of the Thunderbirds. I watched the television broadcasts religiously. Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 are fantastic movies that are now being enjoyed daily by my four year and myself. My only critisism is that the full complement of craft are not represented in either of the feature length productions. Anyway, I'm happy to see the television broadcasts are being released February 27, 2001. That is my birthday and my son (and daughter) have promised me this special gift. F.A.B.

The shock has not worn off nearly four months after the tragedy and I suspect it has changed me forever. This book was loaned to me by a friend and I read it cover to cover in one sitting. It was easy to read and hit so close to home. I am Catholic but my loss has shaken my faith. Mary White struggled, as I do, with the question of \\"why?\\" and her story follows her evolution through pain into acceptance and peace. I particularly liked the text in italics where she questions God and hears His answers. I refer to these passages often for comfort. Also the section at the back of the book that takes you through the stages of grief is a great help. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to find peace with a loss that has made them question their beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mp3 album has little gaps between tracks which disrupt enjoyment of this recording.

The authors speak from experience, and they have plenty of that! Specifically, I found this book useful because it helped focus my positive energy on my wife's specific needs. It also contains a great deal of information about how to continue your physical relationship during pregnancy, which helped keep both my wife and I very happy! Finally, it is a great book to display prominently on your night stand or coffee table, as it labels you as a \\"caring and sensitive\\" husband, who is really interested in being a part of the pregnancy!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agreed with my husband on this one!","review":"We don't always agree, but when he was reading this he told me how useless he thought it was.

Unless you count aromatherapy suggestions and repeated advice that it's ok to have sex while your pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperature indication is not even close.","review":"I installed this gauge on my Weber grill to help with indirect cooking and smoking. After a couple of grilling sessions, I found my food was cooking too quickly and drying out. I became suspicious of this gauge and checked its accuracy against an accurate digital thermometer.

And what a surprise!!! Marc sings it!! Definetely a wonderful song and a great cd too! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked in ....","review":"Well, I should've read the reviews before I bought. It would seem that people either love or hate this album ... and I'm afraid I'm in the latter camp. I was very disappointed to find that 'Need to Know', which gets my hips swaying every time I hear it on the radio, was completely unrepresentative of this dull, soppy, middle-of-the-road collection of forgettable songs. Banal lyrics, whiny voice ... perfect Iglesias material (father or son!) It gets one star only because I quite like 'You sang to me' too ... mostly because he sounds a bit like Alison Moyet on this track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was shocked to get this CD and realize that \\"Need to Know\\" was an anomaly on this otherwise boring and sappy selection of songs. His passionate voice in combination with these vapid lyrics is extremely unfortunate. I don't question his talent, just this collection of mush. This is NOT Latin music and I feel duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I don't understand the craze. I feel this is not the Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Selena category. I am referring to the English end of it, I cannot comment on the other end of where he is crossing over from. I think you have to be Spanish to appreciate the man and his music. Good luck to him anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd for a great price","review":"I bought this for my wife, who loves all his music, and at the price of $2.99, it was a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great CD","review":"Even though this CD is more than a decade old, Marc Anthony's song, \\"I need to know\\" is still one of the most popular songs played in dance clubs. My husband and I are learning the Cha Cha Cha to dance at a charity event and this is the song that we chose. Its cool, spicy, and really gets you moving. My Husband is not a dancer by nature, but now this song had converted him into one. The rest of the CD shows off Marc's sensitive side and is great for Rhumba and slow dancing. What a great voice. A must have in your CD collection. This is my favorite CD by this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice, the music, make every song on this CD a winner.","review":"This CD is one the best I have heard and purchased in a while. I love every song on it and listen to it several times a day. His voice and the music are so wonderful that you get wrapped up in this listening experience. It is very moving because it either causes you dance or to just reflect on the words of the song. All the songs are meaningful and moving. This is a definite must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's all the music you can dance to?","review":"If I had wanted sappy songs, I could have bought a Julio Inglesias CD. I bought this CD hoping the whole album would sound like \\"I Need to Know\\", but instead I just skipped my way through most of the songs, having to scour through a lot of ballads to get to the (Too Few) dance songs. I guess I'll just have to try his earlier albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"You sang to me","review":"What a beautiful song. Marc Anthony is really a singer, our Orgullo Latino. Like Jennifer Lopez, but 1,0000 times better. I love all his songs. Since probably 1993, we love him. Keep singing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Marc Anthony!","review":"I have to say that for this being Marc's first English CD he has done a wonderful job. I have not heard such great music in a very long time. This CD is a wonderful mix of Salsa as well as ballads, Marc Anthony to me is a man that sings from the heart and can truly express himself in a beautiful way. In my opinion \\"MY BABY YOU\\" is a the best song in this album, it shows his great love and devotion for his daughter, Arianna. Marc you are great at what you do! Thanks for putting the LATINO name high."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful music experience!!!","review":"The whole c.d. is great but the main reason I bought this c.d. is for the song \\"You Sang to Me\\".

I would recommend this c.d. highly to any one who is a romantic like I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"All of Marc Anthony's songs are excellent, but when I heard 'My Baby You' play at my friend's get-together, I cried. Never have I known a singer to portray such emotion in his words. This man has a truly amazing voice, but even more is the passion for which he sings his songs...ALL of his songs. Anyone who buys this CD can be certain they won't be disappointed! I ordered it the day after my friend's party and have loved every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sofisticated Latin Pleasures","review":"Beautiful albumn. Has a special jazzy quality to it.

I heard his song ' I need to know' in the charts here in England and it captured my heart! I then bought his album 'Marc Anthony' and its not often that i like every song on an album but every song just grabbed me. I hope to hear alot more of Marc here in England.PLEASE! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marc Anthony","review":"This CD grows on you, I ordered it based on an interview I saw with Marc Anthony where he was touted as the \\"King of Salsa\\". That coupled with seeing his current video convinced me to give the CD a try. There are more ballads than toe-tapping songs but after I listened to it a couple of times I really like it. I will probably try another sampling of Marc Anthony in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved all the Spanish CDs, this one is blah","review":"Sorry, I just can't get excited about any of these songs. I have all of his other CDs, Contra la Corriente, Otra Nota, Todo a Su Tiempo, and love them all. But most of these cross-over songs sound just the same as any other boring soft-rock drivel. My suggestion, buy the Desde Un Principio/From The Beginning collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd music","review":"I bought this Cd for one song I heard on the radio. When I played it to make sure it was the correct song I listened to the whole cd twice at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an overproduced waste of a great talent","review":"The salsa-influenced songs are great, but most of the album consists of saccharine lite pop ballads. What a sell-out.

The songs are filled with emotions and are very intense. The Ballads reveal stories that anyone can associate with while the Latin rhythms just make me want to get moving.

Marc Anthony's music is faceless... I know it may not be the best way to judge an artist, but I tend to listen to the artist's voice first, before anything... and I HATE marc anthony's voice.... every song I've heard by him I hate... So far the only Latin artist I like is Carlos Santana.... Santana is a legend... Marc is not.... Try again, Marc.... ... And Enrique Iglesias is not even a singer you should want to imitate. If you started playing your OWN INSTRUMENTS and writing GOOD BALLADS like \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"Hey Jude\\" maybe I'd find your music halfway interesting.. (But alas the Beatles would be disgraced....) ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible voice, but bland songs","review":"Marc Anthony undoubtedly has one of the best male singing voices going today, and \\"I Want to Know\\" is a great single. However, most of his English language is composed of sound alike ballads. I've listened to it a number of times since it was released, and most of the songs do not really stick out or are particularly memorable. One exception is \\"She's Been Good to Me,\\" which was produced by Rodney Jerkins and is an uptempo salsa-flavored song. Of note, several of the songs were co-written and produced by Walter Afanasieff, who did many of Mariah Carey's early ballads. If you like that kind of material, you'll probably like this CD - otherwise beware. A disappointment...hopefully his new CD, which will be released soon, will be more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant believe it","review":"i purchased this cd a little over a week ago and have listened to it at least 4-5 times a day and i usually do not care for this type of music i would strongly recomend it to everyone and anyone i have always listened to classic rock of the 80s and 90s i have never listened to a cd as much not even my idol(OZZY) cant wait until the next release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marc Anthony/Can't Stop Listening","review":"When I first listened to Marc Anthony I found a sound that I couldn't get out of my head.

Marc Anthony is a truly gifted singer with an amazing vocal and emotional range. Why he chose these songs (and these producers) to work with is beyond my comprehension. If you compare this recording to his earlier work (and even the songs from Paul Simon's \\"Capeman\\") you'll see what a drastic difference good material makes. With all the talented songwriters working today(as well as all those from past!), couldn't they have selected something other than this soupy, sugary, meaningless drivel? Come on Marc, give us some substance along with your great voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD sells on Showbiz review","review":"Yes, Marc Anthony is good, BUT he is no Ricky Martin. The sells of this CD will come from Marc Anthony fans and the ShowBiz review. The music arrangments and lyrics are average.

I look forward to his next CD in hopes that it's a five."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste!","review":"Based on the single that came from this album, you would think they figured it out. What the public wants is music that moves with a latin beat. Isn't that why they released \\"I need to know\\" as the single? I have been listening to Marc for some time and his spanish-language stuff is great, so I was sooooo disappointed to find this CD mostly populated with easy listening sappy ballads. Music to fall asleep buy IS NOT why I buy Marc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I bought this CD based on the two songs I heard Marc Anthony perform on Saturday Night Live (That's Okay and I Need to Know). His performance was so sizzling that I ignored my initial misgivings of purchasing another watered-down \\"crossover\\" album. How disappointing. The CD is weighed down with so many boring ballads that it's necessary to skip around to get to anything lively and interesting.

I am a male singer myself and Marc Anthony is very gifted and he has a large singing range and he could go higher and more beautifully than I could ever imagine singing. \\"My Baby You\\" is a very beautiful song dedicated to his daughter, \\"Am I The Only One\\" is one of my favorites and of course \\"I Need To Know\\" is a great one. Some complain about the minimal so-called latin music, and I can understand this. If you are looking for all up-beat latin music, this isn't the CD you are looking for. Only four or five songs are your upbeat latin music. The rest are beautiful slow, slow-upbeat songs. What I like about Anthony is that he isn't like other Latin artists he has proven that he can sing not only Latin music, but American music as well and isn't following the \\"Latin music trend\\". I loved this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"OVERWHELMED\\"","review":"I originally bought this cd after hearing the heart pounding song \\"MY BABY YOU\\". This song touches the very depths of my soul. All the other ballads have the same effect \\"AM I THE ONLY ONE\\", \\"DON'T LET ME LEAVE\\", \\"LOVE IS ALL\\" and more. Great dance songs and three spanish dance songs including a spanish version of \\"I NEED TO KNOW\\" (\\"DIMELO\\").

I love this man's voice and this CD is an excellent showcase of Marc's talent. After you hear it, you'll be wanting more. I'm dying for another English CD, but in lieu of that, I've started in on his Spanish speaking releases.I've played this CD a 1,000 times and I'm still not tired of it. And I hate to say this, but I haven't done that since I bought my first Beatles album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salsa King, but not King of Pop","review":"With all this crossover business happening lately, Marc Anthony's should have been the best one. He truly is an extremely talented individual compared to the rest of them.His ballads in his crossover album, I think, are typical pop music standards that anyone could release. \\"I Need to Know\\" is a excellent song and misled us to think the rest of the album is as good. His Enlgish salsa song, \\"That's OK\\", is what Marc Anthony fans are used to. Salsa is his strength not pop. There really should have been more songs with that style.I noticed that Emilio Estefan wrote a song on this CD. I don't know who told the Estefans that they are the authority in Latin-Style music, but the song doesn't work on any level. I wanted to like it, but there are too many things wrong it. Musically and vocally, it doesn't work.A man with such incredible talent can do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best in latin music....","review":"I was extremely disapointed when, after receiving this CD for Christmas, I popped it into the player and heard what sounded like a cast recording for some obscure off-off-broadway musical. Many of the songs are melodramatic little songs, but none hold the appeal (or my attention) like his first single *I Need to Know.* If you're looking for a good latin singer, with consitently good music, bypass this one. I'f you're looking for a Frank Sinatra knock-off, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance at its Best!","review":"This is a romantic cd.

The narrative succeeds with understatement, silence, and seemingly simple dialogue. The strong arm of a father around his son's shoulder and life makes this book truly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes you get dry wipes","review":"We received the warmer as a gift for our son that is now seven weeks old. The warmer is the best at night when the baby is half asleep and you need to change the diaper and you don't wake him/her up with a cold wipe. The only downfall is if you use a thinner wipe they tend to dry out much faster, ecpecially if you use the feed through option on the top of the warmer. The only other thing is to make sure to add the amount of water required after each refill. Other then the two complaints we are very satisfied with the wipe warmer. I would and have recommended it to my other freinds and family that are expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good warmer","review":"I think this is a good warmer, but too big. It's on the changing table,(and that takes up a lot of room). I have not had any problems with the lid. If you just add some water to the wipes it will help alot with keeping them warmer! And I think everyone should get some kind of Wipee Warmer so their baby doesn't have to have cold wipes put on him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best kinda warmer","review":"we purchased this wipe warmer when my baby was newly born, because she screamed when we had to use those cold wipes:(This wipe warmer is good, but not great.My baby likes the warm wipes, but I have to change the diaper quickly!! It warms up the wipes, but when you take the wipees out they get cold quickly. Another thing that I don't like is it does not have a latch so you can attach it to the changing table. I don't have any other place to put it, so it's close enough when I need it, so it is on the changing table,(which takes up alot of room). And you can't take the wipes out of the hole, you have to open the whole thing to get them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"I gave it 4 stars, because I have nothing to compare it to. I had never heard of wipe warmers before my mother-in-law purchased this for our son. He used to cry every time we wiped his bottom b/c of the coldness, but now he's perfectly content during diaper changes. Also, a little tidbit, we just use thin, small baby washclothes, get them wet, and put in a little soap, and they work great as reusable wipes. I just wash them along with the cloth diapers. As for this specific product, I read that for other parents the lock broke off.We've had this warmer for nearly a month now, and the lid has been just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works only if you renew your wipes supply daily.","review":"I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm about the Wipe Warmer","review":"I purchased this wipes warmer thinking it would make diaper changes during the chilly winter months a little more comfortable for my baby. I chucked it after only a couple months of use. As other reviewers have stated, the wipes stay warm for an infinitesimal amount of time once removed from the warmer. My other, larger issue with it was that it ruined the top of my wooden dresser - the area immediately beneath the warmer became warped. I'm not sure if it was heat or moisture or both that ruined the wood, but the split second of warmth from the baby wipes wasn't worth the damage to the furniture. Since some other reviewers had wonderful experiences with the warm wipes making diaper changes less irritating, my suggestion is to purchase a wipes warmer at a second hand store - you'll pay a fraction of the price (around here they usually sell for about $5), there are usually plenty to choose from on the shelves, and if you hate it you're only out $5 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste yourmoney","review":"You have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold. Not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria, especially if you are wiping, then put your hands back in to get another wipey."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste for waste","review":"My wife bought a similar one.

Big waste of money initially, big waste on electricity."},{"rating":"2","title":"made diaper changes a breeze","review":"at first I thought this was something that would be completely unnecessary, but, I was wrong. this was one of the best inventions. it makes diaper changes so much easier. well, until they start moving around anyway....worth every penny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"We've had this for a year and a half and the lid just broke off. I'm still using it until I get another. I'm taking this one to my parent's house, so there are warm wipes there too! I'm getting another one for our house, as baby #2 is on the way. I can't imagine not having this. Would you want you bottom wiped with a cold wet wipe? I've never had any problems with discoloration and the only time my wipes are dry are when the lid doesn't get closed. I'm sure my daughter appreciates it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine works fine","review":"I have never had any problem with the lid breaking. I found that one type of wipe will dry out if you fill it all the way. Otherwise no problems. If nothing else it is a more attractive way to store wipes and baby doesn't get quite a shock as with the cold wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it seems","review":"I got this wipe warmer as a gift and thought it would be the greatest thing - unfortunately it's not! The lid broke off in the first week and now won't stay on. It also is difficult to get the wipes out - when you pull on one, other ones come out. You need to remember to push them back in, otherwise they completely dry out. Even though it's nice to have the warm wipes to use, I would not suggest spending the money on this warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay","review":"This warmer is okay. I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great because it can hold so many wipes. But, before the week was out, my wipes were dried out. I know we are so supposed to rotate, but everyday? What's the point. I also received one of the warmers that wraps around the wipe container, now that one is awesome. I recommend the wrap around, that way you don't lose any wipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good warmer","review":"I give this warmer as baby shower gifts all the time. It is wonderful for keeping wipes warm. The warmer wipes are on the bottom but it does keep the top ones warm as long as the container stays closed. If you do leave it open for any length of time it will take a couple of hours for it to warm the top ones back up. Make sure when you refill it that you put the new wipes on the bottom. They will get brown on the bottom if you don't rotate them. Overall I like it. I have one for my son (4 months). Wish I had one when my daughter (5 years) was a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"By the time you get the wipes from the warmer to baby's bottom, the wipes are cold! This is one item any new mother can live without. We used ours for about a week, then we realized that we didn't really need it. This is a frivolous item, totally unnecessary. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like bigger selection from Target/Target.com","review":"My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth. We don't really like it. Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe. That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change! (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full. But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half. We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child. It wore out around the time we started potty training her. That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Lid !!","review":"I received this warmer when my son was born. I had to return it because the lid broke off after a week. It is my 2 nd warmer, and the lid is already broken.... The opening is a little too wide and the wipes keep falling in. I noticed that if I fill it up to about 2/3 the wipes don't dry out. I would definitely recommend a wipe warmer if your baby, like my son, was born in the winter. He never woke up at night when I had to change him because the wipes were warm on his skin and it didn't startle him as a cold wipe would. This said, I like the concept of a warm wipe but I don't like this specific warmer. I would have bought a different brand if I had known that after a few days the lid would break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I received this as a gift. Thought it was great for about a week. Then the lid broke. The wipes were always soaking wet. The wipes did not pop out of the container correctly. I had to continue to open up the container to get the soaking wet wipe. Save yourself the troble and mess. Skip over this item when registering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the $$","review":"We tried this and stopped using it after only a couple of days. The wipes dried out, even though we kept pouring water in to refill. The lid was also pretty heavy and tended to slam down. The warmer was also a bit bulky in my opinion and took up too much room on the changing table. We went back to using the standard plastic box and warming the wipes the old fashioned way... with our hands. It's a good idea, but the design should be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Right Away!","review":"Although I too, eagerly anticipated this product, I was sorely disappointed when the lid broke off after only a few days. Another downfall of this product is the fact that the wipes on top dry out, regardless if you add extra water. In fact the wipes on the bottom become quite soggy with the extra water! Because of these design flaws, I no longer recommend this product to friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"I was very excited to use this product, however was rather disappointed. While the warmer keeps the wipes warm and they don't dry out too bad, the pop-up lid kept falling off. While changing my son I opened the unit from the main opening and the pop-up lid fell off breaking one of the plastic hooks which could not be repaired. Target happily replaced the unit, but when this happend for the second time I opted to look for another model. I would not recommend this particular item for durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"power transfer rings break easily","review":"The cord reels in fine the problem is in the plastic rings lines with copper that within months stop contacting leaving reel useless. squeezing the side make contact occur and power transfer, but this is momentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retraction is either awkward or doesnt' workd","review":"I bought two of these and have had them for over two years. From the beginning, they never retract cleanly. You will have to fiddle with the cord to get it to fit back into the unit while it retracts. Worse though, is that for the unit I used most frequently, the locking mechanism that keeps the cord from trying to retract broke, so, the cord is always trying to pull back in.If you are going to plan on using this for a few years, I would find a stronger unit that has plenty of room to hold the cord without fiddling around all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a rising star!","review":"I love this album.

Draghici is on his way to being a star and I am looking forward to hearing what he will have for his audience in the future.

I bought it for hot yoga but there's no way I could wear this to work out. There's practically zero support. Maybe if you were very small breasted but for medium to larger girls this is a \\"no\\". I like it, just not for sports.

I don't always want to wear a full layer/tank under my usual tops. These look nice and hide the girls. As for sizing, I wasn't sure what to order. Typically I would be a medium, and that is what I purchased. As a layer, a medium fit fine. However, the bottom band, that goes around my chest is not tight at all, and in fact rides up a bit. Since I'm layering, I don't mind. But, as for a sports bra, I would say definitely size down if you want a more secure fit/support. I think the other reviewers are correct on ordering smaller than you normally would. I have some other bras I can wear around as lounge wear that are much more supportive. This isn't much different than a tank top for support. I'm about 5/7, 140, 34 B/C. I would order a small if I ordered again, that or add a little stitch to take in the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sports bra","review":"I returned this item.

They are among the finest, and Giulini is a conductor who can perform Verdi with no serious rivals. The understanding between the musicians and the work is clear and beautiful. Cotrubas could hardly be more poignant and lovely a Gilda, and Cappuccilli's Rigoletto is one of the most endearing, suffering, witty, and well-rounded portrayals of this character that I have ever heard. The voices of those two performers is enough to make anyone listening freeze in one spot and only later begin to wonder why no one sings like that anymore. Domingo performs well, but this recording is somewhat early in his career and his distinctive voice is not quite at its prime. It doesn't matter: he is not the star here, and it is nice for once to hear him humbled by the voices around his.

I ordered this item for Christmas because I thought it would provide the girls different, positive, affirming choices for playing with their Polly Pocket dolls.They opened it up on Christmas day, the girls definitley honed in on the doctor being a male, and the other professions being female. The female dolls have much more traditionally female jobs - teacher and artist (absolutely nothing wrong with those professions at all, just limits the kids' notions of what they can do when they get older).

She also is unable to tell the slime who screwed her over for another woman that she can't represent him! This woman is a doormat and hardly an example to good/fun PI novels. I figured out the killer on page 92-3 as soon as they were talking about Regis & Kathie Lee and plodded through the rest to see how Eichler would resolve this story. It's definitely not a good one, but as I am working my way through the series, I find that most of these novels have been in the 2-3 star range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we trying to teach antisocial behaviour?","review":"I find this a terrible show for young children: Max is a spoiled little brat who always gets what he wants, at the expense of his long-suffering sister. What makes it worse for me is the fact that it is usually quite clear that Max knows he is being bad -- he turns around and \\"stage winks\\" at the camera when he's going to be willfully defiant or disobedient. I am sorry, but this strikes me as a truly terrible precedent to set for children. He never learns his lesson, he's never sorry, and he's constantly enabled by Ruby and Louise. In addition, his sister can be moderately smug and condescending.Please don't show your children this show! This is not a set of life lessons we need to be perpetrating.And... for the record... where are their parents? I come out of this wanting to ring up Child Services and the Supernanny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FAVORITE","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD, being a big Max & Ruby fan. My only complaint is that the image of Ruby flying a kite on the \\"menu\\" list does NOT appear in any episode. So my son requests time and time again the \\"Ruby kite\\" story which isn't on this DVD - doesn't make sense. \\"Chocolate Chicken\\" and \\"Quiet Max\\" are his favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terminal Sweetness","review":"Although adults will surely have many questions (ex: Where are Max and Ruby's parents? Why does Ruby's giggle make you want to take a baseball bat to the TV? etc.), this show does seem to have an almost hypnotic appeal for toddlers. My three-year-old loves it and has practically worn out her copy. I confidently recommend it for very young children. However, I also feel obligated to warn everyone else to leave the room while it's playing, since repeated viewing may cause adult-onset diabetes and/or severe tooth loss.Or, as in my case, plain, old insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler hit","review":"The Max and Ruby videos are a hit with the whole family.

Unless you enjoy the LA groups like The Peanut Butter Conspiracy don't waste your money. Even by PBC standards this is weak.

Its 83 pages contain some general information about careers in marketing, a few stories from Harvard alumni and 21 company profiles (that's what I bought the book for - I didn't know there are only 21).Beside the fact that they are only a few, the company profiles contain in general obvious and useless data which you would have no trouble finding on the corporations' web sites or in some magazines. Even worse, all the information was collected from internal sources. You can find some pretty detailed MBA job descriptions, but I doubt they are of much help - of course, the companies expect you to do about everything that has to be done in marketing.The only useful part of the book are the last 4-6 pages which contain some marketing career resources (books, directories, associations, web sites).If you are interested in this subject go for the vault.com and wetfeet.com guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor, poor","review":"This book is embarrassing.

Some of the sword play is pretty good and some is cheesybut the storys are pretty good. The extra's on the last dvd are cool with a few of the first Zorro movies. They also have the original first pilot episode with a compleately different story line and actors. I am very glad they did not go through with this one.

Now we are being taught that God exists to please man. The author McCullough also points out that a separation from this world may also lead to abandonment of the world, a position directly contrary to Christ's teaching about reaching the world for Him. It seems that, in every age including ours, we must strike a balance between the awesomeness of God, on one hand, and the fact that God cares about every detail in our lives, on the other. This balance must also extend to avoiding the extremes of the severity of God (God watches over our every move and is ready to punish us) versus the tender loving mercies of God (God is much too sweet to send anyone to Hell)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Your God is too Small\\" for the 90s","review":"The correlation between this book and JB Phillips classic \\"Your God is Too Small\\" are obvious as soon as you look at the verses of scripture which begin the work (Isaiah 44:10 & Isaiah 40:25 - both of which deal with the fact that there is none like God and our attempts to make an idol of Him are faulty), yet this book is more than just a rewriting of \\"Your God...\\". \\"Trivialization\\" takes Phillip's theme and conveys it in modern language and metaphors. Dr. McCullough chips away at the false gods of the 90s and after the dust has clear from the destruction of those false concepts that we try to pretend are God, we find a marvelous vacum that is just waiting for the true and living God to come in a fill. Dr. McCullough brings out the mystery and danger of our God and by doing this helps those believers (and non-believers) who read this work to begin to fathom what an incredible God the Lord is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not always Clear","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this book makes some interesting points, and overall, I think it is worth reading. I wish, though, that I could recommend McCullough more as a *writer*. As a thinker, he clearly has good ideas, but he sometimes has trouble expressing them clearly. There are points in this book that read as though they were written by a college sophomore--awkward sentence structure, lurching thoughts, unclear metaphors. There are other sections that sound almost like poor translations (\\"Wholly-Other-in-Love\\" sounds like an untranslatable idea from some German theologian!). Other parts of the book, especially the last few pages, are crystal clear. It's the lack of clarity that keeps me from giving this very good book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very insightful book that I would recommend.","review":"This book exceeded my expectations. The insights given by McCullough cut to the bare bone on numerous issues. It made me view idolatry in a totally different light, one of which I am often guilty. I finished numerous chapters in which I wondered if my highlighter would hold out.The only draw-back to this book is at times it becomes a bit too \\"wordy\\" in places. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in breaking down walls and identifying obstacles that can keep us from truly being open to God and all that He is."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Admit It","review":"As much as I trash My Scene and Bratz, I'll admit that I find this Bratz Kid really cute with her Afro puff.

There something about R.E.M. songs that don't seem to translate very well into classical. Maybe it's the lack of Michael Stipe's vocals and lyrics. Sure, with this CD the tunes are there, but where is the substance? It kinda sounds like elevator music to me.

But the concept of taking away R.E.M.'s lyrics and making their songs purely instrumental wasn't solid gold.Some of the songs come off all right. The songs that were originally more orchestral, like \\"Nightswimming\\" and \\"Everybody Hurts\\" don't sound very far off. But some of the songs, especially \\"Drive\\" and \\"Man on the Moon\\" are ridiculously sipmle without words. The music is not the same without vocals, and the simplicity that is normally so intrinsic to R.E.M.'s instrumentals becomes tedious. Which is sad.But if you're looking for a laugh, try \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" complete with very very cheesy sax solo.The Royal Philharmonic are reportedly really huge R.E.M. fans, so it's kind of mean to mock their effort.

As a leader of several hundred employees and a multimillion dollar budget, it has certainly helped me refocus on important business principles. Principles that are sometimes forgotten during the hustle and bustle of day to day business. The leaders profiled in this book generally had a very clear focus on what they wanted to accomplish and how they would accomplish it. A similar set of princilpes seemed to guide their successes. I am enormously grateful that I have been exposed to their wisdom.

Characters are all stereotypes of the \\"ideal\\" Soviet man (and woman), in an idealized USSR where the shelves are stocked, there are no ques, and everyone is happy to be working towards socialism in one country.

The New Animals were a kickin' live band and that is what we get with this release. That combined with 3 or 4 tracks by the original band make for an exciting collection.The early stuff sounds great and is played well.

(On second thought, its sympathetic portrayal of a black prison convict pining for his woman may have been a bit too edgy for a single in that era.)Almost as good are \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and \\"Corinna, Corinna, both of which are also in the blues-rock style of the original Animals.

It was not moved or exposed to less than ideal conditions (as it would have been in a car). It really was treated like a baby, but it just stopped working after only 10 months. Warranty in the US is only 90 days so it's a total loss. I would recommend trying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery, cheap headphones","review":"No battery included, and manual doesn't even tell you which battery it needs.

It uses grammar jargon without explaining what it is or when to use it. No beginning or intermediate student will be able to make any use of this manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - a good reference guide for grammar","review":"This is an excellent guide to French grammar organized very much like a style guide. For example, conjunctions with the indicative are covered under point 179. Point 180 covers french usages of the English equivalent \\"after\\" (e.g., apres and apres que), point 181 covers French usages of the English equivalent \\"as\\" (e.g., que, comme, aussi) and so on. The structure makes reference a breeze, as opposed to flipping through grammar texts for each grammar point.The book assumes that you already have a fair understanding of grammar and structure and only need clarification and/or fine tuning - this is not a text book for beginning French. Each entry has a brief but reasonably thorough explanation and several examples. There is an extensive index, a section of problem words/phrases, several exercises and an answer key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fades Fast","review":"This is a great product for around the house.

The choir sounds as though they're off in the distance, and it's ALL ORCHESTRA in your ear. I got this to practise with as my choral society was performing it, and on the recording of our own performance, we had exactly the same problem--even though we were singing full-blast, we could not be heard over the orchestra. A great, great disappointment.All that aside, this piece really grows on you. I despised it on my first read-through, but I came to love the work. It has the power and intensity of Burana's \\"O Fortuna\\", even more so because it never, never lets up, not till the explosive ending. It's a piece that will take your heart, shred it, put it back together, and throw it in your face. Awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It. It Doesn't Work.","review":"The product arrived defective. It combined the stereo input into mono output. Even worse, it seemed to have some sort of phase reversal that wiped out any sounds originally \\"centered\\" in the stereo mix, e.g., the vocal and the bass.This problem was discovered only after paying over $150 to have the unit professionally installed. I also further verified the problem by routing around the pro installation, i.e., plugging my audio source directly into the defective unit. This alternate wiring produced the same result, showing that the problem is with the purchased part.I have since bought a different interface from Amazon that works perfectly with my wiring and installation.After submitting a return request, I was contacted by the seller and returned the part to them the next day. That is the last that I have heard from them. Now Amazon is saying that it will take them at least another two weeks to decide if I am worthy of a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I bought 2!","review":"We have 2 2004 VWs, I really hated that we couldn't use our MP3 players without using the cassette player interface.

That's wonderful in some settings, but not this one. I was convinced I had purchased an item not compatible with my CD changer input. I ended up taking a sewing needle and prying apart the female receivers so that the pins had a fighting change to make the connection. It worked.This is a great alternative to buying a new head unit. With a little ingenuity you can feed your 1/8\\" plug through the glove box and have it ready and waiting in one of your slide out compartments.

Hans Von Campenhausen's sociologial and historical perspective, blendid with his theoretical wit and scholarly lore, make this book an entertaining and ultimately edifying experience. Von Campenhausen dissolves some of the most complex questions history has left us behind and builds a comprehensive and unequivocal bulwark of learning for the clergyman and lay person alike. Some topics Von Campenhausen deals with are the power of the keys to bind and loose, the penitential and disciplinary techniques, and the controversial nature of apostolic succession in the Church of the first three centuries. All in all this book is an excellent source for grasping the perplexities of the Church's formation into the ecclesiastical organization we know today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny, Tiny Picks","review":"These picks were cute enough, but they were smaller than expected.

Written by the in the 1920s by Hervey Allen who later became well known for his epic novel, Anthony Adverse, Israfel was the first definitve biography of Poe and has been a foundational reference for all biographies written since. It has the added dimension of a biography written in the same general era that Poe lived thus, perhaps, telling us as much about that era as it does about Poe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is the . . . stuff :-)","review":"Poop-Off is a safe, enzymatic cleaner which softens up hard, crusted bird droppings into a wet, gloppy after-dropping sludge. You might be wondering if this is a good thing, and the answer is, absolutely! The gloppy-wet stuff is very easy to wipe off without scrubbing. Poop-Off works much better than vinegar and smells less, although it does have a distinct aroma of its own. You can use Poop-Off while your birds are nearby, although, of course, you should not spray it directly on them.The price quoted on Amazon at the time I write this review is far lower that what you would spend in a pet store or from the manufacturer. To me, that means I can use more of it and spend less time wiping cage bars, playpens, etc.If you're not a bird person, this whole thing probably seems funny to you, starting with the product name. However, if you are a bird person, I highly recommend this product to you, especially at the Amazon/Global Pets price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poop-off really works","review":"This stuff really works.

It looks great and we liked the fact that the jar is glass and the base has a clean stainless look. We use it often to make smoothies with juice, frozen fruit, etc.However, it started breaking down in the last 6 months. My husband keeps tightening the blades inside the blender, but it has broken down to the point where we can't use it anymore. We may try to get it repaired, but it would probably cost the same to buy another, less expensive blender. I don't know how long a blender should last, I just wish this one would have held up longer. I wouldn't buy another one; it doesn't seem worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down after 2 months","review":"I bought this blender to make fruit smoothies (mostly strawberry) for my athletic husband and son. I bought a \\"top-of-the-line\\" because I knew it would get heavy use. It worked perfectly for about 2 months, and then I had to take it in to the authorized repair shop in our city for a new blade assembly because it no longer blended the frozen fruit; this was done under warranty at no cost to me. The repairman said to add the liquid first, and then add the fruit through the hole in the lid while the motor was running because the blades don't grind frozen fruit--they cause it to \\"explode\\". I took the repaired blender home, where it made 2 or 3 good fruit smoothies before going back to its old trick of not blending the frozen fruit again. It will still make shakes with ice cream and the like, but forget the fruit smoothies. So I guess I'll be going back to the repair shop and seeing what can be done--or asking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my Oster back.","review":"I bought this blender two years ago to upgrade from my Oster blender.

The authors have clearly done their homework and the section on insulin resistance is vital, as I know personally. As someone with insulin resistance, I know I'm at higher risk for thyroid disease, high choleterol and diabetes. The author demonstrates how proper diet and exercise can ward off further problems and go a long way towards eliminating unnecessary medications and diseases. In addition to this information, there's detailed tips on how to use body-building to prevent osteoporosis as well as lesser known information that can make a world of difference in feeling truly healthy and engergetic. One of the best books I've ever read on the subject!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't settle for getting old","review":"Very interesting book. This book provides a very clear pronouncement that you don't have to settle for aging - that the primary age markers can be improved with a plan and action, both of which are explained in this book. It goes deeply into the science and explains itself completely. My only reservations about the information presented is that 1) the book is over 10 years old - I wish there was an updated edition and 2) giving checklists and worksheets on the actions required would be more helpful and 3) this book spends very little time on the nutritional aspects of improving biomarkers.

You will want to get the new volume as soon as possible just to find out what happens! It's one of the best \\"teen romance\\" manga I've ever read. When you start this, make sure you have access to the later volumes, because you will probably want to read through them all as soon as possible!One more thing - be warned, despite the cliche fluffy start, this manga also touches on surprisingly dark themes.If you like other teen romance manga series, this one is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mars...a great manga","review":"I am an avid manga collector and had been wanting to check out Mars for a long time since I saw a write up on it in Newtype magazine.

While the artwork is well-drawn (though in rather unoriginal same old shojo style), I don't see any emotional depth in it.How does the storyline go? Well, basically, it's about a girl who used to hate the main male protagonist, but she started agonizing over her unexplainable attraction to him (because he admired her work, a sculpture of Mars, by kissing it...). The main male character promised to protect her unconditionally but for what? Just because he fell in love with her arts (huh?).Unfortunately for the female main character, because she is now the target of many jealous girls who go gaga over the male protagonist.

I looked, and looked and decided on these as well as one that locks/screws closed. We had some of these hooked on each backpack, and while we never used the larger one we bought that locked closed, these were FANTASTIC! We used them nearly every day for a variety of different uses. This was one of my very best purchases for the trip. These carabiners are nice and sturdy. They are very inexpensive for what you get but are not cheap! I'm sure we will be using these for many years to come, not only when traveling, but also when going to the zoo and other outings with children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not climbing with them","review":"Cheap and good.

Still the same color and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"is there a half star???","review":"this is a horrible movie. i mean truly horrible. they spliced up scenes for the movie to make a good trailer and then you watch the dvd and it is absolute crap. I never stop movies halfway through but i watched it with my mother and she fell asleep and when she awoke i practically begged her to not make me watch anymore. it was so unbelievably bad. Not funny at all. Its one of those movies where none of the characters are likeable. Justin timberlake was so clueless i actually felt sorry for him and cameron diaz plays this burnt out mess whos trying to rumage up 10 grand for a boob job after \\"window shopping\\" in a magazine after her gold mine leaves her before the wedding.you want a funny movie with dirty humor rent or buy \\"Bridesmaids\\" you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie in any format!","review":"This is the worst recent release movie I have seen that I can ever remember!

Boy was I wrong. I probably did not watch fifteen minutes of this mess of a movie. Too much profanity for starters. Cameron Diaz character from the jump start did not show much promise. They protrayed her as a gold digging foul mouthed user of men and people. The things some people do for money. Eventually, her foul mouth and acting made it hard for me to watch the movie any further.If I could, I would have given her 1/2 a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Funny!!","review":"If your not into just stupid humor you won't like this.

This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters had no personality, the story line had no point, the ending made no sense, skipping from one thing to another and I found it so boring I actually fell asleep about 45 minutes in. Cameron Diaz's character was so vulgar and such a B&$%# I found myself wanting to punch her in what seemed to be this movies center of attention,(her chest). Don't let the all star cast fool you. This isn't the product of bad acting, but bad writing. Very bad writing. This possibly could have been a good movie with a little more effort from the writer and director. Instead it just turned out to be 97 minutes of my life that I will never get back. The only character who actually got a smile out of me was Jason Segel's,(the gym teacher), but in the end it was just that, a smile. Huge disappointment...I'm really peeved I spent money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few movies I couldn't finish","review":"The story was so un-compelling that even though we paid for the rental, we stopped ~25 minutes in and decided to do chores instead of subject ourselves to more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I shouldn't be surprised...","review":"I mean, really, when was the last time Diaz was in a good movie. Actually, I thought Justin Timberlake was a hoot. Overall, the movie is cliche, predictable, and more painfully awkward than funny. (There were, however, a couple of good moments.)

Both are overrated and neither can act. This movie has no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Teacher","review":"I had high expectations for this movie, and was sorely let-down. A mix of School of Rock and every other \\"teacher\\" movie out there, it was predictable and drawn out. I saw how the movie was going to end about 10 minutes into it and the rest was less-than-funny filler. Justin Timberlake's character was my least favorite of the movie, and the whole time his bad acting left a horrible taste in my mouth. Paired up with Cameron Diaz's equally awful acting, it was a waste of money to even rent this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time. Not funny at all.

The writing is smart, and the cast does a great job with it. I think this was one of my favorite parts for Cameron Diaz - she plays 'bad' well, and seemed to be having a great time with this one. She and Justin Timberlake were a riot together, and Lucy Punch and Jason Segel are great in their supporting roles. There are a lot of raunchy moments, but it's not the main humor of the movie - a lot of the humor is zinger insults between Lucy Punch and Cameron Diaz, and they are quite good at it. I didn't find the characters as unlikable as some - they are hard-edged, but not whiny, so I can take that. So overall, if you're looking for a funny, medium-brow comedy, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny flick!","review":"One of the funnier movies to come out in 2011, I really enjoyed it.

It's definetly no where close to real-life, but I loved it. I love movies that you can put in and it requires little thought to get whats going on. Its just enjoyable to watch. My husband enjoyed it to. I expected Justin's character to have a bigger part, but I was surprised by how much I liked Jason Segal in the movie. I was disappointed because I watched the redband trailer and in the movie some of the more vulgur lines were not in the movie that were in the trailer.

Then again, the actors are as good as the script allows. There are so many possible comedies for grabs about teachers or students and administrators in academia and this is the best they can do? Is Diaz using the F word and C word and S word supposed to make us laugh? Yea maybe if they surgically remove 3/4 of your brain?..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"The movie has a great cast.

To my surprise, this movie focuses more on wit and less on cussing for its humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking Fantastic.","review":"I laughed and couldn't stop. Maybe it's because I can relate to the laughing at such a rigid role. I work in medicine and for some reason it sometimes feels great to safely let out an oh who gives a once in a while.

The envelope could've been pushed further. The humor was a bit dry; not surprising since Bad Teacher was written by a guy who wrote for NBC's The Office. The film moved at a slow, uneventful pace causing my mind to wander...no ADHD here...the movie was just a major bore. The car wash scene seemed like a desperate measure to spark audience interest after a dull start. No offense to Ms. Diaz, she's super hot, but Liv Tyler's scrub-down in One Night at McCools is the best theatrical car wash scene. McCool's left a little for the imagination. On a positive note, Cameron absolutely nails her role as World's Bitchiest Teacher.

I don't know if the people that made this movie expected the audience to sympathize with the main character, but it is impossible. She is a horrible person. Now, in other movies this type of character could be likable if they are at least funny, but that was not the case with this movie. Everything she did was horrible and selfish and SHE GOT AWAY WITH everything. Drugging and blackmailing a superintendent, cheating on standardized tests, not teaching her class anything for a whole school year, stealing someone else's boyfriend, stealing money from the school; she gets away with all that and more. Ugh what a disgrace of a movie. Definitely skip this one.

The story is terribly written, really trashy and the acting is not much better. To be honest, I am not a prude(I mean Caddyshack is my fav movie of all time), but to me, this movie was vulgar in a way that was not even funny.The only actors who made this movie watchable were Jason Segel and Lucy Punch who actually delivered some funny lines.

Basically, it was just a piece trash. Sorry that young and misled minds that haven't been exposed to real comedy will probably think it's funny.

As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the use of the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13 at best. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated, comedy billing itself as raunchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Horrible Movie","review":"This is one of the most horrible movies out there.

I just felt like the whole movie was off for some reason, that the characters and story was just there for the sake of being there with no real purpose. I don't really know who to describe it. It almost seemed by the end of the movie nothing was really achieved and we're at the beginning again. Overall, two stars for at least keeping me semi interested with barely decent humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK comedy Funny but not great","review":"I felt this movie under delivered in the humor department. There were a couple of VERY funny scenes, but all in all, came up a bit short. This is a good movie to catch on cable, but not as a pay-per-view or in the theater. Cameron Diaz was very funny, but was a bit saddled with some forced dialog; trying too hard to be shocking. While Justin Timberlake delivered a solid performance, his character was so creepy, it made the audience uncomfortable to watch him. The one scene with Diaz and Timberlake was just plain disturbing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"it was just not a great movie, but obviously entertaining if I watched it till the end :( Still, I have seen other silly movies that were not so bad. Perhaps because at least something in the movies was believable; IN this one - perhaps there are plenty of teachers who smoke pot, but not the kind where a teacher comes to work dressed in mini skirt and crazy hills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time watching this movie!!!!!","review":"Bad plot, tiring to watch main charactor betray everyone and everything. Halfway though the movie we switched it off, we truly wasted out money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was one of the worst movies ever. The only good things about this movie is Jason Segel, and he only had a minor role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It is a waste of time and money. It is demeaning to every character and ultimately to the audience because they sat through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny? So-so.","review":"I was really surprised that some critic called this the funniest film of the year and how it was as funny asBridesmaids. I don't think so! Sure, this had a few funny parts but it was nowhere near as funny as \\"Bridesmaids.\\" The main thing was that Diaz's character was despicable and, as a viewer, I had absolutely no compassion or concern for her, so that you don't root for her. I was hoping she would fail miserably, in fact. Not to say Lucy Punch's character was good either, but it just wasn't that good of a film. The best person/character in the film was (no surprise) Jason Segel. He had the best lines and part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert","review":"If you havent seen Gustavo Dudamel Conducting, this is the video to see. Its a pleasure to hear Juan Diego Florez singing all those areas and the famous South American Songs that most of us know !

What a disappointment! I was unable to drum up any interest in the characters, the plot was dull and plodding, and the wonderful humor (so abundant in her former books) was sadly absent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Dig Digging","review":"I found this book rather boring. Every time I thought something interesting was going to happen, nothing did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If this book had not been required reading for my Book Club, and if it had not been short, I would have put it down as a waste of time, but I read it through, always hoping that there would be something to move me, or surprise me, or at least come to some sort of resolution, but it never happened. Yes, these are sketches of individuals relating to each other, but they are only mildly interesting, not thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine reading, thoughtful novel!","review":"First, I am a male and I enjoy Anne Tyler's books. There, I've said it! If you have a deficit in emotional intelligence, Anne Tyler will provide remedial reading. I highly recommend this and her many other novels.Provides insightful views into how people think in ways most people would never be aware or self aware - all while entertaining. Don't get me wrong, though this novel grabs your attention, though it is not just another novel to pass the time with. I always feel enriched by Anne Tyler and this perhaps her most personal novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Will provide good discussion in book groups or with friends. Good subject well presented. Worthy of a serious read. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such an Uninteresting Book","review":"Got (tediously) halfway through 'Digging to America' last night and am puzzled about its 'National Bestseller' status... I just can't relate to a character named Bitsy-ugh. The truth is, EVERY character was equally shallow. And now I'm irritated about this gross waste of my precious time! I wanted more insights about little Susan's personality, as she seemed the most interesting by far--but I am not going to finish this book to find out if she ever evolves. Even the pathetic attempts writing about foreign foods lacked description--so mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond painful","review":"i just kept thinking, what's the payoff? Will Arrival Day bring the arrival of a nuclear bomb? Or the bubonic plague, to wipe out the most tedious and irritating characters ever created? Will Piranahconda suddenly rise from the toilet and devour the entire freakishly extended clan... PLEASE?I read this because there was literally nothing else in the house I hadn't read, and I vaguely remembered enjoying an Anne Tyler novel years back...I should have dropped it after the first chapter, but I couldn't actually believe it was just going to meander along and then stop, for no apparent reason. The only note in the entire book that rang true was when there was something about one of the kids hating Arrival Day. Yeah, me too, kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digging to America","review":"Anne Tyler has long been one of my favorite authors. Her development of the characters in Digging to America is so good, you feel a real connection to them. I like the way she compares and contrasts the cultures of the Baltimorean family with the Iranian family who each adopted a Korean baby girl. Throughout the book, though, the human element shines strongly overpowering any cultural differences. Like life, it ends without every loose end tied up, but it is after all like being a fly on the wall watching the people in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Me the Binky Fairy","review":"As a multiculturalist, I seemed like a natural to enjoy Tyler's latest novel, which mixes the cultures of Americans, Iranians, and to some extent, Koreans in her story about two families who simultaneously adopt Korean orphans and in the process become friends. There's even a reference to my religious tradition, Unitarian Universalism. But the story, except for the plight of the American grandfather who loses his beloved wife to cancer, never really engaged me, and I got annoyed at the jarring change of perspective near the end from the adults to one of the Korean children--I surely hope I never meet the Binky Fairy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitive, timely novel","review":"Anne Tyler really gets it!! Her story contrasting two families adopting children points up so clearly and beautifully how much we are all different while essentially all the same. The American couple are so American!! The Persian couple are perfect foils but also loveable and as imperfect as we all are. That the world is diverse and that we need better understanding and compassion for each other is a message we can't hear enough and I must say, I loved every word of this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than you think","review":"After being disappointed in the past few Tyler books, I approached Digging to America hesitantly. But there is real substance to this story. Tyler has reclaimed her gifts for storytelling, gentle irony, and wonderful observations. This is the kind of book that keeps you thinking about it after you've finished it. I laughed out loud in several parts. And was touched by others. The key gift of this book is that there is true change in some of the characters. Following their journeys is engrossing. And the changes are completely believable. She is the master of style: subtle and unobstrusive. A book more substantial than the media reviews acknowledged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am struggling to finish this book so I decided to read the reviews to see if there was any hope it might get better. I've got to say, I really don't understand the 5 star ratings. Really? You thought it was THAT good? It seems like the entire book revolves around them all getting together for parties all.the.time. I've read so many books which discuss people of different cultures existing in a foreign or native country, and they can be so extremely intriguing. This book, however, is just plain boring. *yawn* Maybe the problem I'm having with it is that the character POV changes so many times. And when it's Dave or Maryam, which is it seems it is a lot, I don't care really to hear what they have to say/think. Sorry, I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adoption - family versus culture","review":"As a grandmother of three adopted children - one of whom is from a foreign country - I was quite interested in how these two families handled the assimulation of the child into the family. Also of interest was the reaction of grandparents and other family members to the new baby. I was delighted in the characters. This is one book that has much to teach us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, so-so book","review":"This book could have been so much better. I thought so much of the writing was trite and boring...some of it felt very awkward. Especially when the two extended families get together the scenes are very protracted and false-ringing. I did not feel touched by these characters, nor did the writing make me care about them, other than to be annoyed by Bitsy Donaldson and confused by Ziba. I think the idea was a good one, but it fails to deliver (in my opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for book clubs","review":"An easy read- it's well-written, but somewhat trite. But it does raise questions that are interesting to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing reading experience","review":"I adore Anne Tyler and have read all of her books several times. So, it was with great anticipation I bought her latest offering, Digging to America. However, it is with great disappointment I say to potential purchasers - forget it. Plodding, boring, poor characterisation and - dare I say it? -this book is badly written. As another Amazon reviewer so cleverly put it, it feels as if it was written by a ghost writer.Our book club meets next week to discuss it and I know it will be such a disappointment for the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"novel where nothing happens","review":"I finished this book because I was urged to by people who had read and loved it, but the reason why is still beyond me. Nothing much happens in this book except a series of suburban dinner parties. Since there is no plot, some strength of characterization should have been necessary, but none of the characters are engaging and we don't get to know them very well. There are some sentences and scenes which are good and amusing descriptions of people's thoughts and conversations, but that's not enough to carry a book which was conceived without much in the way of content."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Well maybe it's because I'm a mother of a two year old or because I am interested in other cultures, but I really enjoyed this novel. It didn't have to have elaborate and gripping plot lines because it was simply a novel depicting two families from very different cultures who have one huge thing in common and that is that they have both adopted girls from Korea. Tyler makes a good attempt at constructing the American from the perspective of an Iranian extended family. Being the typical white bread american, I enjoy glimpsing what other cultures think of us, even though it is usually fairly unflattering. I will say that the ending seems abrupt, but when I think about it, the entire book is sort of a narrative of every day life and so there is no real climax or suitable ending that I could think of. Most of all, I am grateful to Anne Tyler for writing a book that is uplifting and thought provoking without including unnecessary explitives or erotic material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone's gotten lazy!","review":"This book is to literature as paint-by-numbers is to art. Everything that happens is predictable and trite. It's populated less by characters than by caricatures. Even their names are ridiculous - \\"Bitsy\\"; \\"Linwood\\"? Really?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read....","review":"Since this is my first Anne Tyler book, I am not as critical as some of the reviews I have read by long time fans. I found the book to be wonderfully engaging. As I live abroad, I thought that the \\"immigrant\\" side of things was rather clearly thought out in the book. Perhaps the ending was a bit wordy, but I would recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Just a quick note to say how much I enjoyed this book, and the reader who read it aloud. The book is an engaging, nuanced portrait of two intertwined families, that captures truths about the nature of being a foreigner, but also the nature of being a family, a parent, a child. The book doesn't give readers pat answers, but nonetheless has a very generous spirit to it. I grew more and more engrossed as I listened. The reader is great too -- nicely paced, capturing the voices of the many different Iranian and American characters in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"slice of life","review":"I found \\"Digging To America\\" to be a little on the \\"c'mon let's get the story moving\\" side, but being an Anne Tyler fan I know her stories in the end leave you wishing there was more. This one seemed to get better in the last 50-60 pages as I wasn't sure how things would turn out between all the characters.I've enjoyed her other works more (The Accidental Tourist, The Amatuer Marriage, Ladder of Years), but still another great slice of life carved out by a true literary genious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of stereotypes and cliches","review":"This book is poorly researched and based on cliches and stereotypes about adoption and international adoption. Like all Anne Tyler books, the characters are interesting and quirky. However, the author's understanding of international adoption, or rather her lack of understanding, is obvious. It is clear this is an outsider's view and that she is looking in with some disdain. The most disturbing part of the book for me was that it seemed that the author didn't like two of the three children in the novel - she continually described their personalities, and even their appearance (particularly their Asian features) in disparaging terms. As a parent of two children adopted internationally, I was keen to read this book but once I started it I couldn't wait to finish it and put it away for good because it was so awful. The only reason I finished it was so that I could tell others why they shouldn't waste their time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I made the mistake of buying two copies. One for my friend to read on vacation and the other for myself. We both disliked the book. I was very suprised a Pulitzer winning author wrote this story. We both had a really difficult time finishing it! Very disappointing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"from adoptive mom","review":"You can tell Tyler is neither an adoptive parent or good researcher; she uses language that many adoptive parents consider offensive. Examples: Calling bio parents the \\"real\\" parents and saying adopted kids are not adoptive parents \\"own\\" kids, plus implying that all adoptive parents are \\"barren\\" (a nasty word and not true). Also, the arrival day is not her invention, as the publisher says, but common among parents of foreign-born. There are MUCH better books out there about adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Story","review":"This book was beautifully written and fun to read. The author captured what it is like to be a foreigner, being in but not of another culture. She also seems to understand how living in another culture changes a person so that she doesn't feel totally at home anywhere.The characters in the book, while sometimes seeming like \\"types\\" were certainly \\"types\\" I have seen and known and therefore they were real and believable.I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am biased in favor of Anne Tyler books","review":"I haven't met an Anne Tyler book yet that I didn't love. This one is quite different, and yet I love it too. The families, as usual, are so finely drawn that I feel I have known them all my life. There is one description in the book that has stuck with me, of toddlers squatting down to look at something on the ground. I can't see a toddler without thinking of that scene and how perfectly Anne Tyler captured it.The changing voices of the narrators added depth to the tale, seeing the same events from differing perspectives. The grandmother has such depth that I still think about her, and wonder whether she has made the right choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book I've ever trudged through","review":"I have no idea why this book was written, nothing of any interest happens, the characters.. who cares about them. Pointless, I kept hoping it would get better, what a borefest. Watch grass grow, it's time better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I read Digging to America because it received so many rave reviews. I just finished it and found it to be rather boring and poorly written. There was no continuous thread that kept my interest; I found myself wondering if I had skipped some pages because the story seemed so disjointed. Also, beginning in Chapter 9, why the sudden change from: \\"Bitsy did . . .\\" to \\"Jin-Ho's mother did . . .\\" and so on. I didn't get that at all and found it annoying. Maybe I'm missing something??"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Anne Tyler?","review":"What a disappointment this book was! I certainly expected a lot more out of Tyler. The character's were shallow and the plot never really went any where. I love Tyler's other books, and kept expecting this one to go somewhere. It never did. In addition to this, about 2/3 of the way through some of the characters started being referred to in the third person. It was as though the book had changed authors. It was most aggravating. Don't waste you time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off to a good start, but then...","review":"After \\"The Amateur Marriage\\" I swore I wasn't reading anymore Anne Tyler, but someone said this was good. The final 50 or so pages were deadly dull, repeticious and predictable. And one chapter was from the point of view of a four-year-old! Please, spare me. I finished this book just so I could say fairly that I thought it was a dud.Who was this book about? There were too many characters and most of them were underdeveloped. Plus too many details. How many times did we have to know that Maryam took care of Susan? How many idiotic family gatherings did I have to witness?The girls' adoption sets this story in motion, then it goes nowhere. I didn't believe for a minute that Maryam cared about Dave. Toward the end there were pages and pages explaining Maryam. Tyler should have used all that background herself to write an interesting character instead of explaining it all to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tyler ever!","review":"I've read most of Anne Tyler through the years. This is the best--doesn't have the quirkiness nor the bummer-beat atmosphere of most of her other novels. Here, instead, she plunges so aptly into the cross cultural diverse world we all live in these days.And what a perfect way to do it. Tyler must know Iranians well as her late husband was an Iran-born psychiatrist on the University of Maryland faculty. Tyler knows the culture she portrays intimately--and what a timely novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrate our Differences","review":"Anne Tyler takes a new look at our shrinking world, with babies arriving from around the world, Grandmothers from other cultures, and everyone striving to be happy, healthy and to fit in.The engrossing story will make you laugh, grimace and cheer on the cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyler is Terrific","review":"Anne Tyler's latest book, Digging to America, is her finest yet. Her descriptions of two very different families who adopt infant girls from Korea are insightful, warm and witty. She doesn't waste a single word in this delightful and gentle tale; her clean writing is a joy to read, yet nothing is lacking. Missing is the quirkiness that characterized her earlier works, but the story sacrifices no humor because of it. Her characters seem to live and breathe on the page. It's a must for anyone who likes wonderful writing, who has ever lived in a family, loved a child, or worried about being needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and uninspiring","review":"I enjoy Anne Tyler's work, but found this story shallow and uninspiring. My husband and I adopted a precious baby daughter from Korea many years ago, and I expected to find at least a few shared experiences. What a disappointment! I was unable to connect with any of these characters in any way and found the story completely lacking in credibility. Bitsy's attempt to preserve Jin-Ho's cultural roots was pathetic -- without sensitivity or understanding. How could anyone be that clueless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I couldn't enter no star!","review":"This is the most boring book I have read in years, and I love Anne Tyler. The plot was nonexistent, consisting of annual parties celebrating the \\"Homecoming\\" of the adopted children. None of the characters were the least bit interesting; however, the ending maybe showed a little bit of hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, another birthday????","review":"I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a properAmerican. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is plain and boring","review":"I have read almost every book written by Anne Tyler. Her recent books have really been going downhill. This new book is plain and really boring. I didn't finish the last 1/4 of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"B - O - R - I - N - G","review":"Wow. I don't even know what to say. The book went no where. I was so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Anne Tyler...","review":"Never read one of her books before and the reviews on this one sounded good and the premise intriguing so I took a chance. Not good. I can understand why women like her work, as they get all the good parts and good lines while the men are consigned to secondary roles and are total wimps. (When a hurrican strikes and the neighborhood is blacked out and covered with fallen trees, none of the male characters goes out to buy, rent or borrow a chain saw and clear it up -- everyone just waits around dumbly and passively to be rescued). Serviceable prose and the occasional zinger of characterization save this from one star doom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as Sin","review":"Nothing exciting happens in this book. The self-conscious word play and descriptive language amount to a hill of beans.And the cover seems inaccurate: the Asian girl holding up the flowers looks to come from North Korea or China, where that kind of Communist-era uniform and haircut are common, not from South Korea.I'm sure there are better books about the experience of Korean orphans who get adopted into American families. And I suggest \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" if you want a vivid account of someone who lived in Iran and the USA.I usually like Anne Tyler's books, but this one put me to sleep night after night. I kept counting the pages to go until it was over and I could move onto something exciting and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner!","review":"What a book. I couldn't put it down. We have two families here. One American, the other Iranian/American. They both are adopting and end up becoming great friends. Having parties just to have them, and learning each other traditions. We have many strong characters in this book, but I loved the Maryam/Dave story the best. I never thought about it being hard for foreigners to fit in.I loved the pacifier party, and what do you know, she still got ahold of one. I think families are very important and I loved that all members of the families were around a large part of the time. We have a bit of loss when Bitsy's mother passes away, and Bitsy herself gets sick.I love how Maryam decides in the end that she really wants to be a part of it all and that she realizes that they themselves want her to be a part.I have never researched the whole adoption process or these culture aspects that are in the book, but I recommend this book and look forward to more by this wonderful author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happened","review":"I was so eager to get this book and received it as a Christmas present. I quickly got into the story but then nothing happened. You keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. The book ends with some of the story hanging, not knowing what happened to some of the characters. I felt very disappointed at the finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment Considering......","review":"I loved \\"Back When We Were Grown-Up,\\" and expected to really enjoy this, as well. Unfortunately, this was not the case! Enough with the Airport Celebrations -- how many do we need to get the picture?? I don't wish to ruin the read for others. however, I can state that I would have preferred a different path for certain characters. I liked many of Tyler's characters here, but this book & I just didn't click!! I guess I was hoping to encounter another Rebecca from her previous book [already mentioned]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Tyler - my favourite authoress!","review":"As with all of Anne Tyler's books, I thoroughly enjoyed her latest novel. It kept me interested and entertained right up to the last page, and as always, I was sorry to see the story end. I didn't like this story as much as some of her other ones, but I definitely am glad I bought it to read and to add to my Anne Tyler collection. True Anne Tyler fans won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Tyler is always a treat.","review":"Her people are always so essentially decent. The premise of this one makes me think it would be a good choice for a community book pick.An American couple and an ethnic Iranian-American couple both adopt baby daughters from Korea on the same day. The circumstance puts them in each other's lives in a Maypole ribbony kind of way. It's multi-generational. It has a lot to say about culture clashes--the really mild ones. It's about extended families and extending families. It explores the idea of what it means to be an American w/o being patriotic and why some people always feel like The Other. Tyler is so great at writing about domestic life, but this one feels more expansive, somehow. It's accessible and could be very good for discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Boring","review":"I have not read any previous Ann Tyler novels and I might have made a mistake by starting with this one. I love to read and feel I am not an overly critical reviewer but I expect to be entertained, informed or both. This novel is just plain repetitive and boring.I strongly urge readers, if they feel compelled to buy it, to wait for the paperback. This book went on and on about \\"Arrival day\\", the day the girls arrived at the airport from Korea. If I heard one more silly reference to the characters singing \\"She'll be Coming Round the Mountain\\" I was going to gag.I did give it two stars because I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Datalogging!

All of Extech's datalogging meters come with software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reason for Hope","review":"Well-written and compelling, Humble and Awake does indeed draw us into the reasons why we have fallen asleep on both the personal and cultural levels. Its subject matter is not only for intellectual reflection on our modern saturated culture that causes drowsiness and undesired disinterest (thus leaving us not only lost and unable to decide, but lost and unable to act.) Perhaps the greatest value in this work is in providing serious material for religious and spiritual meditation. Using a field populated with a mixture of philosophy, medical imagery, contemporary culture, film, music, literature and the Scriptures, Casey shows how our cultural coma claims the debt of our present exhaustion by creating its own drug that leaves us listless. Can easily be used as a readable book for groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating tour of villages in France, excellent photos","review":"Fall in love with the most enthralling, comforting atmosphere which France has to offer: life in the smallest villages.

Don't be fooled by the book's apparent deficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"'A Whole Lot Of Rainbows: Soft Pop Nuggets' (Rhino) Various Artists","review":"Twenty-four track collection of those 'soft rock' or what some refer to as 'sunshine pop' artists. This may not be my favorite various artists compliation CD out there (even of '60's music), but 'A Whole Lot Of Rainbows' is definitely aimed toward the fans that totally dig bands like the Everly Brothers, the Association, the Vogues, Jan & Dean and the Monkees more than the casual follower. Some of the obscure names here include the New York band Morning Glories, Looking Glass, Holy Mackerel and Addrisi Brothers. A nice pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my insulin?","review":"A collection of nice pleasant songs of the sort found on soundtracks for any number of movies or TV shows based on coming of age or love in the mid to late 1960s. There are a number of well-known groups on the CD; The Association for example. That this was a follow-up to a similar product from the year before is shocking in that it implies the former was a financially successful endeavor.

I was very disappointed in the choice of narrators as the two men had a speaking style that was, to be quite honest, monotone. As I purchased the audio version to have something to listen to while at work, I was sorely disappointed by the reading style of the two male narrators. The woman who was featured very early in the narration disappeared at some point, and I really wish she had been chosen to read the entire text, as her voice was far superior to those of the other two. It was very disappointing as this is a topic I am greatly fascinated in.

Well worth spendng a few hours listening to this - it will draw you inward. The whispering chants in the background have a uplifting effect. This one not some new age mood music but seems to have purpose and focus - as if it were pulling your energy some how up your spine! Almost other worldly times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for external use","review":"I purchased this item for remote (wireless non CLS) flash(manual). Modeling light and 1/3 power increments make it attractive to use in manual mode. While these features work fine there is a major flaw. The unit has an auto turn off feature that can't be turned off (pressing the test button will reactivate the flash). Obviously that make it not suitable for remote flash work. Also, in case you are wondering, the unit min power is 1/64 (I was hoping for 1/128)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flash before the D60's time","review":"This Flash is before it's time or should I say before the Nikon D60's time.I purchased this flash to use with my Nikon D60 and it did not work with the D60. The D60 is a new model Nikon and and the Sigma EF was produced before the D60. The problem is the electronics in the D60 are different from the D40's and the earlier models of Nikon DSLR's.Check out the Sigma website and check the model Nikon's that are listed on the website and you will see that the D60 is not listed, because the Sigma EF's electronics are different which will not allow the camera to communicate with the Sigma EF correctly.I returned the Sigma EF and purchased the Nikon SB-600. So save your time and money and purchase a true Nikon for a Nikon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left, came back","review":"I had used the face doctor soap product for a few years. I use it to reduce redness (rosacea maybe) and occasional acne. I still get acne and I'm more than a tad over 40! My understanding is that one of the main ingredients is sea buckthorn oil. I thought if that's the case, more should be better, so I bought a buckthorn oil soap from someone else.Well, the pure oil soap clogged by pores and I got more problems than using nothing.

Won't be trying anything else anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"simplify your routine","review":"I bought this \\"soap\\" for its anti-aging and pore reduction properties; I have seen results and my skin feels better than ever, no drying no tightness, no slippery residue. My teens tried it and now they won't use anything else including that expensive System endorsed by celebrities.

It worked so well for my daughter that someone stole her bar at camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricy...But a special treat!","review":"I'm a 53 year old male and like to shower with this soap. It makes me feel very clean and balanced. If you suffer from any kind of \\"ichiness\\", this may solve your problem. Have tried higher priced store brands, but like this the best.

It would be better to record it on an audio cassette."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"I must say there are some very beautiful women in this one, but overall it's a waste of money. After viewing this one I'm quite cautious about buying any other DVDs from Playboy. The picture quality is equal to that of VHS, which means you can't pause your favorite scene without some fuzziness to compliment it. Plus, the length of time spent on the most erotic scenes is very minimal. My personal opinion, don't buy it. Your better off with a magazine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you want to be bored while listening to terrible music, buy this dvd. Nothing worthwhile here."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, dull, dull","review":"One decent dyke scenario doesn't make this one worth the money. You're going to stay pretty soft on your armchair, even though there are some way pretty girls on this one. I tremble with excitement just thinking about the kind of performance that PB's arch rival Penthouse could have gotten from a gorgeous big-breasted blonde like Laura Cover. She'd have been so hot in a real depiction of sapphic sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very few Playmates","review":"I thought this DVD was a pretty big disappointment. It promised a lot in terms of girl-girl action but delivered very little. Also there were only about three Playboy Playmates in the DVD. The only worthwhile segment, and it's a good one (reason for two stars) is \\"Olivia's Closet\\" , a very sexy story starring Playboy Playmate Kelly Monaco. It was fun, sexy and Kelly simply looks amazing. As for the other segments, they are pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat let down","review":"I expected more. Some of the girls were hot, but most of them just did not live up too Playboy Quality. It was just too cute at times.

Save your money and do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and intense!!!","review":"There were many exciting scenes the best of which was probably the Nanette major shower scene.

I have nothing really critical to say of this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great women, great action, good variety","review":"No, there aren't a lot of Playmates here. But there are a lot of beautiful women and a little variety too. For those of us who like fair skinned women, there are some lovelies here. There are also a good number of tanned beach bunnies. Some gravity defying chests, and some shapely yet smaller ones. Was happy to see three lovely ladies who had bit parts in \\"Freshman Class\\" here in \\"starring\\" roles. Hey, they recycle the musical bits too.Overall great action, plenty of girl meets girl action, hot by Playboy standards.

He carries you on a style of music that is at once aggressive but yet still makes you dream of those you love. His style melds Ben E. King Harlem music with the urgency of the 80's. Every song on this CD is worth listening to over and over again. No one should miss this CD compilation. I think his lack of large commercial success was actually a help to his music, allowing it to remain unwatered down and pure to the listeners he attracted. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I would have never heard of this CD had it not been for an older friend playing it one night. Simply put, this music is amazing. Impossibly romantic and multi-talented Willy DeVille sings gem after gem on this CD. Not unlike Southside Johnny, perhaps what is most amazing is that this band has been almost entirely overlooked. This is some of the greatest music ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Byzantium","review":"This book possibly expresses the author's thoughts, even understanding, with some accuracy. But to someone who is not already familiar with the point-of-view being expressed it is totally useless. It is easy enough to claim some sort of affiliation with Ramana Maharshi, but presenting the view of reality that Ramana enjoyed, described and promoted is a different matter altogether. This writer seems to relish riddle mongering. He assumes an air of authority, of greatly superior wisdom and insight, but anyone accustomed to reading the prose of genuine essayists, like George Orwell, for example, will find this writing similar to an act of sexual intercourse where one of the participants is entirely imaginary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helen Forrest - the very best of all female jazz performers","review":"I have listened to this CD at least 50 times since I purchased it three months ago. My two personal favorites are \\"Skylark\\" and \\"That Soldier of Mine\\" even though they are not her biggest hits. I became a fan of Helen Forrest by accident. I am a recent fan of Big Band music even though it was before my time. A friend introduced me to this kind of music about five years ago. In the course of listening to this music from a New York radio station I heard for the first time the station playing Helen Forrest's biggest hits. Wow! What a performer. She became my favorite performer of all time.I have tried without success to find out if there is a fan club devoted to her music. In visiting various music stores I see more CD's devoted to Helen Forrest than previously.Once you purchase this tape I believe you will start looking for more CD's of this Big Band star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I bought this book after experiencing a problem with one of my dogs. Because of the reputation of the authors, I assumed (wrongly) that this would be a helpful book. The book seems to be a real cut and paste effort from previous works. It is disjointed and offers the reader no real tools to work with. Worse than that, I foresee someone depending on this book rather than getting professional assistance with this potentially dangerous situation. I was disappointed that these two 'experts' in dog training had nothing better to offer. Save your money, I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I have read a couple other books on general dog training, and this one offered absolutely nothing new above what I had seen before. The case studies presented about dogs retrained at the author's institute struck me as nothing more than a blatant advertisement. If you have no experience with dog training whatsoever, then maybe you will find this book useful. But if you already have some knowledge of basic training and are looking for some advanced insight and more effective ways to deal with canine aggression, save your money. The information here is too superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the times","review":"Uncle Matty is old stuff.

Although fiction, it gives a good representation of life on the Kentucky frontier. Hannah's experiences as she and her husband strive to create a home are described in a well-written, easy to read style.......I get it out every year or so to reread - it's one of my all time favorites! If you like this book, also try the sequel by the same author, \\"The Believers\\", which is the story of Hannah's daughter, Rebecca and her life among the Shakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I had to purchase this book for an online class at National University.

I really like national University and wish they would have chosen another textbook.I was not impressed with the information inside. Ryan does a question and answer format that briefly synopsis very important topics in education. Sometimes when I read a topic, I am really disappointed that a topic that has had a great deal of reseacrh is presented by Ryan in a half page.He wholeheartedly attempts to sell the reader on bilingual education which I disagree. There are other topics that he discusses with what I feel is a liberal point of view.The main point that I was taken back by is the fact that Ryan's end-of-chapter bibliographies include research that is sometimes dated. His sources are sometime 6-8 years old or older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it if you have to","review":"I had to use this book for a class at National University.

I am sure the author is a nice person and kudos for writing a book, but the fact that professors are having their students read this book as \\"required\\" reading makes me re-think my school of choice!Try it out at the library before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this \\"Book\\" only if forced to by National University!","review":"Could this be yet another example of National University choosing the worst available text simply because it is written by one of their \\"professors\\"?

This book provides a great starting out point for every question I have come up with yet on my path to becoming an educator. It helps to map out the most important things an educator should know and clarifies ideas that, before, had been unclear to me. It can be difficult to excel in online classes due to the fact that most of us are used to classroom experiences but this book made it easier to obtain the beginning knowledge needed to navigate through my classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This text book was very helpful. It will definitely be one of the text books I do not sell back so that I can reference it when I become a teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars!","review":"I purchased this book for my teaching credential/graduate program.

I have used the book throughout all of my courses as well as in my masters coursework. The book was easy to read and understand. It got me thinking about different questions about teaching. The questions range from dealing with classes, students, families, and teachers. The questions are fully addressed and really helped me to understand the content. I do not have any of my own children, so the book helped me to think of questions and be prepared for when parents ask me questions when I am a teacher.

This is one textbook that I actually enjoyed reading and quite honestly in my teaching education, there have only been a handful of enjoyable textbooks. \\"Ask the Teacher\\" is practical, clear cut, to the point and not filled with the usual turn off of boring language. I particularly enjoyed how it had a different format than the traditional textbook as it is in a Q & A format. This is what sets it apart from the usual monotonous textbook. It is more of a guide and a \\"handbook\\" to teaching. I enjoyed Ryan's useful tips and use them in my classroom. I also have had the pleasure of taking a separate class (not with this particular book) from Mark Ryan and can attest that he is an incredibly knowledgeable and down-to-earth educator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ask The Teacher: A Practitioner's Guide to Teaching and Learning in the Diverse Classroom","review":"This is a great book to guide new teachers through their journey of teaching diverse classes.

I am glad I bought this book and I believe every teacher should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to keep","review":"I bought this book for one of my first teaching credential classes and knew I had to keep it for future reference. What I like about it is that it answers a lot of the questions you may not find in your other textbooks. Some of the really basic things that are going to happen to you as a teacher are answered here with a lot of good tips on how to handle certain situations; from discipline, to special education, to reading skills...this book has such a wide variety of topics. If you buy this book for a class, it is definitely one to keep. If you don't have to buy it for a class, it is still a great book to have if you work in education in any form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for future teachers!","review":"In page 87, Mark Ryan states \\"As a teacher, don't fall into the trap that you can motivate a student. Instead, create a stimulating learning environment, provide a \\"can do\\" attitude, praise effort, and provide the opportunity or the student to change an attitude of apathy\\" It is essential for a teacher to create a positive learning environment in order for students to succeed.This book is an excellent source and would recommend it to all future teachers as well as current teachers who need assistance in creating a positive and caring environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Using a question-and-answer format, this book presents the teachers with the opportunity to confront issues dealing with foundations, educational psychology, curriculum, methodology, or family involvement in the teaching process.

It shared some valuable information, however it was entirely too short to cover the numerous topics in any real detail.

However, it's not my favorite. For a single book, I prefer the Unofficial guide; however, my main recommendation would be to go for the _Girlfriends Guide_ / _The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy_ pair.The book suffers greatly by forcing *all* the information into a month-by-month format. Plus, some of the information is placed into a very questionable month. For example, the information on traveling while pregnant is in month 6; given that, as the book says, the best months for traveling while pregnant is months 4 - 6, if one really reads it month by month one is going to be really pissed to learn it's too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book to Refer to throughout your pregnancy","review":"I found the information to be very accurate and informative.

This book is a must to add to your pregnancy literary library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I found this book to be 'just OK.' It was published in the 90's and is therefore, fairly outdated. Also, I didn't like how the weeks were referred to in gestational age (two weeks less than how your OB dates your pregnancy). I found this to be confusing and somewhat annoying. Also, most of the information was somewhat basic (nothing I hadn't encountered before)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this","review":"I've read many of the books by the Sears authors and they are always helpful, informative, and easy to read.

Coffee's on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information in a fun to read format","review":"I enjoyed having this book around when I was pregnant. I liked knowing what was going on in my body and well as in my baby. They answered all concerns you may have. I didn't however like the section on labor, I felt they were very narrow in what they considered an \\"acceptable\\" birth. I had an epidural with my son and do not feel like a failure, although they would lead you to believe you are. Other than that, I thought the book was great. And I really love the books they wrote for after the baby is born!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated by many years","review":"I bought this book because of the excellent reviews, only to be quite disappointed when I received it. What I didn't notice was the dates on the reviews, nor the date of publication, which are booth over 10 years old. This book came out 15 years ago, and the information given is widely inaccurate. For example, the information that this book states occurs during the second month of pregnancy is off by a week each.The photos are all black and white and incorrect for the time frame. The whole feel of this book is the 80's in fact. I am sure that back in 1997 when this book came out is was indeed a wonderful book, but with more modern technology and research, this book is beyond it's time and not very helpful for someone who is currently pregnant. The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy is a far better and updated book.

Also, it doesn't give much information in general. I wished I hadn't bought it and ended up using (and loving) the Mayo Clinic's guide to pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the BEST pregnancy book, by far","review":"This book helped me both enjoy and understand my pregnancy. Each time I hit the first day of each month of my pregnancy, I would sit down and read that month's chapter. There were times when I felt like I was reading an auto-biography! The authors really understand what pregnant mothers are going through. It gave me peace of mind about what was happening. I cannot say enough good things about this book. Informative, entertaining, honest without being scary. Perhaps the best thing of all was that it lead me to buy The Baby Book, which turned out to be the greatest resource once my baby was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I have other pregnancy books, but this one is the one I refer to the most. I have been reading it like a novel since I got it, because it is so informative and easy to follow. I am a first time mother, and this book is very reassuring. I will be sure to pass it on to my friends who are expecting when I am finished. It doesn't have a lot of photos, but the text will carry you through. I truly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful all the way through","review":"From the day I missed my period up until now with only a month to go until the birth, hardly a day has passed that I haven't consulted this book for something. It is information-packed, yet readable; reassuring, yet realistic; and gives a balanced perspective on potentially controversial things like homebirth and prenatal testing. Like most of the Sears books, it does have the unfortunate tendency to assume that its audience is made up of women in traditional, male-as-breadwinner marriages, and it does get overly corny at times. But those minor problems are easy to overlook in light of how terrific the rest of the book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"not specific enough","review":"I returned the book because 5-6 page chapters were dedicated to a whole trimester where thousands of things happen. The yahoo pregnancy calendar is more specific than this book. I was not able to find the info I was looking for month after month. This book is just not representative of what happens during a pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing and annoying","review":"The authors of this book imply that anyone who does not share their attitudes and experiences is weird. The objective information they provided was very helpful, but was hard to separate from the ludicrous personal experiences -- and gratuitous value judgments -- of the authors. Suffice it to say that if you have seven children like the authors, and experience nothing but nonstop morning sickness during pregnancy, you will identify with this book. Any other people might want to select a book with more universal appeal. If you are a single mother or are planning to be one, do not pick up this book -- the authors will tell you there's something wrong with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous to read and lacking concrete information","review":"I really didn't like this book. I bought this and what to expect when you are expecting. I prefered the other. I found this lacking in concrete developmental info about the fetus.

I read it for a couple of days, it answered SOME of my many questions. I retired this book as soon as I got to put my hands on to \\"What to Expect When Expecting\\" and \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" has been collecting dust ever since. It has a very poor outline of pregnancy,it only covers the common sense subjects on pregnancy while \\"What to Expect\\" will touch on subjects you would even think to ask. If this book was recommended to you, be sure to get other three or four books to answer all the other questions that this book will leave you wondering about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was disappointing, it contained no information that isn't available in every other pregnancy book. Worse, I found it to be condescending and biased. The indication throughout was that if you didn't agree with their specific, medicalized, and fear-based opinions, you are a foolish mother who does not care about her children. I prefer books that present well-balanced information and options, with fact based pros and cons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Trance At Its Best","review":"I liked his Temptation album, so I got this one.

This book is an exhaustive look at the importance of weather maps, forecast models, and the importance of a \\"hands on\\" approach to weather forecasting. The double-page format is a real treat since this makes the book even more readable and literally easier to use. I've collected many good books over the years on weather maps and forecasting, some of which are excellent, but the Weather Map Handbook is an invaluable classic at the top of my list.

All the people and furniture store inside of the house when not is use, which is a definite plus. My daughter has already asked for more sweet streets dollhouse items, specifically the Hospital, which she will definitly be getting for her 5th bday.

My limited memory of Statistics was one of fear and dread. However, I picked up Statistics for the Utterly Confused... and I am no longer confused. Written similar to \\"Dummie\\" books, it's easy to follow, easy to understand, and comes with quizzes to measure how well you're grasping concepts.Most of the recommendations for this book are for Business Statistics classes. My recommendation is for this book to be passed out to every person without a Math degree that is involved with Six Sigma. The book even gives tips for using it with Minitab and a Stats calculator.Be confused no more about Statistics, pick up this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Confused","review":"I am an MBA student and ordered this book in the hopes that it would be more readable than the text assigned.

There is nothing down-to-earth about this book. Indeed, it looks like and reads like a wallstreet journal (newspaper).It covers topics well and it does not spend too much time on things you dont' need, but it is boring to read, not enough examples, and too many redundant questions. (same question first stated as multiple choice, then as short answer, etc... )chapters are NOT in the order that i would have prefered, or the order that most statistics books use.and the Title: as everyone says, it is misleading and just plain wrong for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for practical instruction skip this book","review":"If you are studying for the GMAT or a similar test, this book might be helpful. However, if you are struggling with a problem and need practical advice on what test to use and how to perform it, pass this book by. I bought this book in part because it said on the cover that it would tell you how to use Excel for statistic.

The title, alas, is a bait and switch, perhaps added as an afterthought by the publisher. I teach mathematics, and this book was no better or worse than the average dry textbook. It even has the usual incredibly boring chapter titles like \\"Data Description- Numerical Measures of Variability for Ungrouped Univariant Data.\\" No wonder regular students find statistics so dry and confusing. Starving students would do better to buy a used statistics textbook at a \\"Friends of the Library\\" sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so book, terrible title","review":"This book is a decent reference for statistics that don't involve calculus. But there's nothing special about that -- there are plenty of others like it out there. The title creates the impression that it's especially accessible or uses some special technique to de-mystify the subject. There is NONE of that sort of sexiness inside the two covers. Just a lot of dry statistics. I suspect that someone at the publisher tried to jazz up an otherwise boring textbook by writing some breathless back-cover copy and putting cute logos on the section headings inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't take statistics without it.","review":"I took a statistics correspondence course for credit. The study guide made no sense to me. I finally got online and found this book. I was hesitant, because like the computer instructions you get, Statistic instructors think they are dummying it down for us but are only dummying it down for them. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the quesions at the end. You are able to apply the knowledge immediately and get feedback. I received an A in the course, and not from the expensive study guide that I bought that was supposed to help me pass.Any average person who is required to take statistics should get this book.

I was in a bad place in terms of my stats course until I got this book. It filled in many of the blanks the textbook glazed over(and vice versa at times). All I can say is I got an A in the course with much help from this book. It was straight and to the point in its explanations saving me the time of wading through the unfortunately wordy textbook. I'd buy it again and obviously recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HELPFUL BOOK!","review":"I had to take a college Statistics 2 class and this book was much easier to understand than the textbook.

Capital was right not to release this material originally, and now they're cashing in by peddling crud.The songs are boring and monotonous, the arrangements are unimaginative yet they still manage to be too elaborate with background vocals way too intrusive and therefore overshadowing Darin's voice. And The Man's vocals are totally uninspired and flat - with (uncharacteristically) little personality or spark. He's really not stylizing or personalizing these songs. His voice doesn't even sound that great on the few tunes where the other vocalists don't drown him out.I think even the most definitive Darin music collection can do without this one.

I believe by having much more silly, always leave 'em laughing personas in public (usually accompanied with humility & incredible compassion) would've made the juxtaposition with their truer, darker, all-consuming narcissism all the more striking.

This film is filled with passion, sex, murder, intrigue, and mystery. Did I forget the sex? My only wish is that more films can take note of the class in which this film was done. Yes, it is like softcore porn at times, but there is an air to the film that somehow makes it okay.

A film that throws light on what goes on behind the curtains, behind the frames, behind every stage, it throws light on the fact that how famous people try to 'keep the show going on!' despite having personal issues. The film is quite unique, if you have the right perspective while watching it. Alison Lohman, Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth have an amazing chemistry with each other. Its a film to watch out for."},{"rating":"1","title":"where the truth lies","review":"did not like the role that colin firth played i prefer him in more lighthappier roles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found \\"Truth\\" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible.

It's really poor. Really. Partly it's the plot -- so much is unbelievable, from Collins' reason for blackmailing O'Connor, to O'Connor's ability to solve the entire mystery after 15 years on the basis of a couple of casual words from Morris. But mostly it's the fact that none of the main characters is remotely convincing or engaging. Lohman is entirely out of her depth, and though Bacon and Firth are competent they're uninspiring. And the pivotal sex scene, which I suppose I shouldn't detail in case I give away the plot, is completely flat. And... well, enough. My advice is, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Truth Lies ( or Lays? )","review":"Convoluted drivel. Better convolution can be found in TheBig Sleep, Chinatown, and The Two Jakes.

After six weeks, I am satisified with its performance. It rinsed much better than smaller showerheads. The adjustable arm also gave my low pipe outlet an extra six inches of height, finally allowing me to rinse without bending down. There are three joints- a vertical head, a vertical arm, and a circular base pivot. It allows for a wide range of rinsing positions.What makes it a four star instead of five. Normal water pressure with most showerheads results in sharp streams in this model, but the solution is as simple as turning down the faucet. Also, the tightness adjustment knob adjusts both arm and base pivots. So you can only adjust both at the same time. Not a big deal as I found a good setting for both.Bottom line- great price and design.

I almost didn't finish it, because I couldn't understand what Kira (a shy student who's good at art) could possibly see in Rei (the heart throb I mentioned). Granted, this is the first book in this series that I've read, but it's only book two, so you'd think there'd still be redeeming bits of his character showing through.

We put it out in the garden area and put some cabbage leaves and baby carrots in the trap. On the third night, we caught the rabbit! It was easy to transport and release the rabbit at a wooded area that is just a mile from the house. We have since placed the trap outside again just in case there is another rabbit in our garden, but so far, we have seen no evidence of any more rabbits. I would reccommend this trap.

I thought I kind of understood what made Gearge tick but, this book really brought it all into focus. George was not only the \\"quite Beatle\\" but also an in depth and deep thinking, and believing, person. Truly a must read for all Beatle fans.ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Religious George","review":"If you want to read a book of about 90% of new material then this is the book...keep in mind it may not be a biography in terms of the man's life or artistic output...it's very much about his religion mainly the India type religion aka yogi's, marehishie? ...and how all that came to be and why it became to be and just how involved George was into all that...brief discussions on the backlash in his involvement and most of all the meaning of his involvement on popular culture as we know it...most people are aware of yoga, chanting, indian religion and 95% of that is the responsibility of George Harrison's involvement...but keep in mind when purchasing this book the book's main focal point is the religious aspect of his lfe...with a very very brief over-view in the beginning chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"The raving reviews tricked me into buying this cd. I did like the early work of the Searchers, but this album is simply muddy and repetitive. I've listened several times wondering if a track would grow on me, but only Switchboard Susan comes close. The vulgar use of \\"extension\\" in that song, however, strikes it from my playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again 2nd to The Beatles","review":"1979 the popworld never discovered one of Britains greatest popgroups at all.Once again they managed to do an LP(Album)with totally new melodies& sound.I hope they will be at the Hall of Fame soon.I have the LP and compared with 1964 they really had developed themselves.I m very happy that \\"Its Too Late\\" went up on Top 20 1979(at the same time as The Shadows took #1)BUT why are they so BAAD promoted?PYE-records failed completely in this matter,SIRE Record what did they do?????? BUY this CD & listen to real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Homeschooling Family Loves it!","review":"My 9 year old son is studying Rome as part of our unit study and I picked this book up because I thought that it looked interesting... well, I completely underestimated it!!! He devoured this and I believe that his independent research of Rome outside of \\"class\\" is a result of the clever illustrations and nibblets of information that come across in interesting ways throughout this book. I went ahead and ordered the books on Pompeii and Roman Soldiers and he absorbed them with the same hunger and speed. This is a series that we will be adding to our history studies for sure. I could not recommend this more - it is fun and education, just what school should be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawn's Review","review":"This book is like you are being told what will happen at gladiator school. That is what makes it funny. Even though it is funny, you learn things. For instance, did you know that you would have to eat barley grains and roasted beans for dinner and ash for dessert? Another reason I like this book is the illustrations. The illustrations also make the book funny because they make the people look weird. You may have read another books in the \\"You wouldn't want to\\" series. As you know they are really good books.By Shawn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel not as good as the original","review":"Gary Gentile's original book, \\"Andrea Doria: dive to an era\\" was an excellent recollection of the original wrecking of the vessel, and early attempts to dive it.Unfortunately, the follow up, \\"Deep, Dark and Dangerous\\" is not quite so good. Although it still has some engaging tales to tell, the narrator gets side tracked into too much grinding detail. In particular, his attempts to describe how to reach parts of the wreck swimming in a three dimensional environment render the narrative tortuous from time to time.There are some fascinating parts of the book that follow on from and amplify earlier stories presented in the first book, but it would have been better to re-release an updated version of the first book rather than try to ambitiously spin a second book out of limited material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Wow! As a Respiratory Therapist, I work with people everday who are suffering the debilitating pulmonary effects of years of smoking. Most of my patients want to quit and just can't. From a scientific point of view I can understand how difficult it is to quit but I never thought about the emotional hold smoking has on people until I read \\"A Life in Smoke\\".I was hoping that Julia's book would help me obtain some insight of how my patients feel about their smoking and their many failed attempts to quit. It did just that. I never realized the intimate friendship that people have with their cigarettes and what a important part of their survival those cigarettes are. I believe the book helped me to become more understanding, more empathetic and less judgemental. I'm going to recommend it to all of my co-workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try, try, try again","review":"As an avid never smoked non-smoker, my eyes were opened to the complexities of trying to break this one little habit. I have much more respect for my friends and family members that have accomplished this feat through the years. Hats off to Julia for not letting past defeats lessen her determination. This book is a thumbnail view into the highs and lows of her very interesting life. It is a great read for anyone interested in how other people handle everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service","review":"I ordered this phone since I live overseas and wanted one that would work. When I received the phone, it did not work. The battery would not stay charged. They company sent another battery and charger and it did the same thing. Now, the company will not refund my money. I will not be using this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing C.D. Highly Recommended","review":"I think that this album reflects all of the hard work that RUTH has done her whole career. I have been a fan since \\"El Toquecito\\" She is pretty unique. Who would ever think that an African-American woman could sing those cumbias in Spanish like she does? I also recommend the Mariachi ballad in English. It is awesome!!! All I can say is: YOU GO GIRL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea--rotten design--terrible product","review":"I was excited to get this for my 3-year-old son for Xmas 2005, as he was just starting to get excited about writing and drawing. However, the problems were numerous:--the light was way too dim-we couldn't see the image well enough to trace the pictures--the markers were dry & useless from day 1--It didn't stay shut. Whenever I tried to pick it up and move it, the latch came undone, and everything exploded out into a big mess in the middle of his floor.This review is written in the past tense, as we no longer store this useless thing in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy","review":"My 3 year old daughter is a huge fan of Paz and she really likes to draw, so I figured this was a no brainer. She does enjoy using it, but there are some drawbacks. The light from the projector is not very bright. If you try to use regular printer paper it is hard to see the object being illuminated. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm hoping tracing paper will work better. The other major drawback is that it collapses easily. In order to use it, you must lean the two sections together. Unfortunately they don't lock into each other, they just sort of balance on each other. So if you try to move it or push on it a little too hard it will collapse. Even so, she loves to draw with the markers, calling herself \\"the artist\\". The chalkboard side is a hit too. Overall I would suggest this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling discoure on development - critical thinking about critical thinking","review":"Paul Nadasdy's book is largely a deconstruction of the process of \`inclusion' taken on by nation states in order to promote empowerment among Aboriginal people. He suggests that these processes (in the Yukon he uses the examples of land claims negotiations under the Umbrella Final Agreement, and environmental management or co-management; but with global comparisons) actually undermine efforts towards self-governance and cultural independence because they force Native communities to offer comparative systems to the western ones. He argues the language of these processes implicitly suggests a western power dominance, and that by participating in them Aboriginal people comply with these assumptions. This argument is also applied to the \`integration' of TEK into western science and decision-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prone to Prophetic","review":"This was insgihtful. Zechariah one of my favorite books concerning future events and Messiah coming. This was well written and insightful. I recommend it to anyone who has a bent toward the prophetic to gain understanding of the symbolism's used."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for serious student or teacher","review":"You can't get a better commentary on this difficult but treasured book. A \\"must have\\" for any Bible teacher. And,at a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the truth?","review":"After reading this book, all I could conclude was it was written by a woman who was very unhappy with her Catholic upbringing, and somehow felt discriminated against by the church because she was a woman. There was no evidence to me that she was searching for God who is sovereign,absolute love, absolute righteousness, immutable, absolute truth, absolute justice, eternal life, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, but rather was searching for a God who fit her ideas of Who God is. There was no way to determine where she drew her ideas from with all the reading she had done, because she did not annotate a single one in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunny CA, just picture it.","review":"As the short introduction says \`Rarely has one geographic region been the focus of such intense visual interest as the state of California' This well produced (and inexpensive) paperback manages to capture the feel of the new Eden. The pictorial material is mainly from the 1930s to 1950s and includes a wide range of printed ephemera (a Sunkist orange wrapper to NBC Radio City, Hollywood, Studio Tour brochure for example) and I liked the nine examples of three-dimensional maps, unfortunately shown too small to really appreciate the detail. All the favorites of the State have a showing, the Giant Redwoods, Death Valley, Hollywood, Dude Ranches, San Francisco etc. The images are illustrative rather than photographic and this is why I think the book works so well, you can see how commercial artists have been allowed portray California as big, bold and bright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"This may possibly be a good book - I found it so boring I gave up after reading only a third of it. Maybe I missed the good part. Although I am a compulsive reader (who ELSE reads the side of cereal boxes?), I couldn't force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly awesome!","review":"Roger's book has brought me both inspiration and comfort. It is pleasing to the eye with the magnificent artwork and his words are masterfully arranged to bring comfort to my soul. I have reached for his book countless times, not only for myself, but to share with others.I aspire to \\"grow up\\" as an author and to become more like Roger! I am so impressed with his talent and his scripture references are certainly a bonus to each of his poems. I highly recommend his book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Grace","review":"Poetic Grace summarizes scriptures in Poetic form. The book provides a different view of the scripture passages and I found it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"songs you haven't heard","review":"Good grief! Not one other review of this wonderful CD. If you are a fan you owe it to yourself to get this. Moments and The King and Queen of England are never-before released gems. No End is just Sandy and solo piano -- it is achingly beautiful and much different from the version on Like an Old Fashioned Waltz. Trevor Lucas's version of Forever Young is worth the price of the album. The Town I Loved So Well is also one of those rare vocal performances of Trevor's. He truly was one of the overlooked artists in England's (and Australia's) folk-rock scene. I give this Cd only 4 stars because it has yet another version of Who Knows Where the Time Goes. Must this be on every CD put together after Sandy's death? The booklet that comes with the CD has some great information for Sandy's (and Trevor's) fans. A must have for any Sandy Denny collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, Great Deal","review":"I'm an occasional weekend warrior, not a pro, so I shopped for value. Though these are reconditioned tools, you wouldn't know it by appearances. The compressor works as advertised & looks brand new. I've tested both nailers & they work & look like new. $154 w/discounts set this at my door. For my needs, this is a GREAT value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter Cable Finish Nailer Compressor Combo","review":"Both nailers work excellently. The compressor is a bit noisier than my old portable compressor, but my old compressor was not big enough to use a finish nailer with. I had already expected the compressor to be louder. Only thing I did not care for was the included air hose, but for the price I can not complain. I did change out the air hose and fittings so I can use my other air tools with this comprssor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter Cable Compressor and Nail Gun Kit","review":"Factory Reconditioned, looked like new product. Haven't really given it a good test yet, but the unit works and I am looking forward to years of nailing stuff to other stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This product was refurbished, but if I wasn't told this, I would not have guessed. The compressor was clean, and worked flawlessly. The brad and finish nailers are good quality, and work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"air nailer","review":"the kit came with a brad, finish nailer and compressor. the nailers are easy to use and makes putting work together fast. i have not used clamps when glueing work since i got the kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control issue","review":"I just received a reconditioned Porter Cable combo and was very disappointed. The regulator was clearly defective it blew air through the housing. I tried tightening connections and it would hold no compression. The unit was reconditioned in Mexico and I have read that there are real quality control issues in their factories. If you make this purchase and are dissapointed, as I was, call customer service they can at least expedite the shipping of a new unit because they can't do a replacement upgrade- Amazon will make it right. As far as I am concerned I won't touch another reconditioned tool that is reconditioned in Mexico, until I hear that they are bringing their quality standards up. I have read extensively about Maytag quality issues since they moved their factory from Iowa to Mexico!! The articles I read spoke of the fact that the factories in Mexico rely on day labor for sometimes critical manufacturing roles and turnover is way over 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be much better","review":"This DVD could have turned out perfect, however it's not what it is. It is boring and not well produced. It seems to be from a very old documentary. I didn't enjoy it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot's of pretty pictures. Short on recipes.","review":"If you want some excellent photography of several great homes in the South, you will enjoy this book. It will make an attractive addition to anyone's coffee table. If you want a good collection of recipes from the south, then look elsewhere. The quantity of recipes is limited; and the ones that are there are found, for the most part, in dozens of other cookbooks. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shetland collie dog","review":"Having read the previous review I have to tell readers that the dog is in fact a Shetland. Eric Halsall wrote in the forward of the book that Gael is of Shetland descent with the inbred wisdom and sheep sense of the little collies of the Islands. Whatever kind of sheepdog she is, Gael is a fine animal. It is as much about the animals she encounters and lives with as about her. Her kind nature and intelligence made her a great working dog and companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for good parking mat","review":"This is made of plastic.

I can drive at night again!!!","review":"I haven't been able to drive at night for years, because the glare from oncoming headlights and streetlights make it hard to see. I remembered that polarized filters cut glare, so I purchased these yellow polarized lenses. It's amazing. I can drive at night again with these. Seriously, the best $10 I ever spent. Actually, $30, because I bought two additional sets and now have a set in each of our cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Them","review":"Great for night driving or cloudy day!

I believe they helped \\"train\\" my eyes to work better with my glasses.
