The latest issue (March 2012) continues to give it a rave, which reminds me that mine sits in a cupboard barely used. I got sick of squeezing out the kinks in the hose, it's heavy as hell (and I'm a strong 40-year-old dude), noisy (I need ear plugs), the bag monitor got stuck on full, it's unwieldy on stairs (as warned), and it never really sucked anything. I had to go over every patch of carpet several times, and we don't even have pets or messy kids. I would dump it, but I stupidly bought dozens of bags, so I need to buy a replacement on the basis of the bags it uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"I am unable to rate the performance of my new Hoover Widepath vacuum due to the fact that there was a MAIN part missing. The main hose, which goes on the back of the vacuum, was NOT in the box when I received it. I have had this vacuum for OVER a month now, & STILL have not received the hose. When I called Hoover, they told me the part was backordered from the manufacturer & I should receive it in 2-3 wks. I called them 10 days ago & they informed me that the part was due in on Nov. 19th. I have not received it. I became suspicious when I tried to order it from their website & one of the options was \\"missing parts\\". Does this mean that this happens frequently??? They could at least send me some free bags for the inconvenience!!

I don't even want to run the risk of turning it back on (i live in an apartment) to see if i can repair it. Trashed.There's nothing worse than an appliance that catches on fire, and this Hoover is susceptible. I'm going to try a second purchase (given the deals right now and the fact that the vacuum operated very well up until this point)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Economical Upright Vacuum","review":"This simple economical vacuum does exactly what I need, pick up the dirt, dust & pet hair off my floor. The 12 amp motor is powerful enough to quickly clean my 2 dogs hair off the carpet floor. I do not like bagless vacuum cleaners & could only find 1 that held a very small bag at my local Walmart. This one takes what I would call a standard size bag that will take longer to fill up. The only thing I've found that I don't like is the too short hose. When trying to use the attachments on something that is not close to you or higher than a foot or so off the ground, the hose twists and slips out of its notched lock-in collar. Otherwise this is a good economical vacuum that I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be a Hoover.","review":"This vacuum cleaner performs flawlessly and is very affordable.

I haven't found one vacuum to be good, or at least manageable when picking up dog hair. I bought this vacuum 6 weeks ago. I have already had to take the vacuum apart twice. The dog hair gets clogged and I have to use a straightened clothes hanger to unblock it. This happened even though I pick up the chunks of dog hair with a broom before running the vacuum. It performs well on areas in which the dog doesn't frequent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Vacuum cleaner","review":"We bought this vacuum based on reviews written here and Consumer Reports.

If you want a vacuum that picks up dirt, go someplace else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"We prefer a bagged vacuum, so this was a good purchase.

I neglected to read that this was an \\"abridged\\" version of the book. Too bad, it felt like one chapter out of a book rather than the whole book. I got the book for my 3 pregnant girlfriends and they were all really excited to read it (as were some of their husbands).

I have step kids and have MAJOR behavioral problems to deal with. So if you are getting this book for that purpose don't bother because this book is geared more for if kids don't clean their rooms or eat all of their vegetables type situations. I am an avid reader of psychology and negotiation. I found this books format similar to the emotional code, the way it gives examples and then an explanation of solutions and examples of the right way to deal with the problem. I think getting to yes, a negotiation book is much more helpful then this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed by the philosophy.","review":"The writers claim that children will naturally come to the right conclusions about how they should behave if simply listened to, and allowed to feel whatever they are naturally feeling. This simply isn't true. Most children need more guidance. I agree it should be gently done, but I disagree that parents should never lecture or \\"preach to\\" their children. If you never tell them what is good, how can they choose to be good? Overall, the writers had good intentions, but their technique is a bit on the floofy-feely side. The result would surely be completly undisciplined children. A better book is \\"1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12\\" by Thomas W. Phelan. It is still gentle, but firm. Kids aren't left to flounder about how they ought to behave to be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking book","review":"I found this book to be very thought provoking and need to read it again and do the exercises to get more benefit from it.

The skills taught here will take a lot of practice. It may be several weeks before results are apparent. My son is not an \\"easygoing\\" child, but this book has changed our relationship.

Skinner Behaviorism techniques","review":"Unfortunately, many of the parenting books on the market lead parents to treating behavior instead of the actual cause. There is a better way to raise emotionally healthy children without violence, abuse, punishment, coercive, or isolation/prison-like (time out) techniques.This book practices non-violent communication, and is an \\"Alfie Kohn friendly\\" method of parenting. Do the research. The answers to positive parenting are there. This book is one of them. Break the generational habits of out-dated, abusive parenting methods.

Have you wondered why today's kids are running around out of control and poorly behaved? It's because of books like this, teaching parents new methods of parenting that don't work. Reasoning with a 5 year old....'tell me how you are feeling right now (after you have colored with marker on furniture).' No! How about a good old fashion spank and being sent to your room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I purchased the book on CD and the re-enactments were cheesy and the whole thing was unrealistic. The problem with people who write these kinds of books, just reinforce the epidemic that children run the household and the parents don't. The examples were full of children talking back to their parents, rolling their eyes and saying and doing things that I would NEVER even think of doing when I was that age. If your children are already talking back to you and direspecting you, then you have already set the precedent of letting them get away with it, but now you want to undo the damage? It's too late because the child already has you trained."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book on the market","review":"If there would be 0 stars I would give it to the book.

But stick with it and you will be so pleased when your kids start talking to you again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Saver","review":"This book is phenomenal. I've read alot of parenting books, and this is one that my husband and I both found to be extrememely effective with our little boys.My favorite concepts are acknowledging kids' feelings, helping them problem solve, and describing a problem instead of accusing. Just by doing these three things we have stopped time-outs all together, a practice which wasn't helping us at all.The best part is that I can see them becoming the people I want them to be. They are learning the tools to work through their strong feelings and to resolve issues with their family and friends.The other day I lost my patience with my 5 year old, and started to yell. He told me that I was hurting his feelings and that maybe we could both meditate to calm down. I was stunned, and happy to go along with his solution.The funniest thing is that I've been using a lot of these tools on adults who are upset and it works like a charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generates super comms","review":"This really changed communication in our family, it really made it better and makes us all understand eachother better. At first it feels a bit artificial, but when you get the hang of it, its simply nice an naturaly and doing the job very well. A big thank you to the writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, but badly presented","review":"I bought this book because I agree with the thought that one should respect children's feelings. However, I found the book a boring read and its contents and examples very simplistic. I did not feel that this book offered any insights into a child rearing philosophy, but tried to act as some kind of manual on how to bring up children without any consideration to the fact that children are not all the same, and hence do not always react in such a predictable manner as assumed by the examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content is average, audiobook is HORRIBLE","review":"I honestly think this is a \\"vanity published\\" book. The content is dated and simplistic, kinda Dr. Laura style. I have the CD, read by the authors. Good God, that was a mistake. I guess I'd have rather have had a professional reader without driveling nasal voices. Anyway, READ the book, but DO NOT under any circumstance, BUY THE CD. It SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW","review":"Before I read this book I read a very good book called Between Parent and child by DR Haim G Ginott and is thought to be a classic in the field.But this book offers exactly the same methods even offers the same example in one part word for word so I am rather unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are reading these reviews, you need this book...","review":"This is one of those books I really wish I could read to the end, but I never need to. Every time I'm in need of some child rearing solutions, this is the one book I reach for. I flip through the first few chapters reading the areas I've already highlighted and I am right back on track. After the refresher, the arguing (for the most part) stops immediately and everyone is much calmer, happier and we can go back to being that well oiled family unit that we all crave. I also have the audio version on my iPod to give a quick listen when grocery shopping, hiking, or cleaning. This book is such a helpful \\"guide\\" that can be used with not only talking to your children, but everyone you come in contact with. Now if only I could get my daughter's first grade teacher to read this...GrRrr"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one book on communication - this is it","review":"The authors have done a terrific job of putting effective communication strategies into an easy to understand format. This book is really useful. The advice in it actually works. The content is presented in straight forward way and, in case you don't get it, the authors put it in a variety of formats (you get examples, scenarios, cartoons, lists, etc) - overall it's just a great, common-sense guide to respectful and effective communication and it works, not only for families, but for anyone you interact with. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with some practice.","review":"This book had a lot of great ideas for just changing the wording of what you say to your kids or how you say or ask questions. I tried them all and to my surprise they really worked for me. My problem with the book is the way it was written. I didn't care to much for the cartoon format of the book. I think for me this made it hard for me to remember what I was reading to retain the information to use later. I found my self thinking about the pictures and not really the phrases I should be using. I don't think it would be to nice to keep peeking at the book while I was talking to my son. Or write my self little notes on my hand. But with practice it got better :) So I would suggest this book to parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building Relationships","review":"To improve relationships with teenage step-daughters, I was willing to try the techniques offered in the very first chapter, even though I doubted they would work. I've come to realize that by letting them know I understand their feelings, rather than trying to fix things on the spot, we have grown closer and learned how to solve problems together. The following chapters on cooperation, punishment and building esteem repeated this cycle of doubt -> practice -> results.I still can't say I agree with everything the authors preach - for example, I believe punishment is appropriate in some cases, that it's not just a \\"distraction.\\" And I am concerned that over-emphasizing children's needs, feelings and desires could create self-oriented and ego-centric psyches. But many of the ideas in this book have helped us all to become more sensitive, helpful, respectful and caring while becoming less vengeful, hurtful and blaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best for parenting","review":"This book examines love, communication, and methods for bringing up happy, secure, and respectful adults.

It does give examples, but doesnt go deep. On a particular subject it will tell you what you should do and give one example and move on to the next thing. It should really go into more detail on each issue it seeks to address/correct.Just when I was getting into it, it was over. It wasn't even an hour long.

It has been a great help. I'm amazed every day that techniques I initially thought would work \\"someday when he's older\\" work immediately, such as helping him to name his emotion when he starts a tantrum - most of the time I can help him stop within seconds - and brainstorming a list of options to a problem worked even with a 2 year old - he came up with ideas I wouldn't have thought of that were agreeable to both of us.

Like all Calico Critter products, it's adorable and shows great attention to detail. There is a frustrating aspect that when you add it on to the windmill house, it comes off very easily as does the top. My children like to have it as a third level with the original windmill top. However every time they play with it, I'm called in to put the both back on. To keep the mutual frustration levels down, I glued it with E6000 adhesive glue, which keeps it firmly in place (best glue ever!) The kids use the sandbox on the floor and do not miss the ability to put it on as as another roof option."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"A little smaller then I anticipated.

The book was written by a rug salesman in 1969 with the sole purpose of motivating customers to purchase rugs at the salesman's Florida stores. Now that it's 1997 one must even assume that that piece of information is moot due to the fact that unless the salesman is one of the oldest living inhabitants of the U.S., he is most likely pushing up pink flamigos in some Floridian cemetary"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own a firearm in NY State, you must have this book","review":"I think this is the 3rd edition of this book, and is a must have for gun owners living, working, or traveling in New York State.

I think Greeley says that one's chances to be a decent human being ~~ no matter how damaged~~ isn't over until God gives up [which God never does].I pray Fr Greeley recovers completely from his injuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to the wonderful series debut","review":"I loved THE PRIMROSE CONVENTION, the first book in the series, but was disappointed by SWITCHBACK. CONVENTION featured a wonderful ensemble of distinctive, endearing characters, teaming up to locate a missing man. The relationships among these characters were charming and unique. In SWITCHBACK, the main characters are fairly isolated from each-other for most of the book. The story centers around one of them, who is subjected to enormous suffering, partially caused (unintentionally) by another of the formerly-likeable characters. The unremittingly bleak tone is a misstep in my opinion; it didn't work for me. And the qualities that made CONVENTION special are mostly absent from SWITCHBACK. I don't object to a somber book, but this one felt \\"off.\\" CONVENTION wasn't sappy-sweet, but it did strike a hopeful tone, and SWITCHBACK's tone was... hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-Talented","review":"Enjoyed the mellow sounds and rocky tunes.

It's not a dry history but a witty and sharp look at the Bloomsbury Group and issues about sex and gender in England. She can be critical of Strachey's misogyny and class elitism while at the same time she makes her readers feel strongly about the plight of the gay man during a repressive era. The book is loaded with fascinating stories about his relationships with Virginia Woolf, Dora Carrington, and John Maynard Keynes.

Or Science vs. Nature? Whatever the theme, the movie, based on the short story Leiningen vs. The Ants by Carl Stephenson, takes 45 minutes before we even hear the word ant. Many people might see that as flaw but I see it as a sign of a good story - they spend half of the movie building up the characters before the ants come to bring them down. Charlton Heston plays the main character and the sexy Eleanor Parker plays his mail-order bride. Both are strong willed, with plans for the future and neither like to back down.When one adds a army of ants, 20 miles long and 2 miles wide, heading right for the plantation, you change the film from a pretty good one to a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Naked Jungle (aka Lanigen's Ants)","review":"Charleton Heston and Eleanor Parker star in this movie about love and army ants. I believe it was originally released as \\"Lanigen's Ants\\". Heston plays a wealthy land owner with very definite ideas of love and marriage. Eleanor Parker is his mail order bride who enlightens him to what love and marriage should really be. The army ants are there to wreak havoc with his hard earned dynasty and to threaten their blossoming relationship.

Mr. Atlas touches his child friend so much that all during the first half of the movie I was half-suspecting this to be a NAMBLA Selection of the Month, so to speak. The plot is ... tired. The acting is weird.And then there is the parade of horrible characters: the drunk grandfatherly old Irish stablehand guy (really, he drinks in 75% of his screen appearances), the simpering villain who looks uncannily like George W. Bush, his mentally-deficient henchman who runs like he's trying out for the role of Jerry Lewis Imitator..... it goes on and on like this.I can't think of any reason to watch or own this movie except to laugh at it.

The black has a lot of problems off and on. It currently is not working. It seems that putting in a new ink cartridge helps it work for a short while--but this is, of course, expensive. I guess we're going to have to eat it and buy another printer after owning this one for only 8 months. Live and learn.

Getting Epson to respond intelligently and consistently was almost impossible. Nearly all commands to the printer now have to be entered manually: the smart-scan and control panel functions simply won't launch. You'll also find you go through ink cartridges quite quickly; they are remarkably expensive but readily available on-line or at office supply stores.

For the last year the printer worked fine, even after I changed the ink cartridges. Now the printer produces streaked pages but mostly nothing at all. Another problem is that the printer will not work unless all of the cartridges have an ink supply. What if I just want to print in black & white? Why can't this printer function without the color ink? $$$$$$ They want you to buy the overpriced cartridges, and they dry out if not used.All I can say is READ THESE REVIEWS before purchasing a new printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pain in the neck","review":"I was very happy when I first bought it. It exceeded all my expectations for a unit like this one but troubles started after one year.

For the uninitiated, this means that ANY TIME YOUR PRINTER IS OUT OF ONE COLOR CARTRIDGE, YOU CANNOT PRINT AT ALL; the cartridges are REALLY SMALL, so you'll be very familiar with your friends at the office supply store; the cartrdiges are REALLY EXPENSIVE, so Epson will owe you stock holdings after a few months. If you need a printer that works and is cheap to run, THIS IS THE OPPOSITE.

But, shortly after the warranty expired this year, I began having problems with horizontal banding and skipping. I, too, have changed the cartridges and cleaned the heads repeatedly with no luck. The magenta has completely stopped printing and the blue and yellow still have banding. I have only used genuine Epson inks. THIS IS THE WORST PRINTER I HAVE EVER OWNED.

The setup wasn't difficult and the CD walked you through installation. There is a printed manual for scanning and copying; the manual for printing is on the CD which is not noted anywhere. Took a few minutes for me to locate it on my desktop. In comparison to my HP Photosmart P1100 - for which I cannot find a repair service - the Epson CX5400 was slow. Printing in draft mode, which I usually use, was extremely light and difficult to read. Normal mode printing was slow and the print irregular and uneven. There was no need to go beyond that, I packed it up and arranged to return it to Amazon. I gave it two stars because I am basically a charitable person. Setup was fairly easy and it did print, however poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly engineered hardware - Avoid!","review":"If you're considering this printer, or any other candidates in the EPSON CX line, there's something you should know: they all suffer from the same fatal flaw: clogging print heads. Unlike HP or Canon printers, the print heads in the Epson are embedded within the printer itself (not the print cartridge). This means that, irrespective of use, sometime within 1-2 years after you purchase this printer, you WILL have a print head failure which will cost you more to fix than the original purchase price of the printer.Happened to me after 16th months of occasional (2x per month, about 10 pages per month) use. As with the other reviews below, I changed the ink cartridges, and found the machine simply henceforth spit out blank pages. I cleaned the heads 15 times (incidentally, each time you clean it uses about 2.5% of the ink in the cartridge)...no change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just becomes an expensive scanner","review":"I should have listened to the reviewers talking about this printer's lack of durability.

Started having problems within one year -- clogged print heads. After Epson first refused to do anything about it even though the thing was under warranty, they finally agreed to replace it. Epson sent me a new CX5400, which of course I was happy about at the time. They would not warrant the CX5400 because it was a replacement for the 5200. Now I really know why. It went bad within a year as well. Clogged print heads -- again. When it did work, I liked the print quality, and I feel it scans well. That's why I gave it a \\"1\\" rating. Or was because there isn't an option for a \\"0\\" rating?

I decided to try a generic brand ink from a high volume ink outfit. Maybe that wasn't such a good idea! That's the end of my printer. Tried an Epson brand black ink tank after the bad experience with a generic (nothing... no printing at all... the generic at least showed something). I admit that I could have damaged my printer with generic ink, but look at all the reviews from people who used Epson brand ink and still had problems. I used generics on my old Canon printer with no problem.Regardless, whenever YOU have a problem with your print head Epson has made sure you either pay hefty service fees for a fix or trash the thing.

I'm not even going to bother talking to Epson b/c I don't want the hassle.

Ever since my first computer way back when, and as a general rule, I've always been pleased with them. That all changed when I got this printer. The paper feeder jambed up and broke after 9 months. They begrudgingly replaced it after several phone calls and then 14 months (just two months after it wasn't covered) I ran into the same problem everyone else did with this printer. Based on my research, this ink tube problem with the Magenta is rather common. You'd figure Epson would do a recall or something, but no, and they seemingly don't care about it either. They were/are aware of the problem with this particular printer but refuse to do anything about it.

Get a WHOLE $40 credit toward a new printer from them which costs either 179.00 or 299.00 depending on which of the 2 I choose.

However, soon after (around warranty expiration time) the print cartridges get clogged and due to its design (unlike HP and other printers) it cannot be fixed (would cost more than original price of printer) so it then becomes only useful for scanning but cannot use printer or photocopier. It is basically useless to me now.I will think twice before purchasing another printer from Epson, and would definitely not purchase anything from the CX series of Epson All-in-One units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogged up yellow and magenta heads in less than 2 months","review":"I had great luck with my previous Epson Color Stylus 640.

I replaced the color ink cartridges when my CX5400 was about 1.5 months old, and every since then the yellow and magenta inkjets are so clogged they will not print. I even purchased solvent from someone that had a similiar situation so that I could unclog the inkjets, but I have not had any sucess. So, now I have an Epson MFP that prints only in black and blue.

I found information at http://www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/printer/28050 regarding the tube problems. So, yes I went down that road and tried to repair it. I spent about 8 hours on it and when it was reassembled there was a new problem. A problem that I undoubtedly caused in the process of completely tearing it apart to reach the tubes.

So I went out and spent $70 for all new ink cartidges, and installed them. It has never printed anything since - just blank pages.If you read the other reviews and do other research, you'll see that it's a defect that results in a clogged tube somewhere inside the printer, and it is not trivial to unclog. As far as I'm concerned, this thing is now a boat anchor. Or a door stop, take your pick.I'm replacing it with a Canon or HP.

I went through the \\"cleaning\\" process about 15 times, still nothing. I did some research on the web and it seems this printer has problems with the print heads clogging/drying up. I've ordered a 3rd party cleaning kit to try to unclog the heads, but I could damage them in the process, but the printer doesn't print right now anyway, so what's the difference? The bottom line here is that I do not recommend this printer....stay away from this printer like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink Consuming... buyers beware!","review":"Had this printer since Monday... just printed about 10 pages, of black text.

I printed 1 index picture, about 2 inch by 2 inch.. and it used 10% of all my color ink!

At that time I thought that most of the postings on here were a vocal minority. However, to my utter dismay my printer simply stopped working after 11 months of use. I changed the black cartridge and shortly thereafter the print quality began to fail. Changing the three colour cartridges simply made the problem worse, and cleaning the print heads left the machine so hopelessly clogged up that it was rendered useless. Luckily the store I purchased it from gave me a complete refund for this hunk of junk. Shame on EPSON for making such poor quality machines - please stay away from any of their products until they learn to put products on the market that actually last longer than one ink cartridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A junk","review":"I just bought one on sale. The color print came out in mostly green, and I found out that the red and the yellow inks were not coming out properly. I tried to clean the nozzles as per instruction. After about 10 tries, the nozzles cleared somewhat, but the print came out with many lines and spotty places. Furthermore, cleaning consumed a lot of ink! The cartridges were only about 65% full after cleaning, even though I have not had a single acceptable print since I bought the machine!!!Avoid this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Ex Epson Owner","review":"I do not have the CX5400, but do own the CX4600 and experience the same printer cartridge clogging problems as many of the other commenters.

Epson must have decided to sell printers near cost, then gouge its customers big time on ink cartridges. Ink cartridges are expensive, and this printer goes through ink like crazy. The ink clogs often, leaving unprinted streaks through my print jobs. I have to run the head-cleaning routine every week or so, which uses even more ink. For the past month I have printed all my documents using the \\"black ink only\\" setting, and it still runs down the color cartridges as well as the black. It must use some during its warmup every time I turn it on and off, or maybe it just evaporates. Now my magenta cartridge is running out, and the printer won't let me run the head-cleaning option while the cartridge needs replacing, so I can't even continue using black only!

I was able to find a website that explained how to disassemble and correct the problem. It was very difficult, time consuming, and messy. But it did fix my printer. It worked for about a month, but now it's not working again.I guess I'll try fixing it one more time...but when the ink runs out, I'm not buying any more. A new printer stocked with ink costs about the same as a set of new ink cartridges for this puppy. So why bother if it's just going to break again?!The scanner has always worked flawlessly.

If your printer have problem starts to print with cut out lines, just remove the print head and deep into hot water for about an hour.

The CX5400 I have died after 18 moinths from the fatal manufacturing flaw that so many 5400 users complain about. That flaw is the ink tube clogging and being almost impossible to repair. The same thing has happened to the CX4200 I have at work. Take my advice, Epson is no longer the standard in inkjet printers. The Durabrite ink may be the undoing of Epson. This ink is far too prone to clogging. If Epson does not make a change and soon they will be at the bottom of the heap if they are not there already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"I purchased this printer in January. Since then Epson has sent me 5 replacement printers. 3 had clogged ink heads, one had a problem with communication between the computer and the printer and one had a scanner issue.

Then about two months ago the ink got low, as ink will do. I bought the genuine epson ink and put them in just as directed. And what do i get? Blank page after blank page. I cleaned heads, checked nozzles, aligned heads (or tried, since the pages were just blank) and it never printed another thing. All this right after the stinking warranty went.

It did go through ink cartridges fairly quickly, but apparently some of that is an issue with the Epson printers/cartridges themselves - see the news concerning the class action lawsuit against Epson (In re Epson Ink Cartridge Cases).

I'm now researching other printers and would be very hesitant to purchase another Epson.As anyone who's purchased this printer knows, if the printer says ANY cartridge is low, it isn't going to print ANYTHING. Many people, like myself, purchased new cartridges to either try to fix the problem (running cleaning cycles uses a lot of ink) or because the printer indicated the cartridge was low and replacing it seemed to cause the problem.

Its alot more radio friendly, but there is alot more emotion. The musicianship is nothing mind blowing, but the latin rhythms they incorporate into their music are pretty interesting, and the drumming is actually pretty decent. The vocals are alright, the screaming sounds pretty good but the vocals sound kind of nasal at times. The lyrics arent great. Some songs the lyrics are good, but there are a few stupid lines in this album that bring it down. But overall all of the songs hold high quality and I would recommend this if youre into nu-metal or if you liked Ill Ninos last album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ill Nino Rocks!","review":"This is a great heavy metal cd! I first heard Ill Nino back in 2003 on the Freddy vs Jason Soundtrack and liked How Can I Live. I waited until March of this year to buy it but I should have picked it up long ago!

However, this book is extremely humorous because it is so outdated and some of the games he mentions that you should play are outrageously dangerous. These games could only be safe if you were throwing the paintballs. He says to do stuff like stand back to back (old west style) and walk 5 paces each away from eachother. Then you are supposed to turn around and shoot!!!!!!

In today's world of Angel's and Autococker's with Halo B's, and games of speedball that use 20,000 rounds(no joke that is an actual amount from a recent NPPL tournie), it is nice to look back to a simpler time, where a 48 round WGP loader or a 10 round feed tube was completly acceptible. The people who wrote the scathing review's are either n00b slayer's with 1500 dollar Angel's who think that anything that shoots under 17 BPS is unacceptable, or they are ungrateful idiots who don't give a crap about what actually built this sport. It takes much more skill to \\"snipe\\", not quite the right word, with a VSC Phantom than it does to dump a case of paint down field with a Angel.

A great read for all appreciative paintballers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISCOURAGES ADVANCEMENT IN PAINTBALL","review":"Hey, I belive that this book should be spared because the aurthor of this book seams like a not verry accomplished paintball player.

I expected practical advice and tools to help me recognize and battle my own shadows, but instead I got what felt like an hour-long advertisement for the REAL Shadow Effect DVD, so I half expected the second DVD to be the program...Nope. The video was choppy, not at all cohesive and really didn't make any sense. There were no complete or organized thoughts, just snippets and general comments by some recognizable and well-respected leaders, Marianne Williamson and Deepak Chopra, and by some totally unrecognizable/unrespected others. I expected to be enlightened, but I am still in the DARK and out some money and time. I have to say, I feel as though maybe one of Debbie Ford's shadows is greed! This movie was a money-making scam.

Intense and thought provoking, I felt this film explores our world through the len of the shadow and leaves us looking at the roots of our world's problems. It offers hope in showing us the power we have access to if we are willing to deal with our shadow self. If you are interested in moving foward in your spiritual life and shifting consciousness, I highly recommend seeing this film. It is a must for anyone wanting to undestand the struggle they feel inside themselves between their greatness and feeling completely unworthy and undeserving of love and good things."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Buying an Infomercial, Not the Course","review":"Hi, I am passionate about personal development, so I bought this DVD thinking I was getting something that would help me deal with my shadow self. What really upset me was that it glossed over the topic and did nothing to show us how to actually deal with the shadow other than very general advice like \\"forgive yourself.\\" Then it says at the end to go to the shadoweffect.com to learn more and it takes you to a $149 course! It's a slick and engaging \\"documentary\\" but I really just paid $20 for an infomercial. Would never have expected this from Debbie Ford, Deepak Choprah and Marianne Williamson. I have read the positive reviews on this DVD and am appalled by how gullible people are when they see famous names. Yes this is an important topic, which is why I bought the DVD, but it's just an emotional and inspiring advertisement to get you motivated to do the expensive course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of Depak and of Debbie Ford. Although this movie contained some interesting ideas and information there was no resolution. Yes we all have a shadow side and now can identify it but what to do about it if you want to live a full, joyous, free life? Well, according to this documentary you take Debbie Fords workshop.

It changed my life then and this new movie is utterly transformational and is sure to change it once again for the better. This movie is guaranteed to get you thinking and feeling. If you've ever wondered why you sabotage your best efforts or been perplexed by the actions of others, this film will shed light to help you see the answers much more clearly. It may make you uncomfortable in spots but that is actually a good thing because awareness is the first step toward creating a life you love.

I own many, many self-help and motivational books, CDs and videos, but I don't get the point of this one. The information is so extremely basic and illogical, and presented in such a boring and monotone manner, it should be titled Motivation for Dummies! I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing, it is so boring. Debbie Ford speaks without passion or emotion, and very robot-like, as if she doesn't really believe her own production, and she appears plastic and phoney. The only two commentators to add some interest, intelligence, spark and passion to this presentation are Marianne Williamson and James Van Praagh. Forget the rest! Even Deepak Chopra comes off as forced and boring here. This DVD really doesn't deserve any star at all, it is that bad. It ended up in my Salvation Army pile.

I later found out that they are by two different people with the same name. Even though \\"Ministers\\" was great and I couldn't put it down, I found out that the sequel to that book is \\"Robbed Without A Gun\\"...Still I decided to read \\"Charming Grace\\", it did not hold my attention and for 2 weeks now I have not been able to finish it. Too predictable, no excitement. Why pair these two books together....Charming Grace not so charming at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOOOO Disappointing!","review":"I usually dive right into a novel by Deborah Smith and dislike coming up for air but with this one not only did I have to push myself to finish, I had to keep putting it down when disgusted with the main character's behavior.

I completed the novel because even telling a very frayed yarn...Ms Smith is a gifted storyteller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh........ what a waste of precious time!","review":"This book was terrible. Only reason I commited myself to finishing it was b/c I had already spent too much time trying to read it. Let's see.... in one word - stupid!

Literally made myself finish this one just so I could honestly write a review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So I'm not alone...","review":"I wondered why I was having trouble getting through this novel - good to know I'm not alone. I've enjoyed most of Deborah Smith's novels but am finding that with this latest offering, her work is becoming extremely formulaic. Two disparate characters meet: one a charming southern belle with quirky family, the other a rough and tumble outsider. Big sex scene smack in the middle of the book then somehow all gets resolved. It's becoming so predictable I know what's going to happen before I turn the page. It's too bad because Ms. Smith has genuine talent but before she embarks on another writing project she needs to get some fresh ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, Poor, Poor","review":"I have been a fan of Ms Smith's books for a while and Charming Grace was a total disappointment - the story was hard to follow; the characters unbelievable and the content generally like a really cheap soap opera. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but clich��s & similes!","review":"I've read everything this author has written and I've never been so disappointed in her work. I found myself wondering if someone is writing under her name. A number of people have written about how difficult it was to get through the book; well, I've tried and tried and finally decided I had to know if it was just me or if others had the same feelings. I logged onto amazon and now that I know that I'm not alone in my opinions, I quit! This is not worth finishing.

The Soviet Block's demise on the economic and and military/industrial fronts has been well documented elsewhere, but that is not the point of this book. The author correctly pointed out The West had won the cultural battle, perhaps the most important one. Second and Third world consumers wanted Western art, movies, music, fashion, etc. not those of the Eastern Block.

The book promises to suit everyone's needs, first time marathoners as well as experienced marathoners. Even though the book starts with chapters written especially for three different levels of marathon performance, the book looses this concentration in the following twelve chapters. The author mixes content for experienced runners with content for beginners. A confusing and weakly structured work is the consequence. Undoubtedly, the author is an experienced runner and coach.

It's not. Like other mock doc's it is fake but that is what makes it work. The fake Documentary filmmaker leads the audience across America meeting one crazy person after another in search of Elvis. Even though both the filmmaker and the people he interviews are not real they are close enough to reality to be very funny. It's fast pace and underbelly Hollywood subplot keeps the film alive more than Elvis. There is not one note of Elvis music in the film but a very cool soundtrack and score, that I think should be released on CD. A very fun and insane movie, good for the whole family even kids can watch it. It would have been nice to see this movie at the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Video Tape","review":"I watched this movie last week. I thought it would be a great spoof documentary. I didn't think it was funny. I didn't think it was original. In my opinion, It was just another creation by someone who was trying to make a buck by using Elvis as subject matter.The lead actor (if you can call him that) will annoy you. When he started talking, I thought it was a woman. He leads you on a pointless journey through various bad characters who think Elvis is alive. Bad acting, bad music, bad from start to finish.The only thing I thought had any worth was the great artwork on the cover. The copy I watched, had a flasher-type cover (one that creates movement when turned from side to side). Worth maybe a $1.This movie is a waste of video tape. If you find Elvis fanatics funny and fasinating, watch a real Elvis documentary. It will provide bigger laughs then this poor spoof.Don't waste your money on this one folks.PS - The one star I gave this video is for the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Like many Glass fans, I waited for this CD for years.

I have always loved the seemingly concise melodies of some of Mr. Glass's pieces, and Candyman is one of those treasures in my mind. The haunting melodies from the solo piano... I am sure in another context ( without having seen Candyman), this music would bring very different images to mind.I buy a lot of soundtrack music, and sometimes it comes across as real \\"filler\\" music, that does not stand alone by itself. The music of Candyman on this CD, stands on its own. Glass fans, and fans of piano music alike will appreciate this recording.. THANKS for FINALLY releasing it!

The protagonist goes back and forth between desiring righteousness and embracing sin that you are never fully convinced of his moral conversion in the end. The contradictions in the novel are so staggering that you will become dizzy with stream-of-consciousness that falls flat.That doesn't mean this book doesn't have redeeming qualities. I was pleased to see some variety from the stock \\"goody-goody\\" Mormon characters, and there is a lot of subtle symbolism that might help people who feel they don't fit the classic mold of what is good but are still good people.I just thought the book was poorly written and the editing of the storyline was severely lacking.

I contacted Circulon and I would have to ship the pan back to them at my cost. Then they decide whether I deserve a replacement. I'm not big on gambling.

I gave 2 stars for \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" because at least it had a small taste of pre-Craig Frost GFR. My god GFR could rock the house down in their day, but this one was a sorry disappointment from the first time I bought it on vinyl back in the day. If you loved GFR's music that was recorded before this album, then don't bother buying Phoenix.

But that didn't stop people from buying their records and selling out their shows. Some of the reviewer criticisms may have been somewhat valid - Grand Funk songs tend to be somewhat simplistic, etc. But kids in the late 60s and early 70s weren't always searching for complexity in their music. I liked \\"Phoenix\\" because it had a pretty consistent groove and enough diversity to make it flow well. All these years later, I still find time to give it the occasional spin. \\"She Got to Move Me\\", \\"I Just Gotta Know\\" and \\"Gotta Find Me a Better Day\\" still sound great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality, plastic parts","review":"Except for the 3 pipes, all parts are brittle plastic, including all fittings and shower head.

I would read a section, throw a few darts, and notice instant improvements. For example, I noticed the biggest improvements after I went from Vortex flights to standard flights after following the advice in the book. I then went to adjust my stance and throw. The book is very well organized. Some of the jokes are a little corny and the book could have been reduced to about 20 pages without all of the illustrations, but at the same time, the illustrations were helpful. It was also very fun to read. I'm not sure if this book would be good for someone more advanced, but it gave me the skills and general information to pursue the game of darts even further."},{"rating":"1","title":"10% Information 90% Filler","review":"There is very, very little real information in this book. The vast majority of the pages contain full page cartoons illustrating 1 line of info that may or mey not be usefull. The author could have condensed the information into 10 ro 15 pages - but that would not justify the ... price tag. The \\"how to\\" aspect of the book is actually pretty helpfull, so if you're a complete beginner there may be some value.

This soundtrack is definitely worth buying if your a fan of the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD Worth \\"Jacking\\"(Buying Of Course)!","review":"I actually bought the CD because I am a fan of Nicolas Cage. However, I enjoyed the music. The Ice CUbe cut is the most relevant one on the CD since it deals with his being car jacked. Painted On My Heart by The CUlt is a great pulse pouding song. Speaking of pulse pounding, DMX's song rocks! I am a fan of Citizen King; so their being on the CD is an added bonus. The only song that doesn't capture the mood of the movie is Da Rockwilder. All said, This CD Is Worth \\"Jacking\\"(Buying Of Course)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone in 60 seconds","review":"This soundtrack was a perfect compliment to the movie Gone in Sixty Seconds. I was surprised at the variation of artists from the Cult to Gomez to DMX. The best song on the CD in my opinion was the BT track, Never gonna come back down.

All in all this was a very good CD and also very fun to drive to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the film","review":"Although I thought the film itself was very weak, the soundtrack more than lived up to my expectations.

I actually bought it because I am a fan of Nicolas Cage, but I enjoyed the music. I think that the Ice Cube song is the song most relevant to the soundtrack since it deals with his being car jacked at the end. Painted On My Heart by The Cult is also a good fit because it is pulse pounding. SPeaking of pulse pounding music, DMX's song rocks. I am a fan of CItizen King so that was an added bonus. This sountrack is one of the few that follows the theme of the movie. My only problem was Da Rockwilder; I did not think that it fits well with the energy or theme of the movie.

After trying it for a few times, I returned it. It takes too long to cook the rice, you have to soak the rice for 30 minutes before cooking, then turn it on, then it takes about another 30 minutes. (I can make rice quicker using the stove). I followed the manufacturer's instructions, rice browned on the bottom, and cooked uneven. I tried to adjust the water, either rice turned out uncooked or too soft. The only thing good it was easy to clean, but so was my old Hitachi rice cooker that did not had the nonstick surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This is an inexpensive rice cooker, and as such does not quite turn out the quality of rice that some of the more expensive models do. It IS, however, a terrific value for your money. I've owned mine for over 6 months now and it has consistantly turned out delicious rice and steamed veggies.

Chuck Connnors heads a solid cast including Aaron Kincaid, Peter Ford and veteran Cesar Romero in this tale of five Confederate veterans.

His commitment to his kids, his bus, his ministry shows each of us what the phrase, \\"...unto the least of these.\\" really means. After reading this book, I cannot imagine anyone who has a vision to see things change around them not feel compelled to get back on track. Our vision is all we have.

To complicate things, she then learns that she is pregnant. Is she willing to risk everything to please her selfish mother?

The more significant message, however, is the depiction of inter-generational patterned behavior. Kerry Washington and Lonette Mckee shine as mother and daughter each acting out of their own individual emotional turmoil.The interaction is remarkably true to life. Director Demane Davis brings inter-generational issues to the surface and forces viewers to face behaviors most people would rather hide in their closets.

Personally, I just loved the effort she put into this album. You can tell she put her heart and soul into it, which makes the work more enjoyable if you ask me. There isn't a single song I dislike, but the ones that impacted me the most were: \\"Angel's Song\\" \\"Because of You\\" \\"Ourselves\\" \\"Greatful Days\\" and finally \\"No Way To Say\\".

The night I received my CD on the mail I took the trip memory lane, and yes there they were waiting for me...

Remember the first time you ever heard it? Did you know what Brewer was going to do on the drums and did it sound great? \\"Gimme Shelter\\" was borrowed from the Stones. I didn't realize it was a Jagger-Richards song until I bought \\"Hot Rocks\\". \\"Comfort Me\\" and \\"Country Road\\" are also highlights on this album. Some of the song \\"I Can Feel Him in the Morning\\", sounds like Farner is singing about Vietnam.

Collecting and reading and re-reading the rest of the books in that series was a pleasant hobby for a few years. Delacorta has what it takes to write a French swindler and his near-Lolita paramour in and around Paris.He doesn't have any of what it takes to 1) write rap lyrics, 2) write American underworld characters, 3) write American metropolitan feel. I showed up giving him the benefit of every doubt, and he disappointed again and again.

Predictable in an unsatisfying way. Unoriginal. Kept reading, despite - hoped to find a fabulous twist to the ending, to great disappointment. This book goes straight into the recycling/trash bin.

It is a highly readable yet erudite examination of the historical, psycho-social, and symbolic meanings attached to the unclothed human body in Western societies. Barcan (herself a nudist) draws upon philosophy, religion, literature, popular culture and personal interviews to analyze the nudity/clothing dialectic, the metaphorical uses of nakedness, the makeup of anti-nude attitudes, and the influence of embodiment on one's sense of self and community. In addition to consulting other nudists in preparation for her writing, Barcan discussed matters with nude models, tattooists, health professionals, strippers, pornographers, and educators. Thus, the book is both well-grounded theoretically and \\"fleshed out\\" by the lived-experience of individuals for whom nudity is experientially significant. Barcan teaches in the Humanities Dept. of the University of Western Sydney (Australia)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes something captivating boring....","review":"This is another one of those frustrating reads. It has such potential, it's appeal is universal, it relates directly to the human experience, and yet it ends up being an exercise in academic self-gratification.The sentences are extraordinarily dense, and the language used is so esoteric, that the layperson will find themselves re-reading passages and consulting dictionaries to the point of utter frustration.In the end one is left with the impression that the author is more concerned with demonstarting an arcane knowledge of sociological concepts than with providing a truly readable, worthwhile, and ultimately human exploration of a fascinating and important topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA Times Reviewer Made An Oversight Here","review":"If only the LA Times reviewer had actually \\"reviewed\\" this CD, he/she would have noted that ALL of the participants in this project were personal friends of Wynette.

We New Yorkers know better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"far from a definitive or even well-written biography","review":"This book is hardly \\"definitive\\" and not even well written with a style that loves the sensationalist but hardly factual. Mario Lanza was a tenor although not an opera singer as he only sang in one production early in career. As such, the biographer needs to know something about music and tenors. By his remarks, Armando Cesari clearly knows little or nothing about music. On page 22, he disputes the comment of Boris Goldowski (an opera authority of long standing) that Lanza didn't have the musical ability to learn the tenor part in the Beethoven 9th so he taught him the role of Fenton instead. Cesari then says he disputes that because of length and \\"not very diffilcult\\". Really? Those are two very different styles, Beethoven and Nicolai,and if Mr. Cesari doesn't know that then he has no business writing about music or singing. The rest of the book reads like sensationalist yellow journalism, something from The National Enquirer. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappropriate comments","review":"Please keep reviews from people who are not connected to this book. We need to hear from people who read the book and comment.

The energy, passion, variety and virtuosity of earlier albums are almost completely absent here. Instead we get a series of almost indistinguishable, dirge-like songs with little or no Celtic flavor.

Now, I decided to use this oppritunity to comment on the band as a whole. There have been people saying stuff like \\"The sound of a band going apart\\" and \\"they are getting worse with each album.\\" I sort of agree with the latter, because they could do better. In my interview, they said that they basically play traditional Irish music and also some contemporary music. I think they need to add some more traditional Irish music into the pot. I currently have a copy of Sunny Spells and Scattered Showers (1997), The Words That Remain (1998), The Edge of Silence (2002), Another Day (2003), and Waiting for an Echo (2005). They certainly don't need to replace any members, but they do need to play some more Irish music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks ?","review":"As a musician, I enjoy playing original music whether its celtic, bluegrass, blues, etc. After a while you start to feel like a big kareoke machine.

Dixie Checks? Don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"It's sad to see a band with this much talent play a bunch of poppish songs that sound like rejects from singer/songwriters or the Dixie Chicks.

This book answered so many of my spiritual questions very quickly and it was hard to put the book down. Written by a man raised as a strict Catholic I too was raised with a strict religious background and had many questions I was not to ask or if I did would not be answered. The author of this book seems to understand the human piece of loss and grief and I cannot tell you how much I appreciated his knowledge and relief! Excellent book and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is All The Fuss?","review":"If you're looking for \\"confirmation\\" of what you already believe in anyway (i.e., that your dear departed are lining up to make a long-distance call via Van Praagh), this is your book.

Yeah, I know the cliche: \\"To the believer no proof is necessary...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A master of deceiving the people","review":"This man is simply telling people what they want to hear. A master of deception. The only truth in this man/book is that there is life after death. I wish these kind of crafty so-called physics who claim they talk to the dead would leave the people alone. That is more peace at heart to these people he takes advantage of. This book is better off never to exist from the beginning on the account he is not truly helping people become peaceful through his beliefs. Have you ever seen him on t.v.? If he was true, he would not need to ask questions from those he takes advantage of...afterall, he talks to the dead, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it! Where they are, I don't want to go!

Spare me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Age at its worst","review":"Pandering, hypocritical, assumptive nonsense. Take a look at Van Praagh's resume and it's pretty clear that he communicates with the dead, alright: mainly Benjamin, Grant, and Jackson. He classifies mediumistic talents, drawing on stuff that was discredited a hundred years ago, like apports and ectoplasmic voiceboxes. Gag. He even has the audacity to mention that ectoplasm sometimes \\"looks like cheesecloth.\\" I guess because that's exactly what its been proven to be. After rehashing all the same Sylvia Browne bunk about vibratory rates and spiritual planes, he has the nerve to bash the Catholic Church for some 20 pages, concluding \\"I still find it a bit unbelievable the Catholic Church teaches this stuff,\\" and refers to Christianity as \\"mythology.\\" Wow.Pass this one by, even if you are a spiritualist. Van Praagh is a cynical charlatan and frustrated screen-writer. The genre holds many more satisfying reads for just about any persuasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you buying this?","review":"I found this book patronizing and extremely difficult to believe. Van Praagh's words were simplistic, vague and shallow. The age-old art of giving people want you know they want to hear has not been lost in this book.

His ability to lead others to solve a murder mystery should have given some proof to those who do not accept his gifts.There is much more to this book then just lots of storires about contacting spirits on the \\"other side\\"; he talks about suicide for example, and gives us a view on that subject that may help greiving families."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"A must read if you are interested in the supernatural.

This book helps you to understand how to fine your love ones an guilds on the other side. Even though I was one reading it I could swear I could here him reading it to me it is that good.

I now have faith that my mother is not only in a great place and doing well but that she isn't \\"gone\\"; she is always right there with me in a way I never thought she could be. She's not just part of my heart and memories. She is actually there with me on a different level of being. She sees me, hears me, laughs at my jokes, and comforts me in times of sadness.

Even with plenty of notice, it was and is, very difficult after they died. This book made me think differently about missing them so much. Whether it's true or not, it's comforting to think that they have a life beyond and that I will see them again. As for communicating with them in the present day...it would be great to say some things that seem unfinished. Unfortunately our lives are so caught up with working and paying the bills, that the time we can spend with loved ones as they are dying is very limited. If I had to do it over again, I would have taken the time off in the end to finish the time with them properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book by James Van Praagh!","review":"This is my second Kindle Book & I have a hardback copy by the same author.

It may provide some with a feeling of \\"happiness\\", but it is a false hope that has no real meaning or significance. There is nothing wrong with spiritualism, but there is something definitely wrong with scamming innocent people with lies and falsehoods.

The great problem with this sort of work for me is it's lack of authenticity. I have no idea if the author has any sort of self-critical skills at all with which to evaluate his experiences. He just lumps them all in the very pleasant and self-serving category of his gift.Still, the pay is very good, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"We are spiritual beings having a human experience.

I mean if someone closed to me passed away and wanted to talk to me, why would I have to pay someone $200 or more for us to communicate?

Of course, hold on to your seats and your reservations about how it really is, but at least this author gives us a hope that life on the other side is not that bad and that the continuation to spiritual growth is there beyond the realm of the material.

My friends there can wake up to fresh raisin and nut bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth purchasing.","review":"can't believe all these rave reviews. yes, it's quiet and has a non-stick interior surface, but after 6 tries i have yet to get a great loaf of bread. most of them are small hard lumps of cooked dough (and yes, the yeast i use is fresh and of the kind they recommend). the latest few loaves keep getting too dark, with parts even being burnt. the only setting that makes a remotely edible loaf is the sandwich mode.i have been making bread by hand and thought this would make things so much easier. i'll admit it is easier than making bread by hand from scratch, but is it too much to ask for a breadmaker that actually makes a nice loaf of bread? because this one certainly isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just hate it!!","review":"Well I read a lot of the reviews of this bread machine and I needed one as my Regal Kitchen Pro died. I had it since 1992 and make a lot of bread and pizza dough. Well reading the booklet, the weights to make bread are weird. Since when am I to measure 4 7/16 cup of flour. Really, 7/16 cup!! So, any way I am sending it back. Also, I made a pizza dough and it was a gooey mess!! Almost like dough soup!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Machine!","review":"As of Jan. 2012 I have owned this machine over 4 months now.It makes a fabulous loaf of bread everytime without fail.We have made Basic White, Whole Wheat, Rye, French breads. Have also made Pizza dough.Never a problem.I advise you to read the review by Harry Perkins whose advice I have followed.This is the first bread machine I have ever owned, so I cannot compare it to other brands.The bread this machine makes is so far above the miserable crap that you get at the super market that there is no comparison. The store garbage is not even bread.I have made bread for years by hand, and I could never equal the performance of this machine!I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic SD-YD250 Bread machine","review":"I purchased this gift for my wife for Christmas. The item was shipped so fast I was unable to get it off the front porch before my wife found her new gift three weeks before Christmas.. The machine seems to work well, we have only made one loaf of bread so far, but the machine seems to be very high quality. I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For low sodium bread","review":"A couple months ago we purchased a Panasonic SD YD 250 Btread Machine. If you are on a low sodium diet the store bread is too high in Sodium. My wife uses Low Sodium Bread Recipes for Bread Machines. Namely Basic White, Rasin and Egg Bread. All come out beautiful, large with a light crust. Now I am back to having sandwiches again, after two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine!","review":"My first bread machine was a Panasonic (1 lb. loaf). It was a great machine, but the loaf was a little small for our family. I then gave each of our 4 children bread machines of different brands. None worked as well as my little Panasonic.Last month, in choosing a variable size loaf machine for myself, I again chose Panasonic -- and it is just great. Perfect loaf every time! Easy to use! Easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breadmachine","review":"I love this bread machine. This is the first one I have ever owned so I wasn't sure what to expect. The bread comes out great.

The Panasonic made a good loaf of bread when I used mostly white flour, but when I tried to make a whole wheat bread with buttermilk that I'd make many times with a Hitachi machine that had given out, the bread came out as 2 inedible lumps. I tried it again - same thing. On another bread (white flour with chocolate chips), the crust was burned and the chips were all at one end. (I'd set it on light crust.) Also, the manual has errors and, as some previous reviewers have written, the monitor is hard to view. I was very impressed with Amazon, however. I got a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"Very good bread maker. It is very use to use and comes with easy to follow directions.

I had another one that I purchased 15 years ago and lost a part to it I could no longer replace. I must say the new one is even better. Bread comes out perfect each time, it has a setting for small, medium or large loaf. This is good if making for two vs making for a dinner party of six. Bread is best fresh but stored properly will last days. The best part is setting the timer the night before and having it start baking about the time my kids are getting up for school. They get out of bed much nicer when they smell bread baking for breakfast! I take that back the best part is that I am sleeping and baking bread at the same time..I recommend the Panasonic hands down over other brands I have tasted bread from. Its worth a little higher cost for the Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect!","review":"I bought this bread machine a month ago and have tried lots of kinds of bread. The total result is satisfactory. Except first time, I always got beautiful bread. The only thing is you have to get the bread out of the machine immediately after it is ready, so I thought the timer option is not practical. Besides, the dough I tried to make for dinner rolls or buns were also not very good, though I followed the receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Mom used to make","review":"We have had this bread machine for about 6 months and it has performed beyond expectations. I had spent several years trying to make bread by hand but couldn't achieve the results I wanted and couldn't even come close to the texture and flavor that my mother achieved. The bread from this machine is consistently of excellent texture and flavor. I would swear it was Mom's in a blind taste test. We also make our pizza and dinner roll dough with this machine and haven't looked back. The only minor gripe is that the XL size for bread is pretty much useless, when we have tried to make that size, it ends up smaller than the L size loaves. It seems the machine isn't large enough to allow a full rise. Otherwise an excellent machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing since...well...sliced bread!","review":"I've been making bread the traditional way for decades. My husband did all the research to find the best machine in this price range. I was initially against the purchase (what's better than the \\"old way\\"), but I have to say, this is a great product! For those new to owning a bread maker, this is very easy to use. I especially like the programmable feature--you can time it just right to have hot bread ready when the meal is ready. We will be purchasing a second machine as a gift for our daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"bread maker","review":"this is our third bread maker and the best so far does a very good job i would recommend this machine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread maker for the price","review":"We love this breadmaker. We have made several of the bread recipes that came with the machine and they are all good. Great machine for the price.

It takes up a lot of counter space, but that's ok b/c the bread is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"We have made around 5 loaves in our bread maker, wheat, orange/cranberry, cinnamon raisin, etc. and everytime we comment on how EASY and delicious the bread is.

Now i have an issue the key pad does not work at all so i called Panasonic who were very polite and quickly answered. It would be fine if i lived in Virginia Beach so i could carry it in for service, instead i can mail 500 miles and pay shipping both ways.

The Panasonic made a great loaf of bread. It took longer than the Sunbeam and to me that was not a major concern. The feature I don't like is the yeast dispenser set in the lid of the machine. When I poured the yeast in, the opening was small and yeast went all over the place. With all oher machines I have owned, you pour the yeast directly into the machine on top of the other ingredients. I spent a lot of time getting the yeast out of nooks and crannies to be sure I had it all so the bread would rise. Maybe with practice, I will get the hang of it, but if I don't, I would not recommend this machine even though it made a great loaf of bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diamond in a pile of cubic zirconias","review":"I got a panasonic bread bakery for a wedding gift 15 years ago and have moved at least 6 times. I used the bread maker all of the time and I have to say, 95% of our loaves were perfect and I do believe the other 5% were human error. The machine has finally baked its last loaf and we have purchased this newer model and so far it is showing to be as great as the last one. I bought 2 other bread machines (seduced by the marketing ex..2 loafs at once ect...) and they were junk. I still kept going back to this one. So if you want a machine that will last and last and give you great bread even if you are not a chef, this is the one for your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid machine","review":"After much research I purchased the Panasonic. I noted some people had trouble with what (I can only guess) must have been defective machines. I have now made three different types of loaves, all turned out great.The biggest challenge was whole wheat, where I found the dough needed more water than called for in the recipe. Too little water with a dense loaf such as whole wheat clearly strained the motor and made for ineffective mixing until fixed.I find the timer convenient and easy to use and programming likewise fairly easy. While a glass cover or window would be nice, its easy to peek inside anyway. Overall, seems to be a well constructed machine that is fairly quiet. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect product","review":"This is my third Panasonic breadmaker in 17 years, all three the same brand, the last two the same model-you know I like it!!

I can make XXL size loafs to small loafs. I have made pumpernickel bread, wheat, gluten free bread, nut and fruit breads and the best white bread I have ever had. The best part is that a recipe book comes with the unit. All the recipes are so great I didn't need to buy an additional recipe book. I use this unit to make about 4 loafs a week. Its perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, does it all","review":"I bought this bread maker on New Year, and have been eating my own bread.

I had a Panasonic several years ago. Then I bought a different brand and never liked it as well, so I have been happy to replace it with this new SD-YD250 model Panasonic. I would recommend this bread maker to anyone, looking for an inexpensive bread maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"I bought after going through a lot of reviews too.It burns the bread, it cooks for about 10 - 12 minutes too long. I set it to the lightest crust, the smallest size loaf, etc, but it burns the crust black. I have learned this now and have to set a timer to stop the cooking process early and take it out. It also squeaks annoying when it is mixing.If there is a way to adjust the heat or cooking time, please let me know. Right now I can only make bread if I am here to rescue it before it burns the outside crust.For the money, I am disappointed. I guess I just have a lemon, but I already threw the box out so cannot return it now or I would have. I am sure other people have good models, mine just is not one of them.It's also pretty big on the counter, far larger than my old model. On the plus side, the bread does slide out the pan easily enough in one piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Kneading just 2 months after I bought it","review":"It worked well when it worked. However, it stopped kneading just two months after I bought it. I regret that I did not take the 1-star review into consideration. Even though it is still a highly-ranked product but the number of people having problem with it shortly after the purchase is amazingly high. I am in the process of working with customer service. The closest service location is over 100 mile away! In addition to the frustration and trouble I have to go through to get it repaired (if they can ever fully repair it), it is highly likely that I'll have to pay the shipping, which could cost a lot! What a lemon! I will complain to Amazon to even allow them to sell it after so many angry customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bread Machine For a Busy Life","review":"I received this bread machine as a gift and I have had it almost 6 months now. I use it a couple of times a week. The recipes in the book are delicious and very easy to make. I love the easy menu on the machine and the options for faster loaves. The yeast auto-add option is great because I can put the ingredients in and get on with my day and not worry about timing the yeast. The only downside to this machine is cleaning the paddle. It's hard to find something small enough to clean the inside of the paddle but I love this bread machine too much so it is only a small negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this product - actually TWO of this product - one for me and one for my daughter. We have had many breadmakers in the past - this one just isn't a good choice in our opinion. The display is hard to read, the instructions difficult to follow and it's just not user friendly at all. We returned them both and got the Zojirushi breadmaker instead - more money but definitely worth it! If you want an easy to use breadmaker with great options, this is probably not the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy!","review":"I have had this breadmaker for about 6 weeks now and haven't been able to make one satisfactory loaf of whole wheat bread yet. The loaves are small. The measurements . are too exacting. You are encouraged to weigh yourIngredients which is ridiculous. And some of the measurements are for sixteenths. I am sorry I bought this machine. I have to figure out what to do now. It is too late to return it I think. I will certainly not get anotherBreadmaker through the mail. Too much trouble to return it. Please don't buy this machine. I don't understand why it has gotten good reviews. I will try to call Panasonic and get some help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread MakerI got this bread maker as a Christmas gift. It does a great job on bread. It makes a very nice 2.5# loaf so the bread lasts a little longer. I understand the price was over $100.00 which seems a bit high, but hopefully it'll last for years not months like the last one I had (different manufacturer). It would be nice if this unit had a pop-up function so that if you can't take the bread out after it bakes, it will get damp since the lid doesn't open. All in all it's a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"bread maker","review":"This bread making machine is wonderful.

My first bread machine also was a Panasonic Mod. SD BT6D over 30 years ago, I went through 3 bread pans and could not purchase parts for it any more, so I went to several other brands some over $200.00 and they were terrible machines could not even get the bread out of the bread pan do to the stupid double mixing paddles, both of the same manufacturer, I now use them for making dough only! I am extremely pleased with my Panasonic SDWD 250, I do not believe there is a better bread machine that will even come close to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"After reading the reviews of the Panasonic SD-YD250 bread maker, I totally agree! This is a very easy to use, well-built, simple machine to use. It gives consistently good results.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"This is my first bread machine; I should have bought it years ago. Not much to add to what has already been said except I've baked about a loaf of multigrain a week for 8 weeks and it is working fine so far. Good instructions. Easy to use and clean up. It is a large brute that takes up counter space or needs to be stowed somewhere though."},{"rating":"2","title":"good results!","review":"Made the raisin bread and wholewheat bread and multigrains!I use Fleischmanns all natural yeast for the breadmachine and good quality flours and exact measuring helps.Not all recipes have the faster option and not all have the option to chose the colour of the crust.The book you get with the machine is clear. I would recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"This has been a great machine so far! The loaves come out great and delicious.

He has made all the bread we eat for more than 25 years. This recent purchase is his third bread maker--bread makers do not seem to last forever.

It is still going strong. We have tried other bread makers but they don't work. We were afraid our original Panasonic would die on us. So we bought this new one. Now we have two bread makers. The new model is slightly different than our old one - but it works just as well. Using bread flour seems to be one of the secrets. We figure that we are saving around $1.50 to $2.00 on every loaf of bread. And this new machine cost less than half the price of the first one. We love fresh homemade bread. We also use it to make pizza dough and sandwich buns. We're happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner in Breadmaking","review":"This is the first bread machine I have owned so I don't really have any basis for comparison.

The instruction manual is very thorough but I wish there were more recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes good bread, but breaks after 1 year!","review":"First off, this bread machine makes excellent bread. My wife and I bought the SD-YD 250 in March of 2007 and have used is steadily for the past year. We grind our wheat using a hand-crank stone grinder, which tends to make a slightly denser loaf than all-purpose or bread flour. Week after week, this machine has produced excellent bread and dough. Unfortunately, it is now March of 2008 and the machine fails to mix the dough properly. We just tried making pizza dough and to our utter disappointment, the dough was unmixed and stuck to all sides of the pan and the motor was making an awful squeaking noise. I called panasonic and we are past our 1-year warranty, so I'm currently researching other bread machines to replace this one. For the excess of $100 dollars I paid, I really expected this product to last longer. I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing this bread machine if you plan on using it for more than 1 year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highbred","review":"My decision to purchase this model was largely influenced by previous reviews.I am very impressed with the loaves that come out of this machine.I prefer the single paddle and this one results in a very small hole in the bread.The horizontal shape is a plus for me also. I like the yeast dispenser even though it meanssacrificing the peek window of most machines.I definitely recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken within a year","review":"We got this bread maker as a Christmas present. Initially it did a great job of making bread. We had no problems, making a loaf of bread about once a week. But about 8 months in, the bread started to get smaller. At first we thought we had gotten something wrong in the content of the bread. We tried adjusting the recipe with no luck. Then we tried different yeast. That did not work. The bread just continued to rise less and less. By the time we realized that it was the bread maker, it was past the one-year warranty. Very disappointed that this product broke so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"crust setting is broken...","review":"I tried with several recipe and crust setting light and medium, but the bread always comes out super dark.

It pops out perfectly formed, great tasting bread in just 4 short hours (usually). It has many other functions that we have yet to try out, but so far it is doing exactly as we hoped! Bread is a little 'taller' than a typical loaf, but still fits in toaster. We eat one XL size loaf each week (2.5 lb), and this does a wonderful wheat sandwich, dinner, and breakfast bread as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the TOP RATING hype!","review":"WOW - it really is that quiet and it really does make HIGH quality bread. I like the separate yeast compartment and the \\"normalizing\\" cycle which helps get the ingredients to the right temp before adding the yeast. I only messed up one loaf, completely my fault though. This is every bit of the TOP RATING that I read about before buying. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years, 100+ loaves, still going strong","review":"We've had this bread maker for almost 3 years now and it's been flawless. We make at least a loaf a week, so over 100 loaves plus several dozen pizza doughs. Never a bad loaf and it's been problem free the whole time. Takes < 5 minutes to do the setup and clean-up is a breeze. It's long since paid for itself, and now we're in the great zone of saving money each time we use it, plus there's nothing like waking up to fresh baked bread in the morning. :)Also, you can fridge any leftover pizza dough - it's pretty rare we actually buy pizza now and that's another source of cost savings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great price","review":"This is my first bread maker, and I love it. The bread comes out tasty and light. It is so easy to throw the ingredients in, set the timer or not, and push start. That's it! Four hours later you have an amazing smell throughout the house and fresh bread in the kitchen.A couple notes:-the XL size loaf tends to be lopsided and almost burn on top because it touches the top of the unit-make sure the bread maker is away from cabinets because the steam will discolor the cabinets if it is too close-the quick-bake setting turns out a good quality bread, but it is definitely worth the extra two hours to get a better loaf from the normal setting.All in all, it is a great product at a great price. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After a long search...","review":"When I buy something, I'm obsessive. I analyze, agonize, read reviews from consumer reports websites, I've probably read every other review on this site...and finally, I settled on this machine. It had excellent reviews, was Consumer Report's best mid-range priced bread maker and didn't have troubles like the Breadman machine I wanted (ie being shipped broken, used when priced as new, etc).I've had this machine 5 days and made three loaves of bread from recipes in a bread recipe book ( 2 loaves of white and a loaf of wheat).The bread came out beautifully every time!The machine is QUIET- I think I could run it in the bedroom and sleep easily. It doesn't rock or rattle on the counter. It's pretty easy to use- I read the instructions once and WHAM BAM I'm like an expert now :).I definitely recommend this machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bread machine!","review":"I found this bread machine to be excellent. I have made several different kinds from the book that came with it and a few other recipes that I already had. My favorite is the onion rye recipe. I made the pizza recipe which was excellent as well. The machine performs just as it is supposed to and doesn't move around at all on the counter. The controls are easy to use and the bread slides out easily. I am not disappointed that I bought the machine and will be using it between 3 and 4 times a week. It performs so much better than my last machine (Breadman Plus)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the box, A WINNER Just a little complicated","review":"Can not comment on reliability as this is new. However the first basic white loaf came out GREAT. As an engineer I measured VERY carefully and followed the complicated directions. Now for a few small negatives. 1, I would have preferred an easier operator interface. You CAN NOT just take from the box and push buttons to make bread. You MUST read the directions very carefully. It is a very complex machine. 2, I would have preferred a small window on the lid to allow me to observe the baking progress. 3, I would have preferred a smaller form factor. BUT do NOT let these mild critisizements stop you from buying this machine. It is a winner and keeper for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! 15 day return","review":"Any product with such a short return policy of 15 days is a WARNING sign that there is something terribly wrong with this product.It is a very bad sign which usually indicates that there have been a lot of returns or breakdowns and this seller is trying to circumvent it by making it impossible to return.Steer clear and find one with a more normal return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job--even at high altitude","review":"I read the reviews on this and made my purchase based on them.

Then in the middle of a bread making cycle it somehow managed to move several inches so that it fell off the counter and was damaged beyond repair. There was no earthquake at the time.

Hey Panasonic, I know you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke under warranty, have to pay shipping to get it fixed","review":"IMHO, it is not a good idea to buy these types of appliance via Amazon. The box was received crushed and one setting (crust) did not work from the start. The machine stopped working altogether and now I have to ship it via UPS or FEDEX to the closest Panasonic repair shop, which is nowhere near my home. I have to pay for shipping BOTH WAYS. It is now going to cost more than if I had just purchased it locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread Maker","review":"When my old bread maker finally gave out, I started doing some research. I read many reviews for the various makers. It was a toss up from the bread machine and this one. The oher reviews kept pointing to this one. I kept reading and finally bought it. I have NO Regrets, this one is Great! My old one did up to 1.5 lbs but this one goes to 2.5 lbs. Now I have plenty of of bread for larger gatherings. I love the delay, since I can get everything ready have it ready when I return from work. The delay feature is a life saver at times. I would recommend this to those who love home mnade bread!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Makes great bread. I will also use it to form the dough for baguettes, which takes a lot of work out of the process.

I have stuck with the small and medium loaves (the small will feed my family of five easy) and have had no other problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Bread","review":"This product is dependable and was used as a gift.

Purchased this one as a gift for my bread making daughter (she went through 50 pounds of flour just before last Christmas). She has worn out two breadmakers, and had to replace parts on others. She also makes dough for homemade rolls, bread and pizza, sometimes using two or three machines at a time as she gives bread and rolls to her friends. (Yes, she has three children also works two part time jobs.) I, on the other hand, just use mine for bread. Just thinking about it makes me want to go start a loaf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bread the first time","review":"This unit was a replacement for an older Panasonic bread maker that I bought in 1993 or 1994. For the first use of the new machine, I used a recipe I was familiar with and the results were perfect! The controls are a bit more complicated because there are choices for loaf size and crust brownness, but otherwise the operation was very similar. The old unit was made in Japan, this one in China. I think the old one was a bit more robust, but that applies to most appliances nowadays. In summary: great machine, works as it should, reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet breadmaker","review":"This Panasonic bread maker is great for making bread in Large, XL, or Medium and from light to dark loaves. The only problem I have is with the recipes. How does a person measure every thing in 7/16 or 3/ 16 ounces. Using the cup and spoon that is with the bread maker is not always helpful in measuring. Learn how to do the 16th and your loaves will be delicious. I hate doing math when cooking!!( I would rather have the Cups and TBS or Tsp measurement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"Amazing products are such a joy to work with. This Panasonic is the 3rd bread machine we have owned, and it is the top of the line. The yeast dispenser releases yeast when ingredients are the PROPER temperature, taking the guesswork out of preparation. We love not having to heat the water, melt the butter, or bother with thermometers. This also makes the prep time quicker. I would recommend this machine with no reservations. AND the recipes are terrific! Thanks for offering this beauty, and at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am now spoiled","review":"Purchased this for my Wife in early Feb. and she has not stopped making great bread since.

We think the new one is even better than the old one and look forward to more years of fresh bread, rolls, pizza dough, etc. Only find the receipes a little difficult to follow since the measurement for the flour is suggested to be in weight. Otherwise it is a \\"winner\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bread machine","review":"Baked loaves of bread slip off the slim Kneader insert, unlike other bread machines I've owned. The bread is consistently excellent (especially the French loaf recipe which is worth every minute of the 6 hour baking process). We frequently use the timer function so that we wake up to fresh bread for breakfast...although the aroma of the baking bread does not allow us to lie lazily in bed.....we are up ready to eat !! I've also used the dough function and made yummy pizza dough. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine, a bit noisy","review":"Bought as gift for son.

Unlike a lot of bread makers, it is really quiet. It dispenses the yeast which is a big plus for timed operation. We use it about twice a week.

All have been excellent and lasted many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have bought a lemon","review":"The breadmaker worked great for about 2 months and then died. The motor and the heating element went out at about the same time. I can't get Panasonic to do anything about it. They gave me a local repair center that never would call me back (called several times). I called the main office again and they transfer me over and over and say they will call me back. They found a service center that would repair it but still haven't given me instructions on getting it repaired. They keep saying they will call me back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 45 days","review":"We brought this from Amazon.com. It worked fine for the first 2 times. On the 3rd time, when we used it. It started a very bad smell like the electronic was melting. Then it stopped working. The bad part is it right past 30 days Amazon free return policy. We actually will have to pay shipment fee to get it either replaced or returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my breadmaker","review":"I did alot of research before buying my Breadmaker. The reviews of the Panasonic helped me to decide. It came so quickly. This is my first breadmaker, so it's difficult to compare it with another brand. A week after I got it, I was wiping out the oven. The little white ceramic bracket that holds the heating element, broke in two. I got on the Panasonic website to locate a dealer and found out that the nearest dealer is 2 or 3 hours away. I fixed it myself with heat resistant glue. Living in a rural area can be a problem if you need service I guess. It makes great bread. I love the smell of fresh baked bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bread Maker","review":"This is the third Panasonic bread maker I have owned. The previous one, which was virtually the same as this model - except for some new programming features that have been added - gave almost 8 years of service. We used it on average at least several times a week. I replaced the belt a few times from normal wear (it's easy to do yourself) and the paddle mechanism gradually wore out. But overall my Panasonic bread makers have been very durable. And they make great bread, though we mainly use it to mix dough that we bake in the oven.I did notice that the old one was made in Japan and the new one is from China, so we'll see if the new machine holds up as well. No problems so far.With this machine and a baking stone in the oven it's like having a French bakery in your kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, Thank You!","review":"I bought the bread machine with the highest rating, so had high expectations. My first loaf was a soggy, compact, 2 inch high reject with no browning on the top crust. I discovered that most if not all of the yeast was still in the yeast dispenser. The next day I made another attempt. This time I mixed the yeast with a small amount of the flour and put it in the bottom of the pan. I also checked the temperature of the water and raised it to 72 degrees F. (My tap water is 55.) Imagine my disappointment when the nice smelling loaf turned out to be another soggy dud! Sorry. I do better the old fashioned way. I'm returning the bread machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make 'em like they used to!","review":"I bought this machine to replace my old Regal machine which served me well for 15 years. The new machine is quite similar to the Regal with one HUGE difference... the motor that spins the kneading blade in this machine is pathetic. It can't even handle a simple white flour bread dough without stalling and smelling like overheating parts. I am expecting it to last about a year. How very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"unpredictable outcome","review":"I bought this breadmaker because it was highly rated by Amazon customers, but I am very disappointed in it. A major defect of this unit is the beeper, which is so quiet you can't hear it unless you are sitting with your ear next to it. As a result when you try to make raisin bread or anything with extra ingredients, it never turns out right. In fact, the bread turns into a mess with raisins and/or nuts stuck to the outside of the crust. Even worse is that if you try to use the Speed Bake option, it never signals when to add extra ingredients. Where were the engineers on this feature?Another problem is that a loaf of bread takes four hours to make, which is much too long, IMO. My old Kitchen Pro took less than half that time to bake a loaf. This unit does have a \\"Speed Bake\\" option, but even that takes two hours or more. Not very Speedy.So, with respect to those who gave this thing a high rating, I would pass on this one if I had a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"i LIKE it !","review":"First, my awarding only 4 stars is not a bad thing, you see, I've never had a'Bread Machine' before.Now for the machine... with the 4 loaves of bread that I've made, so far, I've hadno problems.

I tried several different things (e.g. more yeast, different types of loaves) and concluded the machine itself was broken. I called Panasonic customer service and an extremely rude agent told me I would have to pay to ship the broken breadmaker in for repair. Why should I have to pay for shipping when they sent me a defective product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Sorry, but I am disappointed in the Panasonic bread maker. It was very quiet the first time I used it for a basic bread - because it wasn't doing anything! No kneading, just \\"baked\\" a pan of flour. The second round, it worked on the quick cycle. Next time it rested for two hours, never kneaded - stopped it and restarted it on basic and ended up with a lump of bread. Fourth round, tried making dough. It took four tries and eight hours. And the manual is very poorly written and confusing. It even contradicts itself by telling you to put the yeast in first and then tells you to put it in last. Did I get the wrong manual?!!

Too bad, tuff cookies, you can't reset it once it's set to bake, so I now have to wait on it to run through a four hour cycle with nothing in it, hoping my unmixed ingredients hold up in the fridge until I can actually bake, because I don't WANT an extra large loaf, and I don't WANT to wait four hours to know if it came out right.

I use it daily. It eventually needs replacing because the pan loses its non-stick quality and it's very tough to get the loaf out. I just wish Panasonic would make it easy and cost-effective to replace the pan rather than buy a new machine.It makes perfect bread. I don't bother with weighing the ingredients as the book suggests - just throw in three and a half cups of flour, a teaspoon of salt, dessertspoon of sugar, a tablespoon of oil or a chunk of butter, 12 oz of water, and then one and a half teaspoons of yeast in the dispenser and you're done.Friends and family members have bought other brands, and eventually thrown them away to replace with the Panasonic after seeing the results from mine.

Several months later, many many bad loaves of bread, new yeast, new flour etc still doesn't work - and ya know what Panasonic does - you have to send it to the service center and they will decide if it doesn't work. They say they will send a call tag (they don't) they say they will email a call tag (they don't) the right leg doesn't know where the left leg is and you get to go thru the delightful phone tree repeatedly where the people are trained to say they are sorry BUT THEY DO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING - so we are breadless and will NEVER buy anything Panasonic again.

We have used it three times so far trying a variety of different whole wheat type loaves, so far all three have failed to rise properly and have been burnt. We have use other bread makers in the past, and have never had this consistent of a problem. We have tried cutting the expensive new whole wheat flour with unbleached regular flour. We have always use new yeast, but to no avail it seems to always come out extremely short, dense, and burned on the sides. We did use it to make pizza dough once, and that turned out okay so that's why I didn't just give it one star. I think the problem is in the yeast dispensing mechanism.Now since it has been use, and I bought it just over thirty days ago, I have to deal with the hassle of returning the product to Panasonic for a full refund. Amazon is only offering a partial refund.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes great bread","review":"The Panasonic Breadmaker creates very tasty bread, better than any previous breadmaker I've owned.

The only way around it is to make small loaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"Our new Panasonic Bread Maker is great!

We do a final rise and cook in a pan. We've been making bread with an old machine for years. You warm cold ingredients to room temp with warm water or the microwave. That takes under 5 minutes. Apparently people are too lazy to do this anymore, so the machine does it. It takes the machine 1-2 hours to do this. How ridiculous. If the shipping wasn't so bad, I'd send it back. I do gather that this rest is fairly common with newer machines, so another brand may not help. Could they at least add a setting to bypass this amazing waste of time? My old machine takes 1 hour 50 minutes to produce dough. This machine takes 3 hours 15 minutes, with no improvement in quality.

This requires a kitchen scale that measures sixteenths of an ounce. Scales of this precision begin at $...(if you can find them), so add this to the price of the machine. The recipes DO NOT WORK if you try to convert dry ounces to dry cup measurements. This is foolish for a machine meant to be used in the United States.The manufacturer says that the different density and coarseness of flours requires different amounts (true), so only ounces will do (bunk!). My previous machine gave different cup amounts for different kinds of flour in its recipes (e.g. \\"2 1/2 cups bread flour or 2 3/4 cups whole wheat\\") and it worked fine. Panasonic has simply been too lazy to work this out for the customer and leaves it to us to buy expensive, scarce kitchen scales.I'm returning it and buying the cheap, reliable Oster."},{"rating":"2","title":"This bread beats anything in this little desert town","review":"Great, I bought my first Panasonic bread maker in 1990, used constantly, moved and left it behind.

The next step is Kneading, and that went fine, the dough looked good. After that, the machine bakes it, but mine did not get hot, so no baking. I tried again, but the machine just quit the first time, no heating. Well, that was both a surprise and a disappointment, but I took the dough out and baked it separately.

I called customer service and after ten minutes of explaining they still could not understand my complaint. I was told I would have to bring my machine to the nearest repair center in New Jersey to have it serviced. I live in South Carolina. The Rep had no idea how far away they are from each other. They refused to send me a new paddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw your money away...","review":"I ordered the Panasonic SD-YD250 breadmaker for my wife for Christmas. The irony was that my Mother in Law bought her one too - the Emeril bread machine. Little did I know that the Panasonic would break after using it 3 times. BTW, the Emeril still works to this day!(updated)Working with Panasonic for warranty service was a nightmare. Their Dallas based service provider first lost our shipment (lucky I sent it signature), then claimed that it was out of warranty. They shipped it back to me...and it was someone else's old unit. I tried to escalate a couple of times, but noone would help. This product is the worst and the service behind it is criminal. I strongly suggest you pass on Panasonic bread makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bread","review":"I had purchased another brand of bread maker about a year ago, and was very disappointed in the way the bread came out. Then a friend of mine said she had gotten a Panasonic from you, and she was in love. So I said, \\"Well, what the heck, I'll try another one\\". So I purchased the Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker. What a difference! And the Panasonic was cheaper than the origional! The bread came out great, and tasted so good. Bread making is on my list now as a daily task. Thanks for selling such a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"works","review":"This makes bread making easier. Fairly easy to use and clean. Bread comes out fine. You can make dough for pizza and french bread dough then bake it in the oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Bread Maker","review":"I would give this a five star if the panel were easier to see; arrows on the right hand side are practically hidden and very difficult, especially at night. It makes great bread and as others say almost impossible to fail. Do miss having a window on lid. Amazon was great, no shipping and arrived earlier than expected and in perfect shape. You can't find any better to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I just received the Panasonic bread maker, having ordered it after reading several good reviews. I have only made one loaf of Basic White Bread with it, but that came out marvelously! The crust was crispy and the insides were tender. I followed the basic setting, which takes 4 hours from beginning to end. I will try the Rapid Bake next. It was very easy to use, and based on my experience, I'd recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with Panasonic SD-YD250 Breadmaker and wiyAmazon","review":"We could not be more pleased... in every way. We reccomend this product and Amazon to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes really good bread, but........","review":"It makes really good bread, but the action on the bottom of the pan where the mixing occurs, leaves a lot of unmixed flour on the bread. I would have given it 5 stars for the machine as a whole,(very easy to use and great size), but I have not figured out how to get it to mix on the bottom. I added all the ingredients as listed in the recipe making five loaves. One loaf was worse than the others, but all had flour that was not mixed in on the bread. Maybe this is common for this machine, but never had it happen with my other Panasonic Bread Maker. Hope to get it worked out for future loaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"money well spent","review":"This machine makes very nice bread.You can follow the receipethat came with it or you can modify it the way want.The delivery was superfast, i got it the next day for free shipping.This is my first purchase from amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"kearney bread maker","review":"So far I highly recommend this bread maker.

I've made 4 loaves and EVERY one was scorched, dark, and hard outside. My Welbilt, bought for about $39, lasted years and made good bread. This is such a disappointment! From reading the reviews, it's not worth sending it in for repairs since Panasonic doesn't seem to care to repair. It would be in their best interest to just replace the bad ones. I'll not buy another Panasonic anything. This is just awful. Going back to find another Welbilt for under $50. At least it made wonderful bread!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine","review":"I had an old Zojirushi machine that finally died after 15 years. A new one cost $215 so I looked at other options. This machine looked best when I had read many reviews. The one odd thing is that in my old machine, I put in all the ingredients at once.With this machine, there is a little round hole on the top of the lid that you put the dry yeast in and after the pan has warmed the other ingredients (this takes about 45-60 minutes), the machine bangs loudly three times to dispense all the yeast into the pan. I was startled the first time it happened and am not sure I'd make bread during the night (for morning eating) with this noise.The cycle digital readout is a bit small and not very intuitive, but works fine once you get the hang of it.Otherwise it's a great machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Breadmaker","review":"I have made 5-6 loaves so far, French and Wheat, and they've all come out perfect. I like that the recepies list some of the ingredients by weight as well as volume, I think this is more accurate.The machine is very quiet. Bread comes out of the pan easily.It gets very hot on the outside during baking, too hot to touch, so you have to be careful where you put it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Bread!","review":"I bought this bread maker before Christmas and have made basic white, sandwich, and whole wheat breads in sizes medium and extra large on both regular and rapid bake cycles. Not one failure! In fact, I started a loaf tonight and then discovered that I would be out when it was scheduled to be finished. When I got home about an hour after it was done, the house smelled wonderful and the bread was just fine - it tasted great with dinner! My only problem is that the bread is simply too good and we eat too much of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE MACHINE!!! Couldn't live without it.","review":"This was my first breadmachine and it couldn't have made breadmaking any easier! It does all its own heating/coolings, etc so you don't have to worry what temperature the water should be. It drops in the yeast from the top when it's ready so you don't have to balance anything or precisely stack it. Child's play! The only thing I wished it had would be a longer timer option (13 hours max)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Bread","review":"This machine is NOT a product I would recommend. I have used another brand machine for years, however this year the kneading pin was tossed out hence a replacement was in order.After reading about the various models, I selected Panasonic. What's NOT to like, well here goes: the recipe measurements are inaccurate, the machine lacks a window to check on progress, the machine has consistently produced unbaked, half-baked and under baked bread. On-line recommendations have been to 'peek' at various times of the cycle to observe progress but this 'peeking' shouldn't be necessary. Either the machine works or it doesn't. In my opinion this machine does not warrent a place in my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - At First","review":"Superior bread maker. For about 2 years. Then... the paddle and shaft ceased up and good luck finding anyone with parts. Even the Parts Ordering page on Panasonic's web site is screwed up.

Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I bought the Panasonic SD-YD250 from an Amazon distributor, Zeemo Digital. I used it 4 times. On the 5th time I plugged it in, and instead of the timer reading 0:00 it reads 4:00 and none of the Control Panel-display functions work - except START/STOP. I called Panasonic and am furious. Because it is over one month they will not replace it...I have to ship it to their authorized service person somewhere in OHIO!!! I will NEVER BUY PANASONIC AGAIN - to not replace something or give money back when it is in pristine condition and the control panel failed---OUTRAGEOUS this product is JUNK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I bought one of these for my mother a few decades ago and she loved it for years. She took it with her on vacation! I recently got her a new one and it worked fine for a few weeks. When it stopped making good bread she called Panasonic customer service and had a miserable time. Eventually, she called all of the Panasonic certified repair shops in the US only to find out that none of them repair bread machines. Finally, we send it back to the Amazon merchant we bought it from. We tried again and bought another directly from Amazon. That one never even made one decent loaf. Back it goes.This has been a very disappointing experience not only because we had one of these machines for years of fine bread making but also because Panasonic had such bad customer service. We are now looking into other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recomended","review":"I love homemade bread. I have been using SD-YD250 for over a year now, I make two to three breads every week. This machine is absolutely awesome. The timer function is great. All you have to do is put the ingredients and take the bread out when ready. Also great for making Pizza dough at home or using it for cake/doughnut etc. Super quality. Very little maintenance required. I would recommend getting an electronic scale to measure the ingredients rather than the measurement cup; for more accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent- not durable","review":"I bought this to replace a Breadman that is no longer made. I liked that machine (I had two of them) but the breadpan eventually leaks and you can't get a replacement for less than the cost of a whole new machine. That's why I chose this Panasonic machine- based mainly on reviews of this page. My first few loaves were not good, so I had to refine my old habits from the Breadman. Subsequent loaves were usually acceptable, but after a year and a half the motor won't knead the dough fully. The motor sounds (and smells) like it's malfunctioning. My last three loaves were disasters. For the money- this is not a durable and acceptable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a darn fine breadmaker!","review":"I make mostly whole grain breads and had a Mitsubishi bread maker for about 18 years.

I am very pleased with my purchase!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 15 uses, no customer service","review":"The kneading blade broke after 15 uses. When i contacted Panasonic for a replacement, they referred me to a \\"service center\\" instead of sending me a new blade.

You must be kidding me!This is likely the last Panasonic appliance or device I will ever buy.Update: the \\"service center\\" I was referred to does not even give you the option to speak to a human.

I am using my moms old Westbend one from 1996 that still makes bread perfect. About 3 months after I purchased this one it started over cooking all my loaves, even on light, burning the bottom of the loaf. I also got the run around from the company and eventually they sent me to a local place in San Diego that works on Panasonic products, but they said they'd never worked on a bread maker. The eventually tried to fix the heating elements, which took about a month in the shop, and when I got it back it still burned the loaves. I then borrowed my moms old machine and it's still sitting on my shelf in the garage. I think Panasonic should stick with TVs and Music...stay out of the kitchen.

Makes great bread!","review":"Have had this machine for 2+ weeks and have made at least a half dozen loaves, all on the rapid bake setting with the crust set on \\"light\\". All have turned out excellent! The bread also stays fresh! So far I've tried a couple recipes that are in the instruction book, and several others from a separate bread machine cookbook purchased at the same time. The only thing I wish it had is the ability to set the crust on \\"light\\" with the whole wheat setting. I'm still thrilled with it and can't wait to experiment with making more breads! It turns out much better bread than an older, more simple one that I had in the 1990s. The loaf pops out easily, and the paddle stays with the bucket, which is easy to clean. One important thing: Read the instruction book carefully! Every question I've had has been answered in that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes very tasty bread","review":"I bought this bread maker few weeks ago and I love the bread it makes. I tried several types but I am sticking with the French bread. Yes, it takes six hours to make a bread, but the result is worth it.

The result is somewhat darker bread that is very soft inside with nice crunchy crust."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on with price","review":"I was thinking to buy this item for 107$ with free shipping, but now it's 151$, during day it's changing from 107 to 151...

The ease of putting everything in and walking away is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine","review":"This machine doesn't work as described in the directions which means my particular unit is defective or the product is badly designed. The size/darkness buttons don't function in any order after using menu, or select buttons. The inability to reset the machine without unplugging it for a long time is also a big problem, and would have been easy to add to the controls. Compared to my Regal bread machine from the mid 90s this machine is extremely buggy and hard to use. Don't purchase this unless you like to be annoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas is ruined!","review":"Thanks Amazon!

It worked great for a while on both pizza dough and regular breads, and then I couldn't get the pizza dough to work at all. When I told cust. service the heating element wasn't working, they told me the pizza dough setting doesn't use heat. Not believing them, I took it to a authorized repair shop. After waiting almost three months for it to be fixed, they said a control panel had to be replaced.Again, it worked fine at first, and now it doesn't work again. I've swapped out my flour, yeast, everything, and to no avail. I borrowed a bread maker, used the same ingredients in each, and made pizza dough at the same time. The borrowed one worked, the Panasonic did not. I'm now out of luck and will have to buy a new one, but not a Panasonic. I really want to like it since I had some good results, but I'm ready to take a sledge hammer to it every time my pizza dough doesn't work and have to come up with another plan for dinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I bought this two weeks ago and it arrived this week.

What poor engineering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beater came apart","review":"I had an old bread machine that worked great. Slap the ingredients in and always made an excellent loaf (except when I forgot the yeast one time). This one is cranky and takes a much more precise measuring which is not for me.

The first 9 were wonderful and worked just as advertised. After that, however, the automatic yeast dispenser just stopped working on all settings. So much for convenience...It doesn't matter much how well it functions if it only works for 9 loaves. I'll have to send it off for who knows how long (at my expense) or drive to a service center 105 miles away (each way) two times to drop off and pick up. Very disappointed as this hassle is just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, clean and quiet","review":"Pros:It doesn't get flour all over the kitchen like I used to do when I made bread by hand. Its as cool to operate as a slow cooker, so I can bake bread in the summertime here in the south without overloading the air conditioner. It works great with regular yeast or with the sourdough starter, and its pretty user friendly to operate. It makes the best sourdough bread I've had since I left the west coast!I wish it had:A way for me to tell it \\"knead 10 minutes and then turn yourself off\\" so I didn't have to hover over it when I'm doing the sourdough.Overall, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Christmas gift from Santa","review":"It;s faster than my previous machine and makes a nice looking loaf.

Limited warranty: need to buy another bread machine..","review":"It was very good until it worked. After 20 months it stopped working. The warranty covers only one year. We contacted Amazon and Panasonic, we should ship it to a repair center to have an estimate. The cost of the electric motor alone is approx $80, plu shipping, labor, estimate so at the end pretty close to buying a new unit. It is a shame since this is an expensive machine and there should be a better coverage/assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"burns bread and lousy instructions","review":"I was so excited to get an \\"upgraded\\" breadmachine after using Breadman machines for years. I was patient with my new Panasonic for the first 5 or 6 loaves and after calling support I still can't bake a good loaf of whole wheat or multigrain bread. I live at a high altitude so I made the changes needed. The bread was better but the crust is always burnt. I can't afford to toss it so I guess I will just use the dough cycle and bake it in the oven, which I had to do with the last loaf which came out okay after all the screwing around with it and wound up having to take it out of the bread pan and kneading it myself. I guess I added too much water which is what high altitude calls for. It was a mess. I hope this thing doesn't last a long time because I will go back to my Breadman which at least was simple to use. The instruction booklet says absolutely nothing about high altitude baking or burnt crusts. It's a piece of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"This is an amazing Bread making machine. Just put in all the required ingredients by following one of the recipes in the included book and in 4 - 6 hrs depending on the recipe you chose, you will have a tasty fresh bread.I made 3 breads with the machine so far and all of them came out prefect.The machine is quite, the only time that you can hear it, is during mixing time, but that's hardly disturbing. The next time you will remember that the machine is actually working is when you smell the bread!overall a great purchase!."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so great","review":"I have only used this twice, but this Panasonic has made two great loaves of bread and it couldn't be easier to use.In contrast, the Cuisinart that I had tried didn't produce nearly as nice bread. Annoying, the Cuisinart's paddle also stuck fast in the loaf and had to be cut out. So far, no such problems with this Panasonic.However, cosmetically, this Panasonic had two light scratches: one on the glass and one in the liner. While I didn't dock any stars (I don't care about appearances that much), I was a bit surprised to receive a cosmetically flawed product from Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Motor?","review":"It seems to me that the motor is very weak. I've baked several loaves now and every time the motor labors quite a bit until the paddle stops moving and all that is heard is the whine of the motor. The first time I just assumed that I had not put in enough water, so I added more. But since then I've measured very carefully - even switching to measuring the flour by weight instead of trusting the measuring cup. Same result. So I'm confident that my measurements are accurate and it's unlikely that the supplied recipes are all wrong (14.75 oz whole wheat flour to 1.25 cups water).By the way, the machine arrived dented, but I let it pass. However if the motor is weak then I feel really disappointed with this purchase. From my experience with motors, a motor that is held back and not allowed to rotate will have a very short life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit Breadmaker?","review":"We purchased this Panasonic SD-YD250 from Amazon.com LLC in October 2012 and were happy with the low price of $109.98 with free shipping. So far we have only used it to make bread dough for pizza a couple time. We were surprised how loudly it squeaked. This unit replaced our previous breadmaker that we'd had for about 15 years. Squeaking from that old model was minimal. The Panasonic SD-YD250 squeaking is very obtrusive and would suggest to me to be a defect.Recently I went to register the product at the Panasonic site and found that the manufacturer's label on the back of the breadmaker has NO SERIAL NUMBER. This seems very suspicious and makes me wonder whether it is a genuine Panasonic product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"great and price is right,made a little noise but was good bread,and i will be eating a lot of home baked bread lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful breadmaker","review":"Makes some wonderful and tasty bread (unlike most cheaper brands some of my friends own.)

The first loaf I made came out perfectly, as all subsequent loaves did. Our favorite so far is Raisin Egg Bread, which makes a fabulous breakfast food item (follow the egg bread recipe from the manual, but bake it with the raisin cycle and add raisins).Cleaning is also no hastle - nothing sticks to the pan, so I just wipe it with a damp paper towel - no problems!The only thing I miss is a transparent lid. But it is not a big deal - you just can take a peak by lifting it shortly.Highly recommended! For the price at Amazon, it is a bargain - you will actually save money by not buying bread at stores, but making your own trans fat & preservative-free loaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt Bread","review":"I purchased this machine with high hopes. The first few loaves turned out well. After three weeks, the loaves and the bread bucket began to get scorch marks and the bread too had black marks. I was getting nervous that this was going to cause a fire.Panasonic pre-paid to have this machine sent for repair after I used this machine for three weeks. The repair shop kept it for 10 weeks. When it was returned, they did not replace the burned bread bucket, and it was still scorched. After baking bread again, the burning was getting worse on the bread, and it looks like burnt toast on the crust. Panasonic is sending the machine back for repair again. It has been four months now, and I have only had this machine for use for three weeks. After it is repaired this time, I am going to put it up for sale on amason.com and purchase a Zorishee...or however it's spelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoke too soon","review":"I originally gave this 5 stars. It was great at first but the non-stick coating on the pan and blade started to peel off in 3-4 months. I contacted Panasonic and they said I had to purchase replacement parts because they were considered consumable. I asked if they meant because I was literally consuming the metal that was flaking off into my food? They sent me replacement parts and the same thing happened and this time I noticed in 2-3 months. I used this machine moderately to make pizza dough only - nothing baked, ever. The unit is completely unusable. Bottom line, I paid $130 for a bread maker that lasted about three months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Reliable Bread Machine Ever","review":"I've been baking bread using a bread machine for over 17 years.

I do, however weigh all my ingredients, which allows me to experiment with my own concoctions. I thought I'd miss having a window on top, but I don't.

We have never owned a bread maker, and so the five stars are not based on any sort of comparison. That said, for first time bread maker users this is quite easy to use. The instruction manual provides many excellent recipes, the French bread is our favorite, and once you learn the right proportions for each setting, you can get creative. Whole wheat and multigrain breads are definitely a little trickier to get right, but I do not believe this is an issue with this bread maker, but with making whole grain breads in general. We have begun experimenting with our favorite bread recipes, and as long as we get the moisture to flour ratio right for the size setting, this bread maker bakes wonderful loaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my bread machine","review":"I bought several bread machines before, this is the best I ever had.

The first 4 loaves came out great. However, since then the kneading paddle has begun getting loose and on occasion actually ends up baked into the bread. The bread now comes out barely risen and undercooked or even raw in the center. The loaves are simply inedible lumps that we have the destroy to get the paddle out of.We've tried many suggestions found online and in the manual to get it working properly again, most relating to the ingredients, none have worked. The machine is still under warranty, however the nearest Authorized Panasonic servicer (that will work on bread makers) is over 180 miles away.

This machine does not appear to have enough power in the motor to mix the bread. It came out with a very lumpy, less than nice loaf. It looked as though it had not mixed the ingredients thoroughly. I cannot recommend this machine as it does not produce a loaf that is worth eating. It was very dense even though we used the exact recipe which had always produced perfect results in the past. After the second failure with making bread, we packed it up and sent it back. We have used another brand of machine for years and decided that this was worth a try. It was NOT worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While It Lasted (12 uses)","review":"Did a lot of comparing before I bought the Panasonic to replace our last bread machine which lasted about ten years. Finally settled on the Panasonic because of the great reviews. What the reviews don't focus on is that there is a real weak link with this machine. At the bottom of the pan holder there is a ceramic part that holds the heating element in place. That part broke after using the machine about a dozen times and just after the machine was out of warranty. The part costs just under five dollars -problem is I've been unable to find the part. I've read that Panasonic knows this part breaks with some frequentcy so why is the part hard to find?I think if more people actually looked in the bottom of the cavity they would probably see the part was cracked or completely broken through. For this reason, I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Purchased this as a gift and wife loves it makes bread all the time. I mean all the time.

I do enjoy that but was a little surprised that it was still a little odd shaped espescially when making large loaves.I do not like the recipe book that came with it. I actually still use most of the recipes from my old machine's book. The recipes in the Panasonic book recommend weighing your ingredients for measurement so the recipes are listed that way. I don't weigh ingredients as I don't have a scale and don't really want to buy one. And I didn't like how the couple of recipes I made from the book turned out. My old recipes work great though!The other draw back from my previous machine (GoldStar) is that the cycles are all just a bit longer with the Panasonic. I have gotten used to that but still a bit disappointing.Overall a quality machine though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but comes with a surprise","review":"This is the third bread maker I've owned. I rarely bake bread in the machine, using it primarilty to save my time by making only dough. Other bread makers I've had would complete the dough process in about 1 1/2 hours. The least amount of time for the dough cycly is 2:15 which is for a basic white bread. I make multi grain which takes 3:20. To bake a large loaf of multi grain the time is near 5 hours. I find this extreme. The reason for the excessive time is that the very first cycle is a \\"rest\\" cycle of about 1 hour to stabalize the temperature of all ingredients. Maybe this is a good thing though I've made bread successfully for years without this step. Still, the results from this machine are very consistent, more so than other machines I've used. Perhaps they know something I don't, I just get impatient with the time. If you are new to bread making, this is a good quality maker that has had some thought put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy this product again.

However, the yeast dispenser would not release and let the yeast go down in the mixture. The product was brand new and defective. I spoke with the Panasonic service department 4 times in one week. However, no one has contacted me like they said they would. So obviously I am very disgusted with them. I refuse to pay for a defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN it worked the bread was delicious.","review":"So disappointed with this bread machine. I read another reviewer that said their machine made about 9 good loaves - that was about what our machine produced, too. At the cost of the machine that made the bread about $17 per loaf. From that perspective it was certainly not worth it - not even to mention the ingredients wasted in pursuit of the good loaf. I am calling around to see about the cost of repairs, but I will never again buy nor recommend one of this brand of machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Breadmaker","review":"The Panasonic SD-YD250 model is my second purchase of the same model. About 3 years ago I bought 3 brands of breadmaker. Today only the Panasonic is still in good operating condition and this is the reason I bought the same model this month to replace the other brands.

I have owned 2 Breadman machines in the past and was happy with them until they wore out. I expected this machine to produce the same quality bread and was very disappointed. The loaves from my favorite recipes came out small and hard and did not taste the same. The crust was very tough. The recipes in the book were MUCH too salty and we tried several loaves before giving up and sending it back. I've noticed from the other reviews that the people who had owned bread machines from the past (when they actually made machines that were good quality and made good bread) are all disappointed with the new machines. I agree. Why did so many companies make changes to good products and turn them into bad ones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken out of the box","review":"The yeast dispenser did not work on the first loaf. Panasonic was of no help on the phone. They blamed me and my yeast. Suggested I ruin another loaf of bread, then chase around town looking for a repair shop. Thank goodness for Amazon, I shipped it back and will let Amazon deal with Panasonic. I replaced this purchase with a Breadman. The reviews for this unit come in two varieties: people love it or they have a problem. Panasonic will not fix their problems and they end up writing a poor review. I foolishly hoped to get a working machine, but when I had a problem, I was glad I had bought it from Amazon. My daughter had a similar problem with high dollar Panasonic wide screen LCD TV.

It was not heating at all. Panasonic will not refund my money nor replace my machine. They only will repair it if I bring it to their shop -- 100 miles away.

Just follow instructions, push a few buttons and wait. We have never made bread before but now make at least 4 loaves a week. We are getting more adventurous as we go, and having no problems at all.The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is that the normal bread is not FANTASTIC.

The bread maker performed as expected. However we have noticed that, not quite a year later, the bread isn't rising. We have done everything to adjust the recipes: add more water, add more flour, add more yeast, buy new yeast, but nothing we do makes the loaf rise and bake to perfection. The result is usually small, very heavy, dense loaves of bread that don't fully cook on the inside. We aren't using rapid bake. Just the normal basic/white cycle. Very disappointing! I haven't seen an XL loaf for months even though we are using enough ingredients for an XL loaf and the correct baking cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever Breadmaker.","review":"Hello, This diffinately is the best, ever breadmaker I have owned.

Stone-Burh 100% whole wheat flour, that is made especially for bread making, is my favorite. The flavor and freshness of the bread last several days, especially if kept in the fridge. No extra gluten is needed. A small amount of white flour (about 1/2- 1 cup) can be added or substitued to get extra height and usually looks better too. Happy bread making.

First impressions are it's bigger and heaver than expected, I guess some of that relates to the 2.5lb capacity. My initial two loaves using King Arthur White Wheat Flour didn't rise near as expected. I then figured out I was using dried buttermilk instead of dried milk, and it screwed something up. My next loaf, using the proper ingredients, turned out truly amazing and airy. Best bread I've gotten except from artisan bakeries.What really makes this product better than what I can do with my Kitchenaid Mixer, quarry tiled oven, and a loaf pan is the timer and yeast dispenser. I can set the bread maker to have a piping hot loaf ready when I wake up or just in time for dinner.

'Monza (Rauf und Runter)' is a sort-of-reprise of the first track that winds up sounding almost exactly like 'After Eight' from the 'NEU! 75' album. The rest of the tracks are just good ambient synth-pop that at times reminds me of Mouse On Mars and even Herbie Hancock.Overall, it's a very groovy album.

My choices were either buy a new receiver for several hundred dollars, or buy a TOSlink switch to manually switch over my sources. While the former would be more convenient, I feel the savings of several hundred dollars makes up for having to set a switch manually.This product works excellent, my only gripe with it is the placement of the inputs; I wish they were all in the back so the switch could be neatly setup.

Unfortunately,it ripped within a month. This ball is not durable enough to sustain pressure and weight of typically developing students. Also, as a warning, the outer lining, whatever it is, left markings/residue on my wooden floor (in the pattern of the rings around it) which took my several attempts and different cleaners to get off...not worth it.

Overall though, it was a good buy. Most of the pieces were fresh and it brought back some memories and that to me is what really made this a great value.

Looking at the special effects and acting, its a shame they wasted what they did on this poor screenplay. Anything else would have been better.Avoid, and find some other independant gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!","review":"I've always been fascinated by E. Lynn Harris' fictional work (and maybe a bit frightened since he's been writing about down-low relationships before the term was popular). What becomes of the Broken Hearted was a wonderful read. I was so engrossed in the book that I read the book in two days (I was a bit disappointed as I had nothing else to read after day 2 of my week vacation) Lynn got me emotionally involved in the book and dispelled some of my own prejudices. His writing made me realize that wanting to be loved isn't limited to a sex or sexuality. He also sends the message that facing adversity doesn't define you but is only a small part of you. I'm glad he didn't end his \\"journey\\" and allowed the love and support of friends and family to help him navigate through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book--but where's the author?","review":"I've read all of Mr. Harris' books at least twice, and this one I enjoyed as much as the others...but that was like two years ago! Can someone tell me what's going on with E. Lynn Harris. Has he made so much money off of us that he's quit writing altogether? His new book, \\"The Greatest Pretender,\\" has been delayed I don't know how many times, and forget about that anthology of his, \\"love is stronger than pride.\\" I ordered that thing two years ago and it's still not out! If Harris has given up on us, well, maybe we should give up on him; which is a shame, because I love his books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know He Needs His Privacy But Dayum!!!","review":"I love E. Lynn Harris as an author and I must say his memoir was good, but it wasn't personal enough for me.Must of us already know that he is..... and I am sure that it was difficult coming to terms with that, but hey I don't' care, I still got love for him and I am sure plenty other people do too. I know there was more drama in his life than what was in that book. I am a little bit disappointed. I guess I am just going to have to wait for his next novel to get drama.Later!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Readers looking for the opportunity to get an inside look at Harris' life will probably end up disappointed. As the creator of such saucy and intriguing tales one would imagine the same from his memoirs. Instead it is a prolonged tale of a really depressed and confused person. I guess this credits Harris' creativity as a writer and shows that his novels are not just retales of his life. I think that I kept reading this because I was waiting for it to get interesting...but it didn't. In any case kudos to Harris for putting it all (or most of it) out there in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found myself bored with this book.

I know it is his life story and all, but I think it could have been told a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay to a point","review":"I've never liked any of E.Lynn Harris's books but was convinced to check this one out because it's a biography. The story of Harris's childhood is genuinely heartbreaking (the Easter Sunday scene made me furious) but the rest is just dull. He jumps over too much. Since only 1/3rd of the book is engaging it's not something I'd tell a friend to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"I am a gay man, and it can't get more boring to hear another gay whine about how hard it is to be gay in this society.I've read many great autobiographies, by Piri Thomes, Nathan McCall, Esmeralda Santiago, Reinaldo Arenas to name a few.This book was the Lamest biography I've ever read.This whining drama queen made me wanna throw all his books away.BUT, I think this is good for straight people to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SERVICE!!!!!","review":"I received my book in great condition and I got it quicker then I expected being that I live in California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The contents in the book was very good. However, he kept going back and forth to the dates that events happened. The dates weren't in order and it was so confusing. But overall, I enjoyed it. This is the book to read.

It may help you to understand why he writes the types of books he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine Whine Whine","review":"I can not believe how ungrateful and sorry for himself E Lynne Harris is.

What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris should stick to the creative side of writing","review":"I am an avid E. Lynn Harris fan but I was not impressed by this biography. He leaves out too much detail. The only thing I really got out of it was that his step father Ben was a main source behind his homosexuality. Calling him all kinds of names such as sissy, I think that scarred him for life. That type of verbal abuse usually does. Although I don't encourage homosexuality, Harris' books do make me think and now I'm more understanding to people who are homosexual or bisexual. I've read all of Harris' books and this is the worse one. I think he should have put a little more personal info into it. Just because you're a great writer doesn't always mean you can do a biography. Some people are just better at creating things than they are with telling a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This memoir is a must read.

Hamiltons book reads like a novel and dispels a number of myths surrounding the kidnapping of oil magnate Charles Urschel, the major players in the crime and J. Edgar Hoovers fledgling FBI. Turns out that the image of Machine Gun Kelly portrayed by the FBI at that time was totally off the mark. And it appears that the brains behind the legend was none other than his wife Kathryn!! You will simply marvel at the story of the victim Charles Urschel and the determined way he approached his predicament. Equally insightful is the story of the FBI and how J. Edgar Hoover manipulated the press in order to prop up his agency. Cannot not say enough good things about this book. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Machine Gun Kelly's Last Stand","review":"The telling of \\"Machine Gun Kelly's Last Stand\\" is at once fast-paced, eerie and suspenseful.

Truth really is stranger than fiction, and Hamilton fills every keystroke with tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful humor","review":"As someone who writes and enjoys humor, I've relished Bruce Cameron's columns over the years and consider him one of America's best humorists, as funny and sometimes even funnier than Dave Barry. You don't have to be a parent to appreciate \\"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter,\\" but if you are, you'll find it even funnier.

I didn't plan on buying it until I started laughing so hard it hurt! I am in the trenches with my very own 14 year-old daughter and Cameron is right on the money. I tried to interest her dad in reading it seeing as he doesn't find this stage particularly humorous. The result has been worth the price of the book a million times over. If you can laugh at this stuff, it makes it all a little better. Besides, what choice do you have?

Amazing little machine: I no longer have to wait for shots to get stored before moving to the next, it lets me take advantage of the continuous shoot mode (14 pics in 5 sec), I can now record high resolution video for up to 20 minutes in MPEG mode, and photo recall is almost instantaneous. The 2GB card is not as fast (slower interface) and much more expensive, so this card is the best compromise for speed, size, and value.Fyi - I tried the Lexar 80x cards but their Write Acceleration technology does not work for a lot of cameras (Canon, for example) and some PDAs (select HPs), rendering them average cards for most uses.

First few pages talks about how it is not designed to make it easier to hike in the Rocky Mountains NP. And it doesn't. It's obviously written by one of those guys who wanted to get paid for writing the book, but doesn't want you on his trail. You know what I am talking about if you have read a dozen or so hiking guides. This dreadful thing is a 320 page continuous paragraph. I can't even tell where the new hike ends and where a new one begins. Don't know how long the trail is or what the elevation gain/loss. There is no chart describing the mileage/elevation throughout the trail that I have found in every other Falcon guide I ever purchased. I see now that if I had read the reviews first, I would not have made this selection. Since the return postage is probably more than the book costs, I am going to just burn it, stomp on it and make sure it is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"This would have been a lot better in the regular Falcon guide format. I found the descriptions in this book rambling, lacking in any useful detail and not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn yawn","review":"I have to weigh in with the reviewer who gave this hiking guide only one star. I totally agree with his/her evaluation and description of the Dannens' book. I always buy trail books and read them at home before going off on a hiking trip. I purchased this book but it was so boring I almost fell asleep reading it. Needless to way, I won't bother to take it with me to Colorado this June."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of interesting ideas and concepts, but hard to read","review":"The ideas described in this book should be described in a much shorter and more coherent form.

But this is becoming an acceptable practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading","review":"This is Irving Wallace at his best. In this book his is a combination of John Grisham's dramatic court scene in \\"A Time to Kill\\", Sidney Sheldon's nail-biting suspense in \\"Bloodline\\" and his own narrative as in \\"The Word\\". Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Initial comments","review":"Toilet just installed. There are many versions of the Drake toilet so make sure you order the correct one. We bought the ADA height and elongated bowl at 1.6 gal flush. I thought it was 1.28 gal. Toilet flushes flawlessly. Easy to install. Base unit was manufactured in Vietnam which was a surprise and dissappointment. I don't think that was stated online.

The complete lack of ethics in this book is astounding.Magick is discussed more as a means to an end than anything else: find something you want, use magick to get it. There's a passage whereby the authors suggest inundating a car with imagery and psychic energy of crashes in order to make sure no one else buys it. Any other witch I know would see that as a negative act, not a positive one.I've been practicing for nearly eight years, and though I'm an ecclectic sort, I've never come across any other book this empty of virtue or knowledge. This is not witchcraft as I've ever seen it before, and while disagreeing paths are a wonderful thing, this book became the only one I ever returned in my long history of wicca/witch/pagan bookbuying.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"These authors use the \\"Farce\\"","review":"I spotted Gavin and Yvonne Frost's Church and School of Wicca online and thought I'd better get one of their books to read before investing the \\"tuition.\\" I have never been happier to have bought a book only to learn it was a jumble of ridiculous notions.As a practicing pagan of over 15 years, I was astounded at the lack of ethics presented by this book. Their use of \\"The Force\\" from Star Wars to describe the magic around us may be considered helpful by beginners but it is for those very beginners that I most fear. If this book were your first exposure to \\"Wicca\\", I use quotes because I don't feel this book exemplifies Wicca at all, you are likely to be a danger to both yourself and others.Please, consider Scott Cunningham or even Silver Ravenwolf as alternatives before buying anything written by the Frosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be a lot better","review":"This is not a good book for any beginner. I did not find it easy to follow. It had a lot of stories about mistakes that others had made, which is the only good thing I can say about this book. It shows that the best of us will mess up from time to time. I did not like how they kept referring back to their school over and over. If you are like me and started most of your reading with Scott Cummingham, I would say to stick with some of the books he recommends before reading this one. If you do read this book, read it with a very open mind, and don't take everything to heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying it, new or used!","review":"Luckily I found it at the public library. I found the book full of short stories, some of which left me wondering if they were actually true. No technique or exercises to lead the beginner in the right direction. It's a waste of time just reading it. You're better off reading something useful like the Spiral Dance by Starhawk, To Ride a Silver Broomstick by Silver Ravenwolf, or anything by Edain McCoy. I'm a newbie by the way, so I know how frustrating it is sometimes.

There are two good uses for it: a coaster or confetti."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to be Harry Potter","review":"This book was very boring, and had a lot of pointless stories about the authors in it. It also seemed to be targeted at silly teenagers who are interested in \\"Wicca\\" (quotes, because that's not really what they're interested in) only because they like to fantasize about spells that will make others do what they want.

Over the past three months I have fairly well memorized the 1500 words and phrases of level one, and will soon start level II. Mostly this has been on my commute. Two disclaimers: this is an invaluable supplement to some other course-- it will not teach you how to make a sentence in Swedish. The other is that there is no effort to make this entertaining, so those that expect an enging story or song might be dissappointed.

It holds absolutely NOTHING. I think it would only be suitable for a child to use who only carries a lip gloss and truly nothing else. Leather is nice, but the zippered pockets are terribly constructed and very fragile; I carry a small wallet and keys and every seam was bursting to the point where I felt I had no choice other than to stop using it.

Of course I expected something like King Arthur or Journey to the Center (or Centre, to respect his British origin !)of the Earth, and although it was a less known work, it is as good as the most famous ones. It\`s also his most \\"80\`s\\" work, similar in many things to the others made during the 70\`s, but different in many ways that I simply can\`t explain, and what makes a Wakeman, a real Wakeman, always in his style but never repetitive. The only regret is to have listened the album and have never bought that. Chaka Khan and Jon Anderson are also very happy in their appearences on the album.

However, it is not a very basic explanation, and contains references to places, people, and ideas with which readers may not be familiar, unless they have already had previous Bible review. It might be hard to use this as one's only source, but should definitely be considered because of its content. It contains maps and discussion questions to help the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average, with far too many political digressions","review":"For the most part, this book is competent and easy to understand. However, Harris seems to enjoy picking on politically sensitive parts of the Bible and injecting political rather than religious interpretations. He strays from his own purpose and that completely undercuts any of his credibility has an ubiased scholar. For example, after his summary of the section of Romans that calls homosexuality unnatural and quite definitely a sin, he injects a paragraph about the theory that homosexuality is not a choice, but something that is genetic or formed in early childhood. That's nice, but it has absolutely nothing to do with interpreting the Bible has it's written there. He does something similar in the passage about Sodom and Gemorrah. Ah well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author wants to debunk the Bible","review":"We used this book in our \\"Understanding the Bible\\" course and I just could not believe what I was reading in this book.Harris is apparently determined to discredit everything in the Bible that he can. Throughout the book, he would explain some stuff then say, \\"oh, by the way, 'recent scholarship' has shown that most of the stuff here is false/inaccurate/biased.\\"And I just got so tired of it. I hate the fact that the author does not once admit his bias. (He is obviously biased against believing anything in the Bible.) I agree with another reviewer that this sort of \\"liberal\\" book on the Bible can be dangerous to a new or uneducated believer. But it can be an interesting to those who wonder what an unbelieving mind can come up with.The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

I found that De La Valdene made a good case for hunting, and I found his conservation-minded views to be very enlightening.

But the one dearest to me is the Colette who wrote so lovingly and voluptuously of her early years. In \\"My Mother's House\\" and \\"Sido\\" Colette writes about her family, her childhood in the country, and the creatures - human and otherwise - which informed those years.In her writing about these years, Colette describes the inner life of children, country life, and her parents and their odd, affectionate and often difficult relationship with each other and with their children. We have the sense of lives tied to the earth and the turn of seasons, particularly through loving descriptions of her mother, Sido.These two memoirs are not about \\"not much\\" as one reviewer puts it, they're about the sensuality of life, about enduring bonds of love and of blood, and about the education of a writer. Perfectly gorgeous work, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely writing about not much","review":"France seems to produce more than its share of wonderful stylists who don't have much to say (Georges Simenon also comes to mind). This is a lovely, cozy read, but I'd sure like to know what the other reviewer found that is especially about women or directed toward women. I find what Janet Flanner said about Colette much more to the point, something to the effect that there was hardly a tree in French literature until Colette came along. What she does--and does supremely well--is describe flowers, insects, trees, whole gardens beautifully and precisely. For this reader that's quite enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"This worked really well. I got this book about two weeks ago and I've lost 8 lbs. so far.

We started with the colors, then words and most recently we bought this book for ABC's. My son loves them all. They are very sturdy and even easy to clean should something get on them. I also like that these books are thorough and often feature unique things. For instance, this book has some words in it that aren't in other ABC books I have- thus I can teach him new words. The colors book even includes all of the basic rainbow colors but also has grey, white, black, etc. This will be a series that I will recommend to friends and also buy as a gift. I am so glad that a friend introduced us to this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite with our children when they were infants & toddlers.","review":"We received this as a gift from a friend who was an early childhood educator.

Our daughter would crawl to this pook and pour over each and every page--a very inviting book for an infant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Prototype But Not Ready For the Showroom","review":"If you like collecting novelties or interesting historical artifacts, this may prove to be one.

Sorry, but it is hard to NOT bend notes and thus the sound \\"pallete\\" becomes very un-chromatic. It's good for honking but too much honking without contrast is dull. Contrary to what you might believe, Little Walter did more than just honk. He contrasted dirty and pretty sounds with his \\"Mississippi Saxophone\\" like a jazz master. My advice: use the money to buy a chromatic harmonica, or, buy Howard Levy's video \\"New Directions for Harmonica\\" and get some basics on playing a ten-hole diatonic chromatically by using that \\"simple\\" instrument expressively and imaginatively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaia pra poucos","review":"S�� mesmos os gaitistas avanados conseguem tirar todo o potencial dessa gaita.

The cast is nowhere as interesting as the cast from the first, and the re-casting of Thomas Daggit (I don't care how small the role was), really bothered me. It has, of course, Christopher Walken at his over-the-top best, but even that doesn't save this loosely-plotted movie.

Christopher Walken never disappoints and Russell Wong is a favorite. He and Jennifer Beals looked good together. I'm guessing this will be another cult classic. I wish Russell could be in the next chapter, however, because I never tire of looking at that beautiful man."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happened?!","review":"Jennifer Beals stars as Valerie Rosales, a young woman who encounters a man named Danyael, played by Russell Wong, after he falls from the sky and hits her car. Danyael and Valerie get their freak on and she suddenly gets pregnant. This brings back Chris Walken, Gabriel from hell and he tries to stop this baby from being born. The boy is the Nephilim, half angel, half human who will stop the angel war. There's other things but I dont want to explain because it might confuse you even more. Walken is still Walken and he has little to do here. Beals is too constipated in her role. Wong needs to speak up more and learn to act and Brittany Murphy as Izzy and Eric Roberts as the angel Michael are wasted in small roles. Tries too hard and turns way too sour. Where the hell is Jesus? You had Lucifer in the first one (A very good Viggo Mortensen) but they never bring Jesus in. why not?

The bad news about The Craphecy II is that his talent is wasted. The film is just exactly like the original. That's it. Does it get increasingly tiresome to see a plot where the bad guy searches for something that will end life as we know it and dies in the end, failing to accomplish what he set out for? How many such movies are there? Ah, Jennifer Beals...the fraud from Flashdance.

The Prophecy was an interesting film and one of the most interesting scenes was of course, the climax of the film. In the final scene, the devil eats the heart of Christopher Walken's character and drags him to hell. Let me repeat that, he eats his heart. So how in the hell (and pardon the pun) is it even remotely possible that Christopher Walken is back for the sequel?

It's apparent that the line-up differs from the norm, comprising initially reeds and strings. The violins were shed by late 1937, after which a trumpet was added on occasions. It is true that gave the band its distinctive sound, but it also reduced the tonal variety available. That enabled the leader's piano to be featured prominently, but at the cost of sounding a tad uniform. Given that limitation, these are delightful performances which have been transferred to Vocalion's usual high standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vico and the historical consciousness","review":"This book made me aware that the historical consciousness begins with the Jewish experience of a relatonship to a transcendent God who is also immanent and very involved in human events and reaches its speculative culmination with Giambattista Vico's New Science (1725), the first modern poetical philosophy of history after Augustine's City of God.

Now, aside from that the filter is fine and as described. I chose not to return it because I didn't want to waste the money on shipping, and my old filter was getting quite dirty.The filter is a hunter brand replacement, not a knock-off brand.

Wonder if anyone else had the same trouble. I bought 3 filters, one for me, one for my Dad and one for replacement supply. My Dad's does the exact same thing and is also very noisy.

Admittedly I should have expected that from Marvel, but the actual Norse legends are so much more...alive than what we get in this movie.

Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor. I just wish he should had used the helmet during the action scenes. That would have been more cool. The scenes on earth with Natalie Portman kind of drag and slowed the pace of the film. Natalie Portman (a fine actress) tweeted her acting scenes and to me was unconvincing as this revamped scientist Jane Foster (why they couldn't make her a nurse like in the comicbooks?

Thor is not supposed to remember who he is while he's on Earth (Midgard) If I remember correctly, he inhabits the body of some doctor or scientist but in the movie he knows who he is the whole time. This revolves about Norse mythology so I have no idea why they had a black actor and an asian play Nordic gods. Marvel is notorious for changing the races of characters for movies. Nick Fury gets a pass because he's black in the Ultimates, but older readers who haven't read a comic in decades would be annoyed by this. At least DC replaces a character who is white with a totally different character that is black. I know they did this to be politically correct, but could've used the black and asian actors to be Black Panther and Iron Fist, respectively. This movie doesn't beat the Iron Man franchise.

Branagh's adaptation of the Norse legend is captivating. I don't usually think much of super hero movies as I tend to think of them as more suited for children's stories, or comic book material (and I do love comics), but this movie exceeded my expectations in almost every way.

The movie could have done without so many comedic jabs, however the fight scenes make up for the movies slow part."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hammer of Thor!","review":"I was glad to see the creators and the director Kenneth Branagh decided to drop Thor's secret identity. The entire Doctor Don Blake as Thor gimmick would have been too much for audiences. The modern version has Odin (Thor's dad, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins) casting out Thor to Earth. His brother Loki has other plans to take over the kingdom called Asguard. If you can suspend your disbelief in such a concept, you'll enjoy this take of the character. Thor was a take on the mytholgical character in Marvel comics style. Without giving anything away; the villian at the end of the film called the Destroyer, made this movie worth watching. I liked the fact that the producers decided to keep Jack Kirby's design of the character. In fact, all of Jack's designs inpired this film. If your a comic book fan, this movie is a must buy. It's a movie I'd gladly see again. It has enough depth of character to draw viewers in, that aren't comic fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thor a great movie!","review":"At first I was not sure what to expect. My ten year old son wanted to watch it so I decided to cave in on a school night. As it turned out I loved it!

First of all, I am a mythology buff, so seeing all of these characters was fantastic. And Anthony Hopkins was one of the best parts. No one else could play Odin to the hilt that he did, cultivating that delicate father-son relationship between both sons, yet being disciplinary when disobedience called for it. While I had never heard of Chris Hemsworth before this, I have to say he did a stunning job balancing the hot-headed warrior who only wanted his way, much like a little child, and the semi-human, with no special powers, who cares for Jane and all of Earth, and even the Jotnar after a while. I had seen Natalie Portman in Star Wars: Phantom Menace when she was much younger, but she hadn't changed a bit. She still pretty much was that capable leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pretty Good Comic Book Film!\\"","review":"Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman starin Kenneth Branagh's 2011 action film based on the comics.A arrogant warrior is banished to Earth and redeems himselftrying to save the universe.

The special effects are really neat, but the storyline is pretty much non-existent. Thor is a cocky prince, smarts off to his dad, loses power and sent to earth. Meets girl, they fall in love after two minutes, then it's the final battle. There should have been more. Just seemed way too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best superhero movie so far","review":"I agree with all the praise everyone has already heaped on this movie. it is the best. I'm an old fanboy and I couldn't wipe the silly grin off my face for the whole movie. All I'll add is if you have the chance to see this in 3D at an IMAX, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thor - Another Gem in the Marvel Series","review":"Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is outstanding. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, good special effects","review":"Should have been a much longer movie so that the changes in the lead characters could have been more believable. The plot is as old as the hills, and the overall acting was not the best. Still, the action scenes were very well done, and the visuals are striking. Great movie for a rainy weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENTAL READY? BE CAREFUL","review":"FIRST OFF, I loved the movie. While purists will be in dismay with how Thor and Asgard are portrayed, how the story is interpreted for today's audience and incorporating Thor in a \\"scientific\\" way in order to put him in the modern Marvel movies I felt was creative. HOWEVER, THE BLURAY QUALITY leaves a LOT to be desired on the RENTAL READY version at least. There are NO visible scratches on my disc but three times the disc would skip, stop, and go bubbly all over the place. If I put the machine on SLOW forward I could at least see what parts I was missing, but no sound obviously. I don't know for certain if its a problem with my machine or with the disc--so if you haven't had any problems, let me know please and I can change the review. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Marvel!","review":"Thor was a good film with great special effects. Some parts of the film were underdeveloped at times and the earth scenes with thor less gelling and believable than when he was on Asgard. Most of Thors stay was on his home planet of Asgard and a bit on the Ice-giants planet. The acting was pretty good, the story was well executed but the love scene between Natalie Portman and Chris Helmsworth was pretty forgettable. Overall I enjoyed this film and it was fun! Cant wait to see what they do with Thor 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"has potential, but over dramatic silliness prevails","review":"Thor has such great potential, but this movie strains so hard to be so amazing it gives itself a stroke. The acting is ok, but the story is so simple MST3K will have a go at this one day. EFX cannot replace a well rounded story. The story has structure, but tries too hard to make itself great. I am tired of the look of modern movies being determined by average crap concept artist who use photoshop and one trick lighting techniques. Look to the real world for inspiration, it is far more amazing than all the garbage, backlit, brown and teal concept art you are basing your work on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thor is a magical adventure in your Blu ray player","review":"Thor is a brilliantly directed movie and it is also visually appealing.

The action was pretty good but it really needed more story. The plot was so thin you could read the paper through it. This is clearly just a vehicle leading up to \\"THE AVENGERS\\". Oh, be sure to watch the trailer at the end of the credits. It honestly was the best part.This gets 2 stars ONLY because, well, it IS the God of Thunder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thor rocks!","review":"I always thought it impossible to make a good movie out of Thor.I am not saying that it is bad material, but getting Thor to work on the big screen without making him seem over the top, was never going to be easy.You have to give credit to Marvel for pulling it off. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and the story is exciting and entertaining. However, it is in the humour stakes that Thor really delivers.The film is fun and often makes you laugh.Great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This isn't going to be a long review...I just finished watching this on my Kindle Fire (Amazon had a sale on the rental for $1.99) and I loved it!

It's really prediable and sort of boring. Besides thor and his father, there is no chemistry in anyone relationship. The movie started out pretty good, but after he was sent down to earth we found out that Thor and Portman's character had zero chemisrty and the brother twist was revealed, it got really boring. Natalie Portman is a sure way to dull up your movie. ZZZZZ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad 3D, good movie","review":"The 3D effects are basically non-existent. Very dark with glasses, no pop-outs. Blu-ray version is fine(2D). The movie was not originally shot in 3D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline awful","review":"I only give it two stars because I like the genre, but this thing is pretty sorry. The plot line is completely predictable and phoned in. I mean, what's with Marvel and all this \\"magic ice\\" and \\"super energy source\\" stuff ? It's such a lame crutch and cliche. Can't they think of anything else ? The action sequences were either completely over the top and blurry (Ice Giant fight), or totally silly and uninteresting (Earth fight). The climax was so confusing and ham-fisted, I just gave up. Like most recent cinematic offerings, this movie offers zero suspense, mystery, or intrigue. The idea that Thor was longing for Portman's character, at the end, was ridiculous. The movie developed zero foundation for such a longing. Overall, one of the worst superhero flicks I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of CGI, Poor Acting and Script","review":"I had expectations low enough that it took seeing a 4-star rating on Amazon to decide to watch Thor. Mistake.It's tough for any movie to recover when the hero and title character is an unsympathetic lightweight. And when his love interest is supposed to be a passionate scientist, but she's played to look like a high school junior who's moderately excited by an undefined class project, the movie's probably gone.Good special effects and sets, a C- script, a good-looking and well-shot setting somewhere in the American Southwest, and you have your basic 2-star fantasy flick luring people in with over-generous reviews.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a Hallmark Pilot","review":"Poor put upon Odin (Anthony Hopkins) King of Asgard, must now pass the throne to one of his two sons, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), or Loki (Tom Hiddleston).

I never saw it at the theater-thought it would be stupid. A friend told me it was good so I rented it from Amazon Instant Video. I love, love, love it!

This movie came across as much better than I had expected.

Excellent, very entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic, Entertaining, and Humorous","review":"Thor surprised me because I was expecting Captain America to be the more entertaining superhero movie of the two releases in 2011 by Marvel. Not only did it keep my attention for the entire length of the film with good special effects, great acting (Natalie, Anthony, Chris, and Tom), and decent superhero story, but there were several funny moments that make it unique. A couple examples without giving anything away but to look out for are the multiple car incidents and the coffee cup scene. I'm a big fan of Marvel comics so I can be critical of the translation to movies, but this movie was done with justice. As a result, I have added Thor to my elite DVD collection. I look forward to Thor 2 and the Avengers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Produced","review":"This is one of the well produced super hero movies of all times. They have finally accepted and inputted in the plot that Thor is not a God but an Alien which Earth links assumed that he is a God! Same old Ancient Alien Theory is applied here. This is a great movie, lots of special effects and a wonderful story. I have been collecting comic books and super hero movies since childhood. I only collect top DC and Marvel material (no cheesy brand). This story surely got my attention and I truly enjoyed it. You will like it because it made sense of Thor's past, present and future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this movie.","review":"Iron Man movies peaked my interest in these Marvel based comics turned movies.

The plot resembled prince and the pauper except with magic hammers, ice monsters and enchanted robots. However i think they really could have done better with the romance part, there in love for about twenty minutes. The acting was exceptional and plot always kept you on your toes (SPOIL ALERT!) Including the part where Loki fakes betraying Asgard and pretends to side with the frost giants in order to gain power. But when the time comes for Odin to be killed he slays their king.

The acting is what one might expect from this type of movie. It goes for cheap laughs and chuckles not deep thoughts. It doesn't take it self too seriously and it realizes it's a super hero movie. Even so I thought the acting was decent. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor quite well. Tom Hiddleston take on Loki is refreshing and the positioning of him as a somewhat tragic figure is inspired.Kenneth Branagh does a great job of making this a family type story out of Shakespeare. Granted it is not Shakespeare but one can see where he gets his inspiration.

That \\"Bifrost Bridge,\\" for example, might have looked awesome before anyone ever played Myst, but looks a bit steampunk by today's standards, and the rest of Asgard rises to the same unimpressive standard. (That assassin-bot was pretty cool, though.) Acting? Well, technically, I suppose that's what you'd call it. Thor and Loki both came across as shallow, childish, and mercurial. In fact, among the Aesir at least, the only one who really interested me was Heimdall. Given such weak central characters, even very good work in the supporting roles (and there was some) couldn't save this.Branagh's done a fair job with Shakespeare's work.

There was some good action and special effects but the movie was very predictable. The acting was average to poor even for Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman so you know the director was at fault there. The military handling was very cheesy and not done well. The ending was not so good and setup for a sequel obviously. At best this movie might rate a 5 out of 10, AT BEST, and certainly isn't better than the X-Men series or even Iron Man for that matter.

There was a lot to like about this movie. I thought the relationships were a strong point, as were the characters themselves. Tom Hiddleston had a tough role as Loki, but he managed to make the villain sympathetic and there was a nice mix of love and jealousy between him and Thor. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) added a lot of humor and it was nice to see a female friendship showcased in a superhero film.Sometimes the scenes in New Mexico dragged a little, but not terribly.

A well told story, with plenty of nice action pieces, special effects and good pacing, this is a worthwhile addition to your super hero collection, and the 3D really shines.3D Review: The foreground pops clearly from the mid and background, resulting in a clear, impossible to miss 3D effect throughout most of the movie.

I loved everything about Thor, the movie was excellent from beginning to end. The writing alone pulls you in and makes you care.

The movie has humor, scares, bonus characters, tie ins with other movies, and an overall compelling story line.

If anything there was too much action and not enough interaction. The motivations of many of the characters were never quite clear to me. Thor's change of character after spending, what, a day or two as human, was not believable, nor was his love for Jane. If they had left him mortal, say for a year or two, I might have bought it, but not such a brief time. But the action sequences mostly carry the picture as does the sound. It was all CGI but I can't make myself not like it, even though a bit of it annoyed me. Like the destruction of the Bifr?st Bridge. If this is a society with such high technology that it seems like magic, they seemed to fallen into a decadent period because they cannot repair the technology their ancestors built. That is what comes of having kings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sure a lot of people just want to see Thor shirtless..","review":".... good thing I'm not insecure.

It amazes me that the history books omit or diminish the fact that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union states and that some Union states did not outlaw slavery until AFTER the war.Who can trust the theories proposed by the author if he doesn't have sufficient grasp of the underlying issues?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book","review":"I'm just a Civil War afficionado, hardly a serious scholar, but I think the logic the author applies to the circumstances is compelling. It is incredible to me that no one has previously put forward this idea of what Lee was trying to accomplish on the third day of Gettysburg. This book deserves much, much wider circulation than it seems to have enjoyed to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Triumph for Tom Carhart","review":"Carhart has again out done himself. Dr. Carhart (PhD Princeton)has also remain faithful to his training at West Point, his research and first hand knowledge of combat acquired in Viet Nam set this story above the rest.This book is insightful in a battle that helped define America. A must read for any and all remotefully interested in these men, the battle or war. This is told by a story teller with a unique insight into people and battle.His research has been extensive on the subject. It is his greatest book to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, really weak","review":"This book is mostly supposition, theory, guesswork, not a little fantasy, and a lot of the author putting a spin on events that support his (very implausible) thesis and ignoring or misinterpreting those that do not. He clearly understands Napoleonic theory, but if he actually read the after-action reports of JEB Stuart, R. E. Lee and others, it surely isn't evident. There's simply no evidence provided to support his theories - which probably seem plausible to those who don't have much knowledge of the subject matter, or who have read a couple books on Gettysburg and think they know something. Just where Carhart is really coming from is a bit strange: on the surface he has more than enough credentials to write a solid history, but this particular work-product suggests otherwise - in fact it is just awful, dreadful, and a travesty.But for all that, you might want to keep a copy on your shelf - the bathroom shelf that is; you never know when you'll run out of Charmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Loss","review":"This is a total disappointment after reading Troy Harman's excellent book on the same subject. I had hopes of finding either support for his ideas or an interesting counter to them. Instead, I bought mishmash of half-developed ideas, silliness and writing that has nothing to do with Lee, Gettysburg or the Civil War. Price is a good indication of a book's \\"legs\\" and this one has none. Most Civil War people do not think much of this book and rate it badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book on Gettysburg yet","review":"Every once in a while, a new book appears on a Gettysburg-related topic that makes it evident that the author knows next to nothing about the subject. A few really bad ones have appeared recently - one being Paul Walker's stinker of a book about the fight at East Cavalry Field on July 3. As if that weren't enough, here now is Carhart's contribution to the scrap heap of lousy, factually incorrect and poorly written pieces of tripe about Gettysburg. Every time I've written a detailed, negative review of this book here on Amazon, the powers that be have chosen to remove it. Instead of giving yet another litany of why this book is a waste of the paper its printed on, let me refer you to this review of this book on Civil War News: http://www.civilwarnews.com/reviews/bookreviews.cfm?ID=810. It says all that needs to be said. Instead of buying this book, buy a rubber chicken - you will have something of much more value in your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, a Lee apology","review":"There really was very little new in this book. The idea that Stuart was attacking the rear of the Union army is old hat. There is better than usual documentation of this than the average tome and quite a bit more weight placed on the importance of this movement. Other than this the book is a very breif and extremely uneven survey of the careers of Lee, Stuart, and Custer.Overall, this falls completely in the camp of apologizing for Lee's failure with a bit of a twist of also apologizing for Stuart. Of course someone has to take the fall; here it is Longstreet. Even Ewell does reasonably well. The Union, except for Custer, are bumbling fools.Steer clear! Want a single book on Gettysburg get Sears. Want something on the cavalry action try Longacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give zero stars, I would","review":"This book should be listed under fiction, because that's what it is. Based on misinterpretations of and cherry-picking of some of the evidence, and intellectually dishonest because it just makes things up, this book doesn't deserve any stars. If I could give no stars, I would.Save your money. Buy yourself a happy meal. It's a better use of your money and ultimately more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than speculation","review":"Carhart's theory that Stuart's actions on July 3rd were done in coordination with Pickett's Charge is put forth without citing any credible evidence to support it.I found the claim that the four shots fired by Stuart's artillery were meant as a specific signal to Lee, to be especially ludicrous. According to Stuart's Adjutant, Major Henry B. McClellan, Stuart was unable to locate the Federal troops and ordered a gun to be fired in different directions in hopes of a Union gun returning fire and thus being able to determine their location. (...)My advice is to save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"this is one of the weakest writings about the battle of gettysburg i have read. i understand the permise but to write and publish this work is a real stretch. it reads like a not particularly well done college thesis that attempts to present the battle in a new light. very weak. almost laughable. if i was the professor i would grade this work a D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cool!","review":"This dance pad is really cool.

This is a great cd if you need to fall asleep. Kenny also sings on this cd. This is the only Concord Jazz Heritage Series cd I bought that was not all that good. The Herb Ellis and Barney Kessel ones are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's William Clarke Quantrell, NOT Charles W.","review":"For heaven's sake, the man's name was William Clarke Quantrell.

It fingers just like a baroque recorder, but I prefer the smooth design. It is a light brown color. The product info says it is in the key of F but I believe it is in C, at least it matches the sound of my baroque soprano recorders. It does clog somewhat easily but not any easier than my other recorders. It is worth every cent of $7, and really quite a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Effective","review":"This was a video that was easy for an uncoordinated person to follow. I started seeing areas start to firm up in a couple of weeks. I tried numerous other videos but found myself lost in all the dance steps or too slow to catch up. This goes at a nice slow pace but still gives you a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout in Less Than an Hour","review":"This is a great workout for women on the go or with packed schedules. Although there isn't a solid block of cardio time as is common with Tai-Bo style workouts, the cardio-strength intervals on this DVD had my heart rate going and muscles burning within the first 15 minutes. I felt stronger even after my first workout and I now look forward to mastering the harder moves (maintaining a single handed plank position while pumping a 5 Ib weight). The instructor is okay, not one of my faves, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers may claim. Lower the volume, put on your favorite tunes, count your reps (about 6 per set) and it's no big deal. And ladies, don't hate on a women who's put time and effort into her \\"jacked\\" look. Every woman has her own health and image ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I am an aerobics instructor, so I need a workout that makes me work hard. This is a good one! Hve weights handy for this video though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout but not my favourite dvd","review":"Good workout but the instructor should have done some acting classes before she shot this dvd her cueing is quite hilarious. It's hard to do this video more than once or twice max. But it is a good workout so if you can afford it then why not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the potential BUT...","review":"and that is a really BIG but...I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of the workout!! The instructor was not motivating at ALL; in fact she's incredibly monotone and I swear if I hear the words, \\"Thaaaaaat's it!\\" one more time I may scream!! After 10 minutes I wanted to put my fist through the TV...even my boyfriend noticed how often she said those words. There were times when she didn't speak at all and didn't educate about the importance of form once! I've tried many workout dvds and I can usually get through them even if the instructor is mediocre but this one just got on my last nerve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"I have really enjoyed working out with this instructor. The exercises are challenging for an intermediate beginner, and I've seen the effects of my workouts on my size 2, 125lbs, 5'2.5'' frame. I exercise on and off, and this has been a great motivator for me. The instructor is great. The exercises are great for toning abs and butt, slimming the waist, and shaping the back and legs. I really like it, and so does my body."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"It just never worked out for me. The instructor wasnt so energetic and the quick workout nearly hurt my knee.Ill just say I prefer other dvds. I gave this Dvd to my mum, she likes it so to each's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout","review":"This workout was really fun and really got my heart pumping. I enjoy how there are 3 levels of training in the video, which enables me to tailor it completely to what I can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent workout, bad instruction","review":"I usually love the DVDs from Shape, but I was really disappointed with this one. The workouts - both the cardio segments and toning segments - are fairly effective for an intermediate exerciser (although not great), but I found it very difficult to stay motivated to get all the way through the segments because of the instructor. She doesn't cue well or work both sides of the body evenly, and unfortunately her words of encouragement got on my nerves rather than got me to work harder. She also says those words of encouragement at weird times when I don't really need it and when she could be talking about something more helpful like form and technique. This is the first time I've ever found a Shape product to be less than satisfactory, but I thought that this DVD was not up to the standards of the others, and the annoying instruction overrode any of the benefits of the workouts themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Shape Bikini Body Boot Camp","review":"The actual workouts were challenging with lots of interesting variations on classic moves. I am sure they would be effective over time, if I could only get past the masculine and annoying instructor. The instructor is Dominique Hall - if you were expecting the trifecta of excellence (Lisa Wheeler, Tracy York and Michelle Dozois) you will be very disappointed. Hall's background is in bodybuilding. Her voice is so masculine and her body is \\"jacked\\" - I am not talking Justice in the Hip Hop Abs series jacked, more like the abs of a male model in Men's Health. She tries to motivate you, but does so by only saying \\"that's it\\" repeatedly. For the entire time I am doing the DVD all I can think is, \\"for the love of god, I hope I do not look like her when I am done.\\" The workouts are not as effective, and pale in comparison to the Shape Bikini Body Boot Camp Transforming and Redefining DVDs. If you want a Shape workout, go with one of those because they are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the pattern","review":"Pattern matches my dish set. They are durable and the lids stay on.

They're okay to look at and arrived undamaged but they are VERY small. The largest one is the size of a soup bowl - the other 2, even tinier. I was also not happy to learn they are made of enamel-coated steel and post a Proposition 65 Warning in California. I'm not used to this from Amazon - I should have read the description more closely."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"I could have get the different design.

Just finished Dr. Texas (#4) & am looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of excellent review ratings","review":"I loved the film and expected the book to be much better. Instead you will find that this is a story of a great guy written very badly. Unfortunately the other readers are correct in complaining about the writing style. It makes for an irritating gruelling read. Some sentences go on forever. There is a lack of reference to material and humour which makes the content somewhat dull.For ardent fans only this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are We Being Conned?","review":"I really looked forward to this book, but after about six chapters, I got tired of it and had to return it. Trying to explain what is going on in Kaufman's mind is not a task easily taken, but there are no footnotes, bibliography or even an index. There is no mention of where any of the quotes attributed to Andy are from. Because of that I couldn't trust it. Sure Zmuda's book was as much about himself as it was about Andy, but at least you had the knowledge he knew what he was talking about, and it was a heckuva lot easier to read. I felt this book was more about the author showing off than about a good bio of Andy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful writing style","review":"I read some pages of this book and couldn't continue. The author's writing style is so strange and disgusting. How can anyone stand this? I love Andy Kaufman, but I can't read this book. At least some of 5-star reviews here must be fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Circles of Truth","review":"I'm a huge Andy-phile and I just love this book. I love it so much, I've read it twice. I love it so much, I came onto this site to buy more as gifts to my friends. Along the way I stopped to read some of the reviews expecting to find that other people loved it as much as I did. Some of them, frankly, caught me off guard. This book is loving, insightful, and an attempt to interpret and understand one of the most original yet complex comics/performers of our time. There are some terrific hilarious moments too. My favorite is the one about the handcuffed Andy at the college dorm party. It's priceless. The writing here is excellent...This book is a must-have for Andy-heads who want to know more about their hero, and the best introduction for the uninitiated who want to learn more about this brilliant yet complex man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disjointed writing style--my attention span wavered","review":"I am a huge Andy Kaufman fan, and although I am learning facts about him here that I never knew before, this is an extremely annoying book to read. I believe the author tries to \\"talk\\" and \\"think\\" like Andy; yet, it comes across as juvenile, intelligence-insulting, and very hard to follow. I think he tries too hard to NOT follow a general writing style, but he fails. While I appreciate the facts contained in this book, it's rough wading through all the other junk to get to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andy Deserves a better Biography!","review":"And so this is definately the most obnoxious, stupid, insulting-to-the-reader's-intelligence, arrogant style of writing ever encountered and this Zehme person is obviously, um, like, much more concerned with some pseudo-avant garde style of writing than he is with Andy Kaufman and he conveys a contemptuous, condescending attitude towards Andy and never provides any kind of indpeth or intelligent analysis or interpretation. Andy Kaufman's brilliance and genius DEMANDS a brilliant writer, and this just is not it. Sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in the Funouse","review":"This was an entertaining bio of Andy Kaufman although I think some of what made it into this book is probably a figment of the authors imagination because I don't think even those who were closest to Kaufman really knew what was going on inside his head. Fun to read, great stuff about Kaufmans legendary bizarre work, life and habits. Kaufman was a true original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major letdown","review":"This is a major letdown -- I generally like Zehme's writing, but boy did he blow it here. So overwritten and not terribly illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry not good","review":"The writer attempts to be Kaufmanesque thoughout the story and it suffers for it. I'll bet you can't get through it! He's a gifted author but this one isn't one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Simply put... this is a really good book written by an excellent author about one funny man. Zahme succeds in getting you inside Kaufman's mind. His prior book about Sinatra was good but this one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try but reads too pretentiously","review":"I was quite excited to buy and read this book; I think Andy Kaufman is one of the comic geniuses of our time and there has always been so much unexplained about him. The author obviously shares that affection, and not just because he spent 6 years on the book. But the first half is really boring and is filled with unverifiable \\"facts,\\" and by the end I felt like I knew 10 times more about Bill Zehme than Andy Kaufman. It felt like he'd put Andy on a slide under a microscope, and when what he saw was still fuzzy, decided to fill up his book with a novel about him and Andy Kaufman. Though I'm sure he didn't mean to, the effect rang really pretentious, like he was either trying to pull a fast on the reader because he didn't have enough material, or that he thought he was Norman Mailer. I wish he was too--or at least a reporter who would say like on \\"Dragnet,\\" \\"just the facts,ma'am.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy writing style takes away from content","review":"This is a self-consciously written book; the \\"look at how smugly I write\\" style overwhelms the content throughout the first half of the book. I realize Zehme may be trying to capture and therefore write using Andy Kaufman's style of thinking, but it definitely obstructs any insights that the reader could have gained about Kaufman's personality. There are several humorous descriptions of his comedy, but overall the book is a slow, plodding read. I look forward to reading Bob Zmuda's book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put a fork in Andy, he's done.","review":"After reading the first bio (Zmuda's) and now this one, I was hoping Lost in the Funhouse would be the more focused and complete of the two works. Not so. The writing here is just as annoying as the Zmuda's book is self-centered. I came to the conclusion that maybe there isn't enough story here to fill two books. After Carrey's film, this should just about satisfy any curiousity I had about Andy's work. By then Andy's legacy will have been picked clean by those who claim to be honoring him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hope This Isn't Really the Andy I've Come to Know","review":"Took me over a month to finish reading this book. It was almost a chore. I don't know Andy personally but have been a fan from the first sighting on SNL's inaugural show through every quirky act I could catch on tv and lately catching up what I missed back then after finding it on youtube. I don't think Andy showed anybody who he really was including his own family. This book makes him look so childish and naive as to appear almost stupid. From what I do know about him his act was sheer genius. This isn't the Andy I've come to know. My puppy seems to be a critic and chewed a good part of the front cover. I shoulda bought Zmuda's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reissues are better","review":"\\"Stormy Weather\\" and \\"Gone With the Wind\\" are remastered reissues of \\"Live at the Jazzhaus\\" Vols. 1 & 2 (1965). Along with \\"The Jeep is Jumping\\" (also 1965) they constitute Webster\\"s best later work after having moved to Europe. The reissues have a much better sound than the \\"...Jazzhaus\\" volumes. The program includes many of the standard ballads associated with Webster. There is never a dull performance. Webster, like Ellington, just kept getting better with age. Webster plays with one of the leading bands in Europe at the time, the Alex Riel Trio comprised of Kenny Drew on piano, Alex Riel on drums and the amazing Nils Henning Orsted Penderson on bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to use","review":"We tried to insulate our house for the winter.

If releasing twenty year old rejected songs and leftovers from other recording sessions is your cup of tea, then dig in. But, it just is not acceptable for a legendary band like King's X to stoop to that level. The advice is for King's X fans to bury their heads in the sand and pretend like this one never happended and wait for that late career classic that the boys are capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows","review":"I've got every cd this band ever did and accidently came across BLS in the store.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"Two mysteries here: 1) why would this great band release such a motley collection of old riffs masquerading as a new album, and 2) why would anybody rave about it as they are here?? I had only to \\"sample\\" a few songs online before deciding I not only wouldn't buy this album, I wouldn't even care to download it for free! This formerly excellent band (who I have been a huge fan of since Day One) has been inexplicably avoiding writing a great album for 10 years now. Why they can't sit down and put together another \\"Gretchen goes to Nebraska\\", with its brilliant production, melodies and compositional grandeur is beyond me. Instead, of late, they've been releasing half-assed heavy-metal junk that pales in comparison to any of their first four, great, albums. Even Ty's latest solo album was better than most of King's X recent output. But this one is inexcusable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album for true King's X fans","review":"The more I listen to this album, the more I realize it is their best work in years. Manic Moonlight had a few high spots, but mostly did not come off right. Please Come Home, Mr. Bulbous really grew on me over time, but also did not shine as previous efforts had. I have allways hoped they would return to the style of Gretchen Goes to Nebraska with the hard edge of Dogman. This is surely a step in the right direction, and includes some much needed levity after Ty's good but depressing solo album. Overall, a solid effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's X weakest release to date.","review":"Cheesy lyrics, dated songs, stale performances and amaturish recording /production mark King's X latest release Black Like Sunday. The strongest tracks on this album are the title track, Working man and Two. Even these tracks are just average tracks compared to just about every other King's X album. Gone are the mind blowing harmonies, innovative forms, inspired and soulful performances. This is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat out heavy rock and roll!","review":"Just when you think you know which direction, musically, King's X is heading, they go and change it up. Not that that's a bad thing! Not at all! Black Like Sunday is ironic: it's a bit of a departure from their recent recordings, but at the same time it fits right in with everything they've ever done.Musically it's heavy, creative, fun and wild: a more light-hearted King's X than we've heard in a long time. Career King's X fans may whine, \\"it's not enough like Gretchen,\\" or \\"It's not enough like Bulbous,\\" but they're just being picky. ANY Fan of heavy-metal-grungy-rock-n-roll will have nothing to complain about here! \\"Black Like Sunday\\" is hard rock-n-roll at it's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Respect","review":"Well, well, well...Yes 5 stars! Refreshing and honest, that's the way this Kings X album makes me feel! I have been a fan for 16 years now and love every album for it's unique flavor. I can understand how some people may not appreciate this album because it does go back to a time before the X and has a more 80's sound, but this is a wonderful work and shows good roots of the band. In a time when most music on the scene is bland and dull this is honest and just plain fun. KX has always been and always will be one of my beloved band.

I'm as big a Kings X fan as anyone but this album is a low point for them. I remember when this first came out and it was billed as old pre-Kings X songs redone. I got very excited because I assumed (sadly mistakenly so) that it would have a sound like the earliest Kings X albums. I realize now that those expectations were off the mark and rightly so I believe. I'll take my lumps in that regards. What really disappoints me most about this album is that it's the least Kings X \\"sounding\\" album in their entire catalogue. With Doug handling the lead vocal chores, If I didn't know any better, I'd almost think this was some kind of solo project, not Kings X. All in all, it's the one Kings X studio release that I may never listen to again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack's U","review":"1 1/2Watching the band's material decline post-Dogman was like watching said dog hobble into a new decade, decades late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment....","review":"For me this was a much anticipated album and after hearing the title track I was a little curious but also cognizant of the fact that initial singles usually don't represent the best of a release. Well, this one in fact does. I am a HUGE KX fan and usually will take some departure in sound in stride (Bulbous grew on me big time). However, it's quite obvious that this collage of memorabilia of the band's early days proves that they covered a lot of pop tunes in the early 80's. I would describe this essentially as a rehash of songs from that era with the blazing digital dexterity of Ty Tabor sprinkled throughout. To me that's the only saving grace, unfortunately. As much as I appreciate their roots I can't say that this is worth having.

Back are some of the KX that we all loved, a more positive energetic sounding KX. KX for the last couple of albums has been pretty dark and droning, i love the records but you gotta admit. I just hope to god the next KX album is an uplifting barrage of kick*** harmonies, whaling gtr and of course dUg deep in it.

It would be better to list this under \\"various artists\\" instead of under Ory and Oliver's names.That said, these recordings are pretty good and convey the spirit of the British \\"trad\\" movement.

The last few years, though, have seen rougher going, with a shrinking audience in the States and younger, whiny nu-metal bands becoming all the rage. A lesser band would have given up, but Therapy? has come back EXTREMELY strong with this CD, which has all the pop-laced mayhem longtime fans have known and loved them for. \`\`Hey Satan -- You Rock,'' \`\`If It Kills Me'' and \`\`Rust,'' in particular, are as good as anything they've ever done, which is saying something. A very special band, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reactionaries Rejoice!","review":"Before I put the disc in, I was fully prepared to write a book's worth of negatives on how this Therapy? release doesn't stack up to their past stuff.

Because, as we all know, every release since Troublegum has been \\"not good enough.\\" Well, i am more than pleased to report that I have no complaints with this album. None! High Anxiety marks a return to big fat riffs, and nothing but guitar/bass/drums. No ridiculous production theatrics, no layers of studio effects, no slow songs! It's all rock and it's all good. So if you were waiting for Therapy? to return to what made them great, your 10+ year wait is officially over. For the first time in a long time, I have hope for this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good release from Therapy?","review":"This is not Therapy?'s return to form everyone has been calling it, for two reasons. First they've never released a bad album and second this one isn't better then the previous ones.This is a solid, rocking album, with great lyrics as usual, but i miss the experimentation and unusual approach of the last offers, in the end the main difference between High Anxiety and Suicide Pact/Shameless is that High Anxiety is more radio friendly, and i think this is a let down.Some songs are great, Hey Satan, Stand In Line and Rust are typical Therapy? and very good, If It Kills Me is a great song but My Voodoo Doll, Last Blast, Watch You Go and especially Nobody Here But Us all seem to be not quite above the average rock playing on the radios nowadays.I think this is a good approach for new/curious fans but not the masterpiece us, Therapy? diehard fans, been waiting for.The artwork is fine, but there are no printed lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Company!","review":"Bought a lightbulb for my lamp and it came within days of me buying the item.

Rumor has it that a new British edition will be coming out soon -- hopefully, it will contain the footage that is missing from this edition, and will come from a cleaner print (with fewer awkward splices). Adam Faith may have had virtually all his hit singles sugar coated with orchestral strings--thereby making them more middle-of-the-road pop than rock--but in \\"Made You,\\" which he sings in this film, proved that he could also rock out.

I literally stopped when I got to Tawny Roberts' photos; she stares out from the page with such wide-eyed clarity that you can't help but stare back. Her eyes and expression spoke volumes, which is exactly what the photographer hoped to capture."},{"rating":"2","title":"original idea","review":"Pornstars as people thats a first.

Extremely well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but missed an interesting aspect or two","review":"All in all, this is good book for anyone interested in the relationship between Europe and the USA, and how each views the world and their role in it. Kagan shows how, to no surprise, both Europe and the USA use the tools available to them to their own advantage. Because those tools differ, their approaches to the world differ - and as the difference in their tools increases, so do their approaches.One thing it would have been nice for Kagan to discuss is how Britain appears to differ significantly from the other large European countries. Britian sides with the USA much more often than Germany or France, and isn't shy about it. This will put Britian in a position where it will have to choose between the two at some point. Discussing how this impacts Britian, the overall EU, and Britian's role in the EU, would be an interesting topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order","review":"Blatant distortion, historically ignorant, and inaccurate.

It's basically a group og neoconservates and thinks strictly in good-bad terms. It wants a new cold war, but this time without Europe, because they think the US is almighty and we should all be ruled by the US through their values. This time they see China as a great danger and try in all ways feed the \\"China threat\\" theory. This view is a danger to the world and worldpeace, it's very stupid.

Though the author's overemphasis on wielding force misses the point - our greatest current challenge is terrorism, and the war against terrorism cannot be won by military means alone. Police work, cooperation with other nations (ironically Europeans have had much more experience than the US in fighting terrorism and ensuring security at home), and the encouragement of economic and political development are essential.In this, as in most matters, the reality is that the US can lead, but it cannot dominate.

His notions about the \\"traditional\\" view of Americans is so far from the truth that the remainder of the book seemed hardly worth reading. Americans have been introspective and isolationist for most of American history. Kagan may not like that fact and there may be valid arguments for why the Washingtonian viewpoint does not work well in reality. But, that's a far different matter than rewriting American history and asserting that Americans believe fervently in intervention and meddling in the affairs of other nations. Kagan may wish everyone was as adventerous in practice as he is in theory, but wishing does not make it so."},{"rating":"1","title":"ludicrous","review":"This book is very poor, its content is often unlogic and the conclusions Robert Kagan draws are absurd.I'd not buy this book if I'd have to decide once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Ted Rushton","review":"I haven't read the book (yet), but I have an issue with one of the reviews.

This set is good, but not my favorite. I liked the bookshelf best, as it fits perfectly into any corner of your dollhouse. The little lamp and table are also small and since they're not the traditionally square tables that Fisher Price used to put out for the Loving Family doullhouses (dollhomes?), it also fits into small little nooks and crannies. Other than that, the little shelving unit was almost never used when we were decorating the house and the oversize recliner was sometimes difficult to fit into one of the smaller rooms.It's all extremely durable, as usual and my sister enjoys it.

I am not fluent in any language other than my native English. I have no familiarity with any of the literature cited in this work. As such, I have zero ability to analyze the veracity of Sitchin's claims, which he apparently advances with the utmost sincerity.That said, it's a fun read. Additionally, I do not consider it all that far fetched that the ancient stories, even the fantastic ones, are in fact recollections of actual past events otherwise long forgotten. So if you're prepared to suspend your disbelief, the whole series of books is a fun ride involving extraterrestrials, genetic engineering, interplanetary warfare, and other things, all presented as logical conclusions of a serious and dedicated study of myth, legend, and archaeology."},{"rating":"2","title":"History at its best","review":"History comes alive with Sitchin.

To me, that's the most important aspect of any investigative research: being able to draw pertinent conclusions that help answer major mysteries. Whether a reader is able to accept those deductions and settle his mind is up to him, but Sitchin certainly did his part, with integrity and courage. My only problem is the size of the books! They should not look like pulp fiction novels. This diminishes the importance of their content."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPER READ FOR THOSE WITH OPEN MINDS","review":"Like ALL of his books, this one too is amazing, compelling, persuasive, enlightening, builds rationally and logically to each of its points BUT (there's alway a \\"but\\")is a bit difficult to read.

It is in fact a cobbling-together of some fairly half-witted 1930s science-fiction plots. To anyone with even a smattering of real scientific or archeological knowledge it is simply beneath criticism, if not beneath a proper contempt. It makes von Daniken look like a disciplined, serious researcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armegeddon Prequel","review":"Sumerian scholar Zechariah Sitchen has opened up early human history with his series created by a blend of Middle-eastern mythology and Biblical reference. In this volume he deals with the roots of war, connecting it to sibling rivalry that repeats itself over many generations and cultures, even to this day. We meet,in detail, the characters of ancient myths, giving flesh to history of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Bible lands and even Mezo-America. He implies that war will never resolve old wrongs and that only forgiveness can hope to bring peace. A brilliant, readable, open-minded work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOCUMENTATION PLEASE","review":"Do to a misguided recommendation I wasted my money on several of Sitchin's books. At least they're cheap. His entire argument is a house of cards. The appalling thing is that he didn't even bother to provide the source material with which he constructed it. There are no footnotes, endnotes or bibliography. You have to take his word that his translation of a text is accurate or that the text even exists. He does not provide any means of verifying his assertions. There are established ways to document these things. If he wanted to have any intellectual credibility at all, he should at least document his sources.A lot of people want really badly to believe that aliens are true and that the movie Stargate was for real, but if what you believe is true, then approach the thing with intellectual integrity and let the chips fall where they may. The truth will come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Scholar Again Opts for the Fantastic","review":"Ancient mysteries present difficult and complex problems. But not forStichin... seemingly he has all the answers! Sitchin is a scholar, alinguist, and an investigator with an unusual grasp of ancientarcheology and astronomy.

However, he fails toprove or even substantially advance his case that extraterrestrialintervention and genetic mutation planted the seeds that would sproutinto the foundation of Earth's civilizations.

I laid it out in a large room and by the next day it wasn't as bad.- The barnboard color was GREEN. It looks like moss on a barn floor. It's still usable, but it was not what was described/shown. I would have much preferred a gray or brown but green? I am just hoping it doesn't cause a color cast on the children I photograph. I have yet to use it in studio.- It's small.

In the process, I dump the marginal tracks from the CD and only keep the ones I like. Typically, I might keep only 25% of the songs. To my surprise, I could find very few tracks to dump on this Honeybus CD.This might be the best \\"best of\\" CD I have ever bought, especially when you consider it isn't really a \\"best of\\", but an \\"all of\\" collection since it includes every released song by Honeybus plus a ton of unreleased material.

It is worth it just for that song alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"unforunatley not (2) good","review":"I am from Australia so I had a chance to listen to this album alot earlier than the Americans did. Olivia Newton-John is our most famous Aussie export and it's a shame I have to put down this album,but i'm afraid it's not that good. Olivia works with some really great talent on this album which is suprising it's not better but that is only my opinion. The highlights on this album are songs perfromed with Darren Hayes from Savage Garden and the late Peter Allen,it's sad the songs with Tina Arena and Billy Thorpe weren't more exciting. I just found the songs to be really simple and the lyrics basically written,I guess Olivia was just concerned with singing duets with these people rather than the quality of the songs. The worst part is I absolutley love Olivia and think she is so beautiful and a wonderful singer,but i'm speaking as a disapointed fan. Buyers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT ALBUM","review":"Olivia is better and better, like wine.

In particular, I recommend the Peter Allen autobiographical track where she lends her voice to a very well preserved original recording of \\"Tenterfield Saddler.\\" That song captures the essence of two phenomenal Aussie artists whose voices blend just beautifully. It's in the same league with Olivia's best mid to late 70's offerings. It just doesn't get any better than hearing them acknowledge \\"cockatoo, emu, kangaroo, and jackaroo\\" in a truly gorgeous melody. \\"Love You Crazy,\\" \\"Sunburned Country,\\" and the samba rendition of \\"Physical\\" are some other high points on this terrific achievement. Hopefully the US, like Australia, will soon give this album the respect and recognition it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love you Olivia, but time to get your act together","review":"Having lived in Australia for a decade, all I can think of is this album truly lives up to the popular level of Oz rock; ie very very dull.A bunch of ordinary and some below par numbers, this is not inspiring by far. Why not an album of women's songs - by such great writers as Tori Amos, Jane Siberry and all?I had been personally waiting for a renaissance by olivia since the mid-80s, so I guess maybe it's now too late to ask the Pet Shop Boys, Nick Cave or Morrissey for a number or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"neutron bomb","review":"It's very brave of Olivia to step out out from the shadow (and a large shadow it is as well) of the mighty John Travolta, and at first listen, this CD will reward the casual listener with its twee pop twitterings, and melodic inventiveness.

As a faithful Frommer's fan, I was deeply disappointed. Probably because it tried to cover too large a region, it ended up not giving decent coverage to any region.It seems to me that this book is a compilation of Frommer's already existing city and regional guides, except less complete, with one or two sketchy description of the areas in between. This is useless for anyone planning a car trip where pleasant meanderings and stops are the highlights. For example, after 26 pages on New York City, which would have been covered far better in Frommer's New York City guide, there were 3 pages on the Hudson River Valley, 3 pages on the Andironacks, one page on Niagara Falls and just a few lines over one page on the Finger Lakes area, where only Corning was named as a destination!For a car trip exploring the different states, I found the Moon series of travel guides far more helpful. I frankly can't think of what kind of trip this USA guide would be good for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful applied resource","review":"This review refers to the first edition, which, aside from the dated computer programs used for analyses, discusses a variety of topics that are not typically covered in traditional regression texts.

I'm all for angst and emotion to be channeled through music but this is way too contrived. Some of these songs are utterly ridiculous. From the beginning, pop music has alway embraced lust, libidos and decadence but this band uses no artistry to address it.I was attracted to this band because of the documentary made about them. When interviewed, the band members sound well-spoken and intelligent. Therefore, the gutteral lyrics are all the more an indictment on the laziness of them not trying to produce art rather than just muttering stupid sophmoric lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Culture releases","review":"This cd offers up the goods.

I also realize that much about this subject is unknown or speculation, but still..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A continental history of medicine","review":"While anyone will admit that a complete history of medicine is a daunting task, Roy Porter manages to fall far short of his goal. The author purports to write a history of medicine but brings a distinctively European slant to the topic. He relegates American medical triumphs as eventual consequences of the medical knowledge originating in Europe. In addition he compensates for a lack of substance with a painful abundance of detail. There is a good discussion of \\"alternative\\" medicine, but the author asserts the superiority of Western Medicine and then neglects the topic. The result is a disjointed and painful read that can only appeal to diehard medical historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern take","review":"Macleish's modern rendition of the Book of Job does an adequate job of converting the serious tale to a modern almost circus like story.

It takes you through his struggle and faithfulness to God. After having a lot of land, good cattle and sheep, and a happy family, he is tested. Satan says he will curse God to his face if he doesn't have wealth, a family, or health. Satan is proved wrong. Job stays faithful to the Lord and in the end is rewarded with more than he ever started off with.I enjoyed this book. It is a accurate play in terms of the Bible, although it is not quoted, it helps you too understand the story of Job and it helps you understand what it means to be faithful to God in good times and also in bad times, for he is always there. I recommend it for anyone dealing with any problems or anyone who liked the Book of Job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microwave Oven","review":"I have bought Emerson products before.

Wyclef is the most creative force in popular music right now. He may not win as many Grammys as Lauryn (although he should get at least one or two) but his work blows hers away with its orginality, power and yes, eclefticism. I'd still love to see a Fugees reunion, but I look forward to many more years of Wyclef's solo efforts...I'm sure he is going to continue to grow and provide us with more amazing music. To sum it up, this is a must buy for any music (not just hip-hop) fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the top 5 disappointments of 2000","review":"After all of the hype, the near perfect reviews in the pop culture magazines, and based on Wyclef's previous efforts, this record should have been incredible. It really wasn't. Wyclef's heavy reliance on what some call \\"innovation\\" are simply gimmicks to make up for the cheesy rhymes and shoddy production. Wyclef tried to leave for the plane that true hip-hop innovators such as Kool Keith, Prince Paul, and Outkast exist; but he crash landed on grim candyland of cross-marketing record executives and unimaginitive, tired beats. I would urge anyone to listen to the album, either to see the sad demise of a once great MC or to have a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome, egotistical trash","review":"With the release of The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II A Book, Wyclef has once again lowered the standards of hip-hop.

This man does everything from Rock, to R&B, to Dance, to Country even, on this album, and fails to disappoint.Teaming up with Artists such as Mary J Blige, Kenny Rodgers, Whitney Houston, Earth Wind and Fire, The Rock and Youssour N'Dour (amongst others) - Wyclef's lyrics are sometimes romantic, often satirical, occasionally political but almost always poetic: on many occasions he attempts to convey a social message, however at other times he seems to be creating music for the sake of creating music.For someone who very rarely listens to R&B or Rap/Hip-Hop I was impressed by Ecleftic from which Wyclef's true colors are allowed to shine.Conclusion: This album is pure class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hip-Hop Masterpiece","review":"Wyclef has done it again.

There are perhaps four tracks worth listening to, which are or are going to be the singles. Otherwise, the skits and other songs do not even begin to compare favorably with \\"The Carnival\\" or any other mildly intellectual album in hip-hop. The album's lyrics are shallow, the beats sound like they were composed in about ten seconds, and all in all it seems like Wyclef phoned this one in to Columbia, rather than taking the time to produce something worthy of his talent. And the rendition of \\"Wish You were Here\\" is insulting; for all his shout-outs to guitar legends and his boasts about how we have to \\"peep his guitar skills,\\" it sounds like some beginning guitar student in his second lesson being shown how to use both hands at, gasp, the same time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What\\"?????","review":"I feel left out in the cold, for I cannot enjoy this ablum as so many seem to do.

It is by far the best CD I have purchased, and by a LONG shot is the best Hip Hop album out in the music industry. In many of Wyclef's songs he talks about different issues that have to do with the world today. His duet with Mary J. Blige called *911* is one of the most beautiful and touching songs I have personally heard. Wyclef's song \\"Diallo\\" is an absolutely amazing song which talks about the recent crime that happened in New York. The song \\"Diallo\\" is a protest against racism and police misconduct. It is truly a masterpiece. In fact his whole CD is a masterpiece. Wycelf Jean's CD *The Ecleftic Two Sides To A Book* is a CD that all Hip Hop fans should have, and even people who don't quite like Hip Hop... This CD may capture your interest and soul into the wonderful music of Wycelf Jean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap at its best","review":"Wyclef is simply a genius. He writes song with meaning like \\"Where Fugees At\\" and \\"Diallo\\", he writes song with emotions like in \\"911.\\" I'm tired of people rapping about sex and violence all the time. It's getting old and redundant. But then Wyclef releases an album like this and restores my faith in the rap community. I hope others follow suit and stray away from the \\"standards\\" for rap. I understand that style is supposed to be \\"gangsta,\\" but there most be more they can say. Public Enemy found a way. Anyway, this is clean rap (another refreshing moment) and good rap.

I had never heard Wyclef Jean until he collaborated with the Rock with It Doesn't Matter. I like the first 12 songs the best. Then I think he gets almost too diverse. I know I won't be very popular with this, but I thought Diallo went on too long. I laughed out loud at Red Light District and Something about Mary. Wyclef combines so many great beats with really cool lyrics. It doesn't matter was probably my most favorite song. I think, like Diallo, that Hollywood to Hollyhood went on too long.

I didn't expect much from this one because of the production on the \\"Carnival\\". I was blazed while listening to this CD for this first time and didn't advance not once on any track. The only tracks I heard before release was: \\"Thug Angel\\", \\"911\\" and \\"It doesn't Matter\\". The track with Pharoahe Monch and Kenny Rogers( couldn't vision that treo together in a million years) is one of my favorite tracks. The man is bananas on the mic, guitar and the vocals. Clef was always respected by me as a raw underground talent back in his Fugees days. I picked this up only because it was on the display stand at the checkout counter while purchasing another copy of BB-Queen by Bahamadia.

Take \\"Kenny Rogers Dub Plate\\" for instance, Kenny's version was country to the extreme, but Wyclef blended it together with Pharoahe Monch, and made it sound hip-hopish. On \\"911\\" Wyclef sings a soulful melody with Mary J. Blige, then shows more diversity on the club song \\"Perfect Gentleman\\". He ends the album with \\"Wish You Were Here\\" which shows off his singing again, as well as his great guitar playing skills. My favorite track though, is the funny, yet hip \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" which features The Rock, and again showcases Wyclefs diversity & talents. All in all it's a good album, and definatly worth adding to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"'ca ne me fait rien'","review":"'Ca ne me fait rien' (the french version of 'it doesn't matter' has to be my altime favorite song. it is great to listen to when you're feeling low. but nothing beats dancin' in front of the mirror with all that attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic","review":"Wycleff Jean brings something to hip hops table that nobody else does an eclectic flavor that no-one can rival. Every track has a unique flavor that is truly pleasing to the ears.Hip hop and non hip hop fans alike will appreciate this album.highlight tracks include a redo of Kenny Rogers the gambler, and Thug angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyclef tells it like it is!","review":"I have to give this CD 5 stars because it works on so many levels. The first is its originality. As he states numerous times in his CD, he is not your average rapper. Instead of most rap albums that degrade women, and talk of drugs and violence, Wyclef tells it like it is. His tracks have a wide variety of themes ranging from police brutality, to racism, to forbidden love, and to Wyclef's message to young rappers. Some tracks that are guaranteed to please are \\"Perfect gentlemen\\", \\"Thug Angels\\", \\"911\\" and \\"It doesn't matter\\" with everyone's favorite, The Rock. Wyclef is very versatile in this CD, with skilled rapping, and soulful singing. If you liked him in the Fugees, you'll love him on his own. Even if you never heard the Fugees before, you'll soon become a fan of this truthfull, original aritist."},{"rating":"1","title":"you call this drivel brilliant?","review":"Okay- a number of points:what's up with the rock rapping on it doesn't matter? wyclef is obviously trying to appeal to the lowest form of life: the wrestling fanThen there are the covers: kenny rogers on a remake of his already horrible song the gambler? uh, no.. then there's wyclef's butchering of one of pink floyd's greatest songs, wish you were here.starting to see a trend? look at wyclef's track record, all of his other hit songs took big chunks of or complete coverslook: killing me softly, his john cale collaboration, that track he did for the when we were kings soundtrack w. a tribe called quest, his redoing of the bee gee's staying alive....you get the picturewanna hear brilliance? try my bloody valentine, the beastie boys, de la soul, or sonic youthEND TRANSMISSION"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great products for the price.","review":"If you're looking for an all in one speaker that sounds good.

We bought a tiny amplifier, and have a cable hanging out so that we can plug in a phone, tablet, iPod, whatever is handy, and boom - music in the bathroom. The speaker is nice-looking, sounds wonderful in the small room, and was just an all-around fantastic purchase.

The precision performance of these typically British marches is outstanding. Even those who don't live for marches anjoy this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest effort.","review":"Overall I would have to say this was probably America's weakest studio album. They abandon their trademark accoustic sound in favor of an 80's techno-pop sound. Gerry Beckley's songs are good, but it doesn't work with Dewey Bunnell's style. The album produced two minor hits in 1984: Special Girl and Can't Fall Asleep To A Lullabye. Best tracks are Stereo, Cinderella, and 5th Avenue. Only recommended for serious America fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't sound like America","review":"Released in 1984, this would be America's last studio album for a decade. America uses a hodge-podge of producers and abandons their trademark acoustic-based pop/rock. While it works on some of the songs, I think there are more misses than hits on this album. It produced two minor hits, Special Girl and Can't Fall Asleep To A Lullaby. Best songs are Stereo, We Got All Night, and Cinderella. This is probably America's weakest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I think this is America's worst album of all time. They abandon their traditional sound for an 80's synth-pop sound and it just doesn't work. There are a few good songs on it, like Cinderella and Stereo, but overall this is not a good album. Only for the hardcore America fan who must own all their material (like me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the prince and the paupet","review":"I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM.

Unfortunately for Mr. Taubes, science eventually sorts things out and figures out what's real and what's not real. Well, now fifteen years after the big Pons & Fleischmen announcement, it turns out that Cold Fusion is on the cusp of regaining legitmacy in the scientific community. Not only has the U.S. Navy revealed a decade of clandestine Cold Fusion research, but numerous reputable labs around the world have verified that the Cold Fusion is real.While a well written, and fairly well researched book, Mr. Taubes' burial of Cold Fusion is going to more of a historical artifact in the long saga of Cold Fusion than the definitive last word for this controversal field of science. Seems like Mr. Taubes is going to have to update this book soon, with an admission that he missed the mark in 1993."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth Will Set You Free - But Not In This Book","review":"You might want to check this link for a different perspective.[...]Never rush to judgement. :-)---------------\\"Here is a public demo, created by someone who truly understands the scientific method.

Very motivational."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AUTHOR TO WATCH FOR","review":"Awakened by His Kiss is a touching story of the healing power of love. This book is wonderful. But more than that, Judith Lyons is an author to watch for. She writes beautifully and with extraordinary emotion and tenderness. I can't wait for her next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!","review":"I went looking for this book. I read it some 5 years ago and loved it, so I had to own it. The romance in this book takes its time, and it feels like the real thing. Also, I love a good strong female lead, and that is what this delivers. It also gives you a strong reluctant cowboy, every womans dream. Definately worth a second and third look."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dogs love this stuff!","review":"Granted, my Cattle Dog and Aussie don't understand that it keeps them a little more limber in their old age (12 and 13 yrs old, and I can see the difference!) - they just know that every morning, they get a treat. They liked the old liver flavor just fine - but the new improved bacon flavor has been a HUGE hit! And *I* like the smell of the bacon flavor better. I appreciate the competitive price and the fast shipping, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great results","review":"I have read all the most recent reviews on this product. My dogs were on the Synovi product, but we decided to give this a try. It does contain soybean oil as indicated in one of the reviews, however, none of my seven corgis had issues with this. Only two of my dogs were in real need of joint help, but with all my dogs being equally as active and relatively the same age we have been giving it as a preventative to all the others to help them live happy, pain-free lives. The two that had joint issues showed response rather quickly in about two weeks of dailiy dosage. We are reordering this product, but in the three-pack this time. Every dog is different, but give these a try. If your dog doesn't respond to them, or if they responded better on another treatment, then by all means switch. My dogs love the taste and I even get to sneak meds into the chew if need be! Great product in our house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware....","review":"This product USED to be as good as the name brand Synovi G3 soft chews from DVM products, I tested the 2 side by side. However, when I reordered this Joint MaxTS softchews the manufacturer added SOY oil to the formulation (on the package label) but they did NOT update the ingredient list on this website! My German Shepherd is allergic to proteins in soy and has had diarrhea for months, and I have finally figured out why! My understanding is that most dogs have soy allergies. Also, many pet food manufacturers are sneaking soy bean oil into foods because it is a cheap, abundant product. So the good reviews here are old news about this product, and this new formulation is bad for dogs- even such a small amount of soy. Be very careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as effective as Synovi G3 Soft Chews","review":"We have a 12 year old Ridgeback with hip displasia. We were on Synovi G3's for years and our dog was doing great without any mobility problems.We switched to this product (Joint Max) via a coupon that came with the Synovi G3 brand and it's been all downhill from there. We're only halfway through the 240 count Joint Max, and our dog can barely get up.Your mileage my vary, but for us, the G3 brand was much more effective. We're switching back to it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - overdose of this product killed my neighbor's dog","review":"Like some other reviewers, my neighbor raved about how great these supplements tasted to her dogs who gobbled them up like treats. Unfortunately, one of the dogs got into the sealed container on a countertop and ingested about 75-100 of these; in spite of excellent vet care, the dog died due to liver failure from the extreme overdose.If you buy this product, keep it in a very secure place where there is no possible way your dog can access them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not eat them","review":"My dog would not eat the max chews in any form, I gave them away hopefully the other dog will eat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a deadly product","review":"At least 3 dogs, that I am aware of, had died after eating large quantities of this product. It is flavored and plastic container is not a match for big dogs. In addition there is no usuall membrane which seals top of a new product trapping smels. Be aware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dog died of overdosing","review":"I didn't have a chance to see if this stuff works or not. When the box came in, the dog was attracted by a smell of it. Opened the box, opened the jar and ate all two pounds of it. Unfortunately vets at CARES, Langhorne, didn't take it too seriously the evening I brought him in. By next day the liver was affected too much. In three days my beloved dobermann, who weigh 110 lb and was completely healthy besides an elbow arthritis has died. Beware that overdose of glucosamine can lead to the liver failure. Not too many doctors know that. I think there should be a law suit against the company which packs this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will buy more","review":"My 11 year old chocolate lab seemed like she was getting creakier by the day.

My four dogs love them...they are great subs. as treats,pill pockets....the flavor is good too...The tub is a great way to keep them stored....This is an all around great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff!","review":"I just reordered two large tubs of this. We have older dogs, one of which has bad hips and are constantly trying to figure out new ways to get them to eat things that will be good for them. Beau, who has the bad hips, will not eat anything that he sees as medicine. It is a constant battle to fool him, mostly because he is far smarter than we are. He loves these!!! He looks forward to getting his treats every day and we can tell that he is negotiating steps better since he has been taking these. LOVE IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Chews!","review":"Our six-year-old lab was showing signs of aging. She was having difficulty getting up after she had been asleep and limping like she could hardly walk. Our vet recommended some glucosamine chews, but the cost was astronomical! Luckily, I looked on Amazon and found these for about 1/3 of the cost elsewhere. Even better news: now that she takes two every night just before we kennel her, all of her symptoms have disappeared! She is as lively and energetic as ever. That's why we call these her miracle chews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treating Arthritis in Dogs","review":"I've been using this product for my 3 aging dogs for over a year. My oldest Jack Russell (13 years) is still quick and fast. She doesn't slow down at all. In fact I thought maybe she could be taken off the glucosamine product for the summer months (since arthritis isn't usually so bad in warm weather). After about one month without these soft chews, she was practically crawling. I thought she was dying and that something was terribly wrong. The vet told me to put her back on these chews and see what happened. Sure enough within a short time she was back to her old self. This is a must for older dogs. For as long as I have older dogs I'll keep them on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love it!","review":"This is the first time I have purchased this product so I can only attest to one thing so far. My dogs love this stuff! I have one dog with very bad knees and hips. He is limping less and running more, so far. They have had 80% of the bucket. I understand it gets better as they take more of it. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and economical","review":"Since the Synovi line was discontinued, we tried these. I was worried that our two older dogs wouldn't like the taste based on some other reviews, but they gobble them up. Excellent choice for giving dogs the extra protection they need for their aging joints."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"It was amazing to have my orders handed to my hand at the other side of the World - Istanbul Turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"I truly seem to see a difference in my dog!","review":"Due to an accident my dalmatian, Tyler, only has 3 legs.

But he does seem to be improving."},{"rating":"2","title":"very quick delivery","review":"I have ordered this item many times from various dealers. This was by far the quickest I ever received the delivery. As for the product, It is as good or better than other brands such as Sonovi. My dog has been taking them for 6 years. He is almost 10 yo and 116#. He still plays like he's a puppy with pretty good mobility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product & Delivery","review":"I used to use synovi G years ago for my dog. Then the price almost doubled. Joint Max tripple strength is much lower in price so I use it instead. They changed this product about a year ago but it seems almost as good and my dog still eats the chews without much hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floridas Funny FlimFlams","review":"To any person with an interest in the greatest con games of the Century, this book is essential. While dealing with Florida as its main base, the con games and scams outlined can be pitched in any city or State. Chock full of good old southern \\"cracker\\" humor, the books endeavors to further expose, and explain, some of the most notorious, and popular con games and scams perpetrated within the confines of Floridas borders. The writer has done much research and provides excellent source material for further reading on the subject. Very funny and very informative. You've heard about the scams...now read about them..with tounge in cheek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never arrived","review":"I ordered these and they never arrived. The seller told me to get some sort of paperwork from the USPS to prove that they didn't come, but they weren't expensive enough to warrant that much trouble on my part. I'd suggest they ship them via UPS or FedEx so it could be tracked. I bought similar ones elsewhere instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, But...","review":"This test did detect the presence of nicotine, but I should have bought a more sensitive test.

I usually get running with a new program quickly; but that is not the case this time.I have seen dedicated gps navigation devices for around $150. My system, in contrast, counting PDA, memory cards, software, bluetooth enabled GPS extra battery, case; etc. . .set me back by about $700.I will only recommend this product to somebody that is willing to take a lot of frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"core fusion collection","review":"This collection is a must have if you like to get in shape at home. I saw results fast and really enjoy the professionalism of the instructors. Works all parts of your body for lean long muscles with small movements.You will need small hand weights, 2-3 pounders, and an exercise mat is preferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all I think about!!!","review":"This set is 3 separate DVD's with each disc having five 10 minute workouts. Each 10 minute workout flows into the next especially the pilates series which ends in a savasna and stretching. These workouts are intense and it will take your body a few times of attacking them to really wrap your mind around which muscles you are targeting, which you are using and where your weight should be centered. one small movement, like rolling your shoulders back, will change where you're feeling the burn. it's addictive! I absolutely love it and find it much easier to do a tape and a half of core fusion at my own leisure than pack all my stuff up and hike across town to the yoga studio. For $20 you'll get a new body. can't beat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can feel the difference","review":"I have used these workouts several times since I received and I LOVE them! It is amazing how just small targeted movements can work those muscles!! the arm exercises have tightened my arms and I can tell in my jeans that the glute and leg exercises are helping to lean that area -- but honestly the \\"workout\\" I really love the best and I try to do it as much as I can is the \\"stretch sculpt\\" it is just a very relaxing and mind de-stressing -- it is just a great refresher to me and I feel great and relaxed after it - I will be buying more of these Core Fusion DVD's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"3 DVDs w/ good exercises , good price, easy to follow. Doing a differant DVD every other day waiting for results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workouts","review":"I am incredibly pleased with these dvds. Each dvd is divided into five 10-minute workouts so that you can just do one or two if you're short on time, or you can do all five. They also have the options to turn off the instruction once you become more familiar with the workouts. The workouts are low impact, high in intensity and great for people who are already in decent shape, but want more. The instructors offer modifications to each exercise to make them easier or harder as you progress. I love the whole corefusion method and will probably buy more products from them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for the pros","review":"I was impressed with the agility of the couple. Their moves are challenging and I can truly see where you would get excellent results. On the other hand, I was not impressed with the way they go from one motion to the ext. They do not have a \\"counting system\\". You have to always be watching the video to know when to execute a new move......that can be confusing and disappointing at times. Over all I do like it and will continue to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense workout in the privacy of your own home!","review":"Not only is this trio an excellent price, but they provide excellent workouts that can be done at home. I added this in addition to going to the gym a few times a week, where I only do cardio. While many of the exercises are very challenging you can take it at your own pace and work up to the more intense variations. Each dvd has many options so you can pick and choose. I do this with my boyfriend and brother and we all have a blast. However, many of the workouts require additional items: mat, towel/stretch band, weights, chair. I love love love this collection and encourage anyone looking to get toned at home to get this. After only a few weeks I can see more definition in my legs and abs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, and not that effective (more beginner/intermediate type workout)","review":"This is the most boring workout ever. The voice drones on and on without any change in tone. Exercises are not challenging for an advanced exerciser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree with Most Reviewers","review":"I bought this set based on good price and great reviews - I was very disappointed.I have a large collection of workout dvds but after using each of these twice I'll be deleting the set from my collection. 1)The lighting is bad, with no close up views, makes it very hard to see what the two instructors are doing. 2)particularly on the Thighs and Glutes section the moves are VERY hard on the knees, same with parts of the Body Sculpt. 3)The woman is okay in her instruction, the man is annoying in his commentary. 4)Its a fairly dull set of exercises.I liked some of the exercises and the 10' sectioning, but really, be careful of the moves that stress your knees and any others that don't feel right for you. My knees still hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never judge a CD by its cover","review":"Nice picture on Cd cover. Music content was a mess. Not my idea of a day at the beach.

Had to hit the \\"Seek\\" button to get out of each one. Maybe I am not a true jazz lover. There were lots of dissonant sounds and, to me, just plain noise added with whistles and odd instruments. I was so disappointed I returned it to Amazon and did not even open the other two CDs in this series that I had also ordered. Great cover photos and concepts but based on this CD I am staying away from this series.The jazz series I love is put out by Denon, also available on Amazon.Two that I love are \\"The most relaxing Jazz Standards in the universe\\" and \\"The most relaxing Romantic Jazz\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Material","review":"This book reads like a bad psych textbook from the 60's & 70's; because thats basically what it is. There are some masculine universal truths but you really have to search for them. The case studies & occupations are dated & irrelivent to baby boomers in the 21st century and not very helpful IMHO. Still there are a few pearls and saving graces but you really have to work hard to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dated to be of much use","review":"A nice try at defining life stages but this book misses the mark. It's too culture-bound to be of much use to anyone other than white middle-class American baby boomers. If you are one of those - as I am - you may recognise yourself in this book up to a point, but I doubt you will learn much that's new. As other reviewers have pointed out, it would have been a groundbreaking book in the 1970's, but these days you'll find similar information and analysis in the lifestyle pages of most Sunday papers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Saver","review":"When I was looking for books along this line, I saw the review titled \\"This book provides insights that could save your life\\" and thought that this book might be the one to read. It was. This book can be a life-saver, literally. It certainly made a huge impact for me.The book may be a bit too much for a person to read unless they like psychology. No, it is not hard reading, it just may be too much material unless you were looking for specific advice. Although you may be tempted to jump to your immediately applicable section, I would suggest reading chapter 2 (on men's different eras) before doing that.The author has a friendly, mature, informed approach. It is analytical, yet comforting.

Looking at the copyright date of 1940 and comparing the world as it is today, it was obvious his perdiction of the beginning of world peace by March 6, 1947, had not come true. Yet I thought there might be something here worth learning. I would read a chapter or two and think, this is all crazy talk. Put it down and later go back to it. It was like watching a bad movie and keeping with it in hopes that some event near the end would make it all worth sitting through. That didn't happen. The author gives no vivid explanation for the dates he presents for prophesies and in the end there's no proof for his mumblings having any real meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed & Thorough Work By A Real Pro","review":"Douglas Ward returns to a format, in his 2003 edition, that enables the reader to compare similarly-rated ships in a manner that distinguishes between cuisine, service, entertainment, etc. Therefore, his critical eye and high standards combine to provide the reader with the tools to choose a sailing so that, by disembarking, they'll be thinking of their next cruise vacation.

She brings me back to my roots, especially the track *Tecumseh Valley* because my people come from a poverty-stricken region of eastern Kentucky. Nanci's songs, many on this album, have brought me back to my roots. I was so sick of mainstream Country music with all the whining and sex and boozing that I turned my back on it. Nanci brought me back home because she does country music with intelligence and skill, not to mention extraordinary talent.The track, _From Clare to Here_, is worth the whole CD. Rarely has a song haunted me this much. But she does a good job of picking you back up with tracks like _Do Re Mi_.Many of Nanci's songs are sad, but she doesn't get down and wallow in it like so many Country singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing-a-long","review":"Other Voices is a disc you'll be able to listen to non-stop.

There are none of Nanci's own songs here and the cluttered production (sorry Rooney!) totally obscures her guitar. Plus, all the songs sound the same (I think Rooney is to blame here, too, since he gets credit for picking out the songlist). Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listening","review":"While Nanci's voice isn't for everyone, she's written some wonderful songs that work well with her voice and sweet Texas twang. On this record, she sings some classic songs written by others, many joined in by the songwriter. You'll recognize a lot of the songs, or think you do since they all have a warm, lived it quality to them, and you'll probably want to sing along to the closer, \\"Wimoweh,\\" with many familiar friends and colleagues of Nanci. I bought this to replace an old cassette version, glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"folk ambrosia straight from the taproot - drink deep, my friend.","review":"This music is soul balm. Every song here is searingly gorgeous. Each an American classic, simply yet elegantly delivered by one of the lushest female voices in the business. With just a touch of Texas twang.I own Nanci's greatest hits album, as well. It's good, but I have to say that this album is better, since the songs here are just transcendant. I'm unfamiliar with her other albums, but based on these two, I can assure you I intend eventually to collect everything she's ever done.I really encourage you to buy this album. If you like folk or country, you absolutely will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, stunning, folk at its best","review":"Nanci Griffith has a beautiful voice and uses it on this album to sing some of the most beautiful songs written by contemporary folk artists. This CD has been one of the most heavily played in my house for the last decade and I never tire of it - in fact I am currently writing a novel and the only CD I listen to while writing it is this one. That is the scope of its breadth and power, of its shimmering and relentless beauty.It's a captivating work of collaboration that fills the spirit with the sort of haunting loneliness that feels good. Infinitely listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am not really a drum and bass fan, but this album really made me appreciate the music coming out of Brazil. DJ Soulslinger has some incredible tracks on this album. I wasn't really a fan before, but now I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Study of Six Statesmen","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Each of the six contributed differently. George Kennan, a foreign service officer and then scholar, was the most cerebral and prescient. Dean Acheson was the most arrogant. Robert Lovett had the best sense of humor which served him well in dealing with Congress and others endowed with super egos. Averell Harriman was the wealthiest and the most tenacious. John McCloy was the most accomplished. Charles (Chip) Bohlen was a foreign service officer with distinguished longevity.These individuals were great statesmen. Except for Kennan, at first they were all in favor of US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even very accomplished statesmen misgauged Vietnam.I highly recommend this book despite its length. It is one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book meant for gift had blue permanent marker on pages and bookcover","review":"Very disappointed.

I usually favor wussier music but irresistible messy energy seeps from every song on this disc. A fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks","review":"After listening to this cd several times, I like it more than the first listen which created quite an impact. It is not a subtle Nick Cave album. It is not Lyre of Orpheus, Rarities and B sides or The Proposition soundtrack. It is stripped down, base instinct, garage style rock by a seasoned professional. I recommend it highly and it is one of the rare records anymore that I think should be listened to LOUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cave on the Rocks","review":"As with most of Nick Cave's work repeat listenings are needed before you can make a judgement. Really miss the lyric sheet you find with Bad Seed albums. Grinderman is rougher around the edges. Cave is on guitar for the first time and gets a little repetative but a more rock sound sans piano is a welcome change of pace. No Pussy Blues was funny at first but got old after a while. My current favorites include Electric Alice, Depth Charge Ethel, I Don't Need You, Man in the Moon and When Love Comes Down. Go Tell The Women and Honey Bee are fun with typical Nick Cave dark humor.Not his greatest work but a good swing into the middle aged rocker side of Nick Cave."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Still a Wild, Wild World","review":"Although I truly believe \\"Go Tell the Women\\" and \\"Man in the Moon\\" should have been left out of the album since they don't seem to fit with the rest of the songs, I can't help loving this album. Grinderman is Mr.Cave and friends' way of saying \\"This is how it's done\\" to all those fake-punk-goth-whiners like Simple Plan, Panic at the Disco, etc. You gotta be gentle and smart as hell to get down and dirty like this. \\"Get it on\\", \\"No Pussy Blues\\", \\"Depth Charged Ethel\\", and \\"Love Bomb\\" are instant classics, while the bass line of \\"Electric Alice\\" will take you back to the wild, wild days of the Birthday Party. In fact, Tracy Pew comes back to life on that one. Long live Nick and his Cavemen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of King Ink","review":"Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have been making quality music for some time now (excepting \\"The Boatman's Call\\"), perhaps exchanging some of the vitriolic intensity for more introspective arrangements. With the arrival of Grinderman, Cave and company have returned to their raw, vicious roots. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is the Birthday Party Mk. II, but anyone who has been tracking the career of this amazing showman will be more than pleasantly suprised. One could possibly compare this to the \\"Tender Prey\\" album if the band had the Stooges assisting with arrangements and channeling some lost garage band from the sixties. Also, this is Cave's first outing as a lead guitarist of sorts...very interesting style. Pure fun, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two weeks review","review":"I havent seen any change.

The changing mattress could be a little bit more thick but its still pretty cool. Its has enough space to put two decently sized baskets full of cloth diapers, a big box of wipes, wipe warmer, and other baby hygiene stuff. All in all this is a great product I recommend to a parent with limited nursery space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with changing table I bought for a christmas gift","review":"I bought this table in white for a niece that just had a baby at christmastime and was very upset to hear from her that the item had been shipped without any of the necessary nuts and bolts. I could not believe this had happened as she had pictures of the item when it arrived and it was tightly wrapped by amazon meaning that the product did not have the hardware before it ever shipped. I do not normally write reviews, but I could not let this problem pass by. I would not be as upset if the item was not a baby changing table. Baby furniture is very important and needs to be safe, but how can you be gauranteed of that when the customer does not even receive all the pieces. We have attempted to contact customer service, but actually lost the connection while we were talking. Seemed strange to us, but we will try again.

The 'lore' is at many times innacurate, to say the least; there are only one or two token food 'recipes' to speak of (and those for historical, not nutrional value); the spells and incantations are geared towards wiccans, with a flair for the dramatic and no historical context whatsoever provided. As a laymen's introduction to halloween this book is harmless, and would most probably appeal only to curious non-pagans as a novelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and bland...","review":"This book is ok in content, but the information is presented in a rather bland form.

However, as a so-called Pagan Historian (as she has dubbed herself) then she should know full-well that the Pre-Christian \\"pagans\\" as they were known, and even the Celts NEVER ritually sacrificed men, women, nor animals. Recent Anthropology has discovered this! They were as peace loving as modern Witches and Wiccans are. They sacrificed herbs and plants in lieu of living creatures or prisoners. It just was not done! So, don't believe it. However, if I could give this book -1 stars, I would. As a historian, she is not very accuaret or knowlegable about recent discoveries.

Then she's kidnapped by the Broom Witch and the Council of Superheroines. She takes on their antifeminist foes including the smoking villainess Virginia Svelte.There's a lot of sincerity in the film, the Superheroines are always making speeches about women's oppression and social issues. There's also a bit of parody, the film is not afraid to make fun of its issues but the jokes fall flat, the low budget is apparent and really it's not very entertaining.There's potential. Julia Lee and Lauren Birkell in particular put in good performances, but in the end there's really no reason to seek this movie out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with 5400/5500 iPaqs","review":"Wish there had been some mention of this before I got it.

If you are an Outlook user, third party software i.e. DatavViz is a must. BTW, I spent about $200 on third party software and believe I need to spend another ~$300 for SD memory.

You can ONLY HANG UP ON BOTH CALLS! So what happens is if you tell one person you'll get back with them and then flip over to the other call BOTH CALLS CONTINUE TO RACK UP AIR TIME, regardless of whether the other person has hung up!This is a huge design flaw, or maybe it's intentional so you wipe out all your minutes. Whatever the case, I can't figure out how to deal with it except if you have call waiting, you shouldn't answer it, or you should answer both, hang up on both, then call who you want to talk to.

This solution is so much better and the one handed navigation makes it really easy and convenient to use. It drew me away from Pocket PC and I'm never looking back.Keep in mind though, that you will end up spending lots and lots of money on decent software to run on the machine.

Verizon Wireless has been no help either other than in replacing the phone under warranty which takes no less than 2 hours of my time and two days to ship. Battery life is less than expected and I'm usually recharging the phone by late afternoon. Another annoying feature is the low battery warning that must be cleared from the screen if you're trying to dial in codes to check voice mail or other dtmf services.

Avoid Sprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"I own a Handspring Platinum Visor and a Treo 180. With the Platinum, they dropped the price after I purchased (fine, typical policy). After I bought the Treo, they discontinued the product (again, these things happen). My Treo broke exactly one year after I purchased it. When I tried to return it for repair, the customer service people told me I would need to call the service number and get charged another [$] before I could even get a Return number! This is after several phone calls and email dialogs where they wanted me to go through various steps to isolate the problem (which I happily complied with).I won't go into the lousy service, that could be the carrier. If you are still convinced you want one of these, make sure you keep the packing material - I threw mine out and after a painful 6 months I finally recieved the rebate I was entitled to.I will never buy another device from this company.

I've had mine for about ten days, and couldn't be happier. The call quality is as good if not better than verizon (here in SF bay area) with fewer dropped calls. The speaker volume is also really loud. The screen is amazingly bright, much better than my Sony NX70. Although resolution isn't hi-res, the quality is still surprisingly good, for pictures and video. Email and web access is very fast on the sprint network, and the PDA seems very stable. With the rebates, it's an awesome value. Now that I have all my contacts accessible, I keep in touch with people more.

Overall, this is a bust. The signal is greatly improved over the previous PocketPC Phone Edition, but the Palm OS 5 just falls WAY SHORT. If you have ever used a Pocket PC device, do not buy this phone. One thing after another keeps poping up. Things you just take for granted. Imagine that you have used MS Windows all your life and you switch to something that seems to look better. All the sudden, you can't view your files without a third party app, you can't transfer your files to a disk without a third party app. You have to jump through hoops to check your email or print and even then it's not reliable. Wouldn't that be awefull? I'm telling you, this Treo 600 phone is a BOMB! Looks great but a BOMB. It's light too... a light BOMB.

I was given a refurbished phone, which eventually came to the same end. So, now on my third phone, the sound is again causing problems. Of course, this one fell apart a year and a week after the last one was replaced so Sprint refuses to replace it.If you check out the reviews on ZDNet.com, you will notice that I am not alone in this complaint.

Also since a newer treo (650 ?) is coming in few months, this older model will probably be sold much cheaper than now. So you may want to hang tight for a couple of more months.The reason, I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had some hardware problem and recently my original unit stopped working as a phone. But sprint was very prompt and sent me another unit. So not much to complain there. :-)**Update: Treo 650 is out now. It seems to have lots of things that I desired in 600.

Never once has one of them stopped working. Since I got this particular phone 6 months ago, it has simply stopped working not once, but twice. Two times I've had to replace the phone with a brand new unit. Two times I've lost all of my phone numbers and software.So why did the phone stop working? Not because I dropped it. Not because I mishandled it or downloaded bad software. No, it was because (as far as I can tell) I switched to the phone mode too fast after typing a text message. That's it. Really. The phone just froze up and that was that.With all the hassle I've gone through with this unit, I definitely cannot recommend it. If it had only happened once, okay, it's a fluke. But twice?

Even though its alittle bit longer than the samsung it doesnt weigh anymore.Keyboard does take alittle getting used to but it was easier to learn than I thought it was. I exchanged my samsung for the treo thinking that I would exchange back to the samsung if I didnt like the treo but after 2 hours I knew that i was going to keep the Treo.I havent had any problems with the speaker or the screen or the display.

There's virtually no character development. The movie focuses too much on the mysterious city these travelers enter. It was ok to watch for the first time, but there's zero re-watch value.

See images.","review":"I dropped mine and a crack appeared near the bottom and the bottle leaked from then on - useless now. I also dropped my second one and the same thing happened. Yes, I dropped them -- but should they really break? I own 3 other stainless steel bottles from the same company - the little 12 oz. and two 40 oz. bottles. I've dropped all of them - especially the 40 ozers while totally full and they didn't break. Sure, they're dented like crazy from multiple drops, but they're still intact and I love them (see images). They don't have those ridges, and I wonder if that causes some sort of weakness. I wish I hadn't bought this 1-liter bottle. I like this size, so tonight I'm buying the Klean Kanteen 27 ozer.

For the price it's a great deal, but I would recommend buying the Poly Loop Cap because my husband and I struggle to open the Sports Cap. It is very tight! The steel is very thin, which makes it lighter, but for rough use, I would recommend the Klean Kanteen. The water stored is kept clean and fresh, so this is our little contribution towards helping our planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Biking","review":"I purchased this product because I wanted a water bottle that was not made of plastic that I could drink from while biking. I have not seen another one which is steel and this large. This is the perfect size for my long bike rides and other than the cap which is plastic, I have less exposure to plastics leeching into my drinking water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I was looking for something to replace the plastic waterbottle that I've been using. I hated throwing the plastic bottles away after each use and tended to refill them repeatedly (something the doctor told me not to do). Sooo, I looked around and read the reviews of several other stainless steel waterbottles and decided to try this one. When I got it, I immediately cleaned it and tried it out. The sport-top was EXTREMELY hard to open. I admit I probably looked like a frustrated gerbil trying to get at the water:)However, I don't have to worry about water leaking in my bag. I bought 2 bottles so that I can rotate them, cleaning one w/diluted vinegar while still having one to use. I've not noticed any metalic taste to my water and I've had it 2 months so far.Pro's: 1-liter long shape (not the short, fat 1-liter) that fits in many cup holders, Keeps my water cold all night, the sport-top vs \\"stopper-top\\", wide mouth ease of cleaningCon's: the sport top is hard to open"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Wave Bottle","review":"This bottle works extremely well. I bought two. One we use the sport cap and the other we use with a separately purchased screw on cap. Both are great and do not leak (Although we typically keep them upright).

Upon arriving I washed both and then filled them with water which we drank through the day. That night I left mine on the kitchen table. When I woke up the next morning I found that water had leaked out of a small crack on one of them and it ruined the wood on my table and left a small water spot on my floor too! I suspect this was a used bottle. The other bottle is fine but I am very disappointed that this product was sent in this condition. So check and double check for any damages!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"car traveler","review":"Bottle has a god grip and tends to keep contents relatively cool. However, the bottle does not fit my car cup holder and the bottom of the bottle is not flat, making placement insecure. Would not repeat order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I didn't like this product because the handle is very small and narrow and my nose hits it everytime I take a drink (and I'm a small person). The other reason I dislike this product is because I thought it would have a straw attached to it to make it easier to drink the beverage that's inside the bottle. When you drink from it, you have to bring head way back then you get the beverage all over your face. Will keep only because I don't want to pay for postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for it's own good!","review":"Item description clearly states that it fits nicely in most water bottle cages. Don't believe it. I have tried it on 3 different bikes and it is way too big to fit on any of them. Nothing wrong with the quality, I have 2 other bottles made by the same company and am pleased with all of them. If you're looking for a bottle to carry on a bike you might want to consider something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't handle cold water at all...","review":"I bought a couple of these for my husband to use on his bicycle instead of using plastic bottles. The theory of the design is great... execution... not so great.The quality of the stainless steel is lower than many other bottles. They are much thinner steel which causes the bottles to have issues with cold expansion.I put ice water in the bottle and the mouth of bottle expands to the point where the cap doesn't stay on. It just pulls right off.The threads of the screw top are not deep enough or enough period. It needs to have at least 1-2 more threads for the cap to go on tightly. It just spins loose if you try to tighten it. So it leaks.Not using cool/cold water in the bottle just isn't an option in Texas.I also bought the 12oz bottles which have the same thread and bottle opening... same problems.Save your money and just buy a Klean Kanteen. I've had absolutely no problems with our KK bottles at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks","review":"I looked forward to this new 'space age' bottle. Its sleek design is futuristic i guess and I love the sturdy design...but it leaks.There is a leak coming from somewhere around the top and i cant find it.

Unfortunately I didn't heed the other comments about the pop-up top being hard to open and close. For me, it was next to impossible. The cap doesn't fit snug onto the pop-up top, so that when looped around your finger, it justs pops right off and the bottle falls to the floor or ground. Poor design. If you don't care about using the pop top (one of the main reasons I bought the bottle), this is a good bottle for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"top is poorly made","review":"I bought two of these. The top of one broke off when I tried to remove the plastic seal; neither I nor my boyfriend could open the drinking spout on the other. I returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so pleased","review":"The sports lid is difficult to drink from. The spout pulled off when I opened it. The seal that creates a vacuum is difficult to release and then the bottle leaks. The little seal actually fell out and then had to be put back in place which is not easy. Bottle is OK; lid is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bottle, bottle top not so much","review":"really good price for a quality bottle, but im not a fan of the sports top. it doesn't leak, but the cap doesn't really stay on to protect the nipple from getting dirty. i kind of figured i wouldnt like the top ahead of time, and i would have liked the option to purchase this bottle with the carabiner top like the 20oz and 40oz bottles have. it's possible that i missed it, but i did look for a way to do this. the one liter size fit my needs best, and i saw that i could buy a cap for it later. overall great deal on the bottle, even after shipping it was cheaper than purchasing at a local store. it will be about the same after purchasing the other cap for it, but im not unhappy with the purchase. its very sturdy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this water bottle to replace all the plastic ones I had been using. The first one I received, I quickly realized it was cracked and leaking. I was able to replace it without a problem, but the next one I received the nozzle to drink out of was even harder to open than the previous one. I constantly struggled with it, but didn't want to have to return it again. I stuck with it and mostly would unscrew the top and drink out of it that way. One day, about 7 months after owning it, the top nozzle broke so I happily tossed it since it was nothing but trouble since I bought it! Noticing the other reviews, it appears that I may have received the two defective ones, but I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"After only a year of normal use, my stainless steel bottle has a crack near the bottom and now leaks. I would have thought the bottle would have held up better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product.","review":"This product has helped me to drink more water AND, to stop buying bottled water. I fill it up each morning with water from my Brita jug. I squeeze a little lemon into the bottle and I'm good to go for the day. You can sip at it all day. It can also be used for juice. I like the fact that it is made of stainless steel. I also like the shape as the narrower part makes it easier to hold. If the water is too cold, I simply pad the bottle with a sheet of paper towel and hold in place with a rubber band.

She already knows her alphabets so his was just for fun. Be mindful that Grover says the alphabet the wrong way a few times and the way he says it is quite catchy. My toddler likes to say it the way grover says it now, but she does know the difference. So my advice is make sure your kid knows the correct way of saying the alphabet before watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one downside...","review":"If anything, my daughter loves this DVD a bit too much. She picks up the box, runs to the couch, points at the TV and says \\"Elmo! Elmo! Elmo! Elmo!\\" until I either give in or hide. We don't let her watch much TV, so this has basically become the only TV we watch with her. On the bright side - it is very well done, the songs are good, there are plenty of variations on the alphabet song, and they really do focus on teaching the alphabet. If she has to watch something, I feel like this is at least educational. Maybe it's because I grew up with Sesame Street, but compared to a lot of modern kid's shows, I also find it very watchable. I'm not as enthused about watching it 5X/week as my daughter is, but it's definitely bearable for the adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gathering of essays","review":"I thought it was a book, naturally I found out later that it was a compilation of several papers presented at a seminar in India.

The ultimate result was the breakthrough of the Portuguese, and other western powers, into the far east where naval supremacy reigns.These few remarks somehow balanced the final equation of this shallow 'book'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner, I really enjoyed this one!","review":"In the Catholic faith, suicide is the Big Sin.Father Joseph Shanley arrives at Homicide to discuss the apparent suicide of Rose Alyce, known offstage as Rosa Mendez.

While he believes the evidence is cut-and-dried, Detective Sammy Golden takes a second look at the closed case, and things start to heat up.

It shows that Dave Tipper really knows how to put together some damn good music! Not at all bland or recycled, Tipper produces music fit for that perfect wintery soundtrack, not to mention for the bedroom as well. Beats don't meander or bore you like on most ambient CDs, instead they captivate you at first play and draw you into a world of mysticism and at times danger. Comparisons to Boards of Canada, Mouse on Mars and Telephon Tel Aviv would be appropriate, and rightfully so--Tipper's music gives you that same warm, sensual feeling--just a little more tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoying these videos during my pregnancy!","review":"I just FINALLY started doing the 2nd trimester video and I REALLY like it.

I uninstalled '07 and reinstalled '06 and still had problems. IE and Outlook Express would still not run even with '06 reinstalled. I spent over a week on the phone w/ tech support (over 12 hours) and they could still not solve the problem. The only way my system would function properly was to totally uninstall PC-Cillin. My last ditch effort was to restore (I'm running XP Home) my system to a date before I did the '07 upgrade and then reinstall '06. This seemed to have corrected my issues for the time being.

In spite of this, VanTil is a very neglected writer in the philosophy of religion and Bahnsen's work is valuable to those interested in the field. VanTil is probably underrated.

Bahnsen gives Van Til a big thumbs up but does not interact with him in a critical way. Frame's Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought is the standard by which Van Til scholarship should be judged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"As does SDL itself, this book tries to be too many things to too many people, and ends up being woefully shallow.It would better have separated \\"object-oriented\\" concepts from the SDL language itself, instead of interleaving the two in a tangle of tedious examples, missing details and a basically useless reference index.It might also have addressed the pitfalls of SDL and how they are treated in 'the real world', i.e., by patching in \\"C\\".As it is, it conveys the concept that SDL is useful for building academic models using a nifty block diagram editor. I could have gleaned this from the Telelogic sales brochure, thus saving myself 40 bucks or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"The blurb on the back of this book states that it \\"meets the urgent need for a comprehensive introduction to SDL...\\".

It is so not worth the money and not holding up well at all. My dog is only 58 pounds, and this bed has not held up well at all. We have had it about two months, and already it is broken down and has a deep crater in it. I keep turning it around and over, but it doesn't help. The cover has also worn very quickly. In my opinion, really not worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, poor quality","review":"I'm extremely disappointed with this product and am surprised to see as many positive reviews as there are. I've had this for about three weeks, and already there is a depression in the bed where my dog sleeps that does not return to form over the course of the day when he's not using it. Clearly, this is poor quality foam being sold with a cheap cover for an exorbitant price. This may be fine for a smaller dog that weighs 20-30 pounds, but for a larger dog, Lab, etc., look elsewhere...or just go to Walmart where you can buy your own cheap foam for a lot less money and just plan on replacing it once in awhile.Update 1/12/12 - As I look at this $100+ bed with the huge \\"hole\\" in the foam where my dog lays...I'm reminded how bad this bed really was. And it's been like this since about a month after I ordered it.

You'd know theres talent within these guys, from \\"Breed The Killers\\" to \\"Firestorm\\" to \\"Last Of The Sane\\"... Earth Crisis was a political monster that seemed unsilenceably dominant over straight edge hardcore/metal music. Now 2003 A.D. Earth Crisis boils away as Freya arises. Not just Karl, Eric and Bulldog but a new drummer and 2nd singer/guitarist too! They flow together perfectly, no politics here just artistic expression that rivals the best in Hardcore/Metal today. This is a fantastic album, full of hooks, grinding riffs, and talent talent talent.

On the opposite side musicians sometimes include sound effects to try to distract the listener from sub-par music.Neither strategy guarantees success.David Rothenberg's quartet consists of clarinet, guitar, bass and small percussion playing indulgent new agey \\"jazz lite\\" with spoken poetry over about half the tunes.The quartet's guitarist Douglas Quin brought with him several field recordings of birds, frogs, wind & weather.

Before it was 25%~50%.I don't know why there is all these negative comments on this unit? It's quiet, I have it by my bedroom door and on low at night it just sounds like a very small fan, like one of those little clip on 4\\" fans you can get almost anywhere. It makes a little gurgle sound now and then but this does not sound very loud at all.This unit has the permanent filters, which is awesome. It's so easy to take apart and clean also.I like this humidifier very much and the blue led light that shines through the tank at night is cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"careLESS, useless piece of junk","review":"This is the most annoying, frustrating piece of machinery I have ever used in my life. We bought multiple units and both have the same problems. Though regularly cleaned and filled, both units seem to have faulty air humidity and water level sensors. the machine NEVER runs because it is always sure that the tank is empty because the poorly designed mechanism initiated the brake. I would never recommend this product unless I really didnt like someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is noisy and it leaks","review":"this is sucks water upwards and if it loses suction somehow the water will spill over the side of the bottom reservoir and damage your flooring. I have wood floor and it has spill over a few times and now my floor is bulged because of this humidifier. It is also very noisy, I have placed it far from my bedroom and shut my bedroom door so as not to disturb my sleep; compare this to the gurgling sound of the steam humidifier I would prefer my noisy steam humidifier. This is by far the worst humidifier I've ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this product!! I purchased it because of the Hunter name and and the advertised ease of use. However, it is very noisy and after just two months of use began to make a rattling sound. The humidity then seemed to not be working so I exchanged it for another thinking it was defective. The second only worked for 4 days. Then it also made an even louder rattling noise and had minimal humidity. The water was also always green even when using filtered water. It is very difficult to clean. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Carefree\\"?????","review":"I bought 2 of these humidifiers less than a year ago without reading the reviews. There's nothing \\"Carefree\\" about them...constant cleaning is a must, and I've replaced the 4 filters twice (at $8 each plus shipping...I couldn't find them at any store). Cleaning the filters per the manufacturer's instructions was a pointless waste of time. I have water with slightly high iron content, but I filtered it & still had problems. They were both due for yet another cleaning last night and halfway through I decided I've invested too much time in these \\"carefree\\" units and threw them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"We purchased one of these humidifiers a few years ago, and thought it worked fairly well. It was definately noisier than other humidifiers, but it had the night light feature and permanent filters that we were looking for in the product. Needless to say we purchased a second one for our other childs room and this one has had all sorts of problems. It is noisier than the first one we purchased even though it claims to be the same decible rating, its' nightlight quit working within 4 months, and it goes through water much faster than our other one. Permanent filters are overrated - they are very hard to clean (as is the whole unit). I say skip this one and find yourself a nice ultrasonic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Brand Name","review":"I saw this humidifier in Wal-Mart; however, the box did not offer enough information. Therefore, I researched it on-line. I liked the filterless system. Many years ago, I purchased a Duracraft humidifier but donated it a couple years later due to the expense of the filter. While I read the numerous reviews, I decided to try this product out of desperation.Pros: This humidifier separates easily for cleaning and refilling. However, when I went to refill the container, the gasket came loose, but the container did not leak.Cons: This humidifier noise level kept me awake at night. Also, when the water level drops down, this humidifier gurgles on the medium and high level.After two days, I returned this humidifier. I am looking at Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier V4500, which claims to be 27% quieter and more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get it","review":"I bought this humidifier when i had my baby. It gets moldy, slimy and you have to clean it out after every other use. I also find that it emits a horrible odor as well like mildew if you do not change the water in the bottom tray too often. Dont feel that it is great to have my child breathing this in. GET SOMETHING ELSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I have owned at least 5 humidifiers and I believe this is the worst! The water in the bottom turns yellow and yucky stuff floats in it after one night of running...It's a pain in the rear to clean!!! and doesn't come clean very well at all! And to top it off, I've owned it for 3 months and it sounds like the motor is giving out already...when I put it on high it starts up good and then in a few seconds, it's barely running! And it doesn't feel like it's putting much cool mist out into the air either....Poor choice for a humidifier...don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I thought this humidifier sounded perfect--no filters, low noise, yearly cleaning. What a disappointment. It sounds like a constant running faucet and on any setting other than low, it sounds like industrial equipment. After one month, there was slime and mildew all over the inside. I would never recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carefree? Try High Maintenance!","review":"Despite the expense of this item, I bought it because of the brand name I trust and the claims of low maintenance. Boy was I disappointed!After one day of use, the water in the base was yellow with what appeared to be algae floating with it. I have had to empty out and scrub this unit every day to keep it clean (note that I use only filtered water to begin with!). Plus its awkward design makes it more difficult to clean than the cheaper models!Also, even on low it is noisier than I expected with what I consider a \\"harsh\\" noise, and it doesn't humidify as big of an area as it claims (although it is adequate for a medium size bedroom).Add to this poor customer service and you have one truly disappointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Fan Plus Loud Vibration","review":"I just got this humidifier yesterday and used it in my bedroom for the first night. I was able to sleep over the sound of the fan, but then at 6:00 AM I started hearing a lot of noise. At first I thought that the neighbors were playing the stereo. Then, I thought that someone was warming up a Harley in the parking lot. It turned out to be the humidifier. It was making a very loud vibration noise, which was even worse in the room below. I put it on a milk crate to get it off the carpet and put some padding underneath it. That helped, but if it doesn't any better in the next few nights, it is going back.I have the yellow stuff in the water too, but it is just the anti-bacteria coating from the filters so it is not a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"This unit is swampy in a short period of time. It starts with the yellow debris from the filters and quickly grows into orange slime. This happens in about a week. To make the problem worse, this humidifier has parts that cannot be cleaned without taking it apart. I am going to have to throw it away and get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"To good to be true","review":"I'm so tired of these false advertisements on product packages and commercials. Like the ionic breeze air purifier that claims to be good, but just falls extremely short in all tests. This humidifier is very loud...continuos water gurgle noises are very annoying when trying to sleep. This is caused by the air bubble release in the tank. Like the other reviewers claim; a yellow slime takes no time to form. Night light feature on mine broke after a month or so. I still use this humidifier because i cant afford to spend 40 bucks on another just yet...so until then i'll have to just turn my tv way up to hear over this damn thing. When will these companies make good products and actually listen to reviews like these. The box to this product mentions something to the effect of it having mildew or algae buildup protection...this is a lie. I'll never buy another hunter product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"Because I have had adult asthma for years, I watch the humidity level in our home during the winter months. I have been from A to Z with various humidifier models over the years. Some lasting many, many years and others working for a season only. This one ranks right up there with one of the worst, if not the worst, model I've ever had the displeasure to own and operate. First it's loud. Plain and simple. But the worst is the cleaning and trying to re assemble...Nothing ever seems to fit properly and it takes me f-o-r-e-v-e-r to perform cleaning maintenance. I'd rather buy filters than go thru what this model requires. Don't buy this ! I absolutly promise you there are far better and less expensive models out there. I'd tell you what I think they are, if I was allowed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"I've had two of these. The first started leaking water after a couple weeks. The leak got bad enough that it would go through a full tank of water in a few hours. Threw that one out. Bought a new one for the following winter. After a day or two, it started puking orange-brown grease inside itself. I cleaned the grease out as best I could, and it worked for another two weeks, before the motor burned out. Just threw that one away, too. Oh, and the treated filter does not mean you don't have to add chemicals to prevent mildew and mineral deposits--you have to do this with every refill or risk getting sick. There must be better humidifiers out there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not carefree","review":"I just finished dismantling the humidifier to clean it. There was definitely mold. The humidifier isn't bad. In fact, it works just fine. The filter is made of metal, which you can spray off in the sink or soak in water with a little bleach. I'm just disappointed in the false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for the $","review":"I bought this humidifier for a small living room. I love that it is easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and permanent filters. However, this machine is super loud. I have owned many different kinds of humidifiers, and I have to say this one is the loudest (of the wick filtered ones)! We have to keep it on med or low just to hear the TV. Unfortunately, unless it is on high, the humidity doesn't change much. I will replace this one in the near future. For the price, it helps a little bit without too much upkeep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I purchased two of these humidifiers. IT is nice to not have to replace filters however you do have to soak them in quite a bit of vinegar to keep everything clean. Nothing is without work.

Will have to figure out how to replace that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Strings and Chet","review":"No jazz artist exceeds Baker's work on this great album.

Classic Baker at his very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Chet Baker Album!","review":"This music is great! The strings are not \\"easy listening\\" strings, but more dramatic and at times the sound reminds me of movies from the 40's, which no other Chet album quite does in the same way (that I yet have heard). Chet plays beautifully as well of course. The sound and liner notes are great, with lovely photos, this is a Columbia Legacy release after all! The ballads are amazing, and there's Russ Freeman on the piano, and the album floats perfectly together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Exegesis, Weakly Organized","review":"John McTavish and Harold Wells have performed a great service in collecting some of the most exciting \\"small print\\" exgetical passages from Karl Barth's \\"Church Dogmatics\\" into this compact, paperback volume. Barth's insights into Scripture are still fresh and clear, illuminating the thread running throughout the Bible -- Jesus Christ, God's Word incarnate -- in stunning ways. Unfortunately, the volume suffers from a lack of any indices (such as the topical and biblical indices found in the \\"Domgatics\\" themselves). The volume's title is also misleading; preachers expecting to find a series of passages keyed to the Revised Common Lectionary will be disappointed. The book is only very loosely arranged according to the seasons of the ecclesiastical calendar. Barth's work is strong, but the editors' oversights limits the practical usefulness of this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Performances by Top Artists","review":"I believe, the reviewer is absolutely correct, that KKK is missing from this release of Reggae Sunsplash; still:Peak Performances are here, from Black Uhuru, perhaps the original record had 3 selections; instead of two.\\"The Right Time\\", by the Mighty Diamonds, this is grade A ; all time hit.

My two favorite songs are \\"Day of Freedom\\" and \\"Always be my Home\\" I am Catholic and this would be a excellent to listen in front of our Lord himself.

Using historical examples of American, British, and Russian imperialism, he makes this point well. But he never really explains why the Central Asian republics are at special risk for this kind of imperialism. The book seems on one hand to be about the risks of imperialism in general, and on the other hand a summary of recent Central Asian history.I would have preferred two separate books--one on the dangers of imperialism, and one on the history and future of Central Asia. (The book may have been a bit rushed and its thesis may have been redirected by recent events) But nonetheless, the chapters are on their own all very interesting, and Meyer has a lot of insight about the situation.But despite the structural flaws, I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in foreign policy or in recent Middle Eastern/Central Asian history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, restocking fee","review":"Poor quality, decided to return within minutes of opening the shipment. 10% restocking fee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is hiqh quality celtic music at its best!","review":"GET THIS CD!!

I do get sad, thought, to think that this sort of life no longer exists. I would have liked to have lived it. Excellent, excellent. I owned three copies (two purchased on internet auction) and gave one away to a friend. Now SHE is hooked and looking for her extra copy too! You will love this book!

Having lived a convent life for a year, I can say that while dramatic and interesting, this novel also allows the reader to understand women religious as the people they are; not just the roles they play in the contemporary imagination. Much to this reader's surprise, Ms. Godden explores the personal and spiritual victories of its characters, but also helps us to understand that these sisters also struggle as the rest of us do. Some of the nuns are more likable than others, just as we \\"people on the outside\\" are.

The concert I went to in Dallas was unquestionably five stars (getting the overall effect washing over you, I suppose). I'm no director or editor, but not spending much time visually on the jet-fueled percussionist in the fantastic drum cage is just wrong; his playing was integral and entrancing! I waited with bated breath for that transcendent moment when life is utter zen -- The giant floating all-seeing pig spinning to \\"Run Like Hell\\".

This is a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Why isn't Blu Ray available? Buy PULSE instead. I do like seeing the young Floyd, this concert was amazing, but this DVD does it no justice. I think I know why it has taken this long for the DVD to come out.

Well, I must say, I was lost for words, I was into the rythym and the laser show, the pig floating around, it was awesome. The best video ever to have been produced.

What you got here is cutesy teenybopper bubblegum \\"punk\\", complete with lead vocals by a high pitched Nicky Gilder sound-alike (anyone remember \\"Hot Child In The City\\"?). This is slickly produced nonsense, loaded with way-too-obvious hooks, and hyperactive performances.

Maybe the first and last chapters could be recommended but the rest is boring. None of the characters come alive and none of the real issues they face are made as clear as they should be.

But if you don't mind a very free translation, approach the Mitchell version with an open mind and you'll find much beauty here.Be aware that the paper in the paperback edition is very poor, almost like newsprint. In my copy, the pages in the last third or so are wavy, as if they've been wet, but I don't think they have been (bought this directly from Amazon, not from another seller), I think the paper is just very cheap. If you want to keep the book for many years you may want to invest in the hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good translation but not great","review":"This well done and interesting -- but it just doesn't seem quite up to the usual Stephan Mitchell standards. Plus, he states up front that his translation was done quite freely. While this is typical of Stephan Mitchell, he normally tries to stick closely to the essence if not the literal meaning of the subject. I am not sure that he did either here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is my all time favorite translation of the Psalms. Stephen Mitchell does an excellent job capturing the sentiments behind the prayer of the psalmist if he were writing in today's idiom. I have given this book to many people over the years. I can't keep it \\"in stock\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful translation","review":"This book was first given to me as a gift and I in turn have given copies as gifts many times. It is uplifting and joyful. It is perfect for someone suffering from a loss too. This is my favorite collection and translation of the psalms. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"The author writes:\\"I have translated fairly closely where that has been possible; but I have also paraphrased, expanded, contracted, deleted, shuffled the order of verses and freely improvised on the themes of the originals.\\". This was not bad devotional free verse poetry but to call it specifically a translation of the book of psalms is very misleading. King James version and JPS have done it better. It is more inspired from the book of psalms than an actual translation. I give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Multichannel Version","review":"I was also disappointed when I put this in my sacd player. Then I realized this is the stereo version, not the multichannel one that I had heard on my brother's system.

It is definitely the best live blues CD of the entire 1990s--hands down. Mooney takes the blues and, while honoring its tradition, makes his own guitar style and type of virtuosity. You will swear you are listening to two guitar players on some of these tracks, but the credits don't lie--it's a three piece band--it's just him, his bassist and drummer! The audience adds a lot to the recording with their well-placed cheers after many of his great solos. His vocals are great, too--reminds me somewhat of Howling Wolf. Great songs, both covers and originals here. A MUST HAVE for all blues fans!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was only given the name Demons 3 in the US, to sell the movie!","review":"BAD MOVIE!

His intention is good, but his execution is simply sub-par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a book...","review":"This book is really something of a scam. There are only 128 pages of new content. The rest is a reprint of an essay Einstein wrote around 1916 on relativity. Most readers will not actually read this, so the book is itself actually more of a long essay.

Smith is a good book to teach a beginner how to get started with Active Server Pages. The early chapters do a good job to ease the reader into ASP and provide him or her with a good foundation to build upon. Unfortunately this book has fallen victim to a number of typos, which can frustrate the reader. The approach of the book is to build up one's skills and then utilize each in an application (called eOrganizer). Unfortunately there are problems with some of the code and even the application that can be downloaded from the web site needs to be tweaked to work right.In summary- I feel that this book needs to be corrected and reissued. If all revisions are done, this book will be an excellent resource and worthy of more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Step-by-step Coverage","review":"Easy reading and not intimidating.

Easy to install (I'm no electrician) and seems to like the new-style bulbs just fine. I got the black cap that makes it rain-worthy. Not sure if that was necessary under the roof, but the black accent looks nice. One star off for the price, which I thought was a little high, but the style probably adds that much to the value of the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent price and quality","review":"Bought this control arm recenty to replace a Deeza Chassis control arm.

This Dorman control arm seems to be better quality. Everything is a nice fit with no problems so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet...","review":"I have been a fan of the Flecktones for years, and all of their work is incredible. This CD, however, is by far the best of the best. It is, in a word, INCREDIBLE! The Flecktones have a variety of artists to support them, and they blend them into the music seamlessly to create a wonderful sound. From beautiful, slow songs to up-beat numbers, it is all great. And on this album more than others, Victor Wooten, Jeff Coffin and Futureman have a chance to exhibit their immense talent. Sure, this sounds like I'm a publicist trying to promote their product, but I'm not. I'm just a fan who is enjoying the fascinating creative talents of the four Flecktones. Now I can't wait to see them in person...again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grueling banjos world tour","review":"It's hard not to come away from the journey feeling Fleck would have been better off keeping things a bit more ragged, even if it would have meant risking a misstep from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Side of the Flecktones Diversity","review":"According to Flecktonian nature, every album must evolve from the one previous and this new one definitely follows suit. The album starts off with a traditional melody \\"Hoedown\\" that we all know from Emerson Lake and Palmer as well as the \\"Beef, It's Whats For Dinner commercials\\" and goes on from there to a new realm that is described in the reviews as pop but I think that it is the same style from Left of Cool, except a little deeper left. What I enjoy most is the flow of the album, the overall feeling is the same throughout the album - you can listen to it three times over - but is still not redundant. I think Outbound is of the same caliber as UFO TOFU or Flight of the Cosmic Hippo in terms of the quality of music, but the cover art could have been worked on a little more for that traditional Fleck spunk. Great Listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats going on here","review":"I do not understand why this cd sounds more like kenny g than the flecktones. This sounds like something that should be played on the elevator at sears. I loved all their previous albums but I just don't get this one. They should remain strictly instrumental and this thing that future man uses the royale or whatever makes me want to puke. How can you go from Sinister minister on live art to the songs on this album. I know that a bands music should evolve but this is just outrageous. I saw them live a little while ago and they were awesome except for the songs where future man sung and that damn machine he uses with him humming in the background. For anyone who does not have this album and is a fleckotnes fan I advise you not to buy it because if you are like me you will be embarrassed to even have it in your cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I have ever owned!","review":"My cousin told me about Bela Fleck a few months ago.

The songs \\"Hoe Down\\" and \\"Earth Jam\\"are phenomenal.However the rest of the album is not as good.These are two songs from their live album,which shows more upbeatness in their work.Sorry, but to be blunt, I recommend this albumas a good album for those two songs, but therest of the album I don't recommend.Their \\"Live at the Quick\\" album seems better.Dylan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will someone tell Futureman the experiment is over - real drums rule","review":"I love Bela fleck and all he has done to bring the banjo to the mainstream music listener. That said, he has to put futureman to rest. Vocals aren't too bad, but that tingy, hollow sound that comes from his electronic drumkit ruins what is otherwise beautiful music. And don't get me started on the live records.

Some of the good tracks are Hoe Down, Earth Jam, Aimum (would be better if there were no vocals and just jams) and Outbound. Its definately a feel good cd. Buy it. you'll enjoy it. Has some great guests on it to, like John Medeski (always a plus) and Paul McCandless. Hope this helps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising, yet satisfying","review":"I always enjoy listening to a new FT CD for the first time as I'm blown away by the musical surprises and artistry that are trademarks of B��la's work. After a few spins, I settle down into the favorites - this time it is the title track, Outbound, which I play to celebrate a moment and then on to Scratch 'n Sniff which puts me in a playful,funky mood.

Quite an apt title, Outbound - this doesn't sound like a band's tenth album. It seems more like a beginning. They've got a new label and with new Flecktone Jeff Coffin on board they're reaching farther than ever.\\"Scratch n Sniff\\" is bizarre jungle funk given the bluegrass treatment. The title track sounds as if they'd decided to listen to Weather Report for a week straight. \\"Something She Said\\" wordlessly floats on Shawn Colvin's wonderful voice; indeed, lyrics would probably only get in the way of this one. As if their own jambalaya stew of styles wasn't enough, the contributions of several guests from Colvin to Adrian Belew to Jon Anderson are tossed in for even more flavor. Though there are some evident influences (as always), Outbound is ample indication that this group is still full of energy and ready to explore whatever strange musical paths they find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another colorful masterpiece by the Master","review":"Once again, Bela Fleck continues to push the envelope of jazz and bluegrass with the release of Outbound. This CD has a variety sure to please everyone, from mellow to standard to funky, and the songs with guest vocalists Jon Anderson and Shawn Colvin are a great addition. I especially like the songs Earth Jam, Scratch'n'Sniff, and A Moment So Close. I saw these guys in concert last month and they blew me away. Truly one of the most innovative bands around. Certainly an entertaining and refreshing CD from the 'Tones. There's NOBODY making music like this these days, especially on the banjo. Can't wait to see them again soon! Another good CD I've added to my collection of eclectics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Recording","review":"As a long time Flectones fan, I am never surprised at what they do next. Outbound is another adventure. This album has more of a jazz feel than previous albums. They again use vocals and mix things up a bit by using a throat singer and Shawn Colvin. They also feature the steel drums which adds an interesting twist. I also enjoyed the covers of Copeland's Hoe Down and a Coltrane classic. Despite presenting a different style from previous albums, if you enjoy Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, you will certianly enjoy Outbound."},{"rating":"1","title":"After one month still not receive item","review":"It already after one month.

Hell, this is the closest sounding thing I've probably ever heard to that album anyway. Some people had originally told me that this is a metalcore band, but unless the other Gothenburg bands are metalcore, then these people are dead wrong. This album is so punishing, it is difficult to listen to without flipping out. The drums are beyond insane, blindingly fast and precise. The vocals are brutal, very acidic, and just plain awesome. The guitar riffs shred mercilessly, but have a gentle touch due to the melodic tones. Every song is a winner, but the epic Accessible Losses and Pay Phones & Pills stand out the most.

The Magic Flute is an opera that lends itself well to varied interpretation and a new one holds promise, but beware here.The amateur singing in this performance should have ruled out its public release.. The singing ranges from actually shockingly bad (from the cute three boys) to better (from Monastatos).The orchestra is fine, but not memorable by international opera standards. The career promise of the young Thai conductor cannot be furthered by either by the high-school level the singing or the staging.

She loves the movie and watches it every day. Just purchased a second copy for another niece. The movie is a bit corny (like all sesame street), but the little kids love it. It deals with the emotions and changes that happen when a second baby is born. Message is basically, don't be afraid of changes because they can be really fun and your love grows each time another person is born...there is always enough love to go around. I recommend this movie as a good resource for helping small children prepare for the arrival of a new sibling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this...","review":"I really was disappointed by this video. It portrays having a new baby as an ultra stressful time for siblings. Baby bear is constantly freaking out over the thought of the impending arrival of his new sister. He is frantic through most of the video and quite frankly it stressed me out to just watch it. Life is stressful enough, I don't want my child to be pressured into thinking a new baby is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!!!","review":"My 18 month old loves watching this video and it explains the emotions that a child goes through when a new sibling arrives very well. There is even a few tips for parents included in the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing I hate more than this video","review":"If you are having a second child, do not buy or rent this movie!It is just 50 minutes of Baby Bear complaining the entire time about the changes a baby will bring to the family. He finds one thing after another he doesn't like, from not having lap space on Mama Bears lap, to being ignored, to being woken up in the middle of the night. There is also lots of panic when the baby is ready to arrive, and general stress over the situation.I had to mute almost the entire thing and make up my own dialogue for my 2 year old son, explaining the 3 bears are happy about the arrival of the baby, just like we were.Baby Bear is just one wee little wreck in this whole video and it is complete hell to watch.Good luck with your new baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty annoying and lacks realism","review":"My two year old is EXCITED about having a new baby. She is not scared. She does not need to see or hear (from this video and library books we have checked out) negative reactions. So, maybe when the baby comes, she will be scared or react strangely, but this video was awful. I wouldn't recommend it. Also, it was way too long for an active toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!!!!!!!","review":"This video was recommended by a friend so I thought it would be good. My son is 3 1/2 years old and loves TV and would not watch this video. I found it to be very annoying. It was dumb. Do not waste your money. I am going to throw my copy away. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not exactly what we were looking for","review":"When this last Christmas rolled around, my husband and I wanted to buy our daughter some new movies, and this was included. As we're expecting our second child in June, we thought this would be a good DVD to help our duahgter cope with the new addition. I not only feel cheated out of the money spent for it, but as this lacks any real substance or entertainment, I feel cheated on the time spent watching it. It doesn't seem to bring a postive spin to an expanding family, but shows it's ok to panic and resent the new baby. I don't reccomend this to parents at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feelin' good like I knew I would!","review":"After running out of Source Natural's Cat's Claw, I began to feel worse each day.

You can totally read through it in an afternoon or bring it out from time to time to chew on a new story or fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"This was a fun, easy to read book. Some of the things written seemed to me to be common knowledge. But others amazed me, like:-Christopher Columbus did not have to convince anyone that the world was round. It was common knowledge at that time. The \\"world is flat\\" was added to the story by Washington Irving hundreds of years later!-The ancient Olympics were originally cancelled by a Roman emporor who converted to Christianity and felt the games were glorifying Greek gods. The idea to re-enstate them in 1896 came from a French man who wanted the French people to be physically fit to face war with Germany.-Baseball was invented by the British.-Croissants are Austrian.-St. Patrick, the Patron Saint of Ireland, was an English slave.Those are just some of the cool things you will learn in this book. The author also lists all his sources, making it easy to read more about the things you found particularly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"The Greatest Stories is true to its title. If you like really learn when you read, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Interesting","review":"I enjoyed this book, and you will too if you like trivia. It gives you some fun stuff to talk about at parties or while you're just hanging out with your friends. The book gives the highlights for each story and its just enough to keep you moving through the book quickly. You could read a few pages and come back to it later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure History 101","review":"This was an interesting book and a quick read. However, each item only has one page (one side) of information, and this book would have earned a five star review from me if only the content was a bit more fleshed out. Still, a great book for the beginner trivia buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting tid bits, not much else.","review":"The author did a great job of digging up interesting stories and providing a synopsis of those stories and details, but that is all they are: quick sound bite synopsis's. With a few of the stories that is all is what was needed, but with most I felt I was left hanging on some tantalizing new detail or details with no further explanation or narrative. If this was meant to be a sound-byte coffee table book, then a larger format and more pictures would be suggested.If you are a real history buff, then you might look elsewhere; or purchase this simply to whet your appetite with the fore-knowledge that you will do much more research to get the whole scoop on each \\"story never told\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift.","review":"I gave this to my brother for Christmas. I have to admit I read some of it before giving it to him. It was very fasinating information. Perfect for someone who loves history."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Trivia","review":"The author has published a similar book consisting of tiny anecdotes from history. A few of them will amuse you for a few seconds. There is an overlap, so the author did not find a full 100 new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but lightweight","review":"Bottom Line: I enjoyed this book a great deal but the experience ended far too quickly.What I liked: Easy to read. Short, independent stories make the book easy to pick up and put down. There's no need to read it in chronological order. Stories are really fun.What I didn't like: Nearly every story left me wanting more. Very simplistic (TV-esque?) treatment of events. Very fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome vocal trance collection","review":"This addition to the Ultra Trance series focuses more on the vocal trance area with female singers. The songs were great, especially \\"God Is A Girl\\" by Groove Coverage. If you have never heard that song, buy this CD. That song was actually why I bought the 2 Disc set. The 2nd disc, the DVD, had pretty cool videos. My favorites were the \\"Diving\\", \\"Loneliness\\", and \\"God is a Girl\\" videos. Overall, I think that this is one of the strongest of the Ultra Trance releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Trance CD","review":"At first listen, the CD sounded bland, but once you get into it, the tracks are awesome to hear. Definetly worth [the money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liverpool blessed us with Gomez.....","review":"The album of \\"Bring it On\\" is a classic. The throaty vocals and the lyrics that can only be described as artsy-but good artsy make for an excellent listen. It's a gread album to just move your head to or even break out dancing. The mix of genres percedes usual alternative bands. Favorite songs to check out are \\"Bubble Gum Years\\" and \\"Here Comes the Breeze.\\" The band from Liverpool not only deliver on the album, but also deliver live, their performance in Galway was one of the best I've seen! Recommended to anyone that loves inventive music that truly is ear-candy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're ready...","review":"\\"Bring It On\\" resonates with honesty and purity. Recorded in a cold garage in the U.K., Gomez sound as if they're having a great time coming up with new sounds and lo-fi effects. \\"Get Miles\\" opens the album with a sizzling, evil bass pulse that turns into Ben Ottwell's earnest, throaty vocals. Highlights include \\"78 Stone Wobble\\", \\"Here Comes the Breeze\\", \\"Get Myself Arrested\\" and \\"Free to Run\\". The album is a bizarre combination of blues, reggae, folk, and rock. The guitar sounds are earthy and funky, the drums are understated, the vocals are right up front. You can tell it's really something special after one listen.This is not music for everyone, but if you feel like today's music is bland and heartless, pick up \\"Bring it On\\" and enjoy.By the way, they are phenomenal live...truely a great young band from whom we will surely see great hings in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but nothing like Liquid Skin","review":"This album shows the potential that Gomez has, and Liquid Skin shows Gomez fullfilling that potential. It's not that this album is horible, it's just average. I would recomend anyone interested in Gomez to by Liquid Skin, than once your a fan, go back to this album and prepare to be disapointed. I was atleast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric lyrics, uninteresting sound","review":"Nothing incredibly wrong with this disc, but I found it boring. The singer does nothing to mitigate the fact that he sounds EXACTLY like Vedder, and the lyrics he sings are about as brainless as those of Pearl Jam. This sounds like the work of a few talented kids with a weekend to spare and hormones to burn. There's not a drop of virtuousity in the musicianship and the production adds little else. Songwriting is about on par with Huey Lewis and the News: one unsophisticated catchphrase per song, repeated ad nauseum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this CD and returned it the next day. The lead singers voice is very interesting, but the tracks were a bit boring and lacking musical originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Dull.","review":"I sold this CD a week after I bought it. With the exception of \\"Get Myself Arrested\\" this is the dullest album I've heard in years. Only a critic could love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"hype - lots of it","review":"I don't know why this album is rated so high on the amazon buy lists. it is a poor excuse for music. You can't dance to it. You can't sing with it. It drones on and on. Perhaps I am too uncool to get it but I listened to it twice and it didn't get any better the second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It well deserved the Mercury Music award - and more!","review":"I was going to buy this album before I heard about their winning the Mercury award for Best Album in 1998. I practically wore the CD down listening to it so much! Get Myself Arrested, Here Comes The Breeze & 78 Stone Wobble best tracks, but they're all amazingly original, and can be listened to over & over again! This is true alternative music, and is very easy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep bringing it on.","review":"After reading the other reviews, it is clear that Gomez has to be one of the most underated bands ever. From start to finish, bring it on delivers loose but powerfully driven songs. The obvious Tom Waits and early r&b influences run rapid in this fresh new album.It will be interesting to hear the new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring it on: My sentiments","review":"The album starts with \\"Get-Miles\\" complete with soaring Weller\\"esque\\"/Cocker\\"esque\\" vocals. It is a great start to the album as it instantly reaches out and grabs you.The album carries on from this high point well with the likes of \\"Whippin' Piccadilly'\\" and \\"Get myself arrested\\" \\" as notable exceptions. The best track on the album,in my opinion is \\"78 Stone Wobble\\" due to it's excellent riffs and melodies. Although the lyrical quality is at best non-sensical the melodies and guitar riffs make up for this, but ultimately the lyrics are slightly discouraging. Overall this album is well-worth buying and despite a few glitches it is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good listen all the way through","review":"Rich, diverse, well crafted. There are no throw away cuts on this album. Some tracks may take time to grow on you, depending on your tastes, but if \\"78 Stone Wobble\\", \\"Get Myself Arrested\\" and \\"Rie's Wagon\\" don't have you humming along by the chorus, check your pulse (and pull over to the side of the road), 'cuz you may be dead already. Get in on this band now; they deserve to be the biggest thing out there in the morass of modern music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I went out on a limb and fell on my butt.","review":"No, I don't really like this CD. The songs 67 Stone Wobble and Get Myself Arrested made me want to buy it. There weren't any others that really did it for me on here, but I'll bet that's because of what I enjoy. I usually listen to OffSpring, Verve Pipe, and Green Day, to name a few. This was just a little too far out of my vain to be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve all this gushing praise","review":"I bought this CD because I liked their \\"Getting Better\\" lick in the Philips ads so much, I couldn't get it out of my head. I was hoping to hear more of the same on this CD, but was disappointed. I was irritated by some of the intro sounds, especially the long scratching static on GET MILES--it was a pretty disappointing first impression. I do really like one lead singer's voice but now I see this CD is an early effort by a group that will, I'm sure, refine their talents. They'll be world class contenders if they keep at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cubbie Bench - Maple","review":"The quality of this product is LOUSY. It is particle board covered with contact paper. The contact paper has bubbles in it and is peeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"I bought this to put at the end of our bed in the master bedroom. It fits in with the other furniture in our room, looks good and is what I expected for the price. Obviously it is not real wood but I plan on making a covered cushion to go on top of this so we can sit on it which will cover up most of the top anyway. I looked at many other storage bench or covered ottaman options and this was definitely the best value. Be careful when you hammer in the plastic dowels as they don't need to be put all the way in. One has started to crack the other side which is the top of the bench but as a cushion is going to go over that, it doesn't matter but if I was planning on keeping it as is, then this would be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality material","review":"I received this package and opened it up to assemble. Before even getting it to the final location the rounded front piece had completely broken in half leaving the sides with no hold or stability. The bench is unusable. I am really disappointed that something with such a high price is made with such poor material. I do NOT recommend this bench."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Instructions","review":"Probably the worst instructions I have ever seen. I have the matching shelf, and the quality is quite good, so I assume the quality of this bench is also prety good, as well. But I've given up trying to build it and will try to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bench Cubbie, not to shabby","review":"Cheap wood, but I guess I get what I paid for. You only get the cubbie bench, not what's pictured. Shippment cause some minor damage, but can be expected for the type of wood. Overall, not bad for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap price, cheap quality","review":"This product is cheap, which usually means cheap quality. I would of pay twice as much for a solid wood one that will last 3 times as much than this piece of particle-boards-made furniture and easy to be damage.I bought another set at the same time and both had problems; part were damaged. Prepac is the manufacturer and they will gladly replace your damaged board but it will take 4 to 7 weeks to finally have your piece together (in case the replacement part does not come damaged). It seems that they are used to.If you don't have enough money, go for it and use it as an ornament and be very careful when moving or assembling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product.","review":"In my life I have never wrote any review on any products I bought. It is my first time to do this just because this product is piece of crap. It started to fell apart just days after I assembled it. If the price was $50 I would not complain. For this price you can get something much better from IKEA, or even Walmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, built strong. Nothing else to want.","review":"Easy assembly, looks wonderful and 2 people with a combined weight of 400 lbs can stand upon it with no signs of instability. Nothing more to ask from furniture.Would easily recommend to friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This is awesome. Great product and GREAT price! I highly recommend this!I bought this and the cubbie shelf to go with it. They are both being used in my kitchen as a drop off point after coming inside. Only thing I don't love is the bench tends to tip forward when sitting on the edge. I have small children and was concered about it tipping over on them but it has been a problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"We got this for our entryway to help organize shoes, backpacks, etc. This bench has worked perfect. It looks nice and is very sturdy. I'm happy with the quality of the wood and the color as well.

Finish will lift easily if wet; will need better protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"I bought this product on clearance for around $100. The quality is great for what I paid and it works perfect in our entryway. Sturdy enough to sit on to put your shoes on or enough space to put work and school bags. The storage underneath is big enough to put shoes or good sized baskets for storage of hats and gloves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry way bench!","review":"We had been looking for an entry way bench for a long time. We loved the Pottery Barn style but not the price. This bench was perfect. Very sturdy and easily put together in about 30 minutes. We would definitely purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdier than expected...","review":"Great bench - very solid. Only took my husband about 45 minutes to put together. Looks very nice in the entryway. I only gave it 4 stars because it feels a little \\"high\\" when you sit on it. Obviously, I could have measured the height before I bough it. But with an added cushion, just seems like it's a bit taller than it should be. My husband even feels this way, and he's 6' 2\\" tall.Overall, very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my bench!","review":"I just got my bench a few days ago and I assembled it within 30 minutes. I was very proud of myself. It looks fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-energy, ear snack food","review":"Anyone who knows Louis Andriessen's music won't be disappointed in this crisp, hard-driving, spare music. The cascades of notes, the obssessive slithering around tight clusters of notes, and the pointillistic rhythms have the hallmarks of minimalism, but it seems an innacurate label for pieces so jam-packed full of notes. And there's moments of humor, surprisingly, if you know where to listen. Sincere, virtuoso performances.

The writing for this episode is slow and labored, and relies on running gags from past seasons. I hope they were trying to give a shout out to the die hard fans, who would have recognized the jokes; but I fear it was just lazy writing. I hope the season gets better, because I am wishing right now I could get my money back for this episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"It's very likely that I like this episode more with more views, but first reaction was that I hated it. Just didn't feel like an Always Sunny episode.

It was brilliant from beginning to end and the twist just blew me away.All the characters had great moments but Charlie especially owned this episode.Reminds of of why I got so into this show in the first place.

Some of the episodes are outstanding and some are just phoned in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good.","review":"I know other reviewers have said season 8 isn't as good, but we're still laughing our butts off and enjoying Sunny. These guys are still doing a good job and we're glad they keep on coming back with more."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good!","review":"\\"Sunny\\" is the go to show to laugh at and with jerks doing terrible and hilarious things to other people and thanking yourself for not being one yourself. The clueless and quirky gang are at it in style this time around, dredging up old plot lines for surprising twists and newer ones hitting like a ton of bricks - bricks of laughter, I guess. The deplorable lengths each character stretches to to get what they want makes for great comedy and they push the limits this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gang is back!... and looking for Nazi treasure...","review":"The gang is back and looking for Nazi treasure belonging to Dennis and Dee's Nazi grandfather, who they have to decide whether to take him off life support. Frank is upset that everything of Pop Pops goes to Dennis and Dee. Mack and Charlie decide that they are going to find Pop Pop's treasure all the while deciding how the movie of their adventures (or misadventures) would go down.HILARIOUS!!!!If you like the irreverent humor of \\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\" I HIGHLY recommend this episode!!!BTW, Mack isn't fat anymore, but he is still their enforcer getting sunglasses that are supposed to indimidate others while he determines if they are a threat. lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but getting old.","review":"The past three episodes have all had their funny moments, but they are relying too heavily on jokes derived from previous episodes. This is not where the humor of this show come from in the past and for it to go anywhere the writers need to step their game up. An odd joke about bird laws here or there is fine, but for everything to be from season 1-7?"},{"rating":"2","title":"beach balls","review":"I'm sure everybody knows that this is a great show why else would you bother watching it are you heard from friends but it was great whatever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better late than never","review":"I saw ads for this show for years but never watched it. Last month I was desperate for a good comedy to watch and tried the first episode. And was hooked.

Funny as hell, just like the first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job!","review":"This is one of the last few albums I've been replacing from cassette.I still prefer CD's because, unlike digital downloads, I can upload my music to any computer and not worry about DRM blocks -- I've bought it, let me play it. And, since I upgrade my computer every couple years, it's obnoxious to have to re-purchase songs I bought already.Anyway, I Can't Stand Still is a great album from Henley's early break-away years and it's good to finally upgrade to CD. This was a third-party redirect and drop-ship, rather than a purchase from Amazon itself. Still, the product arrived very quickly and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not something I would normally buy","review":"Only purchased this because it was required reading for a college course, I never would have purchased it otherwise as it is contrary to my beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Occupied New York","review":"People, including Franklin (father and son), the Howe brothers (William and Black Dick), the DeLanceys, the Livingstons, George Washington and Lord Stirling (a soi-disant Scottish peer AND an American patriot!); and geography, Hell Gate, Sandy Hook, Flatbush and Gravesend are the stars of Barnet Schecter's masterly study of New York in the American Revolution. In this 400+ page impeccably sourced book, we also learn about the first combat submarine (the Turtle) and other fascinating details like the peace conference on Staten Island and the noble death of Nathan Hale. I especially liked the maps which combine historic details with modern landmarks which helped enormously in picturing the action.Schecter is an up and coming historian; I look forward to reading his latest work on the 1863 NYC draft riot during the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for a New Yorker or anyone interested in the American Revolution","review":"An excellent and well-written piece of history. The biblio alone is worth the price of the book. The walking tour at the end of the book is a must for any New Yorker who loves the city and its history. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Under Foot","review":"I loved this book. As an avid reader of history I found Barney Schecter's volume highly readable, comprehensive and a must read for any New Yorker, history buff or not. In addition to the great story that is this book, the author continuously compares the places that great events took place in relation to current day NY. He also depicts how close America came to losing. Additionally, he offers walking tours (all accessible by public transport) and a website to enhance the reading experience. Photos of the portraits of the main characters are interspersed throughout the book. All told, this is an excellent and scholarly volume that can also be a wonderful gift for a young student interested in US history in general and NY history in particlar."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP OF THE LINE READING!!","review":"I read this book years ago and it is still one of the best books I have read in my 40 years of life.

It was a brilliant, contemplative and credible account of events that may or may not have happened. \\"Transformation\\" was interesting but mostly a rehash with a new perspective. This book is where Streiber finally lost me. If he hadn't written this book, I may still be totally convinced by him. When he started this Communion business he was seemed very believably sane, that's what made his story so chilling. I suppose it's possible that it's all true. It' more likely that Streiber is finally losing his mind, maybe the visitors drove him insane, maybe he's simply delusional, or maybe it was a ruse from the beginning. Whatever the case, when I finshed this book, I realized that he had written one book too many on the subject...I didn't buy the next one. but I will read \\"Communion\\" again...with a different view of Streiber...and see how it plays now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitley lets you know you're not the only one.","review":"Whitley keeps doing it.

He did it again. I thought that I had to keep searching for the answers in different areas of the paranormal. But, no, he has them there in his books. Perhaps it is more relevant to other abductees. If you are looking for answers to things that have happened to you. You do need his books. You will find out that things you have experienced and don't want to tell anyone about are really common. He tells of other people's experiences. One of his books, \\"The Communion Letters,\\" is of many people sending in their experiences to share with him.

However, his analysis of the encounters seemed insane. For example, he says that our fear of the aliens will lead to a greater communion. Huh? Strieber also says that the aliens want us to reach some sort of hyper-consciousness, whatever that is, he never said. He asserts this planet will soon be run into the ground by \\"exploding population\\", and that the aliens are here to save us from ourselves. But the Earth can stand another 14 billion people, and industrialized countries are starting to level out population-wise. And some of his descriptions seem weird, even delusional, like some growling, standing beast with a wand in its hand. The book also seems to have disturbing undertones, giving the aliens some sort of spiritual prowess (for no apparent reason), when they act evil. The aliens must have finally gotten to Strieber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Volcanic!","review":"This may not be the best book about abductions for skeptics to read.

It is a small collection of interviews and anecdotes of Amish women. The book is a simple, cleanly written work, giving the reader a taste of what life is like for Amish women. It is, however, just that: a taste. There is no depth to this book. It almost seems as if it were a work published by a vanity press operation. It is more like a book one would write and then have printed up in order to give it to friends and family. There is really not too much to it, and it has a certain affectation about it. It piques one's interest but does not satisfy an appetite. It is too bad, because the author herself was raised in an Amish household. Obviously, this gained her entree into this interesting, though narrow world. It is unfortunate that she was not more insightful in terms of her material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I enjoyed this book. The stories were wonderful, and warmed my heart.

It took me less than 24 hours to read, I could not put it down.

It describes the abuse and torture the \\"family members\\" willingly accepted because of their belief that Rock Theriault was being used by God.

I am a long time fan that appreciates their style as it has continued to mature over the years.

If you are trying to decide on a recent release to reacquaint yourself with Saga, I would get House of Cards instead. Worth a listen or two.Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Basics","review":"With \\"Full Circle,\\" the talented Saga returns to the type of music that made them one of the most innovative bands of the eighties. Lead singer Michael Sadler and additional vocalist Jim Gilmour do some great trade-offs and punctuate their vocals with gusto. The addition of a children's choir is something you'd never expect on a Saga song, but they do it on \\"Follow Me,\\" and it's a delightful surprise. Another great song reminiscent of their earlier efforts is \\"Time Bomb.\\" It starts off with a bang and ends with an abrupt crescendo. The single, \\"The One\\" is a good tune, as well. The album's only flaw and it's a minor one, is that there is some repetition in the tempos and song composition, but the guys still know how to do exciting synthesizer and guitar breaks, and never let the energy level sag, even on the slower tunes. All in all, a refreshing collection.

Till then I have already heard and loved lots of their hits without recognizing they are from the Eagles.Hotel California is a poignant song and was hard for me to grasp the meaning and ironies involved. New Kids In Town was and still is my top favorite among this greatest hits package. Seven Bridges Road(in live) is a pure gold track of early Eagles touch. Heartache Tonight take on harder edge having the breath of hard prog/metal era.

There is certainly room for a decent Greatest Hits Vol. 2 in the discography, as the first volume clocks in with a scant 10 tracks and misses a number of key cuts (as well as anything from the post GH-Vol. 1 era). However this LP is not it. This album consists exclusively of tracks from Hotel California, The Long Run, and (represented by a single song) the Live album.

The light switch is a little weak and will probably break again with constant use.And as a children's toy you can't beat the price but don't expect to use it as a REAL tool or for emergencies - it's just not reliable.Not a good purchase choice for those environmentally concerned because once it stops working you just throw the whole thing away!

The vertical stands work fine and goes up in a snap. The carrying case is wonderful - easy to use and holds everything perfectly! The horizontal cross members on my system did not fit well into each other. 2 were so tight I was unable to rotate them into position. I should have sent them back (if they don't rotate into proper alignment, they won't line up with the vertical stands). After a couple of hours of rework in my shop, I got all 4 cross members to fit well. Since some fit better in one position that another, I numbered the mating sections that fit best with a Sharpie. Now I can assemble the system quickly and with great results. Highly recommended. Be sure to test fit the cross members when you get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS-CS1","review":"I took the unit to Mexico on vacation, and it worked very well.

If you walk inside and it losses it's signal it hunts for it and has a very rapid drain on the battery. I drained the first battery in just a couple of hours because I was going in and out of building sightseeing.

Es la vida de Zavalita relatada a Ambrosio y a Carlitos, el primero esta en el bar la catedral, desde donde se desarrolla toda la historia, de atr��s hacia adelante y entrecortada. Es interesante notar el estilo que utiliza este escritor en su narraci��n, un estilo fragmentario que puede hacer que un lector inexperto se pierda o no entienda quien esta hablando sobre quien en la obra. Debemos de entender que el primer capitulo es el ��nico que tiene orden l��gico y que es ese capitulo el ultimo, no el primero. Zavalita se encuentra con Ambrosio y ambos se narran sus vidas y sus experiencias y van dejando ver la situaci��n pol��tica y moral de un pa��s que el escritor ve con ojos desesperanzados y grises..

I was a huge Dokken fan back in the day, and even back then I thought that this album sucked. The production is horrible, and as usual Don Dokken's lyrics scream \\"I'm a fruit!\\" What kind of heavy metal frontman spends virtually every song detailing his broken heart and how he got worked over by some wench? A loser, that's who. I mean, come on, lets have some songs about sex, drugs, and the devil for chrissake. The only thing worthwhile about Dokken was Lynch's guitar playing. As usual its decent on this album, but that's not enough to redeem the overwhelming negatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"just enough","review":"I got this light for my notebook, for use in low light areas.

However, the LED barely lights about half of the keyboard, and the flexible neck is too loose and thus you need to be careful not to bump it when in use to avoid the light from tipping back onto the screen or forward onto you hands while typing. It definitely helps to shed some light on your keyboard in dim light conditions, and does stay cool to the touch.-- In the end I need to mention that although this is a low cost item, in turn it is still not worth the consideration. After all was said and done, the flex neck on this unit is way too flimsy, and I found the base where the USB attaches to the flex neck was not able to support the weight of the product.

The men are beautiful, the sexual content is very arousing and the story line is great,the music doesn't hurt either, I just wish the soundtrak was available. This show casts a very sexy, supernatural spell that is very hard to ignore-although it is geared towards a gay/lesbian,bi-sexual audience. When I finished the first season, I had to have it, soI bought it and soon therafter, bought the 2nd season as well. The 2nd season changes a few things-but not badly, plus adding Thea Gill to the cast from q.a.f. was a perfect casting choice.

Even the sex scenes,too frecquent, extremely choreographic, extremely artificial. The idea is very good, though, but the development is weak, sometimes inconsistent. Yes, it is full of handsome people who seem to live a paradise-like live, but it is too unreal, even for a TV-Show on ghosts and witchcraft.

This is one of those good books that made me think about stuff (like my childhood, for instance) that I usually do not think about on a day-to-day basis and it also made me thankful that I grew up with good and loving parents. The other thing I really liked about this book is the fact that there weren't hardly any curse words in it so this is a book that I could enjoy and then I can give it to my mother to enjoy.

Brian does a nice job of examining both parent/child, romantic, and extended familial relationships. There is a nice twist at the end of the book involving one of the main characters, Benny.

If Rick Wakeman approved of this use of his material, he never heard it. Nobody in their right mind would.It's very difficult to discern the music from the interference. If you're a fan of Rick's earlier works (and you would be to be interested in this recording), you will be disappointed. Even the titling of the tracks is wrong.This rot is unworthy of even MP3.

Oftentimes, after slipping into white slacks and a glass of chablis, I listen to Love Will Find A Way as the sun embrace the horizon. On All Night Long, his harmonies ubdulate like the waves of Malibu lit only by starlight and the dancing flames of a tiki-torch beach party. If there's a song I can only share with my best friends, this is it. And of course, who could forget the timeless Penny Lover? Like ice on fire, this song melts your heart into romantic submission. In closing, prepare this album for the next spring fling with your penny lover. \\"Don't make me cry baby\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD from the 80s.

It jumped right into the mechanics of bowling in good detail. Suddenly, after 30 or 40 pages, it just died. It almost looked like the author became bored and just wanted to throw another hundred pages on to make the book longer. A good portion was spent displaying almost every possible spare. First of all, with the title being Bolwing Strikes, was was there more space dedicated to picking up spares? I would have rather the author diagnosed precisely what caused the spare and options to correct your throw rather then spending a page on how to pick up the 6-9-10! Even stranger, the author assumes you're advanced enough that you throw a hook, yet spends several pages on ettiquette, how to score, and injuries. The first 20 or 30 pages have some helpful tips, but you're better off spending the money on practice. Best suited for someone who just bought a fingertip ball and wants to learn how to hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultural Regions of the United States","review":"A little long and slightly out of date for 2013, this book gives you the ethnic and the cultural backgounds of the different areas of the United States.

Any student of graphic design should have this book in his/her library. The book is spiral bound which makes it easy to lay flat and examine the many examples of typefaces given.One of the most valuable aspects of the book is how it takes 5 classic typefaces (Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni, Century Expanded and Helvetica) and gives examples of each typeface in a large range of point sizes and leadings. Typography owes as much to visual measurement as it does to mechanical measurement.

You must be truly perpendicular, or close to it, in order for the clutch to hit the drywall flush and disengage. Otherwise there was some tear out. A good eye is useful with this bit.

DeVries tells us in the foreward that Sanders' motivation for writing this book was that as he neared the end of his life, he was researching his future destination. In so doing he brought passion to the work, supplemented by the skills of a scholar. There are various types of books on heaven, some very subjective in their approach, others from a more analytical view. This book presents a look at the evidence, but with zeal and enthusiasm.He has done a commendable job of reviewing the literature of what other scholars have said on the subject and adds his own research to what he has found. He even presents varying viewpoints on different issues before saying where he stands and why.The vast majority of this book is excellent. Toward the end I find a weakness.

Come to think of it, I could write something like this, and I've never won the National Geographic Bee.

I cancelled it after a year.Look, my opinion is just my opinion. Almost all magazines today are almost all advertising; either overt ads, or covert advertising disguised as articles and reviews about new products. I spent ten minutes every issue reading a few columns written by famous names such as Nigel Calder et. al and that was it. I've read their books for the most part anyway, so these few useful parts were not worth the $10 a year subscription fee, so I cancelled it.Your mileage may vary.But advertising can be informative if read with discrimination, especially if you are new to the sport and want to get an overview of what's going on commercially.

The addendum makes note that current research only confirms the earlier studies. Essentially, the first half of the book provides numerous arguments to support that children need nurturing loving homes first and foremost. It over and over again contends that formal education is better left until age 8-10. The research and arguments are vast. Resources are plentiful and convincing. Everything makes sense to me, a former educator, who is currently raising children of my own. The research provides a firm foundation regarding my choices for my children.

Pressed to find a category in which to put \\"Sense,\\" I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness, which to my mind were both superior films to this one.

I should have known from the reviews I read that said this wasn't what we remembered, but I chose to believe the 'good' reviews. I sure don't know what they recieved to have given such glowing reviews, but, this product is in a 'tiny' plastic bottle & the contents smell as 'old as the hills'. Yuck!

But I wasn't a fan. It wasn't awful, but it smelled noticeably old, slightly moldy. Somehow I doubt that Love's is still manufacturing this scent new anymore, which makes me wonder if FragranceNet just has some stockpile inventory of old perfume sitting there. I ended up throwing about half of the perfume out when I just couldn't stand to wear it anymore.If you want real crisp lemon, try Avalon Organics lemon hand and body lotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Smelling Stuff!","review":"I don't know what this is, but it's not \\"Love's Fresh Lemon\\" cologne. It smells awful! It smells like very stale alcohol with no lemon smell at all.

It came in what looks like a sample size bottle with no bag or box around it. It was just tossed into the mailing box. I'll be sending it back or into the trash. What a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Stuff!","review":"I was sooooo disappointed when I received this cologne. I hadn't seen Love's Fresh Lemon since the 70's, and I'm afraid this stuff must have been sitting in a dusty warehouse since then.

It would be nice if pictures were done in such a way as to show the actual size. For example, they could have had a hand holding the bottle between the thumb and forefinger.

Not only was it not, I couldn't wash it off my arms fast enough. It was absolutely horrible...smelled spoiled to say the least. Perhaps I just got a bad bottle.

Boyee, was I pleasantly surprised. VERY sturdy, weighted feel, great sound, and to me, sounds every bit as good as an SM58. If that's not enough, they throw in a great carrying case and a mic clip. I used this out live a week after receiving it and loved it. I'm not an engineer, so I dont know how well it ACTUALLY stacks up in a recording studio, but u cant beat it for the price.

One of the most glaring mistakes is what Tolle has to say about nature. He says learn from nature on how to be still. Hahahha. Gee, nature is moving all the time. The universe is expanding, cells divide and mountatins move. To say that nature stands still and stillness speaks really says volumes about how naive Tolle is and why some of his stated beliefs are just flat out wrong.

It has been five years since the first book, so I have to ask the question: Hasn't the publisher learned anything during that time?

I recently felt a little saturated with books regarding mindful living and the present moment and have began to search beyond that (though I may have lost the present moment by doing so). To my surprise, I found an excellent book called \\"The Ever-Transceinding Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It is a tremendously enlightening book for those of us who are not completely in the present moment all of the time but are on our way to learning how to get to a stage of life where we are able to stay close to this state for extended periods of time. I would recommend it to everyone seeking further development in this area of life. Good luck in your quest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stillness opens the door to who you are. \\"Be Still and know.....\\" Psalm 46:10","review":"Written in the style of proverbs or sutra's, this is not a story. It is like a devotional tool to practice the presence of NOW and be present. These are thoughts and words that can lead you to quiet stillness, and no words. It has given me new meaning to the words; \\"quiet time\\". In today's world of high speed, high tech, instant message and fast food this book can open a door for you to be still and listen to the silence. When you are able to hear the silence you may discover something essential about who you are and why you are here. I recommend the book, but it's not about the book. It's about the practice. \\"Be here now\\". Listen, and hear the stillness. \\"Be still and know...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"Stillness Speaks is a book I go back to again and again.

However, if I'm ever feeling down or in need of a pick-me-up phrase, there's no need for me to pay $15 for it. Not discounting the fact that many of the phrases are well said, but I didn't need to buy a book of them! Just an easy way for the author to make some extra $$.

It is meant to be read in small sections at a time, which is compatible with traveling or relaxing around the pool, fireplace, etc. It is great for finding true relaxation and hopefully inner peace.2. This book also makes a nice gift if you want to introduce someone to Tolle's writings. It does not contain some of the more controversial things (like women's pain bodies) that the \\"Power of Now\\" incuded.3.

While his writing style is exquisite and the book is pleasurable to read, the actual content is vague and unrealistic. I recently experienced the death of a loved one and got the impression that Tolle is a religious/spiritual scholar, but has never suffered hardship. His writing is very pretty, but the book is not especially meaningful or useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stillness Speaks (Walker Larger Print Books)","review":"I really love this book. It's one of Eckhart Tolle's best, in my opinion. I especially like the Walker Larger Print format. I've been having eye problems, and this is so easy to read. Another advantage of the large print is that it's easier to find the parts I marked that I want to return to. It's so easy to use like a study guide, and to have room to write in the margins, etc. I have shared this book with several friends, so it's been like our own little book club.

Imagine my surprise since I have a Bachelor's Degree in Science with a 3.8 GPA. After scanning three of his books, I donated them to charity.

How can you be in the now while you're writing? Writing involves organizing thoughts and viewing them through the lens of memory and experience. And ironically, thoughts according to Tolle take you away from the NOW. So how can you be in the \\"NOW\\" when you are engaged in regurgitating so many word in so little thought :)Is Tolle a enlightened individual as he portrays himself to be - in the very portraying he unwittingly reveals he's not. However, I do agree that he sure is realizing decent chunks of royalty payments from all his books. It would have been nice to see him credit to ancient Indian scriptures from where he borrowed his ideas by referencing appropriately.

Diana Palmer is a decent writer despite the fact that all her heroes and heroines are basically the same. The book started off good but slowly went downhill. The heroine and hero both have troubled pasts that separately would be terribly tragic but together, arghh. It's enough to drive you crazy. Not since Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley have two people been so wrong for each other. The male lead is a times viciously cruel(though not physically) and then seems to be a freakin saint.

So when I saw this CD on sale at my local Borders', I snapped it up then. I also like the sounds of \\"Looking For Love\\", \\"Stranger Eyes\\", \\"It's Not The Night\\", \\"Why Can't I Have You\\" (very eerie), and \\"I Refuse\\", which I definetly feel sums up the early '80's music era perfectly.

The Cars lost whatever \\"edge\\" they had with this album, though Shake It Up was a premonition in this regard as the group moved toward the mainstream. They were neither smart nor funny anymore....and became another MTV-friendly pop act.Some of the songs are catchy, but the overall effect is flat. Ocasek's love of the studio is ever-present, and the album probably would have been improved if he'd actually allowed all the group's members to play during its recording.I label Heartbeat City as a letdown for fans of The Cars from their beginnings, though I'm sure the 12 year olds back in '84 loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pop filler","review":"This is not even close to the best album by The Cars, but it had all the pop radio hits like \\"Drive\\" \\"You might think\\", and \\"Magic\\".

Well this disc is semi-HDCD, as during playback the HDCD light on my Denon 3910 went out near the end of several songs, sometimes adding an audible click.

But time has helped bring out the truth.The investigation never found evidence of the ramseys neglecting or abusing any of their children and the latest news we have had was that of an arrest of an INTRUDER suspect.He was cleared when his DNA didn't match that the killer left behind. The unsourced DNA that didn't come from Karr or JonBenet's parents.I have written a play - \\"Murdering JonBenet\\". It is available on Ebay.

I hope many more will receive her gift also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction NOT FACT","review":"This book is for you if you like fiction. I found this book to be a personal attack against the Ramsey's. I see from the other reviews that I am not alone.

Best features: 1. Distinguishes between memory paragdigms (must memorize) and recognition paradigms. 2. Chooses vocabulary based on NT frequency data.3. Uses only NT material for translation exercises, thus avoiding artificial constructions and strange Greek style.4. Morphological and grammatical explanations very clear, building on similar phenomena in English. 5. Homework in workbook varied; thorough drill on requisite skills before moving ahead. Incremental step by step procedure.Worst feature: pushes students to apply knowledge to vocabulary they have not learned yet; this may be sound pedagogy but a little too much and the \\"unknown\\" words are often not in the dictionary in the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but not perfect","review":"I have used this book both in my own learning and in teaching NT greek. I found it helpful and useful in avoiding many issues that are not central to learning the language (one thinks fo the two or three chapters in Machen's book dedicated to accents). Baugh's division of chapters as well as his organization of vocabulary is well thought out and a benefit to those who might easily become overwhelmed by language study. The most problematic issue with the book falls in the translation practice. All of the practice examples are bible verses (a common thread in most Greek primers) which creates issues on two fronts: 1) Well known verses do not require you to know Greek to translate them, and 2) There are many practice examples in which vocabulary is used which the student has not yet learned and some which is not present even in the glossary at the end of the book. All of that being said I still recommend this book and will continue to use it in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"This book is out of print. I don't even recall where I heard about it. As a whole it's an interesting look at brand loyalty. Saturn, Nike, Harley -- they have cult followings that rival few others. It was interesting to read the interviews with Marines and religious cult members to see how similar the sentiments are from faith to brand loyalty. But, I didn't get much of an education from it on building cult status for a brand. If you can find it, maybe it's worth the read. But don't go out of your way for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap copy...","review":"I will go straight to the point: This book came out a long time after The Power of Cult Branding, by M.

I could have unbated by breath, I was mightily disappointed. The photos were average at best, some were even white-outs. I can't imagine why those would even be included. The captions/ descriptions were placed on the page before each set of pictures and I found it very bothersome to have to flip back and forth.If only the subject matter had been a bit more compelling...oh I don't know why, but the book just did not move me. It took me about 15 minutes to read the entire book. If you are really interested in true crime/photography, any book by Weege or New York Noir are two I highly recommend.

The only precaution is that it gets quite hot while operating, and as I haven't used it for extended periods of time, I can't say if that causes trouble, but I rather suspect that if operated for an extended period, the heat may deteriorate the PVC sleeving around the end.Update: after a couple of years, I'd have to remove a couple of stars from the rating.

But, hey, history is here,these are recordings from 1956-57. Half of the cd features the great big band-Latin jazz of the Machito orchestra. They were a great band, full of great big band jazz musicians, and Herbie is not ultra featured but Man o Mann these cats wail! The other half of the recording features the west coast cool jazz of Jimmy Rowles on piano, Mel Lewis on drums, Buddy Clark bass and Herbie playing duos with the terrific Buddy Collete and both play not only flute but clarinet and alto and tenor sax! Cool baby! Please note-research the sellers. You can find some selling this one for $3-5, so don't grab one selling at $20 or more. Also, check to make sure you get the cd that features all 20 tunes, some of these are bogus offerings of only 8-10 entrees. Solid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!!

It's got some songs that have many different mixes of the same song. You can never get enough of SASH! He is just the greates trance DJ of all time, and his songs are fabulous and awesome to bob your head, dance, tap your feet, and just move to. My favourite songs from the album are \\"Just Around the Hill\\", \\"Mysterious Times\\" (both a duet with Tina Cousins), and \\"Adelante\\" which has an acordian or some thing of that sort in the background. Awesome album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Filler Story","review":"After reading this book, I found myself so bored, that I wondered why I even bothered. This story does nothing to enhance the ST:NG characters or storylines. Whoever thought of this storyline must think we will accept and enjoy anything with the Star Trek name. If I could, I would have rated this a negative star.Let's get back to good writing and exciting stories - see Captain's Blood, for an example. No more 'filler' (trying to fill in the gaps in our ST universe) stories.Maybe we should look to the Star Wars: NJO writers, as they seem to have no problem writing a book with multiple, exciting storylines and in depth characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally well-written book.","review":"In this book, we see Will Riker as a Cadet and then an Ensign; we see his father; we see Katherine Janeway as an Ensign, and we see Owen Paris, father of Tom Paris, already an Admiral. The story centers around Will and his father, although the twain never do meet; already, they're estranged. The plot, both the main one and various subplots, are all handled well, competently and with flair. We get more insight into both Will and his father; not surprisingly, Deanna Troi is not the first potential love that Will has broken up with in the name of furthering his career, nor is it surprising that his father has trouble with relationships too.Not, perhaps, of interest to the reader who isn't already familiar with the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" background world and characters unless they would find a study of a disfunctional father-son relationship in which both men are reasonable, worthwhile individuals of interest, but definitely a must for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twenty years later","review":"Bought this when it came out in 1983. Now, twenty years later, it's still amazingly enjoyable. Back then, when almost nobody had heard of Compact Discs, I'd blow their minds and their socks off with this disc. Today I listened to it for the first time in years and it's such an odd, interesting, creative batch of sound effects, songs, and experimental stuff -- not to mention some good sound-system-checking material. There's real music here and all kinds of other bizarre and interesting things. And it's not skimpy on quantity either.

Almost impossible to read with a normal blood pressure, this is the only book that I have ever thrown away. Clearly not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this book is better then the Web version!","review":"As a huge fan of Xena and Gabrielle alternative fan fiction (in particular the Uber genre) I was very interested in reading this piece - but it was very hard to finish it. The writing was passable for a story that cost nothing to read, but the web version of this book was sorely in need of editing. If severe editing hasn't taken place then you will find that the book is difficult to read due to the lame dialog and needlessly complex run-on sentences. The overall idea for the story is a good one, but its one that had already been written (and better executed) by Missy Good in \\"Tropical Storm\\". I think its wonderful that exceptional fan fiction writers are getting published, but consider purchasing novels by Sharon Bowers, B.L. Miller or Melissa Good BEFORE buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this novel on a whim, and am very happy I did. It's one of those books that you will do anything to find the time to read. The thing that impressed me the most were the charactors.

Unfortunately, I was sorely disapointed. The first two pages were unreadable - the grammar was horrible, as was the spelling.

This writer needs to go back to 8th grade English and take a refresher course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After reading the summary of this book, I was looking foward to reading it. I was very disappointed in the writing--stiff and jerky and in the characters. Alex Madison was down right mean to her lover and I have no idea what Taylor saw in this woman.

LInda has performed in many styles over the years, and produced quite a few rock-ish albums from 75-82 - this is as good as any of them, the old rockers like \\"Tell Him\\" standing up very well alongside softer or newer songs - Lies is my own favourite, but it's a hard choice to make in an album filled with top notch recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Ronstadt - Parton - Harris collaboration","review":"Those who love the \\"Trio\\" bluegrass albums that Ronstadt made with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris should take note: Their first collaboration appears on Get Closer. \\"My Blue Tears\\" is one of Dolly Parton's many beautiful creations and it gets great vocal treatment here, with Ronstadt subduing her own brassy voice to blend in with the other two. The first time I heard it, it stopped me in my tracks. I didn't even know what bluegrass was, so I guess I owe it to Ronstadt for introducing me to the whole genre. This is just one of the many surprises on this very nice, overlooked album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning formula works again","review":"I love this album. It came out at a time when new wave was becoming popular and Linda Ronstadt was a great artist of the 70's . She's at her usual versatile best here. One of my favorites is the powerful remake of \\"I knew you when\\", which proved that Linda could still belt out a tune with the best of them. One of the greatest performances I've ever heard on an album is the unbelievable \\"the moon's a harsh mistress\\". It's simply breath taking. The song is timeless. Easy for you to say is also a great song of heartbreak which linda does as good as anyone. Mr. Radio is haunting and beautiful.

Turns out this is kind of a homage to Brat Farrar and makes reference to it, but the story is very different. It's set in Canada, in the present, and it's about a young woman trying to solve an old mystery. It's still entertaining and enjoyable and fun to read, though, whether you're familiar with Brat Farrar or not. Funny and sad in parts and a well-paced mystery. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"humble pie:from the front row live","review":"this is a reissue of the king biscuit show. the king biscuit version has more songs and in a different order the quality is great but no better then the king biscuit cd. also be aware that dvd audio does not mean a film of the concert. it means one picture on the screen while each song is playing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't a soundtrack without Phoebe Cates!","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this soundtrack DOES NOT contain the song playing when Phoebe Cates takes off her bikini top. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SOUNDTRACK.

There are only 2 songs worth listening to... \\"Somebody's Baby\\" by Jackson Browne (unavailable on his albums) and \\"Sleeping Angel\\" by Stevie Nicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes there was an 80's BEFORE Madonna","review":"Although I could take or leave the movie itself, this sountrack is a great recap of the early 80's.Tracks feature some groups who back in 1982 were riding high on the charts, and probally thought that they would be around forever such as the Go Go's (Speeding), Quarterflash (Don't be Lonely), Oingo Boingo (Goodbye, Goodbye), and The Ravyns (Raised On The Radio), as well as 80's icons such as Sammy Hagar, Joe Walsh and Don Henley.The big hit from this album belonged to Jackson Browne with Somebody's Baby, proof that he can deliver a great non-political pop song.Two \\"from the vault\\" tracks also delivered sales to this album, and they are Stevie Nick's Sleeping Angel (later to appear on at least one of her compilations), and Donna Summer's Highway Runner from the then unreleased rock/new wave orientated album I'm A Rainbow (released in full in 1996).\\"Never Surrender\\" your love for the music of your High School & College Years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"This movie is the best representation of the 80's to date. It completely captures the mood and feel of the decade. I was in high school during that time, and was too young to see it when it first came out. In watching it many years later, I was instantly transported back to high school. Who, from that generation, did not know a Spicoli, or Rat or even Damone? The music really brought back memories; rocking out in the school gym, first job, first girlfriend, etc. Beyond a doubt, this movie and the music will serve as the best representation of the '80s ever filmed and recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie/O.K soundtrack","review":"This is a great soundtrack to the best 80's movie. But I find it hard to believe that they could leave out the opening number by the Go Go's titled We got the beat. How could they leave out the opening song! I also believe that some other material is missing here but maybe some of it was a little to heavy metal for a movie soundtrack like this. Also heard some music on here that I do not remember hearing in the movie like there is a song by the go go's on this cd I don't remember that song. But still a great soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saved by Oingo Boingo...","review":"I should have reviewed this along with FM. Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth. Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. This is the terrible soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed. Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book!","review":"This book is a requirement for a course that I am taking. The book is riddled with errors. You can randomly open any page from the book- and you will find typos and confusing text. On some pages, the powerpoint slides for the book do not even match with the text of the book. This is the sixth edition of this textbook. I consider it inexcusable that the book has hundreds of typos even after being published for more than ten years. As another reviewer pointed out, the additional material that is needed for the book -like SQL schemas- do not even exist in the book's website- contrary to what the book claims. Anybody who is considering this book should think twice. Please get it from the library - go through the book for a week to see what I mean- and dump the book for any book that should be better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the concepts and examples, but so many errors.","review":"This book is very comprehensive in covering all beginner aspects of database concepts. However, there are so many errors in this book I absolutely had to sell it because I couldn't stand keeping such a book. For the fifth edition I was very disappointed. The ERD symbols were incorrect, and there are typos galore. You actually have to know all about databases to actually read past the errors and understand everything. For someone who doesn't know database concepts, this book will only lead you to make errors when you try and apply the practices. I hope 6th edition is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreasonable amount of errors","review":"There are more errors in this text book than in any other text book that I have ever seen. In addition to frequency, some are huge, gaping errors in diagrams and equations that completely confuse the subject. Along with this, there is supplemental content that is mentioned in the text as being available on the website that does not even exist (at least at the time of this writing) and the content that is actually available has the quality of being produced during a weekend of absinthe binging. The quality of this text is totally unacceptable for a 6th edition and even more so considering the exorbitant price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I don't know any better database textbook to recommend,but I know this book is not one of them. Beside mention of \\"unreasonable amount of error\\", this book is not quite helpful. Some of the text is very wordy. Also, the author have been published new textbook EVERY YEAR. The homework problem is just flipping around. The chapters are just rearrange and re-word. I has to buy the new edition just because the homework problems rearrange."},{"rating":"1","title":"A typical bad CS textbook","review":"This is a required book for my undergrad Databases class. While reading over it before the semester started I began to wonder why my professor would ever choose such a terrible book. Of course it became clear when, on the first day of class, the professor began to read word for word off slides with the names of the authors sitting at the bottom along with the familiar 'cute' artwork from the cover. Note to instructors: choosing a book because it provides prewritten notes and allows you to be extra lazy is not a valid reason for choosing a textbook. The book is filled with lots of mathematical notation with few good examples. By good examples I mean those that involve realistic databases and not the 'Consider a schema R = (A, B, C, D, E)...' mathematical drivel that fills most of the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for those who can only read symbols","review":"This is quite the typical Computer Science textbook, vastly overpriced and lacking any real information. Veteran CS students will be happy to find that even the most simple concepts have been reduced to pure math, this to make sure that creative students who have no passion for math do not have an unfair advantage.If you can only read math (or prefer that everything in life is described purely in equation form), this is the best book on the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for presenting the concept.","review":"Too simplistic and way below computer science level.

It's all theories and theories and theories!I sure know what a \\"primary key\\" is or what \\"relationships\\" are and how many kinds exist, etc, etc ... but it didn't really teach me how to create it. Just one or two vague examples, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare classic book","review":"When I started teaching Database Concepts course, I used this book for my preparation. For me the content of the book was excellent and very informative. This book can be used along with the other DBMS books to understand the general architecture of DBMS, SQL, data modeling and relational theory.

Some ideas that takes a few seconds to grasp Connollys book, took me about a half an hour to grasp in this one (which I noticed when I tried to refresh my memory). The reason is that it is written in a sometimes incredibly difficult and complex way. Why? For no good reason at all, as far as I can see. The descriptions are not any more \\"rigorous\\" or \\"exact\\", they are just difficult without gaining anything. The ideas are the same.Avoid it, unless you want to waste you time with a book that makes learning 10 times slower than with a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Theory Without Any Practicality","review":"This was the required book for the Databases class at the University of Utah Computer Science department. It is a good book if you want to learn the theory behind databases. If you want to actually learn about practical information then pickup \\"The Practical SQL Handbook\\" by Bowman and others.

If the difference between pizzicato and pianissimo continues to elude you, then read on. Two aspects of this book are particularly appealing. The first is Libbey's style, which is free-flowing and chatty, conveying often difficult ideas with impressive clarity (the articles on counterpoint and fugue are cases in point). Secondly, I was impressed by his essay-style approach to his various musical subjects; unlike a musical dictionary, which would be content to stop at mere definition, Libbey's book provides background, explanations, examples and opinions that do much to round out the material in the reader's mind. An impressive work indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is compulsively readable, witty, and learned.","review":"If you like music, you'll love this book! Imagine that a wise and talkative friend, who clearly loves music himself and has a sparkling sense of humor, has undertaken to patiently and clearly explain to you what musical terms mean and why they're important. The Classical Music Companion has the tone that that friendly, well-informed voice would take. This is a compulsively readable, well-organized, beautifully laid out work that can be approached on many levels - it's suitable for \\"laypeople\\" or musicians - and that never talks down to its audience.

His defintions are packed with information and witty commentary, necessitating its use for any classical music lover. For those in the business, or just those wanting to know more, Hoffman's guide is a must have because no other reference tool is as accessible or as clearly written. Suddenly, the lexicon of classical music is no longer out of reach, but instead understandable and affordable in this wonderful guide to terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"an inexpensive introductory reference","review":"I am a fan of Miles Hoffmann's engaging and educational \\"Coming to Terms\\" segment on NPR's \\"Performance Today,\\" and this companion-style book provides an excellent source to follow with. It is like a paperback musical glossary that defines the broadest ideas and terms within the classical music world, in language that is easily understood. You will not see as much detail within the entries as you would find, say, in the thrice-as-expensive \\"Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\" (my reference of choice), nor will you find as much enthusiasm for classical music as you would encounter in Karl Haas's \\"Inside Music,\\" two factors which make the NPR book a bit middle-of-the-road. Nevertheless, given its size, price, and approachable contents, I would recommend this guide as THE reference (glossary/dictionary) to use for anyone new to classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too soon","review":"Very disappointed with CD.

As a self defense knife, it will either stab or cut, and is very easy to hold on to. As I said above, it is very light, and can even be clipped inside your shirt pocket and will not weigh the pocket down. Great little knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"This book is utter trash and an insult to anyone with even a 1st grade reading level.

I'm one of those people who likes the 70's (and lived through most of it) so I enjoyed the pop culture references, which weren't essential, but helped to give the novel a little bit of atmosphere. The plot itself is intricate, and I was taken off guard by everything that happened. I liked the characters, even though most of them were really flawed. (I think I liked Teddy the most, even though he's extremely nerdy and a bratty little rich boy, he's very funny and charming in a weird way.) I loved reading about all the aspects of planning the city and the founders' idea of an utopian community, where racism or class distinctions don't exist. Very fascinating story with a killer ending. Even though it's been over a year since I read the book, I still wonder about the characters, and what they would be doing now, etc. I heartily recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Look at the \\"Ideal\\" Community","review":"The New City is a fascinating story of the ironies inherent in a planned community, one that is supposed to be free of the troubles typical of suburbia in the 1970s.

I had the 4gb mini but needed more space so gave the mini to my wife and bought the 60gb Ipod with Video for myself. It works perfectly. Be aware that if you have accessories for other Ipods, they may not work with the Video. Firewire is one example, no matter what the geeks at Best Buy will tell you, Firewire currently is not compatable with the Ipod with Video. I'm sure it's only a matter of time till it is compatable. I also got the Apple remote control which gives my new ipod an FM radio. This is nice, but it think for the price of the Ipod, Apple should give you FM radio without having to purchase extra accessories. It's obviousley built into the Ipod. I'm 48 years old and have a ton of music. It's really nice having the ability to carry all of that music in my pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod","review":"I just recently bought a 60 GB iPod from Amazon.com and i am totally satisfied with this product!

My family was sceptical at first that you could see much on such a small screen, but the picture looks great. It is a bit of a pain however converting other forms of video for playback on the ipod. After a bit of google searching, I was able to find a good converter and I transfered some of my dvd's onto it.Also it is great in its primary function as a music player. The number of songs it holds is astounding and the quality of the playback is great. It is especially great for long car rides, I can just set a play list and let it go.I would suggest this product without hesitation to any music lover with a large collection of music that they wish to listen to on the go. The only thing is that you should also buy a case for it as soon as possible, the plastic is easily scratched and it would be a shame to mar that beautiful sleek new ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Video Ipod 60 GB","review":"Not a good compatibility with most of the song formats.

The only things would be 1. iTunes; if u lose your music in iTunes, u need a third party application to take everything off of your ipod. 2.

This suggests to me that they will fix the duds I have handed in and then resell them to somebody else. But don't try to buy one of these refurbished models. They look brand new and are under half the new price, but they will only sell you one if you have a broken one to trade in. I bet they do a roaring trade given the unreliability of these objects. They look great and the interface is a work of art. But zero reliability, zero support, and if you want it to do anything other than play music through cheap ear phones supplied with it, be prepared to pay lots extra.

I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time).Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are.

To be honest, I gotta say that the video playback even clearer than most computer screen.

Yeah... I couldn't even put my DVDs on it because Apple only accepts certain formats which are easy to put on there once you buy shows and movies from them (smart marketing).The only good thing about it is the capacity.Bottom Line: Even before I've experienced this product, I thought it was overrated.

It is crystal clear and it comes with a great wind shield and case that you do not see with mics in this price range. Buy it and I guarantee you will be buying more. This is the perfect vocal mic.

When you listen to the load album you can only stare at your stereo in disbelief comparing it to this.'Fade to Black' is a magnificent song- Metallica's first acoustic song.'For Whom The Bell Tolls'is my personel fav on the album with its thundering bass lines courtesy of the brilliant Cliff Burton and the song's poetic lyrics.I would say it is Metallica's darkest album whilst it does not have quite the same conviction and complexity as the subseqeunt 'Master of Puppets'.'The Call of Ktulu' is a genius instrumental to close the album- an eight minute epic if ever there was one.Yep it don't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great blistering music./ie early thrash!!!!!!!priod for guys","review":"go buy this one if not here somewhere its heavy its great you start off fast keep it tripping and wind up on a soft mellow end to it with call of ktulu pronouunced tooloo its great a must have more any music faanatic..buy now or later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a quintessential. Learn, 'nu-metal', learn!","review":"In these 'nu-metal' days, when numb hyper-freaks decide that there's a 'old' metal (whatever) not worth listening to, is good to remember when one was fifteen and discovered this album at the disco store (at that time was vinyl. Yeah, those days...). And it's fun to remember, in the middle of this (this) days of gabber-gabber-saturated-endless guitar loops, that one bought this album fascinated with its front cover and for its song titles ('Fight Fire with Fire', 'Fade to Black', Trapped under Ice', ...) that promised chills to the spine. But most of all, one bought it under the suspicion that this album was destined to become an endless classic. O.K. I know I know, Metallica has mellowed incredibly over the years (now they dress on Armani). But this album is incredibly raw while melodic, something that lacks every 'nu-metal' band supposed 'to be worth listening to'. So, give it a chance. Learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is definetly one of their best(Master of Pupets is also good). Creeping Death is my favorite, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a definite classic as is Fade to Black.

(Like me) knows that from Kill'Em All to...And Justice for all is the only CD's worthy of being the best!! people who listened to Metallica starting with the Black album have missed a lot!! I like Load, and I love Garage Inc., but man Re-Load was a let down to me...(but i still have it) Garage Inc. kicked major @$$! but undoubtedly the best is either Ride or Puppets!! if you even remotely like Metal then this CD should be in your Stereo at all times!! (and so should Master, Justice, and Kill Em' All!!) although that is hard to do if you don't have at least a 5-disc changer!! but if you don't own this CD a few Words of Wisdom --> \\"BUY IT NOW!!\\" if you don't like this CD then you must not like metal at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars plus","review":"This is their best, and 100 times better than Load. This is what made Metallica great. Fade to Black is their best song ever give or take One. For whom the bell tolls is a classic as is the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Fight Fire with Fire. Anyone who started with the Black Album and later needs to hear their old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smash of thrash with a touch of garnish.","review":"It is amazing to see how Metallica has changed since this album, but we shouldn't forget about them. It is thrash, and it is fast and heavy. Tracks like \\"For Whome The Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\", show Metallica's hard and heavy side, while \\"Fade to Black\\" and my personal favorite, \\"The Call of the Ktulu\\" purely show their composing capabilities. Although Cliff Burton is no longer with us, you can still get a presence of him through this recording. The bass in \\"...Ktulu\\" is crazy with the Wah and distortion and it really blends in nicly with the guitar. Of all the Metallica albums, this is my favorite, so pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD not just from Metallica but from any band","review":"Metallica at their finest! They are probably the best metal band out there. This is their best album. All the song are awesome and Fade to black is sooo heart felt. I love this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible album from the best there will ever be!","review":"Though some of their later albums may have been more well-known and even better, this is certainly an amazingly ambitious CD from the most creative band ever, thrash metal or otherwise. Everything that made them great is here, the astounding writing, the atomicly charged drumming of Lars Ulrich, the fierce bass from the deceased Cliff Burton, and the perfect combination of master Kirk Hammet's and James Hetfield's guitar work as well as the latter's chillingly angry howl. I know I will never tire of Metallica and this album or its pulse-pounding songs. The best are \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (one of their best ever), \\"Fade to Black, and \\"Creeping Death\\". If you don't buy this album, you will never know the epitomy of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"stands the test of time","review":"I've been listening to this album for 10 years (got it after ...And Justice), and although my hearing has suffered, the impact of every song on Ride the Lightning hasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps 'em all on their toes!!!!","review":"\\"Ride the Lightning\\" is one of the best albums of the 80's.

The entire thing is a Masterpiece from The fast paced \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" to the chilling yet beautiful \\"Call of Ktulu\\" The classic songs on this album have to be \\"fight Fire With Fire\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Call of Ktulu\\" Be prepared Metalheads because this ones a powerhouse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Metallica has become the enemy of the underground metal scene ever since they released the Black Album. This one is really good, and should not be judged on account of that. I do prefer both \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"...And Justice For All\\" to this one, but this is great. \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is such an underrated song. \\"Fade To Black\\" is one of the greatest metal ballads ever written. \\"Creeping Death\\" has one of Metallica's most evil riffs. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is the kind of song that gets your body moving in a synchronized mosh. I don't listen to this album too much anymore, but it was one of the important early albums that helped me cross-over into the metal world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good","review":"This is Metallica's second album of their career and is one of their best. The music is much more inspired and truer to their thrash/speed metal origins. Noteworthy tracks are Fight Fire with Fire, the title track, For Whom the Bell Tolls and Fade to Black. The other songs are almost as good though less famous. Unlike most of their contempraries, Metallica wasb not very controversial. The music makes a statement from a band in their prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This is the best Metallica album. Essential for all Metallica fans and hard rockers. Truly a great album of music. Fantastically well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"At first sound, the opening song 'Fight Fire With Fire' sounds like a classic rock ballad. But listen just a few more seconds and it will hit you like a rock. This is true Metallica heavy metal. This album was only the second time I've heard of Metallica, but it was worth the wait. My favorite songs are 'Fight Fire With Fire' and 'Fade to Black'. All around this is a great Metallica album a must for any fan! You should also check out the Metallica cover song HATEBREED did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIDE THE LIGHTNING","review":"Metalicas second album released in 1984 is undoubtebly there best effort. many people consider master of puppets to be the bands best work. but as it stands though lightning is not as technical it is faster. heavier and in most cases better than its succesor. from the melodic acoustic intro to the monstorus fight fire with fire. to the pulsepounding drumming at the end of call of ktulu ride the lightning never ceases to amaze. at just under 40 minutes ride isnt that long of an album but it combines almost every great aspect of music. and is dark. menacing. haunting. exciting captavating and epic all at once. theres so much good about this album its amazing. its one of the most emotionial and endlessely entertaining albums ive ever listened to. its so fast heavy and musically advanced i cant even explain it to you in words. theres nothing id change about this album at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN THEY COULD STILL PLAY METAL...","review":"Keep this album to remind you how this band once was great and unique.

It never grows old. This is one of my top-10 all-time favorite heavy metal albums. Every song on this album is pure genius. I have yet to meet someone who hates it. Many people say \\"Puppets\\" is their best. I feel this is really their greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"fade to black - call of ktulu","review":"i found this to be metallicas best album by far, especially because of the songs fade to black and the call of ktulu, fade to black revolves around kurt hammets great guitar, and hetfields singing the best of all metallicas lyrics ,the call of ktulu is nearly nine minutes long ,but nine minutes extremely well spent ,this song has layers, starting very soft and slowly getting faster and finally at the end going back to the original soft melody, besides these two great songs, songs like ride the lightning and for whom the bell towls are also great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride The Lightning","review":"Ride the Lightning is one of My favorite albulms that i own. That being said here are the reasons, 8 well written tracks, including one of Metallica's better known hits For Whom The Bell Tolls. The best Track on this abulm is probabably Ride the Lightning though, HARD FAST HEAVY. Typical Metallica. This is one of the better metallica albulms and a defiante must for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even a little bit better than Master of Puppets","review":"I can't compare this to any other Metallica cd except for Master of Puppets and Metallica (The Black Album). Even though I've almost heard every song of theirs from my friends and the radio I only own these three.(Which I plan to get more) So I'm going to compare it with Master of Puppets. This cd is a little bit better than Master of Puppets. With songs like Ride the Lightning, For Whom The Bells Toll, and Fight Fire with Fire this cd is a little more harder. Though Master of Puppets has great hard songs like Battery, Disposable Heroes, and Damage Inc it's not the same not for a bad way at all. Master of Puppets is definitely five stars ,but not as quite good. What i'm trying to say is that you had a choice of choosing either Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning I would suggest choosing Ride the Lightning.(I hope I didn't offend the people who like Master of Puppets better than Ride the Lightning)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"Why the hell are these guys considerd \\"thrash' when their best songs are the slow ones, on here that means Fade to Black.

I Have the CD but this LP kicks the sound of the CD. Since I Heard this record , I Discover that the LP has the best \\"Pure\\" and \\"Unadulterated\\" sound , better that the CDs and the digital files like Mp3.

Recently, I completed my Metallica CD collection by buying Ride the Lighting and Kill 'Em All. I had already heard a few songs off of this CD, so I had an idea of what it was like. Even then, I was still very surprised with the awesome quality of this album. Songs like \\"Ride the Lighting, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death\\" are all awesome Metallica songs. I personally think the highlight of this album is the classic hit \\"Fade to Black.\\" It's an awesome emotional song that packs a punch. It's one of the best slow songs ever. If you're looking for something to add to your CD collection, you can't go wrong with this CD. It's one of Metallicas finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the Foundation of Metallicas metal empire!","review":"I'm Bruce Miller, the vocalist/guitarist in SAVANT. All Metallicas CD's are awesome, this one was the first to show that they can play more then just great fast, pounding songs. Fade to Black was thier first attempt at a ballad and it has become almost and anthem to metalheads around the world! Call of Ktulu is like a metal symphoney (even before S&M). This CD shows their wide variety of talent that makes them the best damn band in the world! A must for anyone who is into metal, these guys are the founders of all metal music as it is today and one of my bands most major influences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrash talent at its best","review":"Although the album is indubitably thrash, this album is miles apart from even their first album \\"Kill 'em All.\\" James Hetfield's lyric-writing ability truly shines. One easily notices that he is grappling with some very serious issues. Songs ranging from teen suicide (Fade to Black) to capital punishment (title track) showcase his intelligence and thoughtfulness. But best of all, the album is vintage trash! Intricate, complex songs...BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conquering run","review":"I never thought I'd hear a biblical reference from metal's Four Horseman of the Apocalypse, but \\"Creeping Death\\" is just that. With songs about dieing and Punishment, Ride the Lightning is one of early Metallica's greatest attempts at ruling the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride the Lightning","review":"Truly one of the greatest metal albums ever recorded. Nothing on this album can be labeled as a filler song. This is what Metal is supposed to sound like. Many songs on this album have become classics since its debut. Any negative reviews that are written concerning this album shouldn't be taken seriously because it is flawless from beginning to end. Songs like Fade to Black, Creeping death and Ride the Lightning really add to the album's greatness. All albums of metallica starting from Kill em ALL to the black album should also be considered, all of em are truly great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ride the lightning, ride the Anger instead.","review":"How did this awful crap get 5 stars? I was a big big fan of their albums Load, Reload, and the awesome St. Anger, so I decided to give this one a try.First off, the bass is awful! I'm so glad that Cliff died, because he tried to play bass like Limp Bizkit and failed. Also, the songs are abysmal. In For Whom the Bell Tolls, they try to emulate St. Anger and put no solos in it, but it fails. And Fade to Black is an obvious attempt to be emo, but it did not make me want to cut my wrists. All the other tracks on the album are bad as well, and James' voice sounds prepubescent.Get St. Anger instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"metallica sucks and they always will!

They can do it all, fast, slow, intricate, simple, meaningful, and just plain heavy. Hats off to James because he is my god. Not only is he the best riff-writter of all time, he is the best lyric writter and front-man ever. The feelings expressed in Fade to Black goes unmatched in any non-metallica music i listen to. By god, the solos that Kirk came up are genious. The drum work is one of my favorite by Lars because it just fits so perfectally and let's not forget Cliff, the whole album is a Cliff masterpiece. I love all their albums from Kill em All to ST.Anger, the boys have never failed me and have always been there with the right song to make my day right."},{"rating":"2","title":"METALLICA","review":"Fade to black and creeping death alone is worth buying the album, but every song on it is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one's a classic","review":"Show me someone who doesn't like \\"ride the lightning\\" and i'll show you someone who obviously hates all forms of good music. this is another brilliant piece of work from metallica. Very death oriented and dark, but the lyrics are deep and the music is very original and heavy. There isn't a bad track on this cd, but \\"ride the lightning\\", \\"fade to black\\", and \\"trapped under ice\\" are the cream of the already abundant crop. There are times when the songs seem to stretch a bit too long, which is what docked one star, but this is still an amazing piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Greates Albums Ever","review":"This CD is great! Being the first Metallica CD i've ever listened to, this is the CD that got me liking the band. Ever since I heard the musical masterpiece FADE TO BLACK, I've have never found a song that you can listen to when you feel like listening to slow music, and also when you feel like listening to Hard music. This is just one of the great songs on the album, and with this, there will never be a dull moment with this CD. Go out and by it. You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's first GREAT album","review":"Metallica proved they could give variety in this album. Most of the songs are truly excellent, with incredibly impressive layers of music, especially in the classic instrumental 'The Call of Ktulu'. The songs 'For Whom the Bell Tolls','Escape', and 'Creeping Death' are some of the best metal classics to hit the 80s. 'Fade to Black' is one of my favorite songs. It's different stylistic approach could actually fall under the category of \\"melodious ballad\\", which is something Metallica didn't have until now. The other songs are O.K. to good, but I don't have to push the \\"skip\\" button like some other Metallica albums. This album and \\"Master of Puppets\\" are Metallica's most pounding pieces of work, and I highly recommend both to any die hard metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time","review":"Just go and buy the album, all of the songs on this Metallica masterpiece are great. In my opinion FADE TO BLACK is one of the greates rock songs of all time. I just have one thing to say, anyone who says that heavy metal is a dead genre is an idiot. Ride the Lightning is a metal masterpiece, and REST IN PEACE Cliff Burton aka one of the greatest heavy metal bassists of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"An amazing album, give Metallica a nice headbang and buy the album if you're a big Metallica. Because this is thrash metal at it's best. With songs like For Whom The Bell Tolls, Fight Fire With Fire, Ride The Lightning, and Creeping Death gets you Frantic. Then there is other great songs that sound like a nightmare that feels real like Escape and Trapped Under Ice. You also have a soft song if you're not into thrash metal like Fade To Black. If you don't like James voice then you suck, but you do get the great song without words like The Call Of Ktulu. Anyways, Ride The Lightning is an art masterpiece that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica is No. 1","review":"the album is awesome!

I am 14 years old so I wasn't introduced to Metallica's old albums like this one until recently. After buying the black album, S&M;, and the not so great load albums, I decided to try some of Metallica's old stuff. I went and bought this album and Master of Puppets. These albums were so different and so much better than their more recent albums. I now realize what Metallica is all about. It took a few listens for it to grow on me but now I can't stop listening to it. In fact I'm listening to it as I'm writing this review. The original Metallica guitar riffs and Hetfields awesome vocals make this album a classic. My personal favorite on here is Fade to Black. This has some incredible guitar solos. It starts out slow, but viciously builds up into a heavy fury.For those of you who have only heard post-black album Metallica, buy this and all other pre-black albujms and you will realize how great Metallica really is"},{"rating":"2","title":"The songs I used to learn to play the guitar","review":"I have to say that this is one very nice metal album. I prefer Master of Puppets, but if this is all you have don't worry. It stands on its own in the world of metal. Metallica, sell-out or not, have undeniably put out some pretty damn good releases. Ride the Lightning being among the two best. I highly recommend picking this cd up and playing it very very loud. A nice look into the brilliant past of Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"\\"Ride The Lightning\\" is, by far, my favourite Metallica album! Sure, \\"Master Of Puppets\\" has it's glory, but this masterpiece has the energy, the fire and the speed that, in my opinion, beats the hell out of MOP. My album top 5 goes something like this:1. the sad, yet powerfull ballad \\"Fade To Black\\" (my favourite Metallica song after \\"One\\")2. the lethal \\"Creeping Death\\"3. the heroical \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\"4. the fearless \\"The Call Of Ktulu\\"5. the angry \\"Ride The Lightning\\"Of course, I like all of the tracks because they all give me a free and powerfull feeling that get's me right back on track when I feel down! This album is also special for me because it represents a giant leap from the childish \\"Kill 'em All\\" to the mature and powerfull Metallica we know or used to know...In conclusion, \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is an album worth listening and it's 8 tracks are going right to the point of Metallica in it's best componence and at it's best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic album, but do now buy the 2008 vinyl reissue","review":"Ride the Lightning [Vinyl]Metallica Ride the lightning is a fantastic album, by far one of Metallica's best, but buyers beware DO NOT buy the 2008 warner bros. vinyl LP Reissue. sound quality is flat and is INFERIOR to the cd version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Metallicas second album and arguably their best. Starting with a short piece of classical guitar changing into the hard thrasing sound of \\"fight fire with fire.\\" The next song \\"ride the lightning\\" is weak in my opinion though. with not that much musical variety. \\"Fade to Black\\" is a slower metallica at its best. A good song that is rarely mentioned is \\"escape\\" with the message of indepdence and individuality from the masses of others. Hetfield sings his best on this. Another intresting song is the 5 minute instrumental \\"call of ktulu\\" which can give a creepy sense better than most other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Metallica","review":"This is, in my opinion, the best album ever recorded, by Metallica or by anybody else. I've listened to this album hundreds of times, and never get tired of it. From the melodramic Fade to Black to the blistering Fight Fire with Fire to the almost poetic Call of the Ktulu, this album typifies everything Metallica and metal in general is and tries to be. Every riff and every song is a masterpiece within itself, with each song better than the last. It is listening to this album that inspired me to learn the guitar, and to attempt to do (but never in a million years match) the amazing things that James and Kirk do on Ride the Lightning. If you got into Metallica from the Black album, you absolutely need to get this album to realize what Metallica truly is. They are not the trite and poorly composed riffs of the past few albums, they are the raw energy, power, and grace of Escape, Creeping Death, and every other song on Ride the Lightning. You must experience this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's 2nd Best album, its damn good","review":"I was not expecting much of the album when I bought it. I thought it would be alright. I was wrong. It starts with \\"Fight ire With Fire,\\" the fastest (garbage) metal song on that album. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" has the most powerful riffs, they stuck in my head for a long time. \\"Fade to Black\\" is a great ballad with one of my favorite metallica solos. \\"Creeping Death\\" is the second fastest song, and its really good! I'd say my favorite song is \\"The Call of Ktulu,\\" an 8 minute plus instrumental song, and it is just amazing. Definetely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just really, really good metal!!!","review":"It's better than Kill 'Em All but not as good as Master Of Puppets. It's the epic, anthemic rock of Metallica we all grew to love in the early 80's but didn't stay with us for long. Cliff Burton was brilliantly gifted and Kirk Hammett has some of the fastest fingers ever given to a human being. Fight Fir With Fire, Ride The Lightning, For Who The Bell Tolls... trademark Metallica. Best song on here, and probably Metallica's best song ever, Fade To Black. But don't get used to this, only one more like this to go and it's off the path we go."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best now heard at it's best","review":"I am going to keep this short and to the point. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is an amazing album, but you haven't really heard it until you heard it on the gold disc. The superior sound quality takes this classic album, and let's you hear it the way it was meant to be heard, clear and without defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"No title required","review":"If you're a metal fan and haven't heard this, you're missing out on an important milestone in the genre. Songs like \\"Fade To Black\\" (one of the band's finest works ever) and \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" will go down as metal classics. The instrumental \\"Call of Ktulu\\" illustrates this superior band's ability to produce quality music without the aid of vocals. Even though it's only four and a half minutes long, \\"Escape\\" is one of my personal favorites. Honestly, there is not a single weak track on Ride The Lightning. This is one album nobody should be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woa","review":"Now that's a metallica album.Fight Fire With Fire- 10/10 sweeeetRide the Lightning-10/10 I love the first riffFor whom the bell tolls- 11/10 heavy...my favFade to Black- 10/10 one of the bestTrapped under ice- 9/10 coolEscape- 5/10 nahCreeping Death 8/10Call of the Ktulu 10/10 great instrumental"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Metallica CD EVER!!!!!!!","review":"This is definetely the best Metallica CD out there.

I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great metallica","review":"this is definetly not metallicas best but sure is up top on my list. most songs are great except for escape, and ktulu. buy puppets, then kill, then maybe this one. you will still be amazed at the solos and double bass that lars does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Up Your (Butt)!","review":"Is it me, or was just about everything a lot cooler in the past? For instance, back in the '80s, Metallica was known for pounding, crushing, headbanging METAL, and now they're known for ripping fans off and liking money. It's a sad state of affairs.But I digress. \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", to the epic \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", the beautifully written semi-ballad \\"Fade To Black\\", and, of course, the metal classic \\"Creeping Death\\", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!Anyway, yeah, this one's a classic. Buy it, and steer clear of emo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential's there, but too many weak spots","review":"The highlights of this album are clear: Fade to Black + For Whom the Bell tolls. The rest of this is just plain boring. Unfortunately, this is one of the more overrated bands of all time, but kids just can't see that becuaes there are so few other bands worth listening to. Save your money or go buy some old Judas Priest - it's better than this noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.. didnt impress me as much as st anger, but worth a try","review":"eh... simple 80s guitar solos, long hair, leather jackets... how many of these black sabbath rip off bands do we need?metallicas finest album is st anger. black album the debut was okay but i hate the filler solos, solos take up to much precious singing time"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see what the big deal is... St Anger was the album that blew me away.","review":"Why is this album highly praised? Was it becuase the movie OLD SCHOOL had it in the background? maybe so.Metallica sucks. The only decent albums they have are load and reload and their masterpiece ST anger. Their first 5 albums are really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 GOOD SONGS BUT STILL 1 STAR.","review":"I would like to edit my review because this has 2 good songs in For Whom The Bell Tolls, and Fade to Black. I'm not a huge Metallica fan. I just like about 3 of their good albums in Black Album, Master of Puppets, and this Ride the Lightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definition of thrash metal is Metallica's Ride the Lightning","review":"First of all if your not even a fan of Metallica you should deffinetly own this album. It is simply brillant. Every song is good and worth listening to. It has some great songs like the heavy thrash metal of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" to the slower more calmed down \\"Fade to Black\\". The intro of the album \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" will tell you what the albim is all about. A heavy thrash record with bits and pieces of lighter not as heavy songs. All in all this is a great record. I recommend it not just Metallica fans but fans of hard thrash metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record for historians...","review":"This album presents the 80's heavy metal (as much as Kill 'em All). It is a great album featuring songs written by Dave Mustane, currently on Megadeth. Fast, fast, and.... fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Ride the Lighting is the second best album of Metallica's career, and musically it is leaps and bounds over Kill 'Em All. The most well-written song has to be Fade to Black, which was their first of many \\"acoutic to effortless overdrive\\" epics. All in all, Lightning is a classic, but again, is not the best Metallica album ever - though it's damn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"more like 4.5 stars","review":"This is Metallica's second album released in 1984 and in my opinion is their best one.Fight Fire With Fire- 3.5 it's ok- not fan of vocalsRide the Lightning- 4 good title trackFor Whom the Bell Tolls- 5 classic in it's ownFade To Black- 4 great songTrapped Under Ice- 3 not bad- a little repetitiveEscape- 2 bad,bad song....horribleCreeping Death- 6 personal favoriteCall of Ktulu- 4 instrumentalThis may not seem like I should have rated 4.5 stars but overall this is a well-rounded album, and i would recommend it to anyones metal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The only problem I have with it is that the sound quality isnt as good as it should be, but any old school metallica fan should buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent precursor to \\"puppets\\"","review":"This album was my introduction to speed metal back in the day. It blew me away then, and I still enjoy it today. I strongly prefer Master of Puppets, so go for that one first if you don't already have it, then come back to Ride the Lightening to see where that came from, then go back yet again to Kill Em All. All three of these albums are amazing, and all have something unique to offer. I think listening to them in reverse order helps you appreciate the earlier albums because you recognize details that will later reach their full potential on Puppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Anger, it's not... Thank God for small miracles.","review":"No this isn't St. Anger. This is good. This album shows a young band still hungry and putting their talents to full use. \\"St. Anger\\" shows an old band desperate to get back its old fanbase. \\"Ride The Lightning\\" shows the band as the innovators and leaders they were. \\"St. Anger\\" shows a band willing to jump on a trend to look current. This is where they were true metal not \\"Nu metal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sceptical.....","review":"At first, i was sceptical when my son bought this cd. But after hearing him play it, despite the song subjects, i learned that these people were great musicians. This is is better than my son getting some parental advisory cd, like Marylin Manson or Korn. I think this cd is good enough to listen to if you are mature enough to understand the meanings of lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Thrash","review":"One OF the classic albums of metallica.

It appears she will outgrow it in another month, but by then I'll feel comfortable putting her in her crib. This is a great purchase if you live in a two story house and want an easily portable place for your baby to nap. It is nice not to have another large piece of baby furniture to store, as this is small and could even be used decoratively to hold stuffed animals, etc. Negatives: The liner shrunk when I washed it (I followed instructions)so I had to add extra ribbon ties to hold it closely to the basket all the way around. I have to use a pillowcase as a sheet when the sheet that came with the basket is dirty (often, with a newborn). Moses basket sheets I found online were too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"too floppy","review":"i was very disappointed when this basket arrived all bent out of shape. i tried straightening it out by hanging it with some weight in it, but the sides simply wouldn't stay up. canopy part velcros onto basket, but it does not stay on well since the curves don't match up. it is not well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Basket, great price!","review":"I received this basket today and I love it, the bedding is reversible and both sides are gorgeous! The canopy/hood is a great feature and attaches easily with velcro so it stays on securely (the bedding probably should have been stored separately in a plastic bag, since it was stuck to the velcro when the package arrived). My only hesitation is this - how would you keep the handles from flopping onto the baby? They are very long and hang right over, into the bottom of the basket. Maybe they could be tied back. It's a tiny drawback for such an attractive and functional item, and such a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"VELCRO?!?!?","review":"This basket looks so sweet and nice in the picture, but when I pulled it out of the box I couldn't believe that the hood was attached with VELCRO!! I was SOOOOOOO disappointed. I can't believe it doesn't clearly state that in the description and no other reviewer thought to mention it! The velcro completely ruins what would have been an otherwise perfect basket. So, if you don't mind cheap, tacky-looking velcro, then this basket is okay (for the price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made :-(","review":"I bought one moses basket, and then had to order another one due to a quality defect, and they both ended up getting returned. On the side of the basket, where the handles are located, the basket was either poorly wrapped or wasn't wrapped at all and the sharp basket material stuck out. I was bummed that I had to pay for shipping for both items and then had to return them as well. I really liked the idea of having a removable top piece but I would shop around for other baskets before purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work and had to return it.","review":"As soon as i opened the box, I could tell it was badly made and did not fit my need to be sturdy as I wanted to take it along our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless for us","review":"I was so excited to get this cute basket. I actually got it for my birthday before my LO was born. I used it once because my daughter loves to be held. When she does need to be put down she prefers something softer and where she can actually look around. This offers no view of anything and it's very floppy. I envisioned myself carting my baby around with it but definitely not."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const P=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-4760391f"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/1.md","filePath":"library/1.md"}'),H={name:"library/1.md"},j=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{R as __pageData,j as default};
