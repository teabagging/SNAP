She really enjoys the freedom of being able to move around. Regarding the other reviews- my daughter hasn't bumped her head but, that being said, I can see how it might be possible if baby were to lean back. I guess our daughter is just content to go up and down. Perhaps you should raise the jumper a little bit and that way the baby wouldn't be able to push so far to the side? In any case, we have been really happy with this item!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and embarrassed","review":"I received the item at the time promised but the package was seriously torn apart because it was just heavy paper. A cardboard box should have contained the item. Someone had taped it all over, but I was unsure if it was damaged or if parts were missing. There was no time for adjustments. At the baby shower I had to apologize for the appearance of the item. Another person at the event had the same thing happen to their package(also sent by you!). I will never order anything from you again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT","review":"We are extremely unhappy with this jumper. While my daughter is in the upper percentiles for heighth, we didn't feel that we could use it @ four OR five months because the seat is so deep. She continually hit her mouth on the tray. Also, it is very hard to adjut to the right heighth. I have seen other jumpers that work much better, and we will purchase one of those!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I bought this doorway jumper because it looked like a fun one for my daughter. We put her in it right when she was 4 months old (manufact. recomm.). She just kinda sat in it and was mouthing the edge of the seat where the fabric meets the plastic. I thought it might take her a few tries to get used to it. I proceed to take her out of it and notice that her lips are blue. Upon further inspection the whole inside of her mouth is blue! The dye from the seat leached/seeped into my baby's mouth. I returned it to Babies R Us and bought the Graco Bumper Jumper and now I am quite happy. Also the Evenflo did not bounce as easily as the Graco for some reason? I still cannot believe that Evenflo would make a product with SUCH a blatant safety issue. Makes me leery of my other Evenflo baby items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid design","review":"I read a few reviews when I bought this jump and go, some were good and some were bad. I really wanted this particular one because it had toys on it for him to play with. I had read one review that said her jump and go was fraying on the strap. I was hoping it was just hers. Well it isn't. My son is only 7 months old and the strap has already frayed enough for it to be unsafe for him to be in it. This is a very poor design. The strap rubs right up against the plastic so every time your child jumps it is wearing away on that strap that holds them up. I had a Graco one before this one and I highly recommend that one. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. You will end up having to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy your kid a concussion","review":"everyone's right, this is designed terribly. first thing my 6month old did was put his head back, let go of his feet, and swing to one side and knock his head on the doorway.this thing OBVIOUSLY needs a wider tray, all the way around, to prevent them from hitting their heads. i don't know what's wrong with the designers. it's so obvious i'm embarassed i even bought the thing.after reading all these reviews, if they still don't change the design, they're begging for a class action lawsuit.buy the Jumparoo. we've used that for two months, it's his favorite toy and he has never even had a minor bump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes ... not the best bouncer option","review":"We bought this bouncer as well as an \\"excer-saucer\\" type. My humble advice: stick to the \\"excer-saucer\\"'s. The doorway jumpers are inherently dangerous. The first day my son was in it, he pinched his fingers, whacked his head on the door jamb, and gnawed on the edge of the doorway. I am sure that this item had its use at one time, but I strongly feel that the excer-saucer bouncers are much better in design and safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.....","review":"My sister, who is a mother of three, recently purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my three-month-old son, since all of her kids have adored similar products. At first it was really slow going, since he did not get the concept of jumping, but in the mean time he loved playing with the light up and musical toys. Now that he is four months old he magically figured out that his legs could be used for jumping!! He absolutely loves his toy!! The only downfall that we have noticed is when our baby's head has had a couple close calls with the doorframe!! We have gasped and ran to his aid, but no contact has been made yet, we might just be paranoid first time parents. Nevertheless, we fixed this little problem by placing a folded blanket propped up behind his head...like I said, so far, so good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm happy with it despite its bad reviews","review":"Originally, after reading all the negative reviews, I bought the less expensive Johnny-Jump-Up, the one without the tray. It didn't work very well, though. It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be. I ended up returning it and getting this version instead. People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier than the first one we tried. Also, our little guy really likes the toy tray a lot. It does not seem at all dangerous if your doorway is wide and if you supervise your baby while he's playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best jumper","review":"We were given two different jumpers and this one is far inferior - it doesn't bounce nearly as well as the Graco, which our kid LOVES.

I read some of the other reviews that gave it poor ratings...I mostly used the jumper in the french door opening to our bedroom so I never had a problem with him banging his head on the door frame as some of the other reviewers mentioned. I did, however, use it in single door frames and never encountered a problem either. My son is a big boy for his age, so my only regret was the short time he was able to use it.

This is the second time I have to call Evenflo about this matter, they replaced it once and this one is doing the same thing. In addition the sistem makes a lot of noise when my baby jumps. The actual issue is that when the baby jumps he also spin slowly and the strap begin to make friction wearing the elastic esealy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price!!!","review":"I have bought this jumper for my 6mos. old baby and boy he hates it!!! not only he doesn't like it he cries everytime when I try to have him sit in it but I know he likes the one my niece used to have which's the one by Graco and it's actually less expensive than this one and which I also should have bought. I think the problem with this jumper is that it makes a loud noise from the spring and does not have a bumper around the edges and most of all the seat cover itself is way too big for the smaller babies which i do not understand why they didn't make it to be adjustable. I mean there are smaller babies out there you know not just fat babies!!

I put my 4 month in it and he tilted to one side and he couldn't even jump or move in it. Ours came put together wrong, but there isn't anything we can do to rectify their manufacturing mishap. My son is a large 4 month old so I know it isn't because he isn't big enough to bounce in it. I would not buy it. It is going back to the store and we are going to buy the old fashion johnny jump up. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it, but hang it wisely","review":"My son (who is now almost six months) at first wasn't too thrilled to be in this thing. Once he figured out how to jump, we can't hardly keep him out of it!Caution: Read the directions. I would NOT hang it in a normal-sized doorway. We have double doors leading in to our master bedroom and I hang it right in the middle. I could easily see him banging his head or pinching his hand between the seat and the door frame in a small opening. Give them lots of room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Difficult to Get Baby In and Out","review":"My 8 month old son enjoys bouncing in this seat every now and then. What drives me crazy is getting him in and out of this contraption. I have given up trying to do it by myself. It now offically takes both my husband and me.

It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end.

But that being said, I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. My baby had a great time in her jumper and it was a fabulous way to burn of fifteen minutes. Anymore than that and I recommend an Exersaucer. I mean, how long can you just jump before it gets boring. Just put the jumper in a wide doorway and you won't have the problem of the baby hitting their hand against to doorway or whatever people complained about. And for god's sake, when your kid is over like 20 pounds move on to something else.

She completely obliterates the melody to fit it into her shrinking range.And the production is so amateurish--it sounds like an old demo fromthe 1980's, full of cheesy synths. Add to that the stale \\"Duets\\" concept,and you have a disaster from start to finish.

Where's an acoustic piano? Not one horn? Not even a small string section? This must have been a pretty low budget project.If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's. Then try some of her music from the \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Deja Vu\\" period.But don't waste your money on this one.

We are going through 1 every week or two with very modest output. We used to get at least 8 weeks from the HP 720 with similar test output. I had seen a few people post that the ink usage seemed excessive, but this is ridiculous. We have spent more on black ink in the past 3 months than the cost of the printer.

Needless to say the price for the head plus the service charge would be higher than buying a new one.

I got one which worked unreliably for a couple of months then died; Epson sent me another which refused to take in paper; they sent me another which never once printed without gaps in the printout, and finally they sent me a fourth which I still have, which has caused more grief and frustration than any other piece of hardware I've ever owned. I spend half my time cleaning the print heads; I can do this ten times in a row and still get printouts with blank horizontal lines running through it.

You have to go through the cleaning cycle about ten times every time the heads clog, and that sucks the ink very fast.The picture quality is great if you set the drivers up right, but the factory \\"photo\\" setting is horrible. Figuring out how to get the settings right took lots of time, ink, and epson photo paper. The new drivers helped, but not much.We previously had an Epson 740 and loved it, but we wanted the 6 color printing. The pictures do look better, but just not worth the cost of ink.

Simple - one word - inks. This stupid machine defines the word \\"unreliable\\" when it comes to inks, or more likely the print heads. It will GUARANTEED screw your print just when you need it most, cause you need to clean your heads, and once you start it literally takes AT LEAST 10 cleaning cycles to actually get anywhere near clean. Many times just the cleaning of it would kill the rest of the ink in the cartridge, so you waist more time and money.I used to love Epson brand and how far they've come from the dot matrix days, but I think I'm permanently switching to Canon now.

A typical mode is to have one of the colors dry up in short order or clog, and then have to replace the whole cartridge to get a decent color balance. Integrated 5 color cartridges may be a bad idea.The unit is also very noisy and slow as it prepares to print and no speed demon when printing either.I just noticed that it was rated in last place out of 11 printers in Consumer Reports. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst printer ever","review":"This is the worst printer I've ever used. The print quality on both pictures or text is [poor], to say it nicely. On pictures, the colors look nothing at all like reality. Occasionally I can get some semi-decent pictures (i.e. everyone isn't green) out but that's only after cleaning the head literally about 5 times and going through several iterations of the alignment function. Essentially, if this printer sits for more than a day, you need to go through at least 15 minutes of cleaning and alignment before you have some sort of decent printing-- whether its pictures or text. I've tried their technical support many times and it is as poor as the printer itself. I recommend staying as far away from Epson products as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice quality printing but problems detecting ink cartridges.","review":"Works well during first three months, but quality declines for those with heavy printing needs.

Paradigmatic. Just take $150 and light a match to it rather than spend it on this. Save yourself the trouble of unpacking it and the insults of its pitiful performance. Or I guess you could buy it and drive it straight to the landfill if you can't stand to actually burn $150 in US Currency, which I think may be a crime anyway. So I guess the best advice is to simply not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"short life-span","review":"I purchased my Epson Stylus Photo 820 in February of 2002.

If you don't print constantly from it, you will have to clean the heads every time you use it. 85% of the ink I have burned in this little nightmare has been from running cleanings on it. I am running to the office supply store pretty much every time I have to use it because it's out of ink, even though I'd barely used it since the last time I dropped a bunch of cash on a stupid ink cartidge. Junk. Also: the software for the printer won't let you run a head cleaning if there's no colored ink left, even if you've got enough black ink to print 200 pages. In that scenario, you have to go buy a colored ink cartridge just to make the stupid machine work to print black and white word documents. This thing sucks so much that it's making me irate just thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible printer","review":"The printer jammed and when I cleared the jam it kept believing it was still jammed.

I have had four dating back to the original Epson Color Stylus. Tried an HP back then ('94) and had miserable results. Only reason I usually upgraded was to get better technology. I found this stream of poor reviews because I have become exasperated with cleaning the heads on this printer. I just printed out a color document (with text) just fine. Less than twenty minutes later and I couldn't print out B&W to save my life. Not so much as a drop of black ink on the page! I think the only way I'll be buying another Epson is if I can clean only the B&W, I don't need color to print B&W, and I read where they have improved the problems with the ink clogging.

It is very pretty and comes with a highly reputed name, but beware -- after a day or so (a week if you are lucky) of flawless results, the nightmare starts. Photos appear in the wrong colors, or with unsightly bars through the image. You wonder, how could it be? -- this is a new printer! But you soon find that your impressive looking printer is merely biding it's time, drinking your ink, and (late at night, when it thinks you're asleep) laughing softly and maniacally at your panic and unease. Unarguably an evil invention by Epson's finest shamsters. You will buy much expensive ink, and cry many tears of frustration before throwing the beast away (where it will sit invitingly next to the dumpster to attract a new fool of a human being). On the bright side, if you are masochistic, you will love this printer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real cash drainer","review":"I am disappointed with the Epson 820 for the simple reason that it eats up ink like creazy! I don't print in colour and I can see the ink go down just as fast as the black ink. And guest what...when the colour is empty, the printer refuses to print. (How nice for Epsons pockets) If you read on the internet there seam to be a problem with the consistency of the chip (i.e. sometime it shows to be empty when it's not).I can't complain about the quality of the pictures that has come out of the printer except for the ink consumptionSo if you don't plan on printing in colour DON'T BUY EPSON 820 and even if you what to print colour, chances are that you will find it cheaper on the long run to go to any store such as Future Shop, London Drugs, Staples, ... then printing with the Epson 820."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photo quality - when it has ink","review":"This printer has superb photo-quality printing for printers in its price range. The text quality is acceptable but not fantastic.The ink cartridge nozzles dry out after about 2 days of inactivity, requiring an ink-consuming process of nozzle checks and head cleanings. The software indicating ink status estimates \\"pages remaining\\" but frequently misrepresents new cartridges as low, and older cartridges as empty when they continue to print. And the ink status levels inexplicably drain down from day to day without prints occuring.All in all, this printer is junk. While the photo quality continues to impress me, it takes too much fussy cleanings, maintenance, and trips to the store to buy ink than should be required for a reliable piece of machinery in the 21st century.Avoid it and similar Epson printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"drinks ink like crazy!","review":"My 820 seemed like a bargain for its low price and seeminly high dpi and such, but the bargain turned into a money pit.

I now own an HP 7350 that looks just as good and it printed 135 4x6s on oneset of cartridges.The whole borderless feature is overated.

If you are using it for photos only, it might be okay (albeit, still not great). However, if you need to use if for printing on paper, be prepared for some major frustration. Paper gets jammed repeatedly (even heavier weight paper) and the quality is poor when it does decide to work. I've already sent back one and am currently using the new replacement printer. Same old jam problems...same poor quality. I've wasted at least 2 1/2 hours on the phone with their customer service people(who were very nice I have to admit) and have wasted additional time packaging up and returning their products.

It is usually one-two weeks interval while it is working, after that one of the colors disappears. One cleaning procedure doesn't help, I've usually repeat it for the five-six times and no results. Very often after cleaning cycles results even worse then before. I've noticed sometimes cleaning doesn't help, but it magically starts working on other day. This printer has its own temper, and it never prints when you want :( and you never know will you be so lucky today to get something decent out of it.Overall picture quality is pretty good. It likes only Epson paper, when I've tried HP Premium Photo paper I didn't get any good results.Considering overall quality and reliability I would never recommend this printer to anyone, as well as any Epson at all.

It went through ink very quickly, it was very noisy, and the paper feed worked about 50% of the time.

I lowered the cutting deck one notch (even though my lawn had not been mowed in a few days) and gave it a spin. The mower engine seemed to run smoother and quieter with this blade installed. The cutting quality is superb. No clumping at all (clumping was a huge problem for me previously) and the mulched clippings were small and uniform in size. This blade creates a nice looking cutting pattern which gives the lawn a professional look. Definitely worthy of a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is not universal at all","review":"The quality is good. However, it is not universal at all notwithstanding the ad on Amazon.

The stark contrast of the red wheelbarrow and white chickens on a gray rainy day instantly paints a picture in my mind. WCW had a lot of new ideas (at the time) of how poems should be written and what they should accomplish.

I am concerned with the DVD transfer issued by WaterBearer Video. I purchased both Passolini box sets and was very disappointed with the quality of the video. The transfer of Porcile was the worst.The source print was so covered with dirt that it often appears to be raining in this beautiful film. The DVD contains artifacts from the end of each film reel. I have never seen anything like this in a DVD release.But the worst oversight is the fact that two of the film reels are out of order! This film is confusing enough without this problem. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell was this?","review":"Porcile was the worst movie I have seen since Thugs life in DC. The part i did not like was when pocile did not pursue Lentil after his hut was burned down by Davy Crocker's gang.

See porcile 2:Lost in Cyberspace, it is rad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, terrible DVD","review":"Like most Pasolini films, this is a beautiful film.Unfortunately, like most of Water Bearer's Pasolini releases, this is by far one of the worst looking and sounding DVDs I have ever seen.The sound is hissy and scratchy, like a destroyed vinyl record.The color is weak and pale.The picture itself is scratchy, dirty and shaky: a thick, distracting layer of crud over the picture surface.Worst of all, the subtitles are terrible: hard to read, and irremovable from the screen.There are also no chapters on this disc: the whole film is one long chapter.I honestly don't know why Water Bearer even bothered to license the Pasolini films because it seems they did absolutely NOTHING to prepare them for proper release. It's sad and completely disrespectful to the work. Hopefully, sometime in the future Criterion or a similar company will acquire these films and do a nice job presenting them. The 2004 Criterion version of Momma Roma is absolutely wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of themes","review":"If you are looking for a strange film to watch, you cannot go wrong with Porcile, one of Pasolini's most interesting efforts as a film maker. The theme is a twisted look at fascism through two dominant stories - that of a mountain cannibal and his trials - and that of a wealthy beorgois ex-nazi family.Though this film is a very startling metaphor of humanity and its reasons for downfall (like Salo) it is not the smoothest of Pasolini's films - it certainly lacks the cohesive structure of 'the trilogy of life' while it embraces an equally complicated subtext. Therefor, it is an extremely difficult film to judge or review. I certainly enjoyed watching it - in what was not the best transfer possible, to say the least.I recommend this one - but I would like to recommend Pasolini's finer works first like 'Oedipus Rex, the 'Decameron', 'Salo, 'Accatone', and of course 'Mamma Roma'."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the original version of porcile","review":"The copy of the film has not the original montage (I know that because I know the original film). Instead the sequences are put together partly in the wrong sequency (for example: people are being arrested after they have been executed in the scene before)! Apart from that you see edit gaps of the film reel after every sequence!

Every page contains at least one un-truth, which researched more throughly, and in some cases even at all, would have been of great help to those adamently reading this book. Also, almost every shread of information about Disney's new theme park Animal Kingdom seems to be made up, considering the book went to presses several months before even the soft opening for press members.

It's hard to believe that she even knows how to read, let alone write. The book is tacky and basically makes her look bad for willingly placing herself in a sitation like she claims she was in. She's not naive, she's too old to be and she looks like she has been around enough to have known exactly what was going to possibly go on. The women she writes about are not personal love 'slaves' of Hef, because no one makes these women stay there. This wanna-be 'author' comes across as a woman who is bitter because she could not qualify as a playmate, nor could she qualify as a woman who could live permanently in the mansion. She refers to Hef as being like a 'grandpa', but judging from the lines on her face, she could be referred to as a 'grandma'. Don't waste your time.

By that time, you have formed an opinion of him and the other characters and story line have already been developed. This made Tyrell seem shallow and one-dimensional. Even afterwards we never really know what's going on in his head.I found myself skimming over parts I felt were added to make the book longer.

For example, the author talks about the parts of the gun, but then neglects to have a diagram of what those parts are. At the same time, his advice is very, very basic, so someone who already knew what they were doing may not get much out of this book. There is always a tip or two that anyone can pick up from reading a book, but I think there are books better suited for either the beginner or a more advanced trap shooter. This one isn't really right for either, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty basic and getting out of date...","review":"Potential readers should be aware of two facts about the first edition: (1) There is NO mention of the Palm III or O.S. 3; happily, much of what is true of the Palm Pilot carries over to the Palm III, but how is one to know what?; (2) Some 183 pages of the 320 pages of text (57% of the book!!) is devoted to descriptions of third party software. (3) In many cases SEVERAL versions of the shareware/freeware have come and gone since the version numbers mentioned in the text. More current information is readily available on the web. (4) Many problems in Chapter 4 (Troubleshooting...) refer to long dead versions of the operating system.

It lacks detailed information on basic concepts including \\"graffiti\\" and other details that even a novice will need.

In summery, this book is too simple for even beginners and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was looking forward to Mr. Parker's book on the PalmPilot, the most useful PDA I have used. I was dissapointed. There is very little information in the book that could not be obtained by reading the manual or just playing with the Pilot. Much of the book is devoted to cataloging software available- this information is readily available for free on the Internet. The software on the CD-ROM has a few good programs but unless you want lots of silly games, several Periodic Tables of the Elements or many calculators it is waste. I do not get the impression that much thought went into software selection or even the book. As Mr. Parker states, those WITHOUT Intenet access will find this book most useful. If you can read this review, that counts you out."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"This book is very interesting to read, since it covers a broad range of information about Multiplayer Gaming. But you shouldn't expect every MM secret to be lighted up in this one book. It is a book with dozends of chapters about many aspects of MM gaming, so it is a good starting point to enter the topic and get a broader knowledge of what MM games are and what aspects you have to think about. In my opinion, you will need more books in addition to this (such as the gem series or MM2)."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book has given me the tools to transform my life","review":"If you need to reafirm your faith or get your life back on track, you will find the answers to a better - happier - and more successful life in the \\"Angel First Aid R/X For Success. the contents of this book really contributed to my happiness and success. this book definitly rates 5 stars.thank god for the \\"ANGEL LADY\\" and the wisdom she can portray to us in her outstanding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bumpy Ride","review":"I'm learning database administration for the first time, so I've been sequentially working through this book. I've made it past 200 pages running all of the commands and scripts; however, I've had to do a lot of outside research in the product documentation and internet forums to get the stuff to work. I've marked up the margins of this book like crazy. Key pieces of the examples are omitted, and some information is just plain wrong (e.g. names of AWR SQL scripts). Being forced to do outside research can help you learn the material better I guess, but the time could probably be better spent if all you want is your certification. One of their commands to move EM from SYSAUX to another tablespace totally corrupted my database console service and forced me to install a new database instance.

However, this book is even worse since its space limitations means that the author is forced to be even more cryptic than the already difficult to understand product documentation. I could not find anything useful in this book - the book doesn't explain anything. Nothing at all. Aren't books like these supposed to simplify concepts for nonexperts or beginners?

Beside the 1.5x factor (which really makes this lens more like a 75mm) it is TACK SHARP. Whether you shoot macro or for general shooting for portraits. This glass is going to give you the sharpness you need, the color you wish for, and the depth in your subject. The only reservation i have for this glass is that it's a plastic body with a rubber focus ring, which the rubber will tend to get \\"old\\" as it ages. But don't get me wrong, it's a good build and never feels \\"cheap\\" in your hands. The focus on this is bearable but not super fast when you're in macro mode. Use the focus limiter button and it will surprise you how fast it can keep up even on the KM 5D. It's a prime glass piece!

For someone new to DSLRs, I thought that the lens was pricey for no zoom, but the quality of the images are absolutely great. This gives new life to my old A100 camera.I'm not a professional, and am still learning about photography, but this is a great lens to have. I first got a Tamrom zoom lens, which is great all-around, but this lens beats it on quality hands down. I can get really close to the subject, and still get great quality.I've used this at night for photographing fireworks, and it actually worked well, since I could go all the way down to f/2.8 and use a faster shutter speed.The focus limiter is nice, since the A100 has a bit of a problem focusing at times, and this helps it focus much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I'm still learning how to use this, but it is a lot of fun.

The songs were relics of the past and well crafted. They were played at a very slow tempo, and that was a crucial part of their flavour and mystique.Now we have this live recording called the \\"Long Road Home\\". It is obvious that John has aged. He can no longer carry the notes or the inflection that he did in CCR. So be it.But, what I can not get past on this album is the frantic speed at which every song is played.

The subjects are well organized with many example problems; however, I did catch some errors.

I read it for a class about wisdom and of the 10 books we had to read I'm only keeping three; this is one. I didn't know anything about Buddhism before reading this and I don't feel that I need to be a Buddhist in order to benefit from Pema's insights. Her advice for living (taken right from lojong slogans from Buddhist traditions) can be taken on many different levels. I don't feel that you need to go deep into the practice in order to benefit from any of this books teachings. You take from it what you need to. I'm adding my voice to the many here who have praised her, Pema Chodron has written a wonderful, helpful book. If you're in pain emotionally I highly recommend it. If you just want to get some peace in your life I highly recommend it. Everyone needs help coping with living, even if it's just a little. Pema has given us a guide to one way of coping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity, Insight, & Humor","review":"This book is bound to become a classic! One of the Buddhist practices, called The Seven Points of Training the Mind, is very complex and is comprised of over 50 \\"slogans\\" or \\"proverbs\\" to live by. In this book, Pema Chodron ingeniously weaves all of them into the contents with caring, humor, and inspired examples of how these slogans 'work' in our every day lives. Throughout, the goal is always tonglen, a special meditative practice that can be done in formal practice or while walking, at work or with the family.

I was introduced to this book by a friend and mistakenly thought this book as a self-help sort of reading material without much religious bent. I was wrong. It is definitely Buddhism, but not in-depth Buddhism either. Just some bits of advice here and there in the form of short slogans and some typical Eastern religous philosophical psychology mixed in to make it palatable for someone wanting mere self-improvement rather than the classic state of enlightenment sought in traditional Buddhism. The title aptly implies starter fare Buddhism. Starting where I am, that I don't like Buddhism, this book is not for me or anyone adverse to religion repackaged as self-help psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I found \\"The Buddha In Your Mirror\\" to be a much better book on effective Buddhist practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"If you find yourself 'stuck' in life, and unable to find a path forward, this book will change your life.

I have read two other books by the same author, but the level of understanding for this particular book was deep and totally worth it. Little chunks at a time, giving yourself time to digest the material served me well as I grew with this book. The ironic part is I started it to help a friend, and wound up helping both of us through difficult moments!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pema's Wisdom","review":"Pema Chodron speaks to us in a way that is both compassionate (she has \\"been there, done that\\") and fierce (\\"the time is NOW to wake up!) at the same time. Her review of Tonglen, a Tibetan Buddhist practice that helps us, very quietly, very profoundly, transform the emotional \\"stuff\\" in our lives into compassionate understanding of the \\"others\\" in our lives. It guides us in taking full responsibility for all that we experience, and the ways that we react/respond to it. My personal experience with this gem of a book is that it guided me through one of the most difficult times in my life: the death of my father, and coming to terms with the adolescent girl in myself that still held so much anger and resentment toward my mother. Through Tonglen, I was able to very quietly breathe into the dark heavy stuff from my past, and release it with some lightness, as my gift to the Universe, and my own healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heresy of the first order!","review":"Without a shadow of a doubt this book describes the greatest heresy the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ has ever had to endure in modern times. It uses \\"crutches\\" of people like Jonathan Edwards and Charles Finney as supports for this so-called outpouring of the Holy Spirit which cannot be used as historical support without a huge stretch of the imagination and credibility. It really has brought shame on the modern Church in the name of Christianity. Read it as a historical document but you won't find very much holiness in it!

HA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many inaccuracies","review":"Read this book with a \\"grain of salt...\\" much of this book is historically and theologically dubious. His treatment of Jonathan Edwards is particularly misleading, and many experts think that the entire \\"Toronto Blessing\\" movement has done some pretty selective reading in coming to their conclusions.If you're genuinely interested in learning about the controversy over the \\"Toronto Blessing,\\" James Beverley's book \\"Holy Laughter and the Toronto Blessing\\" is by the most balanced, fair book I've seen on the topic. I'd recommend reading that instead. If you must read \\"Catch the Fire,\\" read some other opinions to balance it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women and Work","review":"The book focuses on the problems that face women everyday in the workplace. Whether one is actually referring to the labor force as the workplace, or the home as the workplace is a huge part of this book. Our society accepts that women should automatically take on the responsibilities of child care and housekeeping in addition to a regular job (if they wish to even have a job on top of all these tasks). It's not easy for women, and Hesse-Biber uses several examples and hard data to back up this book.Not only is the \\"average, white American supermom\\" discusses, but also the differences in race, class, and other factors that can influence women's place in the \\"working world.\\"The book is very useful and Hesse-Biber always takes a strong feminist perspective. One fault would probably be that she doesn't show both sides as best she could, but overall, the book is an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover better than the book","review":"The problem with this novel is one of characterization. Carmilla is not particularly interesting, and comes off as a run-of-the-mill movie vampire out on conquest. She is somewhat juvenile and one-dimensional. The protagonist is even worse, amost like a castmember of \\"friends.\\"Horror novels need to be scary. They need moments of dread, tension, and angst. Carmilla: The Return simply fails to create a spooky atmosphere, and instead degenerates into late-night soft-porn. Even the sex is poorly handled.Please read the original Carmilla by LeFanu -an infinitely better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the orignal Carmilla, and like this","review":"First, I've noticed others mention spelling mistakes in the text, if there where any in my copy I didn't notice.The original Carmilla Novella is still in my opinion the best Vampire story ever written, I want to say that off the bat.I don't like that the story conforms Carmilla to modern Vampire rules we're used to now post-Dracula. The original Carmilla wasn't harmed by the Sun for one thing.But I still consider this a very worthwhile read, I love a good Lesbian romance, with some erotic yet not gratuitous sex scenes included, and this provides that well.I most love reading Barbara's journal entries, I really feel for her pain.The story is a sequel to the original, giving an explanation for how Carmilla still lives, the flashbacks are interesting, and ti's fun to learn a little of Carmilla's POV. But what happens in the present also has a History repeats itself feel to it.I'd recommend to any avid Lesbian Vampire Romance fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my lord!","review":"What has this world come to!One of the best Vampire stories ever written has got a sequel!A sequel by another author and set in modern day!I cannot believe the publishers allowed this to be published. Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu was a magnificent horror writer, a British Poe, respected by Stoker, James and many more authors. 'Carmilla', Le Fanu's story, needed no sequel especially not one set in the modern day. Also the way this is writen is not at all good, and the author made no effort to write in a similar style to Le Fanu, notwithstanding, that he is writing a sequel to Le Fanu's story!I suggest you buy this for cheap in a car boot sale or second hand book shop, if you study Vampires in literature, but don't buy it expecting a lot of entertainment.If you want good Vampire stories try Le Fanu's 'Carmilla' Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 'Cristabel', and even Anne Rice's 'Vampire Cronicles', they are a lot better than this.Thanks for ready my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolly Good Show","review":"I first read J.Sheridan LeFanu's 1872 novella \\"Carmilla\\" when I was in my mid-teens. I was very pleased to read Kyle Marffin's clever sequel in my late thirties. His version of LaFanu's \\"slender, and wonderfully graceful\\" undead succubus has atmosphere, interesting characterizations, a couple of love stories (both ... and straight),a nice sense of tension, and a really interesting title fiend who is alternately likable and menacing--just as her first incarnation was. The movies have never really got it right. This version comes closest to the original. I tip my hat to Marffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this Book!!!","review":"Carmilla The Return is the best Vampire book I have read in a very long time.

It was an abomination to the original by J. Sheridan Lefanu. The plot was in most places nonexistent, it seemed more like page after page of bad porn. There were serious plot gaps in the beginning which would in reality cause the 'return' to not even be possible. A major disappointment, I strongly warn against buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time that could never compre to LeFau's classic","review":"I can only say that the review built it up to something incredible and I was sorely disappointed. The prose is flat and dull, the story is trite, and the characters are wooden. Don't waste your time! This only confirms my belief that modern vampire stories should not be given the time of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very compelling story","review":"Mr. Marffin could have profited from the hand of a tougher editor, and from perhaps not following Le Fanu's original plotline so closely, but with those comments out of the way, I must say I found his telling of this tale completely satisfying. In fact, I hated to see it end. I hope to see Carmilla again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Vampires you will like this","review":"I like Rice, Stroker, Daniels, Le Fanu, and now I can add Kyle Marffin.

It gives a diagram of where the lighting is placed then moves right into the photo shoot where the model is strinking poses at 100 miles per hour with the camera firing as quick as a machine gun.

No narraration.... nothing.I think this DVD is good if you're looking for extremely softcore porn but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay But Could Be Better","review":"I bought this particular oil can because it had a bit of style to it. Unfortunately, that style is now what I dislike about it. The handle is way too narrow and round to grasp well, and the handle is unattached at the bottom. When you tilt the can to pour the oil, the center of gravity shifts, and the can easily slips right out of your grip. The can is stylish and of very good quality materials. I would recommend, however, that you choose a different style from the same manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty cheaply made","review":"One of the few items I've ever returned, this arrived in the mail with the handle broken off and no lid, along with the larger can which did make the trip, but they were not packed at all just loose in a box.

Fundamentally, to its core, this book is based on the Christian religion. This is craftily concealed from the prospective reader in the title and the text on the cover and front matter. As someone who is not Christian, this book holds ZERO value for me. I can get marriage advice from qualified professionals who don't rely on the myths of bronze age tribesmen to formulate their methods. And my wife and I will be better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book remains a classic.","review":"This book was written over 30 years ago by a \\"down home country Arkansas\\" doctor and it is thoroughly Christian in content. So you should probably skip it, right? WRONG! This remains a classic standard that many other Marriage/Family counselors continue to recommend. This good ol' boy doctor teaches you how to be a true lover, and way before the couple ever gets to the bedroom. Truly remarkable for making a good marriage great, BUT......the real gold in this book is that it gives the person suffering through a failing marriage hope and a plan. If you are not a Christian do not pass this resource by. Biblical principles will still enhance your marriage whether you believe in their source or not.It is one of the first resources that I recommend when I conduct premarital classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The single best book to develop a rich married togetherness","review":"This book is full of wisdom. It helps each of the sexes understand the other, and lays out a framework for growing the several kinds of love that make up the best marriages.

I recommend this book to all of my friends that are married and continue to use it as a reference guide in my own marriage. It has helped me when I thought that I knew the answer and didn't need any help. If you are married you need the bible and you need this book. Don't be too proud. Buy the book and save your marriage.

A friend assured me that Lorca was worth pursuing, and indeed he was. In this collection, which features crisp and sharp translations, including those by Stephen Spender, Lorca's poetry emerges with all the strength and pathos it must have in Spanish. He strikes at the core of human longing, the eternal desire for love and death, with a simple and sometimes abstract imagery. Highly recommended for all readers of poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Lorca!","review":"I have read many different books of Lorca's poetry, and I think the translation for this book is really poor.

The print is larger and some biographical details are left out due to the New Directions changein format but it is essentially the same book with translations into English that are very good by oted translators and poets themselves. Of course, the original in Spanish is superb and the verse come from various stages of the poet who was shot by the fascists forces in the Spanish Civil War. Thus I needed to buy this copy again.

The supplied wires appear too cheap. I bought the speaker wires from Monster Cable to replace it.2. The subwoofer has some \\"blank\\" noise after power up but you won't hear it unless you get close.

The sound is great, they fill my 13x20 living with sound, and look very inconspicious mounted on the walls (I used silver NXG X-Mounts). The sub is large and heavy, and delivers great bass. I concur with other reviewers about tossing the included wires, those are a joke. I got some 16AWG 'digital' RCA speaker wire from Home Depot - with speakers this size you don't need larger wire, unless you are running it longer than 100ft. I also got a decent sub cable. Not Monster - those are monster ripoffs - but a $15 cable from acoustic research fit the bill nicely.One gripe: power saver feature on the sub can be annoying. Having the sub shut off during quieter scenes means you'll miss the bass for first 1-2 seconds of action. Thankfully, it can be turned off via rear switch. Just power down the whole sub using the front-mounted button when you are not using the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"its ok but not as romantic","review":"its ok but not as romantic as the notion, but its not the best written or organized books but the SM is important"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks.","review":"I'm no \\"nuclear scientist,\\" to be sure.

This is a major problem because the rainfly does not completely cover the windows. Also, when we were setting up the tent, the rainfly was so thin that it ripped!

I personally think that there are many talented and hard working musicians out there who hustle each and every day to get gigs and are far beyond needing the advice that you must pick up the phone, treat your band like a business, etc. We already know all of this.I was looking for a book (and still am) that would get into more depth on this subject of getting gigs and give some original ideas.

What's worse is Janeway is portrayed as a rude, impatient, bully of a captain. There are very corny lines that no character would ever use and most characters act well, completely out of character.

Well to culminate things, the internal HD (Seagate) crashed and rendered the drive completely unrecoverable (unless you want to pay a whole lot of money).My recommendation is to stay away from this product do to its weak design. As for the hard drive malfunction, I am not pleased, but the technology is so small that what can you do.

This book is an embarrassment for Yale University Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad","review":"As I've mentioned in other books, the secret services history is far from simple. The author manages to make it unnerving to read. Not because of facts presented but because there's no sequence, no effort to write the book adequately. He goes un using exaggerted words, which come out of context with the book.It is as if a highschool student wanted to make a display of his extense vocabulary, grabbed words out of a dictionary and made a great example of not knowing how to use them. The book is also too opinionated. It is leading you to the author's opinion, he leads on a battle without backing, to direct you to think that secret services are over funded, still filled with a seemingly patriotic belief in their good intentions.On the whole, the author set on an ambitious idea of writing a book, tried to fit anectotic facts with hard history and set his opinions, and managed to make a hideous menage. There are better books on the subject, and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poorly edited","review":"The other customer reviews capture the weaknesses of the book. I would only add that a review laying out these weaknesses at greater length and with more precision was published by Piero Gleijeses in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History, vol. 34, #3. A brief extract:\\"Cloak and Dollar adds virtually nothing to our previous knowledge of the CIA, and, worse,it is riddled with old chestnuts and misleading statements. It is, almost invariably, shallow.\\"As he indicates, the problem does not lie with the central theses of the book, which are quite reasonable.

When I discovered that Sabastian is based on a real person who experienced everything that he had in the novel--yes, everything from the psychics, the tire guy, the spirit, and sketches are true events--the far more enjoyable it was.

The show took a bizzarre, edgy and weird-for-the-sake-of-weird turn. It's almost in the tradition of Modernist playwrights like Harold Pinter at times. The episode \\"Party All The Time\\" is more art than cartoon, and plays with your emotions more than you thought possible from a \\"stoner cartoon\\". This volume proves ATHF is smart, and loves to push the boundaries of TV and the concept of Cartoons in general.Die hard fans will not be disappointed, but newbies should start elsewhere to learn the ropes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Volume/Season","review":"I am a big fan of Aqua Teen Hunger Force but this is by far the worst season of the bunch.

However, when we went to pump up the hull of our inflatable kayaks we found that the pump's Boston valve adapter is too large in diameter for the values on our Sevylor kayak. Since the pump was otherwise good and inexpensive, decided to sand down the adapter a little bit. Works fine now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Boston Valves, does not always work","review":"I bought this to inflate my Sevylor inflatable canoe, which has two pinch valves and two Boston valves.

I thought it was going to be a cheap piece of plastic junk, and, it is all plastic, but it works well anyway. It fills a queen mattress in less than ten minutes. It's not hard to pump. It is very quiet (not like a crazy loud 4D battery Coleman pump i had that took forever and finally died after a year's use) so it won't disturb your campground neighbors if you happen to arrive in camp sort of late (as we inevitably seem to do.) It's fairly large and bulky, not compact at all, but great for car camping. Highly recommended if you are 'roughing it' with an air mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great handpump for Inflatables from Coleman!","review":"This Coleman hand pump is really the ticket if you need one to easily inflate or add air to an existing inflated air mattress without taking it back to your vehicle to use your 12v air pump. It was easy to use even for an older person, and did the job in short order. It is perfect to take with you if you will be camping for a long time in one spot when your air mattress could lose a little air with just sleeping on it for several nights.You cant go wrong for 10.95 for something so efficient, so I highly recommend this product. Amazon shipped it quickly as well, and it was priced better and no taxes either, than getting it from my local Walmart.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing adapter","review":"This pump doesn't work with Sevylor boats.

Very heavy and raw. Much more like their live sound. They all had a lot to improve upon performance and technique. Basically, this is great as a time-piece.

The instructors can seem annoying, but not nearly as bad as some other exercise tapes I've tried over the years.The tapes are about 25 minutes each.

This alone is bound to have a positive effect on raising our children.

Instead, this book is a mishmash of history, haircutting and shaving techniques, and barber jokes, and i think it's aimed mostly at barbers themselves, rather than the public at large. it features barbers the author has visited personally, but it doesn't provide the pertinent information necessary to locate them. like most people, i've been the victim of many a bad haircut in my day, and i would like to find a simple, no nonsense directory of top rated barbers across the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Reading for All Women","review":"As a success coach for women I'm always keeping my eyes open for resources.

The secrets that Stanny shares have the ability to change your life if you take them to heart.Every chapter has offers some Aha moments. There is also advice you've probably heard before but somehow Stanny makes that advice fresh. Perhaps it helps that it comes from women who've proven that the advice is sound and it works.Written in a warm and honest style, it reads like a conversation with a good friend.

It's not the type of book that is going to just bullet point out the secrets of successful women and there you go. Its full of many quotes and real life experiences from women that have been very successful as well as women who might be considered \\"under-earners\\". What I really like is that so many women who were interviewed in the book didn't start with a college education or MBA and some were just simple housewives and some high school drop outs. I found motivation and self encouragement and have found that I have made changes in myself after reading. Sometimes when I am making decisions, I tend to second guess myself or hold back due to evaluating what reactions would be and I think after reading this book, I have been able to open up more and give my opinions and advice easier and I am finding that it is well received by others. I think if you have high expectations this is a great book to read to help you achieve your goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the Tips","review":"Found this book very practical and enjoyed the read. The tips are great, especially for beginners. Don't skip the advices about financial education, though. Without understanding how the market works, it will be hard to make it.

It has already given me some ideas and encouragement to conquer some of my fears and get over my inability to see myself as others do- as a confident and competent person who deserves to be properly paid for what I do.Opportunities for increased income float around me all the time. Stanny is teaching me that art of letting go and seizing these opportunities. I highly recommend this book for shy people like me- perhaps it will also help you get beyond that shyness and built in fear and earn what you deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is an outstanding book. Ms. Stanny takes a step-by-step approach to getting through your blocks to success. Not only does she reassure you that YOU can make 6-figures, but she gives examples of others who have and, most importantly HOW they have.

Realistically this is a self-help book with no scientific connection.","review":"This book/movie is good in that it at least briefly skimmed principles of quantum mechanics and probably provokes some optimistic thought in its readers. Unfortunately, they dragged the most precisely proven scientific theory out onto the self-help floor. I honestly don't see the connection between Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and learning to better control your life with your mind. Taken word for word these two things might mesh together, but really, this book/movie strips all science from quantum theory, turning it into a two hour message to learn how to think with your mind.This book has no place citing quantum mechanics or anything remotely scientific. It might be useful if you want to stare at the ceiling and try to figure out how to guide your life with what you have behind your eyes.

So this is nothing more than a major money making scheme by the Ramtha-people. Please research this organization before buying into the nonsense in this book.

The only problem is it merely encapsulates the same cherry-picked notions of Quantum Theory as an attempt to legitimize certain dogmatic doctrine in the New Age movement, specifically Ramtha.

But I consider it a sin to intentionally confuse the two.OK, here's the basics. Just because something is true for subatomic particles (e.g., existential superposition), doesn't mean it's true for people. In fact, it's never been demonstrated for people. Ever. In fact, humans have never experienced quantuum mechanics phenomena nor relatavistic pheonoma. Ever. Never. Got it?

Ceremony starts with a brief selection by Biber (b. 1644), then moves on to compositions by Barry Guy, who was born in 1947.

It was worth the reading, though, as Ms. McCaffrey's books almost always are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borders on boring","review":"As much as I enjoyed the previous Freedom series books (particulary the first book, Freedom's Landing), this one read like a junior high school essay of \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation.\\" Very little plot, almost no conflict or character development. Description was lacking as well-- I felt as if I were listening to a bunch of \\"talking heads.\\" There wasn't even much between Zainal and Kris, which to me was one of the highlights of the previous books. And the beginning, where the characters were discussing what they were going to do-- ARRGH! It's bad enough to have to attend meetings, much less read about them! I think Ms. McCaffrey could have done with less research on coffee growing and dental procedures and spent her attention on what has made her such a great storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description of a story, not a story itself","review":"Freedom's Ransom could have have been a good story, but instead, it is a description of a story. Instead of dialog and action telling the story, the story is described in prose. It brings to mind the old line \\"SHOW the reader, don't TELL her!\\" This is definitely a book that could have used another rewrite to replace the tedious prose with dialog and action. This isn't the first of her books about which I'd make this same complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did the publisher let this one get to print?","review":"The \\"Freedom\\" series kept my interest up through the third book. This fourth one falls off a cliff. Imagine a universe where a few tons of automotive supplies and food has a measurable impact on the reconstruction of a looted and devastated Earth. Imagine one where interstellar travel is so cheap that bird carcasses, bananas, and coffee beans are the prized trade items. Repetitious descriptions and dialog, boring 1-D characters, a chaotic plot, bad science and inconsistent technology, absurd scale effects, and a host of other flaws make this a painful book to push through to the end. You'll also find \\"exterior motives\\" and \\"one of the only\\". Sad. How did the publisher let this one get to print?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ransom for Freedom","review":"Anne McCaffery has done it again in this book. Although this isn't her normal stand alone novel, \\"Freedom's Ransom\\" must be taken and should be read after the others in the Freedom Series. I think she's done well in keeping with the Characterization and shows that there is much to be done even after a revolution in order to get things running smooth. I look forward to seeing her next novel as our Main Characters may go hunting for the Farmers or completing thier joint mission in becoming partners with the Cattini."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like another case of no rewrite and paid by the word","review":"Title says it all. Too many writers are writing series in which the plot never develops, irrelevant side stories distract from the plot, and phrases get repeated over and over with no purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gobbled this up!","review":"I'd have to agree with previous reviewers who say this is mediocre but who cares? I gobbled this up faster than a Thanksgiving turkey. The book's 300 pages, reads fast. I finished it in one weekend. Was it worth the cost of hardcover? YEAH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!!","review":"Though best known for her Dragonriders of Pern series of books, I like Anne's work that is based in a world similar to ours. The Catteni Sequence delivers. What would happen if Earth were invaded? If you enjoyed Independence Day, you'll like this series. I also highly recommend Susan Wright's SLAVE TRADE trilogy (don't be fooled by the provocative title--good for young adults too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly a major disappointment","review":"Well, this is a turn of events. I, who so enjoy reading any book by Ms. Mccaffrey is sad to say that this book was a total waste of time to read. A part for the fact that it was written by Ms. Mccaffrey, there isn't much holding me to keep it. i was rather taken aback when Ransom hit the shelves. i had thought that the freedom's series had run it's course. With the liberation of Botany and the subsequent defeat of the Eosi, i had thought that was all that needed to be said. Ransom was a slow read and at times i just wanted to not finish it, but i have learned to at least give a book a chance. the chance given was not enough to permit me to keep this book. With the poor plot line and lack of anything interesting turn of events to keep me reading to the point that i forget all else, i just wish to say that Anne probably should have stopped at Freedom's Challenge. I hope that she will look into expanding more on other series that i love so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first disappoint from Ms. McCaffrey","review":"I have really enjoyed reading the series but number 4 is a disappointment. There are so many other ascepts of this series that need to be explored that reading about the principal characters going out on a trading expedition for several hundred pages was not enjoyable. Hopefully number 5 and beyond will deal with things like conquered races, humans included, dropped on other Catteni worlds, are all the Eosi really gone and who are the Farmers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterly disappointed","review":"I don't know if maybe Anne McCaffrey was on medication when she wrote this book, but it is far beneath her usual standard. The characters are paper thin, the internal and external dialogue are trivial to distraction, and the plot is practically non-exist. I had to force myself to turn the page...but kept hoping it would get better. I love Anne McCaffrey's work and usually just her name is enough to recommend a book, but frankly, if this was an amateur's manuscript, it would have never been published. I kept looking at the cover to see whether the author's name had magically changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok.. But not great.","review":"I had figured the series was done with the previous book. When I found this book at the book store, I was like \\"I must get it\\". Now, I could have easily waited, and so could have M[r]s. McCaffrey. In my oppinion, this book is only half done. When I reached the last page, I was still expecting more pages. Somewhat dissapointing, I hope she chooses to finish this book with the same attention and care she uses for her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was really looking forward to the 4th book in this series, having read and enjoyed the first three. I was very disappointed in this one. After all the troubles those who were dropped have faced, this book was terribly anticlimactic. Where were the challenges? Where was the tension? Coffee becoming the biggest item of trade? I expected much more from a somewhat triumphal return to Earth. I expected more of a gut or heartwrenching reaction for those who traveled. The Eosi are not gone completely, yet this book almost seemed like a holiday. Not at all her usual style. Count me one letdown reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I loved the first three in this series, Freedom's Landing, Freedom's Choice, and Freedom's Challenge. To be perfectly honest, Anne should have left it with those three. When I first learned there was another, I was like oh great. The Freedom series has been one of my four favorite series that Anne does. But it was a real chore to read the book. Unlike most of her work, this book dragged and reading it was literally like pulling teeth. I felt I was at the dentist have all my teeth pulled. I can highly recommened the first three in the Freedom series, but Freedom's Ransom, I would definately say skip it. Anne Mccaffrey was having an off day when she wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"Anne proved in this book that she know's nothing about mechanics or electronics. Since when do Toyota transmissions have spark plugs? And how do you make a Nokia cell phone work without at least a cell tower and transmission equipment? I would find myself enjoying the story and when something like the last two examples krept up I wanted to put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe that this was actually written by McCaffrey","review":"I enjoyed the first three books, and the idea of this one was good, but who wrote it?! And who edited it? Not up to standard, that's for certain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the rest of the series","review":"This book left a lot to be desired after the first 3 in the Freedom Series. I kept on reading in hopes that it would become more interesting but it didn't. There are a couple of plot starts that dribble away and don't go anywhere. I hope there will be a 5th in the series and that it will be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mildly interesting book","review":"This is one of those books that keeps you reading, but only because you're sure the good part must be coming up next. The characterswere never in real danger and the interpersonal conflicts were mostly solved by shipping people off somewhere. The moments with the Masai were interesting, but too brief.I've enjoyed the romance between Zainal and Kris in the last three books, but they seem almost bored in this one.I was really looking forward to this book, hopefully the next one will have the spark back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you think...","review":"My daughter has the whole collection, so I thought Id start my niece out with number 1. When you look at this doll something is missing.. so I did a side by side comparison with my daughters number 1. Wow there is no sparkle on the 1, its even curved.

Im so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Instructions, Fun Moves","review":"I normally have a very hard time following any kind of choreography, but the moves in this are easy to understand - without being oversimplified or boring.

Yngwie blew me away. His acoustic guitare solo is bar none the best Ive seen.I really liked the jam together. Steve Vai and his band with Tony Mc Alpine on keyboard and guitar, Billy Sheehan on bass etc are fantastic. Dont listen to the bad reviews. If you like great guitar shredding, you will love it !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Satriani, Vai, & Yngwie, you'll enjoy this","review":"I went to the glenside PA show and thought the DVD was better (probably because they were being filmed and wanted to make a good showing). I liked Joe's set the best, his riffs and melodies just seem a notch above Vai, and far superior to Yngwie. Vai is still quite good though. Yngwie could be so much better if he could just take it out of warp drive once in a while to tease the audience (for what is coming). I liken his playing to a flat out drum solo without peaks and valleys - it gets boring quick.The dvd also has some nice close-ups of the fret work. I felt it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps chapters 7 and 8 are the most useful?","review":"Lawson gives the Oracle DBA many useful ideas on customising your Oracle database. He pretty much assumes you already possess a reasonable background in Oracle. There is no wasted space on elementary SQL or Oracle tasks.Perhaps the key chapters are 7, \\"Oracle Pathologist\\" and 8, \\"Analysing SQL Bottlenecks\\". Later chapters add important refinements. But if you are in search of quick gains, chapters 7 and 8 could be the most fruitful. The ideas in those might not have to involve a major overhaul of your architecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"very impressive","review":"This is not a highly technical Oracle book but it does demonstrate how many of the Oracle features rely on intuition instead of science.

Answer: Less than an hour was enough to make me walk away.Don't get me wrong: watching someone get hit in the crotch can be funny. And some of the videos were genuinely humorous, but host Tom Bergeron could suck the fun out of a circus. His segueways are so belabored, he has to turn to the Jay Leno method at least twice a show to remind people that all the laughter he gets is out of pity. At least he can recognize it.Suitable for almost all physical ages, but people with normal human adult intelligences might want to steer clear of repeated contact. Maybe it won't cause brain damage, but about three shows in and I was ready to start scooping out my gray matter with a spoon to end the misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Out There","review":"I read other Sonny Baca stories and liked them.

Those tales, flawlessly told by Anaya, call to be read and remembered numerous times.\\"Jemez Springs,\\" however, needs only to be read once. Whether by pressure of deadline or the simple need to tie up a few loose ends, Anaya comes across as a self-indulgent retired literature professor, attempting heavy-handed ties between New Mexicanos and their culture and forms of Greek and other literature, while tying them only with the loosest of whip stitches.If you are an Anaya fan, you owe it to yourself to read \\"Jemez Springs,\\" but then give yourself a good dose of \\"Ultima\\" to wash away the bitter aftertaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"I am a big fan of Rudy Anaya and the Sonny Baca series. This book, however, was disappointing. It was very wordy in that there was not much conversation going on. I am a native of NM, but no longer live there.

It is also more personalized with additional information on favorite hotels and cafes located in the vicinity of favorite shops.

Instead, it contained a disjointed collection of vapid sketches, lightly salted some naughty language. It was almost as if the sketches were early musings of what eventually proved to be a much funnier final production, but with no final production!Technically, the BD itself was flawless with stunning sound and picture.

The only reason I give this DVD two stars is that I did find some of the clips very funny. However, if you like lots of homosexuals and gay jokes, bestiality, toilet humor, and too much sex with robots, household objects, celebrities, etc. then, this is for you. Otherwise, you can catch a lot of the tamer stuff on YouTube. Also, way too much use of the F word. Seth MacFarlane loves to swear. A LOT. And although that's not uncommon these days, for me, it takes away from the humor if it's done too much. This DVD really got me thinking about Seth's sick and twisted sense of humor. It's really bad if left unchecked by the networks. In the future, I think I'll just stick with Family Guy. I know at times that can be over the top, too, but not this bad!!

The DVD consists of a bunch of short \\"skits\\". A few are very funny, most are boring, and a few are downright stupid. For example, there is a skit of a Scotsman watching movies and commenting on them - it gets old after the first movie, and then they come back to it later in the DVD for more yawns. There are a lot of infantile sex scenes, which would not necessarily be bad if they could be done with the genius twist that Seth usually has. Unfortunately they come off as being written by a 12 year old, and probably only a 12 year old would find them amusing. I now have the feeling that Seth is more funny when he is trying to get around the TV censors than when he is not restricted at all. I hope he got this out of his system so he can try to get Family Guy back on track at last.VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad.","review":"Wow. Words can't describe how bad this DVD is. Honestly, I just feel embarrassed for Seth. There isn't a single funny moment in the entire 50 minutes. It's worse than the new seasons of Family Guy.

It is just a bunch of 5 second clips. It's completely random. These kinds of clips work when they are inserted in the Family Guy stories but on their own it isn't very funny. And there is nothing very shocking at all. There is some swearing that you wouldn't hear on normal TV but you can get that by watching any South Park episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Not a single laugh.","review":"I don't write many reviews but I felt compelled to help others trying to decide to purchase/watch this DVD. First of all, almost every clip has profanity and sexual humor in it so it's definitely not for kids. I sat through the entire DVD (about 100 or so clips/jokes) and can't recall *one* clip that was truly funny. It's a mess of a DVD that was apparently made to cash in on Family Guy's popularity. My recommendation is that you forget this DVD even exists as you'll very likely regret wasting both 54 minutes of your life and $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a fan of Family Guy and have been for years.

A definite miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Worth Any Money","review":"While I am a huge fan of Seth McFarlane and his works, this was an item I bought despite the reviews, and was thoroughly disappointed. It is, in short, a skit-collection of thoughts Seth McFarlane had for Family Guy, that he wasn't able to work in. While there was a few semi-funny skits, most are pointless and dull. I do not recommend spending even $5 for this item.Now Ted... Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not best effort","review":"I expected more from MacFarlane than the 7th grade level situations and characters.

Unfortunately, the two clips I saw on YouTube were the only funny ones on the DVD. So, if you're a Seth MacFarlane fan and NEED to see this for some reason, I would say rent it, borrow it from a friend, or buy it REALLY CHEAP used instead of spending the money to buy it new...because it really is not worth what I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of MacFarlane's best cartoons","review":"I am a huge family Guy fan and was disappointed with buying this video because it was not that funny and it was under 60 minutes long.

It is best to rent this video versus buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This has got to be the worst thing I've ever seen. I do like Family Guy and American Dad, but this is just really awful. It's not funny, its not entertaining. Don't waste your time, that's 54 minutes of your life you'll never get back.

To me, this disc is filled with the things Seth couldn't find space for in a Family Guy episode or that the FCC would have a stroke over if they did. I absolutely love Family Guy and the fact that they don't care too much about being politically correct...it's refreshing and this disc stays true to that. It's raunchy, just wrong sometimes, and pretty hilarious all at the same time.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little pricey for only an hour's worth of fun. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Family Guy and American Dad! I never miss an episode of both shows and own all the seasons that are available DVD. I have been a fan of Seth MacFarlane for years, but this DVD is crap! I don't know what he was thinking, but he was out of his mind to release these cartoons.Out of all the mini-cartoons included, I only \\"lightly\\" laughed at a few.

But even I was often appalled at the utter lack of decency and taste in Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Oh sure... there were a few bits I truly liked. The frog wanna-be prince was a favorite. The cats in a board meeting... Wile-E-Coyote's life issues... good stuff. But many of the others that I watched (before shutting it off and never finishing it) were just so appallingly tasteless and, quite frankly, not the slightest bit funny, that I finally just had enough and tossed it without finishing it.

You call this comedy?","review":"This is the first review I have written on Amazon in years (not that I was a regular), but I felt that I absolutely had to share my critique of this blu-ray disc, if only to reinforce the idea that NO ONE should purchase this.Simply put: it SUCKS! I mean not only is it not HD, but it is so unfunny it made me cringe for MacFarlane, who actually held a red carpet event for the premiere! Could you imagine sitting in a huge room filled to the brim with people, and hearing maybe five of those people laugh throughout the whole thing? I can -- and I'm sure that's exactly what happened.Now, if these clips were inserts in an episode of Family Guy, they'd probably be hilarious, we'd have a setup. But they weren't, thus, we were treated with a plethora of sex skits and pointless potty-mouths.Just avoid this at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen it all before.","review":"When I saw that this was coming out, I was really looking forward to it but now that I have it, I'm completely dissappointed with it.

It would've been better as a bonus dvd added in with the Family Guy seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious and boring","review":"You often knew what the punchline was going to be in the first 3 seconds of the clip.

Always wait for the reviews to come in before buying a DVD. This DVD is pathetic. A couple slight laughs, but nothing compared to Family Guy and American Dad.

Yes Seth, we get it, gays are funny and the south is backwards and some people talk with accents. It wasnt funny the first eight times you tried it in Family Guy, it still isn't funny now that you've run out of ideas on Family Guy and repeat these same jokes every episode, (wH , bumped knee, Conway Twitty, really?) but to try and pawn the same material which has already worn itself out in syndication as 'new' product to be sold is offensive to consumers. If you enjoy this product you might want to watch Idiocracy, as you ARE the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even once","review":"I did not laugh, chuckle, or even grin once during the 54 minutes duration of the cavalcade. The funniest part of the cavalcade is the word cavalcade if that tells you anything. A common theme through all the shorts is gross out humor which I think is usually pretty funny, not sure what was missing... I guess even gross out humor needs to have some semblance of a plot or a point at least. If you are curious try to find some of the shorts on the web for free, not worth spending any money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not HD, Not funny","review":"Love Family Guy. Love American Dad.

There's a few funny skits, but the only ones that were funny you can watch for free on Youtube. Everything else is nothing but scat humor, beneath even Family Guy. Some weren't even jokes, they were just characters taking a dump. Only a handful of things in this were funny that couldn't be seen on Youtube, but nowhere near enough to justify the price of the DVD.I say this as a fan of both Family Guy and American Dad. This DVD is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Family Guy? Dont expect the same.","review":"I love family guy's funny edgy humor. Naturaly,when i had heard the creator was making a DVD that was going to be over the edge, i was all in.

I must say that these shorts are hilarious all the way to the end. They are definitely some of Seth's best work, and I guess since he knew this was so not for tv, they went all out on this one. I gave it 4 stars because, for being a Blu-Ray, even a DVD, they could have done some more. There are plenty on here, and you don't see the time fly. So i guess that's a good thing.

Now to the cartoon shorts. Not even a chuckle. I kept advancing chapters hoping to find something funny. Nada. So save your money and let Amazon keep this disk on thier shelves.

It was definetly too short (not enough exercises). I assumed that the person who wrote \\"so, so workout\\" liked long abs sessions (which I do not), however, this workout only had about 4 or 5 different exercises w/ short reps. (The box suggests that the workout is ~15 minutes, but the instructor is thorough and takes a long time to explain the proper technique-- which is great). However, I would NOT have spent the money for this workout. There is only one ab workout on the tape (tape does have short warm up and cool down)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Instructor","review":"I am an advanced exerciser and love working out at home the best- so i buy a ton of DVD's. This one--the exercises themselves are good, but the girl never shuts up and often looses track of her counts--it may be okay the first time you try it, but if you plan on doing this more than once, she'll drive you insane with her LONG instructions every time you just want to do the work-out!!!!

I did, however, want to do something to bring back some definition to my ab mucles - not necessarily lose weight. This workout fits the bill. It's simple yet very effective - I could feel which muscles were being worked - and the instructor is thorough and not annoying or too fast. I did begin to see some results almost right away.

The former has an equally memorable guitar riff, but the song is a reminiscence about days gone by and dealing with growing up. \\"Hurts So Good\\" went to number two and \\"Jack & Diane\\" became his only number one single and both songs ended up among the ten biggest of 1982. The rest of the album contains some equally pleasing tracks like \\"Thundering Hearts\\", \\"China Girl\\", \\"Danger List\\" and \\"Hand To Hold On To\\".

This album is filled with catchy rock treasures, such as the minor hit \\"Hand To Hold On To\\", the aptly named \\"Thundering Hearts\\" and the anthemic \\"Close Enough\\".

This chapter was completely out of place in this book. The lackluster chapter described something thats a year or more off, not to mention stuff that is going to change.

Yes, the little blue power indicator light burned out after about a month, but so far it is the best indoor, TV-top antenna I have found. While recently shopping for an upgrade, I tried the newer (and more expensive) RCA ANT1250 model, featuring \\"dual gain controls\\" and \\"UHF reflector\\", but it did not even come close to outperforming this Jensen. As with any indoor antenna, do not expect your reception to have cable-like clarity, and of course some tweaking will be necessary to find the optimal orientation, but until you're ready to advance to the outdoor antenna scene, this Jensen should provide you with years of satisfactory television reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT much better than a ...

Each contribution explores what inspires and sustains hope in seemingly ordinary people, but in many cases, people who have changed the world. In a time when cynicism and despair run rampant, The Impossible Will Take a Little While offers voices we desperately need to hear, voices we must remember. The beautifully written essays and poems not only reaffirm the power of one, but also show what can happen when people unite and act out of their collective sense of hope. The actions of others will inspire all who read this book to act with courage, confidence, and conscience in their own lives. This is a book you will want to share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reach for Inspiration","review":"I love this book. Open to any page for inspiration, hope, courage.

This book is not about hope, unless what you hope for is for the country and the planet to be taken over by these nutballs. FYI, there are things in this world worth fighting and dying for, even if people of other nations are involved. There are things that are not worth fighting and dying for, such as fighting for the right to choose the WRONG, and rub it in the faces of others who know better.If you are a patriot, if you think we live in a country founded on agency, and the inspiration of those who gave and or wore out their lives to create it, then do not waste a moment on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revied on The Impossible Will Take a Little While","review":"Received on time and in a very well condition.

They are very effective and do work I have found."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY SLOW with few reps","review":"This is the slowest video I have ever seen. I am surprised to see positive reviews about this video. The instructor shows you no less than 3 times how to get into position, and then you do all of 4 reps, then release. She then says \\"Where did you feel that? In your thighs, right?\\" Thank goodness she points that out, or you might think squats are an arm exercise (sarcasm). I can't imagine anyone doing this video more than once, as there is only 10 minutes of actual exercise on the video, and the rest is chit-chat. I gave this video 2stars only because I appreciate that a real person actually put effort into this. If you have never done any type of exercise before, and want to kid yourself that this is a 'workout', you could try this, but really, why? There are so many better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge dissappointment!","review":"I got this DVD after reading many reviews on the Lotte Berke Method. I love to find DVDs that have challening and unique moves for toning. However, I was very disappointed with this video. I did not find it challening at all and the \\"knee dancing\\" segment is dangerous because it puts too much pressure on your knee caps. And also, I found the instructor to be extremely annoying. Do not waste you money on this DVD when there are so many other great ones out there. See the rest of my reviews.....PS - The Bar Method, which is supposedly based on the same concepts as Lotte Berk - is a MUCH better workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and too short!","review":"I own dozens of DVD workout videos ranging from pilates, yoga, aerobics, kickboxing, strength training, weight training, etc. This was by far one of the worst videos ever owned and wish could return!

I run and lift weights , so I didnt' feel anything later, but totally different muscle work than what i am used to. It's slightly challenging, I found it was best after at least 10 minutes on treadmill.I wanted to trim down- after years of weightlifting i am larger than i'd liek to be so I wanted to maintain tone while losing some inches.

Unforunately, The Bar Method is a superior set. The Bar Method has a longer run time, similar challenging excercises, and I find the instructor more tolerable.This instructor seemed to be a bit arrogant.Anyway, if you are choosing between this and The Bar Method series, I'd go with the TBM. I might use this DVD to add variety to another short workout though."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big let down!","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book. The carachters were too shallow. I never really felt like I was totally connecting with them. I absolutely could not stand Leslie, the heroin. She had no backbone to speak of, and Flint totally rode roughshod over her through the entire book. The book had a terrific story line and I even Liked Flint, but it just left me with no 'feeling' at all. This is the only book by Joan Hohl that I haven't liked. I'm normally a really big fan of hers. I've read several of her books. However, this book most certainly was not up to her usual standards. I would not recommend anyone waste their money on it.

The first session is better than the second, but the album overall is very good. It's mainstream bebop from 1954 & 1955, 4-minute long songs, melody-solo-melody. What pulls everything together is Johnson's superb trombone playing. 8 of the 13 songs are standards, the others are by J.J. Johnson. Johnson's writing is pretty good, the standards are just more likely to be a ballad. Johnson has both technique and taste, the taste is on display on \\"Time After Time\\", and technique is shown in a fast one like \\"Coffee Pot\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bar is short and clunky, delivery was horrible!","review":"This bar is short and clunky.

While it requires you to learn some vocabulary on your own, for being able to quickly learn phrases and speak them, this book is fantastic.

I thought that like with many mechanics books, I will be forced to put it down after page three because the struggle of continuing is too onerous. Surprising, I have gotten past chapter 5 and wish to continue. In other words Arnold does not expect too much from the reader. Contains some formal proofs but not enough dull you interest in the subject. Also unlike many mechanics books it is not filled with endless pompous writing (e.g Goldstein, and Salatan ) but gets directly to the point. Also I like the way the problems are presented. After every couple of paragraphs a problem (of not too great of difficulty) is given for the reader to try. This promotes reinforcement of the subject material. Some of the solutions are given and I only wish I had them all. In short the best advanced classical mechanics book I have come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece.

Important steps always missing.","review":"I don't understand why my professor is using this book for the class. The way the content is organized is very confusing. You do not know why the author chooses a particular example or why this section follows the last one. The exercise embedded in each lesson comes with a one-word answer that leaves you even more confused with the material.In the derivation of any formulas, something always goes missing. For example, in the chapter related to effective potential energy, the author does not mention any single word about differentiating polar coordinates when that is the most important insight you need to gain.Overall, a very bad book about an interesting subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for those without moderate understanding of physics","review":"I've just started going through this book and so far I'm a little disappointed. I feel Newtonian mechanics are introduced in an unnecessarily confusing way and the author makes certain assumptions that compound this confusion. For example, the author assumes that mass of any particle is 1 throughout chapter 1 and 2. Therefore, when he defines the kinetic energy of an object, it is defined as (v^2)/2. I feel that so someone unfamiliar with basic physics, which could easily be the case for graduate mathematicians reading this book, that this is completely misleading at best.

Even our ideas and opinions, religions and romances, have become commodified, slanted, and marketed. And most of the flood of commodification is the product of the postwar communications boom. Before 1950, one had newspapers, magazines, radio, and the occasional newsreel. Before 1900, one had placards and fliers.So why is this book exclusively about the 19th century? The 19th century deserves 1 chapter, not all 400 pages. I am only vaguely interested in P.T. Barnum, but fascinated by how Tony the Tiger recreated American breakfasts during the Baby Boom. Or if Lear wanted to aim his book at historians, why the audacity to title it \\"a cultural history of American advertising\\"?

Sure that would have been fine had they really been American..but no... Yeah the patriotism was borderline cheesy. But I guess we can't win all the time.

The part that is most ambiguous is in trying to set up WebLogic. The two authors, being from BEA, should have been a little more detailed in their explanations. If you are new to Tomcat and WLS, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do-it-yourself Manual","review":"I have 2 major complaints about this book and the software that comes with it. The first is that setting up Apache's Tomcat is not exactly intuitive, and there is almost no help in the book itself. It casually mentions editing a batch file here and there without any specifics. As far as setting up a JDBC driver, youre pretty much on your own. My other complaint is that some of the code itself is buggy. The author(s) takes a meandering journey throughout this book, as if ideas were just coming to him randomly. The book does little good for a beginner because of its lack of info on getting the software that is bundled with it working properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good but code is buggy!","review":"Hi:THe book looks good and has helped to get me going. The book will go off in directions in a haphazard way that reminds me of a Simpsons episode where Homer is trying to repair his basement by watching a video. The BIG problem with this book is that the code has errors in it that keep it from working!! This to me is a big NO NO and the reason I gave the book a low rating. Sometimes the errors can be fixed by adding an import statement here and there but othertimes it seems to be a question of coding logic. Now I have not time to debug their code so I skip it, but it would be nice to see it work...On top of all that there is NO support for the book by the author or the publisher. This is strange considering other titles offer great suppor that usually rival software manufacturers support for their own product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money here!!!","review":"This book amazed when I first sat down to read it.After encountering the first few errors, I decided to write them all down.- After reaching the 15th error after about 40 pages, it wasjust too much!- The authors don't even provide you with code samples that work!- They don't go into any level of depth when explainingsomething (I know this is a beginners book, but at least don'twrite something that is not true, just because you assume yourreader are not JSP/Java experts).- I wouldn't dare charge more than $10 for such a low-qualitywork."},{"rating":"1","title":"carol jewlery","review":"nice product but does not lay flat on the right side it needs a slip ring to keep the right side facing out"},{"rating":"2","title":"michael jackson ben","review":"this is one of my favrite early michael jackson recordings ben the title song other songs like greatest show on earth people make the would go around are my favrite songs rest of cd is 5 stars he did a song call in our small would that was really moveing. the would has lost one of best performers michael will be dearly missed thank you for your music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on re-thinking freedom and community","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who considers issues around freedom and community, experience and empiricism (I would include both therapists and coaches in this category). Block's eloquent writing identifies some of the significant flaws our Western culture makes in bowing to the gods of empiricism and data to the exclusion of experience and community.An excellent book by a man with a unique perspective on the American culture of capitalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"I am very happy with this book. The questions asked have really helped me in my work. Block helps us to find the questions that should be asked before we look directly at how to implement a project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's asking the right questions anyway?","review":"I have not been doing lean consulting long enough to have a career's depth of war stories. When faced with some regular questions, I have to pull from the underlying philosophy rather than a real world example. Even in the Lean Construction history, there is not a lot of examples. Peter Block defends this approach in his 2003 book, The Answer to How is Yes.He says that the typical How questions are a defense against action and change. When we ask how much time is it going to take, we avoid asking about our level of commitment. When we ask how much it is going to cost we avoid asking what the price is we are willing to pay.The book is about the meaningful questions that we should be analyzing. Questions about our desire to create a future together. Questions about personal risk, freedom and responsibility. As I see it, progress won't happen if you study how others did it. Get your philosophy straight first and act on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Scholarships","review":"I bought these for some kids that really needed it. I like how they show you winning and losing essays; they also show why or how each essay won or lost--brilliant strategy. Some of my kids at the school I donated it to have already won thousands in scholarships."},{"rating":"1","title":"the authors are publishing virtually identical books under different titles and covers","review":"The authors are publishing virtually identical books under different titles. For instance, \\"How to Write a Winning Scholarship Essay\\" and \\"Money-Winning Scholarship Essays and Interviews\\" are virtually identical (I could find only some minor differences in chapter 4). These two books have completely different covers. Beware: There may be other duplicated titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"The key is getting your kids to actually do it. We have found that a number of schools and general scholarships have dropped the essays, however most school's Honor Programs require essays and it can be the tipping point for someone who is borderline in either grades or scores. My daughter was admitted into ASU's Honors program and her grades were not stellar but her ACT scores were. Because she didn't entirely meet the basic requirements she felt she wouldn't be given a look but we encouraged her to apply and the ideas she got from this book helped her plan out a thoughtful essay. Because they were willing to take a chance on her based on her essay, she felt motivated to achieve and completed her freshman year with a 3.8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Information","review":"This book gave great tips on writing essays to obtain scholarships. It helped us fine-tune our essays and we got the scholarships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This DVD is exceptional.

The dvd gave me a valuable insight for acting on stage. Emotional, unemotional, the highs, the lows, what an actor does to create the character, what the actor does to fill the role. The dvd has me signing up for acting classes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful","review":"Very grateful that the acting classes of the great actress and teacher, Uta Hagen, are captured on video and that one can \\"take\\" -- well sit in on -- Uta Hagen's Acting Class covering two semesters including all of her acting exercises and scenes from Simon to Shakespeare, also comentary from former students such as Whoopi Goldberg and Amanda Peet. We may no longer be able to see Hagen on stage BUT we have her teaching and her wonderfully entertaining stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to learn from the original source","review":"These dvd's are a great tool for actors AND directors. Too often, directors (especially in film) neglect to study the acting discipline in sufficient depth to communicate well with their primary collaborators. DVDs like this can help do that without going through a lengthy and expensive class. Also recommended are the Sanford Meisner DVDs, called Sanford Meisner Master Class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little, Too Late","review":"This is the book that should have accompanied the software, still leaving the need for a third party book that actually explains what features do what and when, why and how to use them. This book, in instance after instance gives no more information than the program gives, leaving you quite in the dark as how, and whether or not to perform a given activity. I will now buy a third party book on Quicken with the hope of learning everything 'The Official Guide' and the software didn't explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me kinda disapointed","review":"I had some trouble finding instructions I wanted. I get the impression that this book was taken from the Quicken help files because you can get the same info by choosing Help on the menu in the Quicken program.Maybe its my fault and this book just isn't for me, but I got more out of the other title I bough from Amazon. Not a bad book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"If you're looking for nuts and bolts help, this is not the book.

But this book is now serving admirably as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superseded Book","review":"This book was moderately useful in handling routine issues, but anything advanced, especially technical glitches, were not even mentioned. Superseded by the 2001 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! A wealth of information!","review":"I normally don't buy computer books, but the promise of learning something new about my personal finances convinced me to give it a try. I'm glad I did! The author has done a great job of providing lots of useful financial management information along with the usual how-to stuff for using the software. The last few chapters are especially useful. They don't cover much Quicken, but they provide tons of info about saving money, investing, and getting the best deal on loans. I bought a second copy for my brother, who is getting ready to buy a house. I think it'll really help him get his finances in shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Aluminum wire","review":"This Speaker Wire has in fact 20 AWG! with respect to its resistance. It has almost 2 times higher resistance in compare with regular 18 AWG copper speaker wire. You may ask me Why? Because this is copper-clad aluminum wire not pure copper! I have done all measurements in my lab very accurate. After that I scratch out the copper layer and saw white metal. I think this is supplier's trick rather than seller.

This is a whole new sound from them which is good, the only thing I wish is that there is more singing, there all good songs but for me if some of them had words they would just blow you away even more.If you dont have any 'd t t b' cd's than start here and work your way back cos the last cd is also great!.This is there best work and you wont be disapointed by getting this one, but like I said get there last one also you wont be sorry,"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration in using our intelligence to pray!","review":"As a religious educator, I am very grateful for Bernadette Stankard's book \\"Prayer and Multiple Intelligences\\". This book provides an amazing array of creative yet practical ways to pray using one's individual strengths of intelligence. The book is well researched, yet easy to read.The author uses a multitude of examples from her own life and from contemporary culture to explain the nine kinds of intelligence and to give prayer experiences meaning and depth.This book is beneficial for individuals, classrooms, or prayer groups, which desire a deeper, more intimate relationship with God. It is a clear guide to meeting God through the individual gifts with which God has blessed each of us. If you are sincerely seeking a personal connection with your Creator, I would highly recommend reading this book and putting into practice its insightful prayer practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slips off a lot","review":"I got this to protect my front passenger seat when I had a dog riding shotgun.

They go on to become members of Accentus/Oni Wytars/Unicorn, easily the most formidable early music instrumental ensemble in existence. Here, their skills certainly aren't what they'll become. But even amid their slightly hesitant and unrefined playing, their phenomenal musical spirit shines through. Thomas Wimmer is the only early musician I've heard who can sound so compelling with so little technique! I wouldn't recommend this CD as authentic Sephardic music (which isn't verifiably medieval), but it's a welcome addition to any collection solely on the basis of its engaged arrangements and presentation.

Plugging your AC Adapter into the stand and then flicking a switch turns on a the bright blue light.

It is not exactly nature photography, but rather, very intimate portraits of beings, plants and animals, on the edge of extinction, found nowhere else in the world but Hawaii. The color and print quality are glorious. One can only hope that this book develops a fondness from the viewer toward the denizens of this lost world that can motivate the political will to save and restore it---money to eradicate Miconia that threatens them all, programs to replant native Hawaiian forest, and programs to protect the land from introduced cattle, goats, sheep, deer, and subdivisions. Otherwise, in another generation, children will read this book, and all we will be able to say to them, \\"See what we once had.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great addition to your library if you are interested in the Napoleonic era.

I don't believe even absolute beginners would get much out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad decision","review":"Under no circumstances would I suggest that anyone buy this book for any purpose. Especially don't buy it, if you are considering the Kindle edition. On the Kindle Fire the pages are approximately 1/3 the size of the Kindle Fire screen, and cannot be enlarged. Thus the pages are so small, you can read neither the notation, nor the lyrics at anything near a normal viewing distance. Second, although the book says \\"includes Super-Tab notation\\" on the cover, it does not have ANY type of tablature, super or otherwise. Furthermore, what notation is in the book is only the for the vocal music. If you have any interest in playing the music on any instrument you'll have to go online to find the music there. Trust me your online search will give you much better results. Shame on Alfred Music Publishing for offering it and shame on Amazon for enabling them to sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon product picture shows the wrong adapter","review":"When I bought this adapter the picture showed a male HDMI connector to female DVI connector, however, the text description was the opposite.

Unfortunately, it has often been misunderstood to be a whale. I know it is a children's movie, yet that is not a reason to stray from God's Word. ...The VeggieTales movie about Jonah is more accurate and is awesome! Even the ending of the veggietales movie is accurate to the Word, in that Jonah never really understood that God has mercy upon anyone who repents, turns away from sin, and truly seeks His will. The story of Jonah is often taught as a story of obedience, which it is. Yet it is also a story of God's MERCY. The veggietales movie teaches that in a captivating (and entertaining) way.

Absolutely the lowest quality, and the graphics are horrible. The cover pictures ARE NOT what you get in the movie itself!! Not even close! As a consumer, I expect to get what is advertised!! I was wondering why there weren't any video sample clips... Now I know!! It is too bad that I opened them all before I watched one because I would have returned them all!! Not Kidding!

I also read the Microsoft Training Kit book for this exam. This books covers a bit of information in its 300 pages, but I certainly would not rely on this one book to teach you what you need to know. The enclosed CD contains two practice exams and flash cards. The book's main weakness, however, is in the questions both on the CD and the ones at the end of each chapter. The questions are not the verbose type found on Microsoft exams and they are much easier - too easy in fact to be of much use. If you want to utilize good questions for the exam try MeasureUp and SelfTest.

I may be being picky but when I buy a cookbook touting being 'International' I expect it to have a a decent amount of recipes from each country included - not a MASSIVE section of French food but when you get to numerous other countries you're lucky to get 2 to 4 recipes for them. And, when you buy an 'International' cookbook shouldn't the recipes actually be authentic? For example: I am pretty sure very few Russians can afford to use a pound of Fillet Mignon to make Beef Stroganoff.Furthermore, a great many of the recipes - you will NEVER use. Seriously - who needs this many recipes for Fish Soup?

He by far has been the most impressive tutor I've seen to date.

He also trusts in the process of the yoga unlike the biggest loser and boot camp flavors of yoga program.This is a video I can recommend to my mother who has had back problems for over a decade.

This book was obviously written as a marketing tool for the author's vocal coaching services... but it had the opposite effect on me. Perhaps she witheld information in some misguided attempt to encourage readers to go to Toronto for personal instruction. Or maybe she simply doesn't have any useful information to dispense. Regardless, this book did nothing to convince me that the Vocal Science courses and seminars would be any less of a waste of time than the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect?","review":"Your satisfaction will depend entirely on your expectations.

If you just want to read about the author's life experiences in regard to her career in music, her personal journeys, her discovery of a new vocal technique and how she came to have a school of music - read on. The entire book digresses from myths about singing, to helpful herbs, to singing with emotion for self-expression.....and is an overall transcript of her personal perspectives. Humor is attempted throughout, compounding an already confusing and nebulous script.

But on the eve of disaster for the small town they live in, their own lives and marriage crumbling beneath them, this husband and wife have a chance to save themselves, and their marriage, if they can build a bridge across the great ocean that has grown up between them.A novel of magic and heartache, Mr. Toth creates characters you feel, a story you see, and a world you believe.

Being a nightly after dinner show it was very convenient to watch. Although the season finale was aired soon after I got hooked to the comedy, the show is so popular that reruns are still on every night which helps to get me caught up on everything that I have missed, especially the episodes of the seasons which I have not bought yet.Another reason why this comedy is so easy to get hooked to is that the characters are seen throughout many seasons.

It is normal for every show to run out of ideas with time but all things considered ELR wasn't that bad, specially since season 8 might have just been an improvement over the less inspired #7. I specially enjoyed the \\"Lateness\\" episode in which I found as much truth and uneasiness as in the classic \\"The Cannister\\", in other words, something like this could happen to you (and probably has). I also think the \\"Misery loves company\\" episode is one of the best of the series, for a second there you can sense there is more than a glimpse of knowledge in Frank and Marie constantly beligerant attitude toward each other.I have a collection of TV shows (Cheers, Seinfeld, Taxi, Happy Days,24 etc.) but only in the case of 1 specific show I have bought every available episode: (to put it in Robert's words: Raymond, Raymond, Raymond,....)

In three brief chapters he captures the essence of the role of sports for humankind, its attractions and challenges. To understand sports is to understand the human aspiration for order, freedom and immortality. If to understand sports is to understand humanity, then to understand baseball is to comprehend the soul of America.I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires a deeper understanding of sports and their role in our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Translation","review":"There are two kinds of people in this world, those that absolutely loved the film Lost in Translation and those that said, \`What the hell did I just watch?' I myself fall into the latter camp and I couldn't help thinking about that movie while reading this book from Bart Giamatti. It sounds like something that was indeed written by the president of Yale and if it was about baseball I could barely tell. I'm sure there are those that will thoroughly enjoy this work just as those that enjoyed Lost in Translation but clearly this ode to sport was out of my league. I had more fun dissecting John Dryden in a 17th century lit class years ago than I did reading this. I would recommend Thomas Boswell's \\"Why Time Begins on Opening Day\\" or Ken Burns baseball documentary instead. I have to say the foreword and afterword by Jon Meacham and Marcus Giamatti respectively were very well written and quite moving, more of what I was expecting from the late Commissioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of great book","review":"Stephen Silver's book is a great find and a must for any budding cartoonist.

They also make it easier to grab things in the oven since the material is thinner and material \\"grippier.\\" Another advantage of the material is that you don't have the big issue of the fabric getting wet--there's nothing like having a moist cloth oven mitt and the heat permeating to your skin--ouch!!!!!!!!

It deals with a blind young woman ( Farrow ) who returns home to find her family has been murdered. How and when she realizes the evils took place...and how she deals with it...are the focus of this first rate story. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite Thriller...","review":"When I was a teenager growing up in NY this film used to be shown on TV late at night. It had an impact on me, and I found myself looking back over the years and appreciating it more and more. See No Evil has the ability to transport the viewer into its strange eerie world with a sense of realism and terror. I love the simplicity of the storyline, the beautiful English setting, the acting, and the the overall creepiness! I still have a mad crush on the boyfriend too....DREAMY!!! Another fave English suspense film that was on late night TV was \\"And Soon the Darkness\\" with Pamela Franklin. Unfortunately it is difficult to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific thriller","review":"I saw this movie when I was 9 years old at the old New Broadway theater in San Juan. I remember being terrified. So it was interesting seeing this movie so many years later. It still holds up. This is a really suspenseful movie that takes a while to build up, but when it does, it really delivers. Mia Farrrow is excellent as the blind girl who suddenly discovers that all her relatives have been murdered. Watch out for the man with the boots!!!!I wish the DVD had some interesting extras, it simply features the trailer for the movie and for \\"Homicidal\\"(?).Still a great buy and a good movie for a rainy Saturdaty afternoon.

I'm looking forward to watching the entire program on DVD. Thanks for another good feature, HBO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I saw this on a recent flight and after 45 minutes decided that it was more painful than dealing with airport security. As someone who occasionally has bouts of insomnia, I thought this would provide useful information. Instead it was the most self absorbed display I can recall seeing in years. It was like watching an addict who wants to blame everyone else for his problems (maybe he has problems sleeping because his parent fought when he was a child?) but really has no desire to solve the problem. This was just painful to try to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and utterly uninformative","review":"This has to be one of the most grating and pointless documentaries I have ever seen. The filmmaker is utterly self-absorbed and neurotic. He obviously believes his incessant thinking to be a marker of a superior intellect, when he is actually a rather typical worrier who never learned to quiet his mind. He overuses repetitive sounds to mark the passing of time (yes, ticking of the clock, we get it) and stock footage from the 1940's and 1950's (amusing a few times, but more than half the film is lame clips). In the end, I felt annoyed at his obvious desire for an instant cure (hence his sleeping pill addiction), his more-creative-genius-than-thou pride in his insomnia \\"problem,\\" and hokey editing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"We watched this last night. My partner wanted to stop after 30 minutes. I kept watching hoping the main character's wife would shake some sense into him. This movie sheds little light on insomnia but a lot of light on the filmmaker - he is VERY proud of himself. I found his constant assertion that he is different and brilliant annoying and not born out by the evidence: lots of people have trouble sleeping and/or are night owls and he clearly isn't brilliant. Most troubling is that he refuses, throughout the film, to do ANYTHING to try to sleep better. That left us with this question: how bad can it be if he doesn't care to change the status quo, for himself, his wife or his new baby?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Already at Walmart","review":"This movie is already out for purchase. Found this combo at Walmart for 5 bucks. Wanted \\"They\\" only, this is the closest (other release has 4 movies). I found the movie compelling and moves along quite well. Very good cast and acting is convincing. Sleeper movie not many know about. The picture is much better than the DVD, as it should be. Some soft scenes, but it seems to refocus if you will, after each occurrence. Sound says DTS on the label, but plays back DTSMA on my player (Elite 05) which for me is worth the 5 bucks alone as this movie, like many in this genre, relies heavily on the sound to generate suspense and peril. Doesn't disappoint. Very good spacing, detail and dynamics. A super clean version would of had me drop 20 without blinking. As it stands, for 5 bucks, it's a super deal for sure.Out of a possible 5, I'd rate video a 3.5 and sound a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good spoon rest","review":"Good spoon rest.

What I found was something more along the lines of a greeting card than <i>The Giving Tree</i> (which is something like what I was hoping for).The illustrations were nice, I give it that, but this was so utterly *sappy* I'm surprised the pages weren't stuck together. Maybe this would be perfect for the Chicken Soup for the Soul types, but not for people who want a touching story that isn't ridiculously cheesy.

Thesae are the alcoholic and young people who are also squatters. She is determined to help, and spends alot of time with the people. Her middle class parents try their best to prevent her, but she does this work anyway. It is a truly fascinating story and well-written in great detail. I highly recommned this book to anyone. If nothing else it is a great read, but more than this it is a book in which you can come away with a greater appreciation of the struggling poor. Too, you can also learn an honest way of helping, which would engender trust on the part of the \\"recipients\\".

Although the author understands the basics of Quantum Mechanics, I did not see him connecting that knowledge with the workings of the conscious mind, at least in the way he presented it. Part of my PhD thesis dealt heavily with Quantum Mechanics. The only relavence I can see of QM (and Einsteins relativity) to the conscious mind is that we have to be open to the unexpected. It seems that from the evidence of near death experiences, past life recal, the paranormal, telephathy etc, the consious mind has a connection to a non-material consciousness with which it sometimes communicates. The author however does not even allude to this possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"Just not very interesting the way it is written ... a real disappointment.

It is a must read to scientists studying the brain and personal behaviour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps I am dense, but ...","review":"It seems as though the central claim of Chalmers is based on what seems to be a faulty argument. He imagines a molecule-for-molecule identical copy of himself that lacks conscious experience, and then says that because it's logically possible to imagine it, there must be something other than molecules responsible. My problem is that he is jumping the gun. We don't know the brain well enough yet. He is taking an unsolved problem, imagining someone without this feature, then saying that this feature is therefore above the physical.

Dave Chalmers breaks out of the crowd & makes us rethink everything. I am on record as not thinking the *hard problem* is as hard as Dave does; but read Chalmers for the argument that I (& most others underestimate) the difficulty. I think also that the move from conceivability (of zombies) to possibility is a problem. The fact remains that this is the most important work in consciousness studies in recent years.One small thing: one reviewer of my *Consciousness Reconsidered* complains that I don't respond to Chalmers. This is true. My defense: my book appeared 4 or 5 years before Dave's. It would have been hard to respond to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"the great pretender","review":"The main hypothesis of this book, resting on the fictional \\"zombie\\" Gedankenexperiment is so bizarre & naive that it boggles the mind.Can nature evolve a highly functioning zombie? Of course not. What we call consciousness is a direct product of embodiment - an emergent 'functional state' that allows evolved multicellular creatures to navigate their environment. Therefore the book is mainly hot air.Chalmers thinks of a meaningless/pointless \\"hard problem\\" and then meanders around through using \\"look-at-how-clever-I-am\\" mental gymnastics. In other words, he invents mysteries, or nonsense, or both together.

His jokes are not funny, his questions not perceptive, and he constantly steps all over his guests' attempts to utter pointless gibberish. The DVD notes make a fool out of Sly Stone, and I expected the worst, but compared to the rest of the numbskulls, and to Cavett himself, Sly comes off rather sensibly. It's hardly necessary to ridicule Sly for drug use when Cavett has raved about the wonderful effects of his own electroshock treatments.

Then even my hand wasn't warm because some of the water from the chamber leaked out on it.There are no buttons or other type of controls, just a twist off plug for the water resevoir. Allegedly it's supposed to heat on its own. No checking, tightening, of the plug made a difference. Even sincere threats of violence couldn't get Steam Magic Pro to perspire, let alone heat.Remember that old con, where someone is selling \\"factory sealed\\" vcrs to people stuck in traffic, then when the box is opened, there's nothing but a brick? In this instance, a brick would have at least been an honest con. There are better ways to waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeliPro Knife is the greatest","review":"This is similar to the old Swiss Army Magna WonderKnife that used to be sold by Hammacher Schlemmer for 49.99.

Dogmatic iberalswon't like it, but concerned parents and others shouldlook at this study before pouring any more funding into a failed system. Paul J. Walkowski, Co-Author, \\"From Trial Court to the United States Supreme Court\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading!","review":"This book is one of the best things I have ever read as a parent. It explains WHY the educational systems we have today are failing, and WHAT parents can do about it.I read this book through several times, and it is just so packed full of information! I come from a family of public school teachers, and I am a homeschooler, partly because of what I have heard from the p.s. teachers in my family. There are problems inherent in the public school systems, and in this book, many of them are delineated.Sykes briefly touches on the impact of psychological and psychiatric programs in the schools, but I think he fails to realize that they are actually BEHIND many of the other problems. This is why I give this book 4 stars instead of 5.Combined with The Leipzig Connection, I think this book could make a huge difference for many children -- if only their parents and educators would read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't you get the email? Then why buy the book?","review":"There's nothing new in this book. It's all the same clueless right-wing blather that was in Sykes' other book. This book is also a re-hash of the \\"chain letter\\" email, erroneously attributed to Bill Gates, that is still making its way around the Internets. (No doubt Charlie is trying to profit off of his association with that email.) Seriously, though, Charlie, we get it--you don't like public schools, you don't like government, you don't like infrastructure. Then why don't you DO something about it, rather than throwing stones from the outside vis-a-vis books like this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical bubble-brained right-wing blather","review":"Like so many of his compatriots, Charlie talks a good game in a vacuum. The fact that much of this book is pure fiction doesn't get in the way telling us all how to fix our schools. This book panders to the prejudices of everyone who thinks teachers are lazy and educators don't give a damn about kids. Thus it adds nothing to the critical debate on how to fix our schools, except white noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"repeat...repeat...repeat","review":"I actually agree with the author's basic premise that the public education system is too worried about everything except the academic education of our children. I started reading this book prepared to nod my head and say, \\"uh, huh\\" while agreeing with his clever way of stating what I already think.I read the first several chapters and then just started skimming over headings. The author, while clearly passionate about his subject matter, keeps saying the same thing over and over. Perhaps, as publically educated readers, he believes we will not understand his message unless he states in 200 times in 100 different ways.I would be very interested in reading a new, abridged, version of this book where Mr. Skyes states his ideas just one time--clearly enough to be understood by his target audience (who I never could honestly identify.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times can you make the same point.","review":"The book could have been reduced to the first few chapters. The remainder of the book is simply a rehashing of the same theme discussed at the beginning of the book. This should have been an article in a magazine and not a published book. Perhaps he should have titled the book \\"Dumbing Down Our Kids and Our Customers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's My Book?","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago and I was taken in by Mr. Sykes fearless dissection of educratic logic. Well after 3 years of teaching in a fairly affluent school district I was wondering when we were going to get a sequel. What about the kids who get good grades, have supportive parents, read very well and 'don't feel good about themselves'? What about 8 and 9 year olds who suffer from sleepless nights and stress because of standardized test issues? This is typical narrow-minded, right-wing bellyaching that is about as objective as MSNBC and the Fox News Network. The current wave of accountability testing is already collapsing under the weight of its own disjointed logic. In years to come this book will be seen as evidence of a misguided attempt by freak reactionaries to uproot one of the only public insitutions worthy of its existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Rocks","review":"This \\"album\\" has always drawn me in.

John may have done better and perhaps it doesn't even rank the 5 stars on this Amazon scale, but compared to some of the trash that is passed for music today it deserves far more than that....Taxi Dancer alone was worth 4.

This is my favorite John Cougar album for this reason. Many of the songs are hard hitting rock songs - A Little Night Dancin', Small Paradise, Miami, Great Mid-West, and Pray For Me are spectacular songs you will never hear on the radio. They also have staying power. I Need a Lover is w/o a doubt the highlight and much better than Pat Benetar's version. The long intro is killer. This album is worth your money! I have not yet heard the remastered version, but will order it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"John's Best Album","review":"This is John's first and best album. Every song is a classic. But then his next several albums followed suit. Each has a distinct style as he developed over the years. I have always been an album listener - skip the \\"best of\\" stuff. You have to hear the man. My favorite creative artists with their own unique style that has endured over time are John Cougar Mellencamp and Tom Petty. I love a bunch of bands out there, too many to list. But in my collection, I have every one of their albums. Other bands, an album here and there. They stuck it out and keep on rocking to this very day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak debut.","review":"Mellencamp's second album, but first to be released in the states, is the typical first album that does not hint at the greatness soon to come.The only song remotely familiar to the general public is \\"I Need A Lover\\", famously covered by Pat Benatar. It shows his ability to write a pop song, and write it well, the rest of the album suffers from what \\"A Biography\\" also did...weak songs with cliched sounds. The production gets better, and there is definite progress being made if you compare it to \\"A Biography\\".However, here in the U.S. we didn't, and this album was ignored. And listening to it now, you can't really blame us for doing so.If I'm being honest (oh dear...I'm sounding like Simon Cowell...) this is an album I probably won't listen to again.Again, I think this album will appeal to hardcore Mellen-heads (like me) as you can't believe the guy who made \\"Scarecrow\\" made something like this...One more thing: the remastering on this and the rest of the series is spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Incredible cd.Mainly want to say: You can buy this new for 15 dollars off of Jimbo's website.

I do have a post-production complaint however: Acorn saw fit to add Engish subtitles to an English script! It was not necessary, the accents are not that heavy.

Derek Jacobi is the definitive Cadfael, I could never imagine another. The production values are excellent with the look and feel of the 13th century. The stories will hold you interest. The music is perfect and the featured actors are great. I personally liked Sean Pertwee as Hugh Berringer in Series 1. The extras are interesting but Jacobi is only on as an audio.

Here, he demonstrates his intellect and eloquence in 756 pages of compelling prose.You can't fail to be impressed by how well he covers both the biological and the physical sciences. It is really tough to do both well. Perhaps Calder is a good successor to the late Isaac Asimov.Very suitable (and recommended) for a high school or undergraduate reading. I would claim that this book is best directed at the high school level. For it is there that students may decide to pursue further studies in science, or not.

None of the characters really have any emotional depth or personality, thus it's hard to care when anything bad happens to them, which is pretty much all that does happen in this book. I realize that many people were like Sofia in that they either did not or could not understand what was happening in this time period because of government censorship and misinformation, but Sofia isn't just naive.

For, the linguistic characteristic of French as to Derrida possesses the significance of racial discrimination, cultural hegemony and 'grand narrative' covertly.

I frankly think that it is more likely an electrical interference problem with these units than a range problem.We have a fairly high tech house with multiple wireless items eg.Security System,Internet,Cable etc. I think that if you have multiple signals being transmitted in your home that it simply interferes with the operation of the 'hook up' between the transmitter and receiving unit.I suggest that you take this into careful consideration BEFORE you purchase one of these units.Mine are both going back to Amazon today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I purchased this item foolishly ignoring the warnings of other reviews.

It requires a standard DC power adapter to plug into the wall. The cord is useful if you want to put the device on a shelf or dresser and can hide it. I just wanted it on an open wall in the kitchen. I used double sided tape to stick it to the wall right next to an outlet and then wrapped the cord up with a velcro tie and tucked it between the power adapter and the device.

When I go to bed the garage door is closed and the green light is on as it should be.

The garage doors are about 30 feet from receiver. On the first day or two it registered properly. After that, the receiver would alternate between the door(s) opened or closed.

That might be tolerable... Except the connect the AC plug is at the TOP of the unit. So you can't hang this on a wall because the cord is on top and it just flips off the front of the device. Second issue... The AC adapter is a full size block plug. So it takes up a lot of space on your outlet. If you plan on installing it say in the same outlet as a phone charger or base unit good luck. Third issue.... Why doesn't it have a button to control the door? Wouldn't that make sense? If you are putting this sensor in your house, logic dictates that you don't want to be walking to the garage to check on it. Well, if it's open, why would you want to walk to the garage to close the door? HELLO!If they made this with a controller button and made the AC plug less annoying, it might be worth $20.

I have the base unit located one level above the garage on the opposite side of the house and have a good signal. I don't know if I would trust the unit blindly (after all, anything electronic or mechanical can fail on occasion) but it's a great confirmation device for what I *think* I already know.I can't tell you the number of times that I knew the garage door was closed, only to second guess myself and go all the way back downstairs to check. Now I close the door behind me, see the green light on when I get upstairs, and never need to wonder from that point on.Would it be nice if the base unit were a little smaller? Yes. Would it be nice if you didn't need to plug it into a wall outlet? Sure. But I think these are small trade-offs for the piece of mind it gives. Maybe the next generation monitor will incorporate these changes, but for now I'm happy with the way it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price...","review":"I have now been using the Chamberlain garage door monitor for ~6 months and it works great.I have a detached garage and the base unit works anywhere in the house.

Of course, I have the receiver mounted only 20 feet from the sensor.I mounted the sensor at the top of the garage door with screws (I don't trust tape). That was the easy part.I mounted the receiver on my bedroom wall. I knew that many people were upset about the need for a wire to run to the unit, so I just drilled a hole behind the mounting point & ran the wire through the wall down to the outlet that was conveniently below it. So, it looks like it belongs on the wall. In my opinion, it was worth the extra work.Anyhow, I did raise & lower the garage door many times to verify function & all is well. No false alarms yet.

The receiver is placed on the second floor directly above the garage doors. There is approximately 10 feet between the transmitters and the receiver, through a hard wood floor and sub-flooring.

I'd give it a great review if that was all that mattered to me as the movie viewer. It might even be a 4 or 5 star as a family or christian movie but looking at the the rest makes it all fall apart.

New technology that is cutting edge. New way of approaching film.I got a dull, predictable plot that at many points made no effort to connect the story/plot point together.It is as if they were so focuse on the technology that they assumed the story would make itself.You are left with the feeling that the director thought, \\"it's a cartoon so it doesn't need to make sense.\\"And, it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad interpretation of a classic teenage comic that explores the world.","review":"This interpretation on screen of Tintin, lacks the soul and depth of characters that Herge created as artist. When I read the books, I got a different picture of tintin's characters, Haddock's melodramatics. Tintin does one thing to you - it unifies you with a vision of world that Herge created, and teaches you to respect cultures and nations.Screen adaptation has a mellowed Haddock with passion, a tintin that is too serious for an adventure, and a story that is at heart of Tintin's adventure - ruined by slapstick stunts rather than being enamored by tintin's quick wits and Haddock's silly antics.In case, however, you have not been introduced to tintin through herge's picture books, please bear in mind you are watching a mindless stunt show, rather than being properly introduced to tintin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This was to stupid for my taste.

All I knew was that he was a very popular comic character from the 1950s-1960s. So without any prior knowledge I still felt that this was one of the themost enjoyable animated films in 2011.You have two of the best directors of the past 30 years, two incredible young script writters and a cast for the ages. The 'Adventures of TinTin' is just a rolercoaster of excitement and pefect blend of adventure and comedy. You do not need to be a Tintin purest to enjoy this one.

First of all, I should I have guessed it was going to be a be hassle because there was no description in the product details about the actual digital copy. I assumed it was through amazon. You have to sign up/create an account on not one but two websites to finally get your movie. And the best part - even thought it says right on the DVD - works with itunes, it does not!!!!!!

Obviously this is a children's movie but even as a kid I would have felt insulted.The story is pretty standard and the animation is fairly nice but probably not worth your time watching unless you're a fan of Tintin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old comics reinvented in a brilliant manner","review":"Let's hope for more of this.

Other than that it was AN AMAZING MOVIE!! ;) I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, great animation and poor storytelling","review":"I have found this to be a common theme among most of the computer animated movies nowadays. Speilbergs TinTin is no exeption. Here we have some of the most stunning animation ever put on film that is frustratingly wasted on a mediocre story. I found the whole expeirence to be a confusing mess. There were never any genuinely funny moments, (though it tries and flops), and the over use of action sequences just became tedious after a while. Its amazing that a master storyteller like Steven Speiberg could deliver to misfires in one year, War Horse being the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks 3D experience","review":"Disappointed with 3D, unlike Hugo the image was flat.

The best part of the film for me was the major action sequence towards the end of the movie...but, having to sit through two hours to get to that point, it wasn't enough action/story/animation to win me over. Having seen it in the non-3D format, I'm guessing that the major saving point of the film for others may have BEEN the 3D (and truthfully, the \\"loveable\\" drunk captain was an embarrassment to watch with my niece and nephew).Plop in the DVD of \\"Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief\\" if you want to give the kids a good action/adventure/story to watch.

Would you want your kids to remember TinTin this badly? Probably not.Story, Cinematography, soundtrack and overall feel is muddy, underwhelming and lost in translation fits the key premise of my review and thoughts about the film. Sure, 3D effects are nice and don't detract from what little energy this film has left.Kid may enjoy it but only because their is a Dog in the film and that they would probably get emotionally attached to him... until he dies. Truly a sad film. Not very engrossing and lacks depth to save grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a cute cartoon!","review":"This cartoon isn't your typical cartoon.

One of the scenes can be kind of hard to follow what is happening, but it's rather funny anyway. The very young children may find some of the action too violent and scary, but for older kids, it's fine.I had originally been hoping that there would be more special features, like deleted scenes and outtakes; but the behind the scenes feature was interesting, to see how they made the animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthraling","review":"I have never read any of the Tintin books though I do have a Tintin book about learning French.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Of course, you could always check out the NEW version of that song on his new 'Timeless' album with Black-Eyed Peas, but if you're not crazy about the funky urban reinvention (as am I), then by all means check this original one out.

The second half is a little thinner, more latin than you might like. The vocals are a little up-front sometimes, but the album has a live feel to it. The small combo is a treat to hear. The first tune of course is the classic that everyone will recognize, and evokes the 60's immediately. The only complaint I might have is that the album is extremely short, with 10 songs and the two longest of those are just under 3 minutes. There's less than 1/2 hr of music on this album. A great debut from an icon of the period. I wish Herb Alpert had played at least one little solo somewhere, but he was only interested enough to put his name on it, not to play on it. By the way if you like the French electronica group Stereolab, this will show you where they got a lot of their sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazilian","review":"Great music that never grows old.

No explanation is given and the texts are very hermetic. Maybe these books are pointed to another level of astrology student.

No Encarta is ever going to have the scholarly content I'm looking for. But I'm sticking with DVD 2002 for now, even though it has other flaws (dvd can't install to hard drive, etc).

There are different age levels and libraries that allow this to work for a much wider age group than others.I agree with the reviewer that says - If you want flash without substance than Encarta or others will do - if you want trusted, comprehensive content in a good (if not flashy) interface than Britannica is the one - without question - to go with.I am looking forward to the second version (2004) of this new interface and direction Britannica has taken and anticipate great improvements in all areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"For an OWB holster for non conceal carry it is a great product.

His honest, plainspokenness is particularly interesting when he compares the demands upon the choral conductor with those of the typical instrumental conductor.All this is presented with plenty of humor in a conversational tone, making for an engaging and entertaining read.

This 1987 version is fit to be viewed over and over (as we do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Version of Secret Garden!","review":"I have read some poor reviews here, but I disagree. The Hallmark Hall of Fame version is my absolutely favorite. Yes, I know the ending is not true to the book, but I am able to forgive that because the rest of the movie is so good. The romantic in me does adore the ending if I forget about the book. It does seem even somewhat realistic as one set of my great-great-grandparents did marry and have children in the late 1800s - they were first cousins! Even if Colin and Mary were first cousins in this movie, it would be entirely conceivable that they marry. I enjoyed this version overall - and much more so than the 1993 version. (In that version, there is an earthquake! I love earthquake stories, but I also love epidemic stories, and Mary's parents must die of cholera. The ending is forgivable, but the cause of death is not!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror Garden","review":"This film was creepy and unnecessarily dramatic. It does not follow the novel accurately, and the \\"artistic liberty\\" taken by the director ruins the beauty and joy of the original story. The background music is dramatic to the point of being ridiculous, much of the lighting is dark, and the overall feeling is that of a horror movie. My eight-year-old, fairly tolerant of spooky stories and movies, did not like it and we did not finish watching it. My husband and I just thought it was stupid. If you've read the book recently, you'll find this film version disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Awful Acting.","review":"While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.Recommend you see another version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worset movie ever","review":"I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring.It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.The child actress \\"mary\\" and then the older grown up \\"mary\\" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful!Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite version","review":"This is my absolute favorite version of the Secret Garden. The death scene at the beginning when the family dies in India is chilling. The kids show the right degree of stubbornness, and you really relate to the change in the characters. I can watch this over and over (and do when i show it to my classes). The kids always get caught up in the story. Perfection!! Don't waste your time on other versions...buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, not a good video","review":"The Secret Garden is one of my favorite children's stories. This video keeps faithfully to the story, but is ruined for me by the fact that the three children (Mary, Colin, and Dicken) all have American accents and Martha has a Cockney accent. Maybe this wouldn't matter to someone who doesn't know English accents at all, but Dicken and Martha should have the same broad Yorkshire accents (they're brother and sister after all!) and Mary should have an upperclass British accent. These details are important to the story.My 6 year old found elements of the video quite scary but stayed glued to it nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Video Deserves -0 Stars","review":"I know that some people read these reviews, but decide to find things out for themselves. Trust me. DO NOT buy this movie. It is terrible. This is truthfully the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is dreadful and the changes made to the plot completely destroy the original meaning of the film. If you are looking for something similar to the book, try the Kate Maberly version. That one is, in my opinion, by far the best. Please, don't waste your money on such a pitiful excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist."},{"rating":"1","title":"did the writer even read the book","review":"I don't know who wrote this movie but it has nothing to do with the book. Only in the beginning did it even resemble the orginal story. but after that it went down hill. they changed everything. First by making Mary and Colin not cousins was wrong and then at the end to add things to it that weren't in the book. First of all the story ended after Mr. craven discovered his son could walk and the garden was reopened but in this movie they had to add what they thought would happen when they children grew up. If you are going to that at least it should have been Mary engaged to Dickon instead of Colin. especially since they were cousins and it seemed like Mary had a little crush on Dickon. so my advise is if you want a copy of this movie check out the other ones or do not read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret Garden","review":"The acting was terrible. The girl began with an English accent, then lost it halfway through the movie. The original Secret Garden is MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film version of \\"The Secret Garden\\"","review":"I saw this version when it was first aired in 1987, and I remember being disappointed with it then as a nine-year-old who had religiously read and re-read the book. The ending was the most disappointing aspect for me (Colin over Dickon? Never!), and now that I'm older I can pick out countless other things that made this movie so bad (most of which other negative reviews here have covered). The 1993 version is the best, and even the version from the 1940's was far more enjoyable than this version of a classic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the 1993 version instead...","review":"These Hallmark films bore me to tears. They are far from exciting, let alone interesting. Nothing more than a long talk-a-thon with very little going on. The music is not so great either. Watch the 1993 version instead. It's the best one. You can find it here:The Secret Garden"},{"rating":"1","title":"This video stinxs!","review":"I love the Secret Garden but this video just stinks it all up! The girl that played Mary was utterly annoying, the way she said, 'CurtainS and fountains of roses.\\" was HORRIBLE! Notice how i say HORRIBLE! The boy that played Colin was also annoying, after someone says something he'l say, \\"I like that curtains and fountains of roses,\\" and blah blah blah BLAH!

Not only is it exciting, dramatic, informative and fun to watch, it is also intelligent and believable. The narrator is both a ceremonial magician and an anthropolgist. He does not insult anyone's intelligence, or make any wild claims to supernatural powers--but the technique of facial reflection-distortion in a dark mirror that he uses to evoke the traditional spirits of the Lemegeton is ingenious, startling and effective. The fact that it is also admittedly hypnotic and subjective adds to its credibility, but does not detract from its power or its authenticity. This documentary may be a dissapointment to those credulous miracle-seekers Crowley called \\"the fools\\" among the students of magick, but for those of us who agree with Maestro Lon DuQuette that: \\"It's all in your head, but you have no idea how BIG your head is!\\" The Magick of Solomon, and The Book of Solomon's Magick are pure gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I saw this stuff on youtube and was astounded.

I usually watch more girly animes not to much fantasy but after buying the book I was hooked and the dvds were also very addictive. It's very nicely played out, the characters have there funny moments and than the serious ones. It's not cheesy either where you have to roll your eyes. It was done well and ended on a good note. I am going to buy season two though from the looks of other reviews it was not as great or up to par but what can we expect most things that are continued such as dragonball gt are never as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most allsome anime","review":"I was hook the first time I laid eyes on the Manga. Due to some cercumstances at the bookstores I couldn't find any of the mangas past 4. So I bought to DVDS. And I became addicted. I loved it!!! The funny moments (especally with the trolls), the flash backs, and the serious moment. I mean what eles can you ask for. It has every thing in six DVDs. Humor, Alittle bit of romance, fantasy, action, adventure and much much more. I have to admit sometimes the plot alittle slow but I guess it's just to fit all the funny parts in. I would recomend you to buy this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Wizards & Warriors Series","review":"By today's steep animation standards, Orphen looks a little dated. However, one should notice the care and attention to many details the animators used despite the absence of computer modified animation. The characters are likeable and well portrayed. Though there are issues and flaws, many of these are minor and easily overlooked. The story is engaging and full of surprises. Of particular note: the two trolls who seem to always cause Orphen a ton of trouble are wonderful comedic additions.The anime gets high marks for fun, action, and characterization. Lower marks due to some inconsistency in the story and plot, as well as merely average voice acting.Overall this is a worthy, classic anime addition to any library.Viewing Preference: English Dubbed"},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL COOL COOL COOL....!!!!","review":"Orphen is a really really really good series. Obviously. It starts a little bit slow, but still manages to make you want to watch more. Once you get to the last ten or so, it's really hard to stop watching it. Volkan and Dortin are really annoying, but hey, without them, where would the humor come from? (aside from Cleao and Majic and Leki, and Black Tiger...) Anyway, this series is definitely recommended.So is Orphen Revenge, though I've only seen the first DVD. The ending is a little twisted, but it's perfect for the series. Also, the nudity in the last few episodes is not needed. Even so, it's one of the better anime series that I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictively oustanding","review":"The first time I seen Orphen a friend had it. I did want to give it back.

For someone who does not know Japanese, this anime is not worth the time and money, even for someone who likes magical and sword fighting animes. First, the plot sucks. Second, the dubbing does not match the subtitle. And third, the character's (especially, Orphen and his crew) names change often.If you are not a Japanese speaker, don't buy Orphen because you will not be able to understand this anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must to collectors","review":"A recommended read for anyone interested in the history and aesthetics of the Japanese fan. A basic historical review which traces the developements in taste and techniques.

She hardly knew him and her contact with him was limited to a few brief phone calls and one short in person meeting when Tim came to her house to pick up a tv set.I feel the title was very deceptive and designed to lure people in. She had a life with Terry yes, but not Tim. Plus she made the unfair allegation that Tim killed Marife Nichol's son when there is not and was not the thinnest shred of evidence thats true.In fact all the evidence points in the opposite direction-that McVeigh tried to save the boys life.Only read if you have an intense desire to know every last scrap of information, mainly about Terry Nichols because he is primarily what the book is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickie book cashes in","review":"There's not much worth reading here. It's a badly written, uninformative book that tries to paint the \\"as told to\\" author, Terry Nichols' ex-wife, as an insider on the case.

I remember it was hot as hell and raining almost mist like and this guy comes out with this weird sounding guitar and thumping funky music, what a show. If this is your first time hearing scofield you would know what I mean, his guitar sounds different than most guitarists. He somehow manages to write all instrumental very catchy , jazzy, funky, tunes and wraps it up in a neat package. I love this album. I bought it as soon as I left on the way home.

It's a blend of jazz, funk and beyond.Scofield amazed me with his versatile fusion playing.

This record is packed to the last byte with great musical understanding and rythm between bass, drums and rythm guitar.The \\"youngsters\\" Scofield has summited on this record are driving the groove to a place where Scofield never has been before.

I've never been a big fan of jazz guitar - I find that most guitar players just don't measure up against a Coltrane or Mile - until this. Scofield never runs out of new ideas on this monumental effort. Just sampling each of the songs should be enough to convince any jazz fan that this CD kicks from Acidhead right on through. I'm telling everyone I know to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"it all works","review":"It's good to hear Scofield working with new ideas and with young musicians to fuel his virtuoso playing with solid grooves.The album holds together throughout and the cerebral slippery lines of Scofield's guitar is all held tight by Avi Bortnick's rhythm guitar/samples and the superb drum and bass work. This may be the first scofield album with rap on it, and it all works. Plus we get John Medeski on a few tracks cooking up his mad scientist soundscapes on the keys. Karl Denson sneaks in on a couple tracks as well. This one will be in heavy rotation for me.

For example, I could not find a review of mention of Whispering Canyon Cafe at Disney Wilderness Lodge. The restaurant section seemed like it was missing a number of fairly popular places. Maybe the author felt these places were not of interest to adults-only parties. Also, the only Disney hotels discussed are the high end hotels.

All fonts are my computer are crystal clear, but this one is blurry. Therefore, the only way to read the articles is to set the text size to medium. Also, the pictures tend to be too small. The interface itself is horrid comared to even MS Encarta 1995 edition, which is sad. That's too bad, because the content is head and shoulders above Encarta, and there is an article on just about everything you can imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value.","review":"I recently received Encyclopedia Britannica 2003 Ultimate Reference Suite on dvd. I read all the problems people had with it, but decided to purchase it anyway because of the content. I had no problem downloading it to my hard drive and the user interface is straight forward. I don't know why people are having so much problems with the software. It may be because they are using Windows instead of OS X.Although it is easier to look an article up in the book version of the encyclopedia, it is a lot more economical to buy it on dvd. You receive 3 volumes of encyclopedias, a dictionary, a thesaurus, atlases, quick time movies and much more ..., plus you can download updates. You can't do that with the print version."},{"rating":"1","title":"bogus brittanica","review":"my brittanica will not load. my e-mail requesting assistance remains unanswered (one week). the pay-for-help line has beenbusy for one week. if there were a lower grade than 1 i would assign it ti brittanica.cliff sanders"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great content marred by awful software","review":"It's too bad that the interface is so clunky (other reviewers have already pointed out the problems, so I won't bother here). This is at least the sixth edition of Britannica on CD/DVD, and there's no excuse for such poor software. A shame, really, because the text is far better than anything else out there. I'd like to see them work with Microsoft and develop an interface similar to Encarta's. They could call it Encarta Pro, with the same interface as Encarta but with the authoritative text of Britannica.

After several failed attempts I e-mailed tech support and described the problem. They never responded. I finally found a toll number to customer support. Called them. They sounded amateurish. After trying numerous fixes the guy told me I needed a file from Sun microsystems. He said he would e-mail the link to me. He never did. After another hour on Sun's site I found the correct download and installed it. None of this was documented. My machine is a recent (6 months) high end Dell.The interface with Britannica is poor and hard to navigate. This is unfortunate because the content is quite in depth; which is why I purchase it in the first place. I will certainly hesitate before purchasing another product from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than previous versions","review":"I've owned the 1999, 2001, and 2003 versions of the EB DVD. The 2001 was by far the best. While the content is wonderful in all three versions, only the 2001 edition provided any sort of ease of use. The 1999 version barely functioned, and the 2003 is a major step backward. As others have noted, it runs much slower, the scolling mouse function doesn't work, and the dictionary and article interfaces have been annoyingly combined. Also, the Atlas maps have not been greatly improved, which would have been really nice. The only major improvement in the 2003 EB-DVD is the pronunciation guide included in the dictionary. The superfluous student editions included on the DVD are worthless. My hope is that Britannica will build on strength and focus on improving content in subsequent versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential early wailers","review":"For those who can not afford to get the 3 volume box set collection of the Wailers' pre- \\"Catch a Fire\\" material- including their late 60's sides- the essential recordings with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry- these cds will help you get more acclimated to these sides.Both cds offer alternate takes of many of these songs, which is a nice thing, so as to allow the listener to follow the evolution of the tracks.

The chapters on preoperative evaluation and stabilization of the trauma patient are particularly good. The photographs and illustrations prove appropriate. Deficiences: pediatrics, tumor, and foot and ankle...but these topics can certainly be addressed with other texts such as Ogden's Skeletal Injury in the Child or Lovell and Winter's Pediatric Orthopaedics by Morrisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the original Nintendo Light Zapper instead","review":"Comes in gray or neon orange (not pictured)--I got the orange one through the luck of the draw. It is very cheaply made. It is compatible with the NES 8-bit system in the sense that it works with the games. But, it is a real struggle to get the plug into the connector to the point that you will think it will never happen. Humorously, the packaging indicated that it \\"Come with 8ft Extension Cable\\", but the cable on the gun is no more than 5 feet and there is no further extension to be had. Not a problem as I didn't buy it thinking there was an 8 foot cable, but it is indicative, perhaps, of the quality control used on the product within the package. It should also be noted that this product is not licensed by Nintendo. Not surprising as Nintendo has higher standards than this product exhibits.

I would have done better to toss it and find something more interesting to read.There was absolutely NO emotion by any of the characters in this book.

The tragic event took place more than 58 years before. How would that have affected the villain?I felt that a lot of pages got left somewhere. Jammed in a fax machine? Eaten by the author's dog? Don't know and don't care. If this is an example of Ms. Simmons work, I don't care to read anything else. This one goes to the used book store ASAP.

It is not surprising that it is an excuse to show topless women, but it makes little sense otherwise.[...] No consistency.The nude scenes are just that, with little or no action.Battle of the Colossal Women makes even less sense.[...]Both the battle and love scene between the two women are super staged and awkward.

It's about two women who are increased in size by some scientific experiment, who then push and shove each other for a while (hardly a 'battle'), and then carress each other a little.Vampire Call Girls was a dud too, but was in fact long enough to be both a 'feature' and an exercise in boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for American Toyotas","review":"This intake kit is not for American Toyotas.

Otherwise it is a quality item, made in the UK. Now for Corollas, this will not work with any manufactured before January 2002. That month they switched to a different filter box with a longer intake hose, which they used on the next generation Corollas. I have attached a picture of the newer filter box which it will work with, and the older filter it will not. Even if you jerry rigged this kit to work with the older intake hose, it will place the filter too close to the engine and you will be sucking in hot air, which you don't want.

The orchestra sounds nice; bright, balanced, fluid, and the singers know how to pull off the baroque.But one more comment about the stage. It's like parents day on the Death Star (The Return of the Jedi one) and the Emperor's Guards have gotten together their moms and dads who share a passion for late Guns and Roses and have adapted Axl's stringy corn rows.Yeah it's a shame because Rameau's score is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very ugly production","review":"Rameau's music for this opera is wonderful and it is well-performed by Les Talens Lyriques under Christophe Rousset.

Yes, they're minimalist, but they're also just plain ugly and add nothing to the merits of the opera. The costumes are mediocre at best. Worst of all, the choreography is ugly. The acting is quite weak as well. In every visual respect, this production detracts from Rameau's music rather than illuminating it.If you haven't already seen Rameau's Les Indes Galantes, get that instead, or try a CD version of this opera.

A story that takes you around the world from Siberia to France to Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia. A culmination of the world's best fighters coming together to hunt each other down for a pricey bounty. The violence was too graphic and some of the stunts were a bit over the top. Not as good as Ice Hunt, but better than Area 7.

From the very beginning, Reilly builds a ever increasing tempo of action. Problem is, it's so far-fetched that the reader inevitably skims through the action sequences and scoffs at the results. It's just not a fulfilling read in any sense of the literary word.Oh, and Mr. Reilly, if you \\"happen\\" to read this, there is no contest for the most italized actions sequences and exclamations in a work of literature. In fact, your overt attempt to punctuate action scenes works the opposite way when it's used as much as you did. Just an opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crock!","review":"This is the most unrealistic and ridiculous book I have ever had the misfortune to read.

I think Reilly has missed his calling; he should be writing for comic books, instead of the book market. Then maybe he could have a movie made out of cartoon characters who never die, and hardly get wounded under the most dire circumstances. I'm surprised the characters who do die, as in having their heads cut off, don't somehow grow them back and return to fight another day!

However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible... Sorry Reilly.","review":"Mat Reilly's scarecrow is sub-par read.

I'm sure you'd know to expect action in a Matthew Reilly story, but this was far too over the top and I found it almost exhausting to read. It's action action action with no break, the story leads from one thing to another and back again over and over. Characters get into impossible situations where you think they've had it, when suddenly, [surprise] another impossible factor gets them out. The first couple of times the fact a character may die seems plausible to you, but you just expect some more crap to save them time after time -- it becomes very predictable and boring, really. It's painful! Read Ice Station and leave it there I'd say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"i can't help it but compare to how reilly writes his book to jeffrey archer.. i consider archer as my first love in thriller reading and this book is 3/4 of action in the field and 1/4 explaination and it's the other way around in archer's book..for people who prefers action to explaination this would be a good choice but it wasn't for me...however i have to compliment on the story line..i think the idea of the bounty hunter was brilliant and quite interesting however the story fails to flow..i love the character of scarecrow and mother and i also love the element of surprise...it's not very often you come across things like this..but sadly i didn't read the whole book, i skipped all the actions and went straight to the explaination"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scaredy-crow","review":"I only read this because it was my book club's selection.

Reads like a comic book - all it was missing was a few \\"ka-pow\\" and \\"shazaam\\". I couldn't justify finishing this book. I don't know what this author was trying to communicate. This was my first Matthew Reilly book and probably my last. How could something like this even be published??"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, just wow","review":"I am literally in awe at how incredibly bad this book is. If I could I would give it negative stars. The stuff in this book is only slightly less believable than Star Wars. At least Star Wars gives the disclaimer that it happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. This reads like someone who has no grasp of military doctrine, equipment, or the most general knowledge of physics. I'm willing to suspend some belief when reading fiction but this got a little absurd. Several times throughout the book, I would have laid money on the author being a 15-year old boy. If you are under the age of 16, this may be a great book for you. For anyone older than that with the slightest intelligence, pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously over the top","review":"This novel must have been written for some big screen, off the planet adventure flick. Completely unbelievable, I found myself shaking my head on so many occasions.

I think he tried to outdo the formula that made the other books successful. He tries to pack too much action into it, and the result is not that the book is fast-paced, but rather, that it keeps building improbable situations on top of each other until you look at it and say \\"there is NO way this can happen!\\" Like an above reviewer said, it reads like a comic book. I also don't like the way he killed off a main character in it, and the way he did it ruined the book for me. My $.02"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and a little Emotional","review":"After eagerly anticipating every single one of Matt Reilly's novels I didn't think he could take me anywhere I hadn't been with one of his novels before. WRONG! After reading some very shocking and unexpected plot twists I found my mouth wide open in shock and well, a little emotional. Matt Reilly has captivated me with characters I have unexpectantly become attached to, and after introducing a whole new cast I have to say I can't wait to see them return in a sequel. Scarecrow's new \\"twin\\" especially caught my attention and I can't wait to see him return. Thumbs up to Matt Reilly for making me give up two days of my life and dedicate them to reading a book I just CANT put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarecrow if for the birds","review":"This is a truly awful book. First, the plot is based on Marxist nonsesne,that big businessmen control the world and even worse nonsene: that they would make more money if they first destroyed the world! Second, there is so much action (maybe 200 episodes if you count actions within actions) and so many impossible, hairbreadth escapes that the whole thing becomes ridiculous.Third, the author kills off the one romantic interest for no good reason, so the book is malevolent as well as preposterous. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely absurd","review":"I enjoy many books, I allow for Artistic license, and I do not require absolute accuracy or impeccible physics, but this book went too far. The plot is absurd, but I can forgive that.The cast of charachters keeps coming back to life even when faced with certain death numerous times. As readers, we are asked to believe that scores of highly trained Special Forces Commandos of numerous countries using extremely high tech weapons can't seem to hit anyone or do any significant damage, even when they have superior odds, superior firepower, and superior training on their side. The author seems adept at ( almost ) killing people off using unescapable situations only to have them reappear later after having escaped certain death using comic book type rationale. After a few ( of many )of these silly situations it was a chore to finish this book. It is not believeable, it is not rational, it is not reasonable, it's explanations border on magic. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly stuff.","review":"If this is a techno-thriller, I missed the both the techno and thriller parts. I tried to think of a word to describe the book and couldn't get past 'silly'. I tried to do better but the word is too apt and nothing else could do the book justice. If having magnets clinging to aluminum isn't silly to you, you might enjoy this book. But, that's only one example in hundreds instances of 'silly' in this book. If you make it to the halfway point you may feel that you have too much invested to just quit. Sorry, the investment required to finish it increases geometrically. And... there's no payoff. Like the 2000 bubble, you're just ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out writing a shopping list","review":"Matthew Reily set out to blow readers away with this book, all he managed to do was turn readers away. This once decent authours latest work is terrible, his shopping list would be more interesting to read. Over the top situations that defy everything from physics to plain reality gives offence to the average reader. When i read i like realism and facts, it makes for a believable story, i like something different and un-original its refreshing, i like character building to make it easier to relate to and understand the under currents of the story and the characters in it, but most of all i like a good plot or twist..this book failed to deliever any of the above.Simply Terrible i hope he doesn't give up his day job and if he does manage to write a hollywood script god help us all, its about time us sinners had another street fighter movie on our hands to punish us.Rubbish"},{"rating":"2","title":"teen titans","review":"The product came just in time for Christmas.

The first two books are magnificent enough to make me buy the third, and I wasn't dissapointed.There's two stories here. The first one is completely centered on Beast Boy. He goes in search of fame to Hollywood, but he only finds disgrace in every corner. There's a few special guests too. The story is very good, and the art is magnificent.For the second story we got the whole team now. Beast boy has been cured of Sakutia (the desease that allows him to change) but at a terrible cost. Fun writting and again the art was magnificent.This might not be the most amazing Teen Titans book, but it certainly is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Generic TITANS Adventures....","review":"Geoff Johns' revival of TEEN TITANS has been less than thrilling so far, and the latest volume, BEAST BOYS & GIRLS, is no exception. The low-priced volume reprints seven issues: A four-issue BEAST BOY mini-series from 2000, and issues 13-15 of TEEN TITANS, which also focus on BEAST BOY. Garfield Logan has always been one of the least-interesting members of the team, so I wasn't expecting much out of this book, but I was still disappointed. Johns has been turning out some really mediocre work on TITANS, and the BEAST BOY mini-series, co-written by Ben Raab, isn't any better. TITANS completeists will want to add BEAST BOYS & GIRLS to their collection....Everyone else can safely pass and move on to Volume 4.

If you're going to stage an opera in an auto dealership, Electra would be the best choice since Buick made one. But I should have been more cautious when I saw it was De Nederlandse Opera who undoubtedly have a performance in the works of Aida with the Grand March set in the checkout line at Walmart or Billy Budd set in Captain Verve's bathtub.

I refer the reader to an outstanding book review by well-known physicist, author and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman. His review of ABDUCTED is posted on his website (which isn't hard to find.) He blows a whole so big in Dr. Clancy's conclusion that it leaves her book in shreds. Clancy's book is another example of a scientist who doesn't explain the Big Picture. Unfortunately, regarding aliens/EBEs, scientists are among the last to know what's going on. To balance Dr. Clancy's book, you are encouraged to read \\"ABDUCTION: HUMAN ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS\\" by John E. Mack, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School's Cambridge Hospital.

I can't imagine what he was thinking when he wrote this. Maybe I didn't pick up on his moralistic anti-capitalism before.To some extent, I guess it's simply an example of old-time, small town America stories of romance where people are too morally upright in public.However, the main character is the local teacher who questions his vocation. He's decided book learning isn't making the children happy.Knowing arithmetic simply enables them to cheat and rob, like the local wealthy farmer in the story. Is he happy however? It didn't stop his daughter from being forced by pregnancy to marry her boyfriend.Everything is told in an elliptical, sad and moody way. The overall message seems to be that people should just be happy farmers who can't add and subtract, instead of giving in to the modern world that's going downhill.In the end the teacher is fired, and who can blame the parents for being unhappy with him?

We been using teeth cleaning biscuits but they didn't seem to be enough to keep her teeth really clean.I purchased this item because I liked the fact that the brush had two sizes of bristles since Bella's teeth are so small. I followed the directions on the package and put some on my finger first. She hesitated initially but after she tasted it she really liked it.

She even followed me when I was finished, because she wanted more brushing!I first let her taste it and then used the small side of the long toothbrush and was able to scrub on all on her teeth - even the ones in the far back. She was okay with it and thought it was fun, because she tried to bite at it to play.I chose this doggie toothpaste because of the enzymes, non-foaming, toothbrush choices, and beef flavor. I am happy with my choice as it takes the stress out of brushing my 8 year-old baby's teeth. She likes it and it is something that needs to be done. The best part is her fresh doggy breath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"about what you'd expect","review":"LOVE this toothbrush.

And she clearly loves the toothpaste--her \\"reward\\" for tolerating having her teeth brushed is that she gets to lick the rest of the toothpaste off the brush!I found the finger brush to be totally un-useful because it's nearly impossible to clean--you can't just rinse it out like the toothbrush, you really have to wipe it down and scrub it.

I brought my 7-year old dog to the vet about six months ago for a check-up and the vet told me that I should definitely look into getting my dog's teeth professionally cleaned because they had a lot of brown tartar buildup. Professionally teeth cleaning can runs upwards of $150 near me and that is something that I would willingly pay for if necessary, but I wanted to check out my other options first. I was compelled by the high ratings of the Petrodex toothpaste/toothbrush kit and I decided to give it a go. After receiving the kit in the mail I began brushing my dog's teeth 2 to 3 times a week and in no time at all her teeth started to really look fantastic. And to top it off, my dog can be very finicky about things she eats and she didn't seem to mind the paste at all! Six months later she still has a little yellow staining on her teeth near the gum line but they are looking ten times better than they did and my vet gave her teeth a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fail","review":"Well my dog hates me now.

It is a flexible plastic material, with a hard but soft enough bristle. It's immensely useful because you can just insert your finger in your dog's mouth and start brushing back and forth. The finger brush may not be so good for hard to reach places (depends on your dog). But for the front teeth and some of the teeth closer to the front, it is easy to brush.The brush with the handle is definitely more thorough, with long enough bristles. It's no special design, really. It has a soft bristle and an angled handle, which makes the angle of brushing your dog's teeth more comfortable.Overall, our dog has fresher breath and the brushes included are very useful.

Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee.

In addition as another reader commented the author, takes a very racist, anti white tone throught the entirebook, which is strange becuase I read somewhere that is wife is Caucassian. Oakland is a facinating city to visit, one of the most diverse in the world.I wish he would have done a better job. It's sad that Reed is so out of touch with the times.

Last who's director of that film by Blockbuster Video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameless attempt to increase video rentals","review":"After browsing through this book a full ten minutes, I was unable to find a single video with a rating lower than two stars. Virtually every movie is given a hearty recommendation, even those which were universally panned by critics and viewers alike. Unless you intend to purchase this guide solely for the plot synopses or actor/director cross-references, it is virtually useless. My advice: stick with the IMDB, or, if you must have a book, get one by Ebert or Maltin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short summaries to help pick a movie!","review":"This is a great guide to movies, one of the best you can get.

Every movie-lover should have a copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blockbuster never met a video they didn't like.","review":"This is more of a sales catalog of Blockbuster videos than a critical review to find those movies which are gems or worth two hours of your time.

It is a book about programming audio APIs, not programming audio algorithms. The section on Advanced 3D Techniques is mostly a description of how to use EAX. There is little here that could not be gleaned from the documentation and examples that come with the APIs in question.This has only the barest whisper of theory. Just enough for someone to understand what a certain function in the provided APIs might mean. DSP, FFT and DCT are not even mentioned in the index! In all, this book is pretty much useful only to someone who doesn't want to deal with the included SDK documentation with DirectX Audio. Anyone working upon a different platform, or wishing to go beyond the basics of merely playing back samples should look elsewhere. Do you really need a 640 page long book just to figure out how to play back a sample?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bashmet's super-sensitive phrasing could use a little brashness","review":"Yuri Bashmet is a phenomenal musician and a superstar in his native Russia, despite the fact that his chosen instrument is the mild, rather doleful viola. Brahms's two late clarinet sonatas, transcribed for viola, are a staple of the repertoire. Among the versions I've heard, Bashmet's stands out for the beatuy of his tone--he never sounds creaky or buzzy--and the ultra-sensitive phrasing he applies everywhere.My reservation is that hearing sensitive viola playing gets a bit tiresome in this music, which is already among Brahms's most introverted, if not outright melancholy. I wish Bashmet had punched it up a bit. He needed an equal partner at the piano rather than the reticent, though highly musical Mikhail Muntian. Every mezzo and alto of repute has recorded Brahms's two songs with viola Op. 91, in luscious lullabye mode, and here the version with Bashmet and Larissa Diadkova is as beautiful as any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Being born in the 50's and enjoyin the classic Universal Horror Movies in the 60's was a great time for Horror Movies.The Frankenstien DVD collection is excellent to say the least, especially seeing \\"House of Frankentstien\\" again, along with my other favorite, \\"Son of Frankenstien\\". It's real nice to see 5 Classic Horror Films on one DVD set. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who remembers the horror movies of the 50's and 60's, and to those who don't? go out and buy this DVD. It puts the new \\"slice 'em/dice 'em\\" movies to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for the Legacy Collection DVDs","review":"The films themselves are phenomenal, timeless, and light years beyond the pseudo-horror flicks of today, especially Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and House of Frankenstein.However I strongly advise you NOT to buy the Legacy Collection DVDs. I ordered them and had to return them THREE TIMES because they arrived loose in the package and were scratched up. Very frustrating and disappointing. Apparently others have had the same problem with this collection. The manufacturer is obviously not reliable.So I'm just going to buy all the Frankenstein movies separately, and I would suggest that you do so as well. (Of course you could buy this collection and it may very well arrive in perfect condition).But after arriving damaged three times in a row I will throw in the towel and just buy them separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Case Flawed, DISC ARRIVED DAMAGED","review":"I have been buying from amazon for over 2 years and never got damaged goods until I bought this set. The poorly designed DVD case is made of bi-fold cardboard with a plastic interior. The plastic button which holds the DVD in the center is poorly designed and does not hold the disc in place. Disc number 2 arrived severely scratched on both sides. Since the disc contains movies on both sides, it means 3 movies are damaged on the disc. I have seen the reviews for this and other DVDs in the Universal Monsters legacy series and it seems to be a recurring problem . I am very dissapointed because I love the Frankenstein movies, but now I have to plead amazon for a refund and return this. Hey Universal, whats the deal witn the highly decorated crappy -cardboard keepcases ????"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I just sent back my Frankenstein dvds. Received in the mail and one disc loose. All scratched up. Ten minutes into the movie - BAM it freezes. Disc was rattling all over when I received it and disc was badly scratched.

Out of nostalgia sake I picked up this Frankenstein set and was quite pleased. I had forgotten how good Frankenstein was and in particular, how great Bride of Frankenstein was. Those two films alone, make this set a good purchase. In my opinion, the other 3 films are garbage and barely worth a viewing. All of the films and most of the supplemental material on this version have been previously released. If you already own Frankenstein and Bride, I can't see this set being worth your upgrade just to get the other 3, barely passable films. But if you do not own those two, this set makes for a good collection.The Van Helsing movie looks especially bad to me, and seems like a poor attempt to capitalize on the past legacy of these characters. Stick to the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Those Orginal Classic Scary Movies","review":"If you can relate, I've watched all of these movies and the orginal Frankenstein on the late, late, late show on TV with all those commericals. Its great to watch the orginal \\"Frankenstein\\" uncut and no commericals. Watching the sequals gives you a more appreation of how good the orginal \\"Frankenstein\\" was in its time.

I bought the Frankenstein Legacy Collection and the Bela Lugosi Collection and they both have flawed discs! I was going to return them until I learned how pervasive these problems are.

On the other hand, as others have complained before me, the reality of the packaging is that the disks break from their cheap clear plastic holding tabs, get scratched, and become unplayable. I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN? Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal. Nope on both counts.To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade. This is inexcusable hack packaging from a major studio's whose past work has been stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCRATCHED TO HELL- You have been warned","review":"I recieved numerous copies, all scratched to hell in shipping process, thanks to the cheap cardboard cases.

Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein hold up well, and are still very good movies. Son of Frankenstein began to get a little thin. Ghost of Frankenstein, Meh! House of Frankenstein, yawn. The set is worth having. Boris Karlof is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank. Universal","review":"The set is ok. THe main feature is on a single sided disc. I still think it would be better without the double sided disc. This set comes with a cheesy little piece of foam to protect the 2nd disc from being scratched. It would have pleased customers more if the 2nd disc was on two single sided discs packaged to reflect the price paid for what should be a good boxed set of old Universal movies. Same as Creature from Blk Lagoon, but better than the Dracula set of the same type I bought years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankensein-The Legacy Collection","review":"I received mine just like some of the others discribed... the tab was broken inside that held one of the DVDs in place. Hmm, wonder why all the trouble? Anyway, loved this classic. I grew up watching Frankenstein & the other classics at our halloween carnival. Don't expect the sound to be of the same quality as today's films, but it's all part of the experience. I would recommend this purchace to any Legacy film lover. Great addition to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Pleased - Frankenstein Legacy","review":"I was pleasantly surprised about the contents of this package. The video/audio transfers were very well done --- certainly the best clarity that I've experienced for these old classics. Additionally, I wasn't expecting the re-insertion of missing/censored scenes --- so was gratified to see those.Some titles had alternative AUDIO-tracks --- with behind-the-scenes commentary. A few of those were well-done and informative, but others were of questionable value.MINOR PROBLEM: A shipping problem rendered one of the platters unreadable. I used Amazon's return-procedure (a first time for me) and obtained a replacement in less that a week. That was superb service --- and very easy to use.All in all, this was a worthwhile purchase for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of The Legacy Collection","review":"Having owned all six of the Universal Studios Legacy Collection I can easily say that this is the best of them all. The quaity of the scripts and choice of actors in ALL films in this collection is what really sets it apart. Every movie has been wonderfully restored and the bonus features are plenty. If you either want to collect all of the Monster series, or just not sure which to buy, this is where to start! 5 stars all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Any fan of Frankenstein must have.","review":"My son collects these movies.

Brings back lots of warm family memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Five Frankenstien movies in one box. Frankenstien and Bride of are true classics. The others are pretty bad but still fun to watch in a campy sort of way. Karloff's acting is amazing. Even when the rest of the cast are being melodramatic. The camera work and art direction in Frankenstien and Bride is great. Extras are pretty good. My only wish is that they included Frankenstien Meets the Wolfman, and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstien. Then the set would be complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the sound...?","review":"My problem with the Universal Monster DVD collections is that the sound is so poor. I know that these movies had sound (I think it was called Monomorphic) which tended to be very loud and very soft and would rise and drop in the movie soundtrack, but in all these movies, I guess the sound is not compatable with today's HD ditigal so you get movies that have a restored picture but the poor sound reception does not really work that well in your HD TV, and can ruin both the movie and your emjoyment of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic DVD","review":"Recieved fast, but had to return 3 times.

But returns were easy and didn't have to pay postage as manufacturer was responsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disputing the \\"superiority\\" of film 2","review":"I do not feel Bride of Frankenstein (on this dvd) is really a better film than Frankenstein (ditto). What's better about film 2? Nothing. It's actually way more improbable than film one (with more monsters in a contrived siutuation), as the original had a certain surprising believability to it. Also, where is Dr. Frankenstein's old cootish baron of a father in BOF? And it is really dumb that the monster in film 2 actually manages to survive the burning windmill climax of the first picture. THat fabulous film one sequence is put into pointlessness in BOF. Other problems abound in the newer film. The actress playing bride Elizabeth in film 2 is different and in no way calls to mind the lady playing her from film one. The original film was obviously meant to be totally self-contained, there was no room for a sequel like this. I prefer film one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The films themselves STINK","review":"Frankenstein is a lackluster, tedious and infantile film filled with ham actors who smoke, curse and fight each other in each scene, attempting to portray some sort of sophisticated 'drama'. Most of the characters are so inept they can't even shoot straight. The 'scenes' of the countryside were repeated over and over on some man made studio back lot. I was rooting for the monster all the way.I could go on, but basically, these films are an insult to intelligence and have been hyped up by teen pranksters who saw them at the theater in the 50's/60's and have been following every Frankenstein feature convention for the last 45 years.They try to drown out any sort of criticism. Avoid the Frankenstein - (The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of) (1931))."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book that sends chills.","review":"Some of the scenes in this book are simply fantastic.

The cases are probably not right for you if your expecting them to stop damage from falls, after having my case for a month, not a scracth on the ipod. The cases get scracthed pretty easily but not so you can't read the ipod and i would rather have it on the 3 cases than on my ipod. The three colors are also cool to have. Also, when visiting the ipod store recently, a case just like this cost $24.99, I don't know if they make theirs heavy duty but these cases have been wotking exceptionally well for me, I would recommend to anybody that needs a case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protects iPod from scratches, but not itself.","review":"I bought these cases, expecting a nice look, and something to protect my iPod from scratches.

I have known the author for several decades and could see his reverence for life projected into the work. As a perceptive and philosophical neurologist he has been always enthralled by the various forms that intelligence takes in our world and its relationship to the larger whole of the cosmos. On reading Mister Bluefin again I see it also as an allegory--the counter to \\"Moby Dick\\" in which the great white whale symbolizes the dark side of nature. Moby Dick is a projection of the hubris and destructive arrogance of Captain Ahab. Mister Bluefin, on the contrary, represents the beneficent forces of nature. He portends a natural order which is directed toward the propagation of universal love and caring--a goal which escapes us still. This book is a natural for an animated movie--I hope one of the producers takes a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not practical","review":"These towles were bought as a gift for me for my bridal shower.

I have read her other books, and I think \\"Living a Beautiful Life\\" is the best of the lot. I agree with the other reviewers that she seems pretentious, but perhaps she is targeting those who actually have the time and money to follow her suggestions and play in her league. At the same time, so many people are aspirational and want to read about the lifestyle they dream of having--even if odds are that they never will.I found \\"Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy\\" by Sara Ban Breathnach more inspiring and realistic. I bought it in 1995 and still have a look at it now and then.

Two homes, trips to Paris, beautiful clothing, yadda, yadda, yadda. I guess they are happy!!!! She needs to come down to earth and realize there are people out there who can not afford Porthault lines, or Roger Muhl paintings. I guess she wouldn't be caught dead sleeping on linens from that fabulous French store \\"JC Pen-NAY\\".

My experience with the SD-V391 will make me think twice on future purchases from Toshiba. I read a handful of reviews that addressed the quality issues that this unit was having and decided to take a chance. Shame on me for taking the chance. My out-of-box experience was that the DVD drive door would not open. This was accompanied by a gear grinding noise and the display eventually showing ERR. This is a fairly big manufacturing defect. If Toshiba believes that a 50% return rate (based on user reviews) is acceptable than I'm switching brands. A responsible company would take a proactive approach and remove defective product from the shelf.

I am on my second unit and the spring loaded charging connector would not stay on either one. The design has to be the poorest I have ever seen. The plastic tabs that hold it on are small and flexible so the spring loaded contact pins push the connector right off the phone. The problem is even worse in a warm auto.The buttons are difficult to find when the headset is on your ear and because of the design of the ear clip it is difficult to slide on the ear. When you finally get it on your ear the earbud is uncomfortable and the feeling is that the headset will fall off your ear any second.This could be a good product from an electronics standpoint but the mechanical design is horrible. The design engineers really should have tried the product before marketing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design and overpriced","review":"I have owned a jawbone for about a year. The earloops are uncomfortable and break with regularity. Replacement earloops cost about $20 and I have gone through 4 in less that the year I have had the headset.

It does not adjust for volume in noisy environments well at all, although its supposed to do that.maybe mine is simply defective, but i doubt it. it looks good though.NOTE: I got a second unit.

I struggled with the fit, trying every supplied ear loop and ear bud, but it still can fly off when I turn my head. It also has a mind of its own, transferring calls back to my phone 1-2 calls/day. And when that happens, you cannot transfer the call back to the Jawbone without turning it off, and back on again.I am returning my Jawbone, and will try something else. But when Jawbone's designers get innovative, I will probably try it again, as the sound quality is top-notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"For all the ear buds and \\"hooks\\" provided, does not fit well in ear.

I ignored the negative comments about the earpiece to my regret. I thought I had figured out how to manage placing the headset around my ear without going through too much wrangling. To my dismay, after only several months of use, I broke the earloop off at the point of entry to the headset rendering the headset without any way to secure it to my ear.

I am hoping Aliph will replace mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good and bad","review":"I thought it was kinda big...My ears are weird so it just did not fit on or in my ear.

That's all I want from this type of unit. I've tried the motorola H700, was the best rated at the time. No comparison. I had to stop using it for some of the people I'd talked with.

Unless the piece is continually touching the cheekbone, the sound/voice cuts in and out.As well, there is no size adjustments. Aparently nobody told the people at jawbone that all ears are not made the same size. Becase they don't fit every ear. In my case, it's too big. the part that goes around my ear is not adjustable, and the part that goes in does not have adapters to adjust for smaller ear canals. As a result, any time i turn my head too quickly, or lean my head to one side, the jawbone falls out of my ear, and often, off my head completely.So, for $100+....not a great buy. There's plenty of $20-50 ear pieces that will do just as good, not cut out, and can adjust to your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product...no regrets!","review":"The Jawbone performs as advertised. Had trouble with the fit at first but, following the advice of previous reviews, I purchased the Jabra EarGels at Radioshack and was off and running. I don't even need the earloop!! It stays firmly locked into either ear. I use this headset not only when I'm driving but at work in a noisy enviroment.....heavy equipment in the background. Wind is still a problem but to my knowledge nothing out there filters the wind any better. The Jawbone does the job for me.....I'm very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this bluetooth. I have incredibly small ears and I could never find a bluetooth that would fit me. I have tried almost every brand they make. When this one arrived with two sizes of \\"hooks\\" and different ear bud sizes I was estatic. It fits great on my tiny ear and works very well. My only complaint is the noise shield doesn't seem to work very well cause the person you are talking to can still hear the wind in your phone when you are driving or in windy conditions. Other then that it is perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR","review":"I bought the Jawbone thinking this is going to be so cool, cool it wasn't. First, the ear pieces that came with it don't help at all and appears to me they are almost the same. They fell off my ear so many times. It looks cool to wear I will say that much and the noise shield does work with the radio on NOT with wind though. Also, the stactic is bad don't walk anywhere without your cell cause the jawbone will lose the contact or make so much static you will want to throw it away, just return as I did. I did give it a one star only because I like the looks of it. I do wonder if the new one out is any better, but not worth my time to buy and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAW BONE BETTER THAN ANYOTHER","review":"WOW, this jaw bone is great no noise when talking at all the only thing I would change is the volume in the ear peace not loud enough when driving my 18 wheeler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it were better","review":"I had high hopes for the Jawbone. I love the aesthetics and I completely bought into the noise reduction technology claims. While it is an improvement in terms of hearing conversations and having folks here me (while walking on busy Manhattan streets), it is extremely uncomfortable. I've tried all of the different ear piece configurations and wearing this device for more than 15 minutes is out of the question.

First of all its hard and un-intuitive to place on the ear, it's hard to understand the use of the 4 alternative earclips, and to change them requires so much force you wonder if you are about to break the device. Same for the non-standard connector for the USB-based charger (seems to be an excellent candidate for the ongoing competition \\"Who-can-make-non-standard-USB-connector-no.-100\\"), once put on it is so hard to pull off again after charging that you are wondering what breaks next.It random connects/disconnects with the iPhone, but I haven't been able yet to determine if this is due to the Jawbone or to the iPhone's poor BlueTooth implementation - or a combination.When in place and functioning it functions fine though!I can't recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound and Noise Cancellation - Fragile Earpiece","review":"All in all I am very happy with the unit. I've tried various bluetooth headsets in the past and the voice and sound quality has been too poor to really make them worthwhile. Now, the state of California has passed legislation requiring the use of handsfree devices, so we're all stuck using them. I'm happy that the Jawbone is out there to meet this need!That being said, the earpieces are fragile. Mine snapped off without any negligence on my part. This required getting the broken piece out of the electronic unit (with a thumbtack and paper clip). However, I called Jawbone up and they were more than happy to send me a replacement earpiece - for free. No questions asked. This was pretty amazing service. On top of that, a four pack of the ear pieces only costs $9.99, so all in all it's not too bad if this happens again.I definitely recommend this headset for its unique and far superior sound and voice quality, despite the ear piece problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fit, No use","review":"Hi:I tried the Jawbone after reading a number of reviews.I can not stress how important the fit to your ear and head is for this to function properly.I could not make this fit. When it came loose, which was often, those I called had great trouble hearing me. With the A/C on high in the car, the wind noise added to the problems unless I covered the item.Its not for me, but may be what you are looking for if you can make it fit.I sent it back and purchased the Motorola 710, which does the job.Dave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if....","review":"You are left eared. The 90 degree turn to fit the ear bud turns the wrogn way so it pops off too easily.

A thoughtful book about dialogues and reaching out to better understand who we share this world with, The Man Who Talks To Whales is a singularly fascinating read especially recommended for all who have tried to see and understand the world from an animal's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little dead girlie..","review":"I really love Lenore. How can't you? She's adorable and witty.... everything a little girl should be, minus the dead part. Hey don't be like the other hottopic kids and just wear the merchanidise, read the damn comic... its actually quite entertaining :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"A collection of the first Lenore comics and they are great. Years and years ago I was browsing a little comic book shop and came across this one, at the time I had no idea what it was. I read the whole comic book in the store and LOVED it! I bought it and have been in love with the lenore series since. I definately suggest this book...IF you have a bit of a twisted sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark humor, nice art!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Roman Dirge's \\"Lenore : Noogies\\", a nicely imagined and well drawn journey into the world of a cute little dead girl. Although this is humor, it certainly isn't what I would call hilarious...more \\"interesting\\" funny than \\"laugh-out-loud\\" funny. Dirge does a great job of keeping my interest; lots of nice one-page gags; good use of sarcasm, macabre humor, etc. I would recommend this book to anyone with any edgier sense of humor. My final thought: If only Lenore would be rendered in a PLUSH form one day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenore - Cute Little Dead Girl","review":"The first strip I've ever read of Lenore was called \\"The Raven,\\" it was in Lenore Issure #2. I read it while I was in a local comic book store. I knew I was falling in love. The next one I read was called \\"Little Bunny foo foo.\\" Both are in this collection. That's when I had enough! I bought the comic book. I believe that was 2 weeks ago. :) Since then I've bought both books (Lenore - noogies and Lenore - Wedgies!) and love them both!Roman Dirge's Lenore is very funny. Lenore is adorable. U never know what's coming, U just know it'll be funny. It's so funny, one time I Laughed so loud that everyone on the bus turned to look at me! :)~Mari"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining, if not Slightly Off, Start","review":"Most people interested in this compilation will be familiar with the Lenore series (at least a little) and will not be disappointed. The art in the early issues is of lower quality than the newer art, and some designs actually change in the four issues collected here, but I understand that can't be helped and the comedy stays strong throughout.Expect a fun cast of one-time (or more-time) characters, some of which have their own short strips, and in issue three, Ragamuffin is introduced, one of the few long-term characters in the Lenore series.Overall, this is Dirge at some of his best, and if you like Lenore, then you should get it, along with the other compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment.","review":"...Lenore is a cute little dead girl who has very macabre adventures quite frenquently. Other bizarre creature are documented too and Dirge litters his comics with fairy tales gone wicked. As for how lenore stands up to Johnny the Homicidal maniac, I'll tell you this: Lenore may not be as \\"philisophical\\" as JTHM, but at least you can read this book without getting a brain seizure from ridiculously cluttered art."},{"rating":"1","title":"D'oh!","review":"I got really excited when I saw that Slave Labor Graphics, the publishers of a personal favorite, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, put out a new book, so I decided to give it a shot. After reading this trade in a matter of thirty minutes, I felt as though I had just read absolutely nothing. The artwork is poor, the concepts are childish and simple, and the storyline is flimsy and...poor. Lenore is the type of crude Goth-nonsense that Johnny the Homicidal Maniac likes to make fun of. Do yourself a favor - if you want to read something wildy entertaining, stick with Johnny. If you want to kill some brain cells..., try out Lenore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for quantumgoths and mansonites alike.","review":"Oh, god. This book is painful. I picked it up after reading several good reviews here, but was sorely disappointed. This comic is meant for mature readers in the same sense that \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" was meant for mature viewers -- ie, wherein \\"mature\\" is defined as \\"possessing just enough intelligence to restrain themselves from lighting people on fire or putting a cat into a blender.\\"If you liked early JTHM (before it really had a plot line), or if you want to be really really spooky and show people your spooky spooky book of a spooky spooky spooky little girl doing SPOOKY SPOOKY SPOOKY SPOOKY things, you'll like this. If you liked JTHM more once it was more than \\"Blood, blood, death. Hee hee. Death,\\" don't waste your time on Lenore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ewwww Cute!","review":"A lot of gothic humour comics have been flooding the market recently, but Lenore is one of the best. Lenore is basically about a dead little girl who neither ages nor matures and is filled with oodles of innocent curiousity about the world around her. This often leads her to do gross things (she has had a long line of dead pet cats), and she is very amoral in her childlike innocence, but she is so damn cute you just can't help but forgive her for the sick things she does. Seeing her throw a tea party and invite all the nearby walking-dead or doing a happy little dance at a funeral will leave your mind conflicted over whether you should retch or sigh. And unlike most recent goth comics, this one doesn't take itself at all seriously. Not great art or literature (Gorey and Sala still reign supreme at dark humour comics), but a fun little diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cutest Little Dead Girl... One of the BEST!","review":"I had never heard of Roman Dirge or Lenore until my best friend brought it up in a phone converstaion one day, screaming out \\"POOK-POOK!\\"I thought it was bound to be an intresting read, and really dark. I mean a comic about a little dead girl...When she came to visit she brough her Lenore books for me to read. I couldn't put it down, laughing at the wonderfully dark and funny stories spun by Roman Dirge.If you're looking for something dark, yet something that will make you laugh Lenore is the best that there is. She is and always will be the cutiest little dead girl there is... by the way did I mention that \\"Fishies go pook, pook, pook\\"? If you're looking for more dark comics check out \\"Johnny The Homicidal Maniac\\" by Dirge's good friend Jhonen Vasquez."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate Roman dirge","review":"Roman Dirge made me buy this book, although in a purely metaphysical sense. I hate him for this. This was a complete waste of a perfectly good eleven dollars that could have been donated to poor starving puppies. God, it was even a waste of tree pulp and soy based ink. Don't beleive the other reviewers, especially the ones that say this is similar to Jhonan's masterul creations. If you like Squee, JTHM or Devi, you will be repulsed by this poorly drawn (and thoroughly un-entertaining) load of badly rhyming fairy tales and a dead girl with no plot or personality. Yes, it does bare some resemblance to J. Vasquez's comics, but the similarity is so sick it's a mockery of all thigs Jhonen labored over. Good drawings save bad plot. Good plot saves bad drawings. This book, therefore, is beyond redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. Dirge can't write or draw at all.","review":"Terrible. Dirge does nothing but rip off Jhonen Vasquez. I am offended by the poor quality of the art in this book, which I did not buy, but had the misfortune of reading while at a friends house. It was so bad, I had to read the whole thing. The only positive aspect of this collection of \\"comics\\" is an inclusion of a single page strip by Mister Vasquez himself. I love sick humor, but if you care at all about art, originality, or quality story telling, stay the hell away from anything Roman Dirge does. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad...","review":"After hearing terrible reviews for the original Knight Hunters show I wasn't expecting much from this anime. The cover art and story is what brought me in. The show isn't that bad. Sure i've seen better anime, but i've worse too. The story is kinda boring at times, but its an interesting idea. The voice acting is good, the animation is nice. All in all this was better then what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Music, Bad quality recording","review":"Hi I liked the artists music, but the problem is with the recording quality.

When these don't sell I'll buy them for a dollar off the discount rack at a retail store. Maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing duplication of 3 episodes","review":"Why Warner Bros. chose to link SPELLBOUND with SCHOOL DAYZ is a mystery, since all 3 episodes of SCHOOL DAYZ are on the BATMAN BEYOND MOVIE DVD. It would have made more sense to have linked SPELLBOUND with CRUSH, since that VHS volume has still yet to make its DVD debut, now that DISAPPEARING INQUE and TECH WARS have been paired up for DVD. Since most people who buy this will have probably purchased the BATMAN BEYOND MOVIE, they already own half of this DVD. While it's nice to get 6 episodes on the DVD (unlike the usual 3 or 4 of JLA or animated BATMAN), there are no extras. The only explanation as to why we are getting SCHOOL DAYZ on DVD yet again instead of CRUSH seems to be that Warner Bros. are unfamiliar with their own product."},{"rating":"1","title":"only half satisfied","review":"I think its wonderful that Warner Bros has decided to release on DVD School Dayz/Spellbound and Tech Wars/Disappearing Inque to each contain 6 episodes and priced with a reasonable price. However, I am extremely disapointed at the fact that the first 3 episodes of School Dayz/Spellbound HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED as the \\"bonus episodes\\" in the Batman Beyond Movie DVD. This is irritating the heck out of me. I was so looking forward to 6 wonderful episodes I do not yet own, only to get 3 new episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!","review":"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 episodes - a good deal for the price","review":"For the sake of clarification, the two \\"titles\\" on this DVD (School Daze and Spellbound) were previously released separately on video, and are combined together on one DVD. Each video contained 3 episodes of the original Batman Beyond show. As such, this DVD contains 6 episodes : SPELLBOUND / HOOKED UP / A TOUCH OF CURARE / GOLEM / THE WINNING EDGE / DEAD MAN'S HAND.I think this DVD is aimed at two audiences - as a low priced DVD for the kids, as well as for adults who enjoyed the show. I personally would prefer a box set containing every episode, but how many parents would buy that for their kids? Putting the episodes out this way gets both audiences to buy the DVD.This disc contains no extras, but there is a \\"play all\\" feature.Picture looks great, but no subtitles, and only one audio choice. Still, I give it 4 stars as I feel 6 episodes for the low price is fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great Batman stories","review":"It contains great episodes of the newest Batman and love the characters and am glad I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for the series, 1 star for this DVD","review":"Let me start out by saying I love the series Batman Beyond.

The lyrics are in Papiamentu, the language of the ABC islands. It's a pleasure for listening.

I finally decided to get one for my own family. It is a simple game but tons of fun. The felt piece is plenty big and easy to store. There is plenty of room for the chips, you just have to be neat with them so they don't get mixed in with the other slots. The cards are flimsy and the chips are kinda cheesy. Also there aren't enough chips to play very long. We ended up buying a separate chip set and using our own cards. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a simple yet super fun family game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I hoped!","review":"We have an older version of this game that we play all the time. Both my kids asked to have their own this Christmas (now that they live on their own), and I thought, \\"Sure. No problem.\\" Well...this game was nowhere to be found in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon and it's sellers! This is a great game and this particular game set is just as I'd hoped. The only flaw, and it's just a minor flaw, is that it doesn't come with as many chips as I would have liked. But we had plenty of extra poker chips that we packed into the games for the kids and now they're all set to play the game with tons of their friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I got this game for my husband for Christmas since we played it at Thanksgiving at my sister's for the first time. We stayed up late, playing for hours. When I took it to the Christmas gathering, after teaching everyone to play, the game itself was in use almost constantly. When I was leaving, my Mother in Law said, \\"leave the game here\\". They played into the wee hours of the morning. It really is fun, and though it seems complicated the first time you play, after one or two rounds you'll see that it's very simple. My only suggestion is that you get some extra chips. We found that we needed alot more chips than the game includes. Also I think we will eventually need to replace the deck of cards just from use, but it's a standard deck so that's no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game!","review":"This is my wife's favorite game.

If you are interested in buying a good selection of Pound's Cantos in order to see how 'they look alike', I cannot advise you eihter another better selection than this. But remember, arriving at one Malatesta's Canto without knowing the history and development of the Banca del Paschi, or to arrive to the 'ed ascoltando al leggier mormorio' (Canto LXXXI) without any furhter refernce is like seeing 5 minutes of a very good 2 hour movie.

They were the quintessential frat party kegger band, and if you're my age it'll certainly take you back. Ah, yes, Louie, Louie, a veritable masterpiece of pre-flower-power dreck. Wonderful! I'd suggest just downloading the MP3 of Louie Louie instead of buying this double CD. After a few repetitive tracks, the camp value starts to fade. A little bit of it is fun, but it rather quickly starts to get on one's nerves.

I wanted to know what happened next. But on reading the rest, the family is completely dysfunctional.I'm sorry, maybe it's just me. But I felt the book insults Witchcraft, Christianity, and women in general. The Witches seem to have little power- they can't protect themselves from the extremists past or present; the Christians are comic book; and the women all allow themselves to be victimized by various people, including family, without seeming to have even basic self protection skills (much less magic).

Not the scary, evil stuff that you might have been led to believe.All in all this is a bold step on Poke's part, to just let a camera crew film an actual working without special effects or editing and just let the viewer decide for themself what to make of it. So, if you have ever had a desire to see the inside of a Magick temple or learn more about what Magick is all about, then this tape is a great place to start.For those of you out there that are already conversant with these things, then seeing a Master in action is also well worth the price of admission!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and full of useless info","review":"Do you buy computer books by the pound?

The scope of \\"Sometimes a Great Notion\\" is truly ambitious, but as the reader follows Kesey's unfocused but always necessary travels, they may find themselves as much of the landscape as the grand forests the characters inhabit. If one gives this book a chance, they will be in for a memorable experience. Highest recommedation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever a Great Story!","review":"I just got through rereading this novel after a span of about 40 years. Enough has been said about it in these posts - it IS a great story, & I see now how much it influenced my perspectives over the years. However, I give it 4 stars because I believe it needs some serious editing, particularly the multiple stream of thought & action sections. Some of these are just too long & boring, & some are too confusing as they are written. Some contemporary authors (I'm thinking António Lobo Antunes & Jose Saramago right off) pull this off a whole lot better. Nonetheless, I think this is Kesey's best & out to be offered in high school & college reading lists.

The ending was also very confusing. I still don't get what Lee and Hank realize as the \\"secret of life.\\" Why does Indian Jenny throw sand and shells on her pillow case? Why did she take off her clothes in the last sentense? The jump between time frames made the book very confusing. Half of the time, I am not sure who is thinking what and who was talking what.

The reader has to work really hard to keep up with who's narrating, with the focus sometimes changing mid-paragraph, or even mid-sentence. The lucid sections were vivid and fabulous, but sadly were few and far between.

Following the point of view is a challenge, to say the least. I couldn't keep track of who was thinking, talking or where we were in the time frame of the story. I am not a reader who likes fluffy kinds of stories, but this one was too much. So disorganized and barely lucid. I also found that after 100 pages, there wasn't one character in the book that I liked, or cared about--that is, if I could figure out who was who. I gave up at page 100. Maybe the idea for the story was a great notion, but I couldn't follow it. I am amazed at all of the people who found this book so great--being that is it so extremely difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I love this book and think it is the great American masterpiece of our time.What a bold piece of writing for anyone to attempt- and he pulls it off. Kesey seamlessly narrates from one character's perspective to another's. I first read this book almost 20 years ago and had a hard time with the first 50 pages or so- then couldn't put it down. I would advise anyone who has a hard time with the different narratives to persevere- it is well worth the effort.

It's one of the most brilliantly and beautifully crafted works I've ever encountered, and it keeps getting better with each reading. But what happened to Molly the dog"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic","review":"This work is vastly different from \\"One Flew Over\\" but only in positive ways. It is complex and intricate, powerful and emotive. Kesey's simultaneous usage of multiple voices is awkward initially but smoothes over time. The best way to approach \\"Sometimes\\" is to read it once and then immediately begin anew and read it again. On the second time through all the voice interruptions will make sense and your comphrehension of the novel will be therefore more complete. I highly recommend this work to any serious fan of American literature and though it is a somewhat difficult read it is ultimately very fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich in language, characters and message","review":"I first read this around 1964 as a young man in Scotland...it has lived with me ever since. After recently visiting for the first time the beautiful Oregon coastal and river areas described by Kesey, I had to buy the book again. What a buy! I had forgotten (or never fully appreciated) the beauty of the language, the depth of the characters and the strength of the narrative. To revisit the book after these long (and hopefully maturing) years, with the benefit of a better understanding of life and America and the Oregon landscape has been a rich journey. This book will take a permanent spot on my bookshelf and will be high on my \\"must read\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH OUT!","review":"Kesey gives your inner hero a big kick in the pants.

My all-time favorite book ... by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes a brilliant novel happens by...","review":"Ken Kesey set out to write his opus with this endeavor, and he can rest easy that it will go down as one of the greatest American novels ever. This masterpiece tells the tale of a prominent logging family's battle against a local union and the tragedy that comes with. The Stamper clan was not one to back down easy from a fight, whether externally or internally. The introduction of a half-brother to the clan sets events in motion. Hank Stamper understands the necessity of having another family member around but struggles to accept it. What follows may be one of the most brilliant stories ever put on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at all the stars!","review":"Thought I would jump on the bandwagen. A truly awesome book. It explores more themes than a 2nd year literature class. The writing is incredible. It shifts effortlessly from one character's perspective to the next without missing a beat.

One has to wonder how much all the electric kool-aid ruined Kesey when one sees how great his writing was back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"A true American classic. I first read this book 30 years ago while in college and have re-read it every decade or so. I am shocked at Kesey's descriptive power every time.

I have only two complaints that caused me to give 4 stars rather than 5. First, though the pictures are very good, not every cookie is shown -- and I like to have some idea of what they're supposed to look like, especially with unfamiliar recipes. And second, some of the cookies are supposed to be like sandwiches -- two cookies with a filling between -- and these are not nearly so easy to achieve as the book seems to imply. It's really hard (at least for me!) to get two cookies to be exactly the same size and shape! However, those two small things aside, the recipes are excellent, and the book also has a couple things many cookbooks don't, such as summaries of prep and cooking time at the bottom of each page, and storage instructions for every recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cookie Book EVER!!!!","review":"I have been baking from this book since the day I received it as a gift.

The ginger chewies are in constant demand. And as for the double chocolate chocolate chip cookies, I won't be sharing those anytime soon. This book is a must have for everyone!

This magazine used to flat out make my day (week?) as I eagerly devoured it. Now it is a flip and toss. Which is fine for those 10 bucks for 12 issues mags. This one, not so much. Plus the decline makes me sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn about Bust","review":"On one hand, I like this magazine. I appreciate the interviews for the most part (Amy Sedaris), and I love the retro articles with feminist takes, like the one they did on airline stewardesses. They seem pretty jazzed about women in music, so there are reviews every issue. The mag is littered with plenty of dense, blurbish \\"reporting\\" on varied subjects, keeping the reader interested and moving along. On the other hand...I don't feel like the mag \\"applies to\\" my age group; though it tries to keep everyone happy, their main demographic is obviously young women in their 20's. And I have read too many incorrect, flip, trying-to-be-oh-so-young-and-hip and just plain not-well-thought-out responses from Betty Dodson, their resident sexpert. Additionally, I think a magazine like this should avoid politics altogether. It's obviously liberal, considering the recent article on Obama's wife.I don't love it, I don't hate it. I'll just read it at the library or newsstand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't deliver quality or to your home!","review":"I had problems too when I switched my address. I think Bust has outsourced whoever handles their subscriptions. I had a problem with the Amy Sedaris issue a few months back and when I emailed someone bout it, I got a reply from someone at Bust who was very nice and I got the issue. When i changed my address after the Sandra Oh issue, I didn't get the next one (Men We Love) and I emailed them about it, and I got a reply from some outside company who at first said, \\"we'll send you another copy\\" and when i emailed them back three weeks later, I got a snarky response saying, \\"we don't replace issues anymore but we'll tack one on at the end of your subscription\\" so i had to go out and buy it. Sounds like b.s. to me, so be persistent, but don't be surprised if you don't get the issue mailed to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Delivery","review":"Well, I got home yesterday and whipped open my mailbox in anticipation of my new magazine! And what was that when I opened flipped the lid? It's larger than an envelope... roughly magazine size-ish... could it be?? No. It wasn't. It was just a flyer. Still no magazine. I guess I'm going to have to call the dreaded 800 number and just hope that they don't hang up on me as they did octobersky! Now I just need to find the number."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up on my subscription.","review":"I never got a single issue and I live in the USA. I finally started buying them from borders. I don't feel so badly about it now because BUST has gotten too slick for me anyway. I miss the old days of reader submissions. It felt like BUST was actually a magazine made by people like me about people like me. Now it's nothing but an endless parade of skinny, white hipsters, and people in their late 30s trying to cling on to some bizarre Jane magazine notion of young and it's not so fun. I had been loyal to bust for years but not I just read other magazines, which are cheaper. I sse no point in paying nearly five bucks for a magazine, when I can get nearly the identical contents in something like Teen Vogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"for independent, strong women with a hidden girly side","review":"I really enjoyed the magazine, it's an overall fun read w/o being full of fluff or overly political. It's not super femminist but for those of us who are independent, strong women but still like a little fashion and some cooking in our lives, it's a great read. I really enjoy the sometimes quirky and sometimes great recipies and DIY projects (like Chai tea from scratch and an earth friendly tote made from recycled grocery bags). The sexuality parts are definately w/o shame and will address anything, but if other mags can talk abt how to pleasure him than why can't Bust talk about how to pleasure yourself? The book, movie and music reviews are often quite good and smart. The fashion sections are a bit cliche indie/punk at times but enjoyable. Overall it doesn't focus too much on any one section but is definately worth paging through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of material, but very weak analysis","review":"This book contains several very readable chapters that review organizations, movements and projects that any student of social action and community advocacy should be aware of. Sadly, the book leaves out any effort smacking of controversy or campaigns dealing with identity (where some of the largest efforts today at social change come from). Worse still, it paints controversy in change efforts as backwards. Several of the projects covered are also elite-directed, and not very participatory. The real nail in the coffin, however, is that their analysis is at the level of simply reporting \\"what people told us.\\" E.g., the authors never ask if purported results are real, or should be truly attributed to the campaigns in question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have reeally enjoyed using this book. It has several patterns that I have made. Some of the patterns are hearts, trees, flowers, Christmas patterns, friendship wreath, and Irish Christmas. The small quilts can be used for all types of thing. A great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't call these quilts, necessarily...","review":"I've been looking for good patterns for doll and cradle quilts and was excited about this book after reading the reviews. Sadly, I was very disappointed. More accurately, the items in this book should be called fabric wall hangings, not quilts. They're all quite intricate, use lots of stencils and wouldn't be appropriate to put on a bed. I don't think there's one pattern that could be completed in a day and they're certainly not for beginners.This book will go on the shelf with a few others that didn't turn out to be what I hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campion-Police at the Funeral","review":"I love murder mysteries. I especialy like the ones set in the early 1900. And I like that the mystery is solved without a lot of blood and etc. I like that there isn't any profanity in the production.

I am of course old enough to remember these the first time 'round, but I had to explain to my teenaged niece that times were indeed different during the Kennedy years. The country is so mean-spirited regarding politics and the present White House occupant that it is hard for young people to visualize a time when it wasn't so. Plus, of course, the Kennedy tragedy ensures that these people will forever be frozen in time in their relative youth. Just seems amazing what we've been through in such a short time span.

And although the album's real worth is mediocre, at best, the remastered versions of tracks, \\"Hot Night In A Cold Town\\", \\"Ain't Even Done With The Night\\", \\"This Time\\" and \\"Wild Angel\\" gives you something to look forward to - providing you are somewhat of a fan of John Mellencamp.And the 4-star rating is primarily 2 for the entire album and an additional 2 for the bonus track.For the money it cannot be beat and for the fan it's a necessity to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"The quality stated is just what i got.

I love that one so much, that when my home coffee maker ceased to function, I replaced it with the 14-cup Coleman. This percolator makes delicious coffee. I will never go back to drip coffee again. This is a well made enamelware pot with a real glass top. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the stem is really flimsy aluminum. You really have to be careful washing it as it wouldn't take much to break. Otherwise, I have only good things to say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Tech Perfection!","review":"Being tired of \\"high tech\\" appliances breaking after just a few months, including a coffee pot (glass carafe that we couldn't find a replacement for) and electric percolator, we have made the choice to \\"low tech\\" it as much as possible. Not only does this percolator brew an excellent cuppa joe, it uses less than half the amount of coffee our old electric percolator used, and makes 2 extra cups at a time to boot. We do not use a paper filter...so what if there are a couple of grounds in the bottom of my cup at times? Mornings have been an adjustment as there's no timer to set on the pot, but the taste of the coffee is well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going to Pot","review":"This coffee pot is everything that it was advertised to be. I do have a smooth top stove and flat bottom pans work the best on it. This pot does not have a flat bottom but the center section of the pot does touch the heating surface of the stove, so it does \\"perk\\" the coffee okay. I like the way it looks, as I am going for the old west look in my home. The first time I made coffee in it I took it to it's limits and filled the coffee basket full and the water compartment full. It did boil over when I did this and got a little messy inside the pot. I now kick it back a little and it works fine.

Mine was only used once for coffee then for boiling water and doesn't even make it into the car these days.There were grounds in it (ok I can live with that) and it took FOREVER to boil. Frankly when we camp we have mountain biking/kayaking/hiking to do and can't wait around for this. Doesn't stand up well on a fast gas stove.As other reviewers have stated, the interior basket/stem is really flimsy, and although mine didn't have a chance to, my friend's one melted when the top fell in the campfire (it's not glass as some have said, it's hard plastic).The handle gets crazy hot, and the hinge holding the lid on is not firm either.It's probably great for RVing etc but it doesn't come camping with me anymore, things either work reliably or they get left in the garage. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted!","review":"Despite careful care-taking, it rusted around the rim.

This included an automatic coffee maker which drove the need for a replacement in our primary residence. We liked the concept of the Coleman 14-Cup Enamelware Coffee Percolator and ordered on line. It arrived with several paint chips missing, which we accepted as \\"product allure\\". However, after two uses the glass knob on the top cracked and broke, rendering the product useless. I'm hesitant to replace the knob for fear it will continue to break. Don't buy this product - it's no longer manufactured. Bad, bad decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Purchased this and used it about four times then the basket stem broke from the bottom base. I know from the start it was flimsy and cheaply made. What I didn't know, until today, is that if you go to Coleman's online store to order a replacement, they no longer carry the replacement baskets, stem/base in stock. So, I'm stuck with a coffee maker and no way to make coffee (other than cowboy coffee and that is not an option).For the four times used, the coffee was good. Now, I guess it will become a target for my next trip to the back yard range.Time to look for another manufacturer; Coleman has lost my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"glass-top coffee-pot lid","review":"glass top flimsey and breaks easily. replacement glass costly if available!!!!!!!would not recommend to anyone this product is very cheap and flimsey!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Percolator","review":"I bought this item for a friend for their camp.

The pot is sturdy but the basket and stem are flimsy. The stem seems to short for the pot and did not line up with the glass knob.

I was completely bummed once it got here. There are a few things that bother me. The first and biggest issue I have is the knob on the lid broke while I was making coffee the 2nd time I used it. I heard it snap but wasnt sure what happened till I went to take the lid off and the knob fell off - and there were small pieces of glass in the coffee. This obviously is an issue with this particular percolator as they sell replacement knobs on the coleman website. The 2nd issue is the basket and stem are very poorly made in my opinion. Mine was slightly bent upon arrival. It had nothing to do with the packaging as it was packaged well. If I was to purchase another I would find a different one for sure. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy junk","review":"Love the color of the coffee pot but it was flimsy and when we made coffee for the first time, the glass bulb burst.

Big mistake.The Good:The pot is heavy and of good quality construction. It should provide many years of service if properly maintained.The Bad:(1) The glass knob on the lid broke with the first brew.(2) The insert stem arived with a slight bend in it.(3) The insert components are of very poor quality and of weak construction.(4) The lid is not engineered to fit properly.The Ugly:I've not found a better subsitute as yet. After all, the reason I purchased it is to use it in the more harsh environment of a campsite. So no reason to return the unit. Instead I'm going to try to find a higher quality insert and glass knob.

Boring!","review":"I love the Harold books, but the translation to DVD did nothing for the story. Part of my issue with this DVD is that the colors and animation seem 'old', like Scholastic just grabbed an old worn out VHS and burned it onto DVD. Also, the charm of the books is imagining how one line-drawing could morph into the next drawing. In the DVD, the drawings seem just as real as Harold and it is not as fun. I was so bored after watching five minutes that I turned it off, and never even showed it to my niece, for whom I bought it. Maybe little kids would like it, but it was definitely not for me. I was disappointed because I like almost all the other Scholastic DVD's I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect readings after 2 uses.","review":"I used this thermometer to check mash temperatures for homebrewing, I needed a probe thermometer to reach different parts of a 15 keg. It matched the temperature readings of my other thermometer for 2 days, and then after that constantly read at 190 - even when out in a 70 degree F basement.

I will go back to the traditional thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"This thing sucks. Followed the instructions; choose temp setting, insert into meat, then turn on alert. It immediately begins the timer function and starts beeping. When the alert is turned to off, it shows the temperature max setting but never shows the actual temperature of the probe. So you have no idea what the probe temp is whether or not the alert is turned on. Very lame product. The timer is a useless function anyway - what difference does it make if the meat has been over temp for a minute? So what exactly are you supposed to do if the meat has been over temp for 35 seconds versus 55? The Poulder I used to have was very straightforward and you could actually see what the temperature was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked twice then flaked out.","review":"Garbage. If switch to move from F to C is far too touchy (it's fully set to F and keeping flickering back and forth between F and C). I used it maybe twice before it went bad. The last time it worked correctly I used it to cook fish (i.e. the oven was never anywhere near as hot as it's \\"safe zone\\" of 400o). Now I drop the probe in a glass of icewater and I get a reading of 95o (yes, F not C). No support on their web site, no reset button, no buying these guys products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed on first use","review":"This MIU brand probe thermometer failed on our very first use. We were attempting to cook a beef rib roast and when the probe was inserted in would randomly jump around as to what temperature it was reading. It would correctly read around 120 degrees for a few minutes, but then all of a sudden it would set off the target alarm and the displayed temperature would be jumping between 325, 450, HI, and so on. Very disappointing. Amazon is sending a replacement so hopefully that would work.This was a gift for a family member. I have almost the identical model but under the Pyrex label and it works wonderfully. My guess is that these are all manufactured by the same company and then have private labels placed on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen tool!","review":"I love this thermometer!

I don't roast without them! Temps are programmed in for different meats (beef, chicken, lamb, etc.) and you can adjust the way your meat is to come out (rare, med, well done, etc.) It beeps loudly when the meat is done, and also has a readout of the temperature. If you go over the \\"time up\\" period, it tells you for how long, as well. I have come to trust in it completely. It's the easiest way to roast.

I am only glad that I have discovered them while they still have a few rough edges. Emily_____? has the heart of a poet and a voice similar to Harriet Wheeler (The Sundays). The songwriting is unique and mature, with jangly guitars that can build into a monster overdrive. I don't want to compare them to another band because they have found their own voice. The CD is infectious, but too short---I guess it is priced accordingly. Why not 5 stars?

While he has all of the biases of his own upbringing in a welfare state, he has none of the biases of an American upbringing, and so his critique of American life is razor-sharp and unrelenting. His pictures contrast all aspects of life in the U.S., and are both artistically beautiful and emotionally moving. His personal politics are a central theme of the book, and the reader must not let any biases of his or her own interfere with its reading. Jacob Holdt's story is a colorful tale of people and places, of a journey, but above all it is an adventure. Think of it as a way to experience vagabonding without actually having to risk your own neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"An opinion Quoted from David A Vise","review":"Author of \\"The Bureau and the Mole\\" David A.

The one plus is that if you listen to this crazy crappy cd and then put in their last effort, Americano, you will appreciate Americano more and instead of that being a 2 star record it's a 3 star. Anyway I don't know what happened but this entire album seems contrived. Junebug sonds like a them to a kids tv show. This is the most disapointing albub of Roger's to date. If you asked me he was damn near perfect with every album through Sonoran Hope and Madness. He faultered a little with AMericano but this is the worst.

On anyone more traditionally sized, it would be a shapeless, flopping mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper than it looks","review":"I was diappointed with this dress when I got it. It looks much nicer in the picture than in person. I would've sent it back but its too much trouble to return it.Its basically a cheap, thin t-shirt with a nice satin ribbon tied around the waist."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"this dress is terrible. while the material feels soft and comfortable, the fit is aweful. my chest pulled the dress up so that the satin bow did not sit right at the front. it is an awkward length that hits below the knee. it just doesn't look flattering at all. would never wear this in public"},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable but low","review":"The dress fit great and I was happy to have it. I looked everywhere in my area for a simple brown dress and couldn't find anything that wasn't a weird material that showed every body blemish or was a wrap dress. The dress neckline is very low, but I planned on buying camis of different colors to wear under it. The ribbon \\"belt\\" is pretty but doesn't always stay with the elastic waistband. There was only one belt loop, so that kept it from holding the belt in place. Very comfortable, size matched well, and looked good on me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly profound!","review":"An insightful book of studies skating all over the mystical paths towards enlightenment.

However, since it does cover so many conventions, the explanation and examples and not as in depth as a serious bridge player would like to see. I gave this book 4 stars because I think that it is a good reference book that should be in your bridge book library because it serves as a starting point for developing a bidding system. Serious players will want to go into more depth regarding the conventions that they decide to employ and should refer to other, focused books for comprehensive explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another perfect \\"Look Up\\"","review":"After I had read and used the \\"25 Bridge Conventions You Should Know\\" I decided to get this one as well.

Too bad they don't just sell the knob","review":"When the fan knob control burned out in our 04 Buick Rendezvous it needed to be replaced. We found out quickly that there's no cheap solution for this and the fan knob can't be bought separately from the entire control head. While looking at used heads we found this new ACDelco one for the same price as the used ones, without a photo I was iffy on the purchase, but the model number matched the fit guide... so I got it. It looks and works great. The only difference is that the edge of each of the 3 knobs is finished with chrome, I'm not sure if they added that after '04 (since this fits multiple years) but it looks good and not out of place. I'll add a customer photo of it installed soon so you can see if it looks like what you need or not (of course what you won't see is the part that slides into the dash and the one connection point in the back corner)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disgrace!","review":"Being a Opera fanatic, tenor fanatic, Puccini fanatic, Verdi fanatic, etc. etc. , I find this production dreadful. Why DID the Met chose THIS??Jose Carreras is not as good as he is now. His voice is scratchy, and rather squeaky during the start.Nessun Dorma and Che Geldida Mania are my favorite Puccini arias. Jose Carreras gave the worst performance of that aria I have ever heard in my whole life. Let's just say, he is so mis - cast as Rodolfo.The noise in the backround is beyond what can be accepted. There is coughing, wheezing, etc. Not my type.If you are a La Boheme fan and a Carreras fan, keep looking for another. Mostly, a La Boheme casting Pavarotti or Placido is not a bad idea to own.So here I am shot down once again! Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUBLIME!","review":"Being a brand new opera afficionado I could never really understand why Jose Carreras is so loved by the opera public. But now I understand! He is so believable, his singing and acting is done with great emotion and tenderness. Theresa Stratas is excellent as usual, very dramatic and emotional. I just wish she wouldn't have looked so sick already in the first act. Scotto is a brilliant Musetta, a joy to watch.The production is unbelievably extravagant. I forgot at times I was watching a staged version rather than a film. Very well done.I have seen La Boheme before but it never moved me as deeply as this version. A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best La Boheme Production on Video!","review":"Zeffirelli has struck again with a wonderful version of La Boheme. Beautiful voices are sharply contrasted with the tragic storyline. Zeffirelli's magic rules costumes and sets, creating an unbelieveable experience. Lovers and non-lovers of opera can appreciate this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"La Boheme should be younger","review":"I agree that Zeffirelli's production and voices of leading roles are wonderful. However, I believe that La Boheme is the story about young women and men - who have no money but a lot of energy to find a small joy every day and enjoy their life. Unfotunately, this DVD tells a sad story only, and I was not able to find any youth and sense of humor, which should be prominetly existent in every great La Boheme."},{"rating":"2","title":"positive.I purchased the VHS","review":"Unfortunately the introduction by AMOZON cites G Puccini as one of the stars of this production ( which is of course true (in essence) but failure to mention MS Stratas is a major blow to us who use the discography of this fine companhy to do our shopping.In any case, the Zefferelli production at the MET is fine not only on the VHS but in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!","review":"This is a great La Boheme. However, the soprano that sings Mimi is a *not so good soprano* (if you will) Stratas, (the soprano that sings Mimi) shakes her tounge and jaw which means that she is using a poor vocal tequnie. (sorry, I cant spell!) That is the reason that I took off one star, cause of Stratas.But, on the other hand, Scotto's \\"Quadro men vo\\" is one of the cutest I have ever seen. And in this video, Carreras is a hottie!

Not aye said the little brown rooster.The girl is funny looking, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate rapture","review":"I have both of the Metropolitan Opera DVDs of la Boheme and consider this the finer production, Carreras and Stratas are not only vocally excellent they look the part. Renata Scotto is perfect as Musetta. In the other copy she plays Mimi and Pavarotti is Rodolfo. They are just too healthy to be dying of TB or look like a starving playwright. That copy I would rate as 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Castles and Fortresses","review":"I really thought this book would be in better condition.

Felt the style of the art was too dark. I was expecting to see more classic styled characters.

I have decided not to give it to the child. The book received good ratings from other customers. It just wasn't to my liking.The quality of the book itself was good. Very colorful and the paper quality was very good (no seeing the picture on the other side of the page)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excpetional","review":"The cartoonish production values served the cartoonish subject beautifully. There are no weak points in this superb production by Covent Garden. Bryn Terfel filled the role of Falstaff wonderfully, playing the loveable rascal to perfection and bringing out his humanity. No gratuitous schtick here. The supporting cast served their respective roles equally well.

He is able to go back to the bathroom ( with close supervision) and get up on his stool and go \\"potty\\" himself. Huggies training pants are so stiff, but the Pampers are a lot softer. He likes the stars and spiders on the diapers.

They are a great learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service","review":"The product was more than as described, coming in excellent condition. However, trying to contact the seller caused massive headaches. Three days at least to get back to me. Shipping was several days later than seller said would take the longest.

After using Magic Chiles you will never buy chili powder in a store again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only superficial","review":"Although I have not completed the book I've gotten to the first 7 chapters and I have not found it that enlightening. Most of the referenced shops are old and out of date. The depth of discussion is common sense at best. For example there is a chapter devoted to dust collection but no information on how to determine which size of collector is needed. Nothing on ducting size, determining static pressure loss, length of run, grounding techniques, etc. All very important in deciding how big a collector to buy and how to install. Yet the title implies it is a how to guide. Again very superficial on most topics covered. No guidance is supplied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help for beginng woodworkers looking for direction.","review":"I found this book very helpful for me in setting up my woodshop for the first time. It is well organized, easy to read, and I find that as my range of skills increase, I go back to it again and again looking for new ideas. It offers both in price and function, a wide variety of examples of workbenches, shop layouts, storage alternatives, and shop equipment. I found the many pictures throughout the book, enlightening, interesting, and instructive. If you are just getting started and don't have a good idea on where to begin, this book is a great choice and an excellent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't cut it","review":"This book tries to cover areas that are best left to magazine articles. I was looking for a book on the shop space itself, but this one pays a lot of attention to the tools in a workshop instead. Brands of tools, accessories, and machine-specific set-ups become quickly dated and are not useful to everyone picking up the book. Most woodworker's don't go out, buy all their equipment, clear out the basement, and then start on projects. Unfortunately, this is the assumption the author works under, and it hurts the book's usefulness. The pictures should add something to the text, but many of the pictures take up space (5 pics of one commercial vice?), advertise a specific item, or don't add value (we all know what flexible hose is). A lot of time is spent on the author's personal shop, which isn't particularly innovative or different. I can see lots of shop tours online. Nagyszalanczy's book is a far superior alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coverage of MR physics, however complicated maths.","review":"The selection of the chapters and the overall coverage of this book are excellent. It provides an outstanding and detailed description of MR physics and of how MR signals are generated and processed. However, not being an engineer or a physicist but a MD interested in MRI, I had some problems with the mathematical background required to understand the formulas used in this book. I feel that the book would be greatly improved if a more detailed explanation to the mathematics were given. At this point, I would recommend this book to graduate students or Ph.D.'s in physics, in biomedical or in electrical engineering, who want to understand in detail the principles of MR signal generation and processing. Because of the somewhat complicated mathematics, the book might be somewhat less destined, but still of interest, to radiologists and MRI physicians who, like me, want to enhance their understanding of MR physics and signal processing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise, but...","review":"I thought that this book had a rather cool premise. In it, a bunch of random letters from famous authors to aspiring authors were found and published. As could be imagined, the quality varies greatly. Some are pretty much useless, some are full of interesting advice. Some advice is overly general, some too specific (and applicable only to the letter writer). I wish that the editor had better culled the letters to remove some of the ones that meander, discuss stuff that's too personal to be interesting to a random reader, etc. But there's at least some good advice to be found here.I'd probably recommend skimming, not buying this book. (Unless you're really into one of the listed authors and desperately want to know what he/she said about writing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patak's not that good","review":"Not a fan of Patak's sauces.

Perhaps it will be tough for Answering The Call to compete with Morgan Freeman and his Penguin pals, but if I were voting for best documentary of the year, it would be the one produced by Angeli and Dubin.Answering the Call reminds us of what is beyond in the human experience. 40,000 people volunteered.

If you're into hardcore boot camp type stuff, you probably won't dig this. This is straightforward & simple to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good workout!","review":"I consider myself to be in good shape and I workout by either running 5 miles or DVD's such as Insanity/Bob Harper/Jillian Michael's 5-6 days a week.

I am definitely interested in trying more 10 min Solution DVD's to add to my rotation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout!","review":"I bought this tape because I wanted to add a little variety to my workout routine. To be honest, I was surprised by the intensity of the ten minute segments. I thought they'd be slightly easier, but the instructor jumps right in and gets down to business, which is great!

I workout probably 5 days a week. On a day I chose this DVD, I usually do three or four of the workouts..skipping the arms.

Now that's just insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly....","review":"The first time I did this workout I hated it. Her cuing seemed off to me and the \\"terminology\\" she used for moves was so weird (I'm a turbo jam/fire woman) but....I must say after trying it out again I LOVE IT. I gave it a chance and had a good time. I did three of the workouts and sweated my butt off I had to add a little of my own moves to keep my heart rate up but overall this is awesome. The abs portion is my favorite some pretty cool moves I haven't seen before. I definitely recommend this workout. You may not like it at first but give it a chance it's a keeper and a awesome sweat fest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice DVD..gloves, not so much","review":"I received this as a gift. I wanted weighted gloves and my dh thought these would be great since they came with a DVD. I must say, the DVD is fine. I had no problem following along, and I did find that it was a nice, quick workout. Sadly, the gloves are not that great. I suppose they are okay if you are only using them for 10 minutes at a time. However, I use them for 45 minute Turbo Kick classes as well. They became so stretched out after only a couple of classes, that now I can barely keep them on my hands. If you are like me, and really just looking for weighted gloves, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloves are cheap & damaged","review":"I do like the video, it is a great workout. However, I was very disappointed with the gloves. I should have just purchased authentic piloxing gloves. I would return them but with the money I spent on shipping it's not worth it. They are very cheap quality and are already falling apart after 2 uses. The threads are coming undone in several places, the velcro is peeling off, and the material is thin and cheap and probably toxic too since it was made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Instructions Given-Not for Kickboxing Newbies","review":"I bought this thinking it would be fun and easy to follow since it came from the 10-min solution products. However you go straight into a fast moving section and the instrutor gives you no instructions or explenations of the moves(she does do some explaining is a different segment)so I was left standing there going HUH? which when your trying to excercise is counterproductive. The only good thing about this is the gloves that I use with different workouts.If you don't have a kickboxing base or alot of time to just watch and flounder through until you can finally get it.

It's not accurate when it comes to reading your movements especially on the ball return and dodge ball segments. Sometimes your WII person is swinging their arms and you haven't even moved. The graphics are terrible. The people look deformed. Once again it takes longer to get set up to do the exercise than it takes to actually exercise. Slow movements and way too much down time. It is not really a 10 minute work out since you can only do one five minute and then a break while it reloads the next five minute segment. I'm still waiting for a good exercise program that is fun to do, gives you a good consistent work out and doesn't have a bunch of extra stuff that slows it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knock out Body Works!!!!","review":"Honestly I have done numerous home workouts and I never stick with them because I don't get results. This video is awesome. You feel the workouut. I sweat just as much as I do when I go for a run. The instructor Jessica Smith motivates you to keep going and her routines keep you moving. I do all the video segments to have about an hour of workout time and by the beginning of video two, I am sweating bullets. I recommend this video and Belly, Butt, and Thigh Busters with Jessica Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase ever made!","review":"Since we use well water in our pool it has always been a problem keeping the chlorine at a good level and keeping the algae out.

So, I guess the product is now \\"broken.\\" Yes, the thing comes with a 2 year warranty, but today is Saturday and Intek isn't open until Monday. Now we've got a green pool to look at (we're not swimming in it) and who knows if we'll even get a replacement or refund before the end of the pool season?? We'll find out monday when Intek is actually open. But, take a lesson from our experience and just buy chemicals in the beginning.

From day 1 it required kid gloves to function. We constantly had error messages. When it did work, the inner metal plates quickly became coated & crusty with salt/mineral deposits (which starts up the error messages again) and we had to take it apart and spray it off with a high pressure hose once a week. (The manual says you may need to do this once a month at most.) Big pain in the tush. So, our pool was green off and on all last summer, despite our best efforts.

We have spent so much money over the years for chemicals. I saw this Chlorinator and decided to try it. It is GREAT!!!!! We bought it in July and our water is crystal clear!!! We set it up and put in the 120 lbs. of salt and that was it. You can get a 30lb bag of salt for $6.00. We have not had to add any salt yet. So far no error codes either.

It would be good if the company included some other pool adapters without the customer's needing to search for a cure to the problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saltwater System","review":"We purchased this and just shy of a year it stopped working, they did replace it under warranty, but that process took 5 weeks. The replacement has now stopped working... 2 years 2 units... not a good track record I would not recommend this for long term use. It is an awesome product while it is working. My husband is a stickler for premaintenance and takes care of this unit exactly as the instructions state... but now, I have a pool full of salt water.. and have to decide what to do from here....Unhappy customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pool Water","review":"Not wanting to spend a lot of money on Chlorine products for my above ground pool, I researched salt water systems. I found the Intex model to be the lowest priced and easiest to operate system out there. I have been using it for 3 weeks now, in a 12,400 gallon 24' above ground pool and have detected ZERO algae growth. The water has stayed crystal clear, easy on the eyes and most importantly, no chemicals!!If you are using a chlorine system now but are thinking about switching. Don't hesitate.PS Salt should be available in 50 lb bags from most pool stores for less than $10.00 a bag. Don't get gouged on this item. Also, as a general rule of thumb, you'll need 50lb per 2000 gallons of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and thought provoking!","review":"This book is going on my bookshelf next to \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" and \\"Godbody\\" There is more to this book than I ever expected. Her kids books are fantastic and so is this one. I don't think I've ever read a book by her that I didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children's?","review":"I can't imagine why this book is classified as a work for children other than the large type and brief text. Each chapter tells of a person who wasn't quite ready to enter heaven (mostly adults) so they go to the Heavenly Village as a kind of halfway mark. While Rylant does use poetic language to create some poignant moments in this collection, the work does not move together as a whole. Further, the \\"rules\\" of the village are not consistent. For example, at one point, we are told that time moves according to Earth time, later, Rylant states that the people can jump ahead a week or two in a flash if they wish. This work might appeal more to adults who may appreciate the language and find comfort in the idea of a safe harbor in the afterlife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"More religious garbage used to brainwash children into believing there is an imaginary friend up in the sky and that we all go to a happy place when we die.

Probably \\"Pugilist at 59\\" is my favorite, but \\"Love and Fear\\" has enough dimensions that you're going to hear something different each time you listen--and you will want to listen.The one reason for the deduction of a star is because the CD doesn't seem to burn on iTunes. Since this is now how I keep track of my collection, I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible...","review":"I'm a huge Bernie Wrightson fan, but this has to be his worst work ever. I'm thinking of the Wrightson who illustrated Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, did Captain Sternn, and great horror work. This was just plain awful. The only explanation has to be that the story and dialogue are so bad, he simply wasn't inspired to do top quality work.Aside from that, the \\"rough banter\\" between the mercs was hackneyed and predictable, as was the excuses for them to wander from the group to be summarily slaughtered by aliens. \\"I gotta go kill that damn chatterin' monkey!\\" Yeah, brilliant.This was slapped together, as most of the Aliens/Predator crossovers have been. Since the success of the original Batman vs. Predator, DC and Darkhorse have been trying to capture lightening in a bottle again only to fail miserably over and over. I could write a better premise than this junk. Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and graphics pitting the Dark Knight against death itself...","review":"Very well written story that draws you in and keeps you asking for more.

We have several \\"standard\\" souffles that we make for these occasions and wanted to branch out and learn about others.Unfortunately when we tried several souffles from this book all of them failed. It almost appeared that the author never tested them herself. A friend (also an excellent cook) who borrowed the book from us also met the same fate.We were only able to get these recipes to work after several attempts but found in each case we had to significantly modify ingredients, proportions, and instructions so that in the end the recipe looked completely different from what was written in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-Christian, eastern bias?","review":"This book gives an overview of the more popular religions of the world but I think it's written from a skeptical point of view or possibly leaning toward eastern philosophy. This may be because they tried to stay neutral but it would have been better if they had believers from each religion write the section on that religion.This book did not fulfill my needs of giving an unbiased overview of various religions and I was unable to finish it as I felt it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tropical looking fan","review":"I bought this fan for my living room and it goes wonderful with my palm trees and tropical theme. The only thing is I was expecting a white and tan fan and there in no white at all on this fan. The picture looked like the fan base was white, but it is a creme color and the blades are more of a greenish creme color. If I had known this before I ordered it, I would have passed on it thinking it would not go well in my room. However the colors blend in well anyway and the fan is a good quality fan, so after my husband had it up I was very happy with it. The fan is so quiet and looks like it is easy to clean and that was a big plus. We need a fan in a bedroom and I am leaning on buying another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BE AN INDIAN GIVER","review":"For those of you sick of experts who take themselves and their subjects so seriously that they totally forget to keep their readers awake, this breathtakingly beautiful book is the antidote. I saw this book on a friend's coffee table and started reading it, loved it, bought my own copy, then bought copies for friends and might even start giving it to total strangers just so they can partake in the Barry Friedman Experience! I never thought a book on Indian blankets would be the funniest book I've read in years, but that's precisely the case. It'll also teach you everything you could ever want to know about Indian blankets if you can stop laughing long enough to concentrate.

That the author had managed to talk to all his contemporary\\" giants in the music world, like it was the most natural thing, was astounding and suspicious.And then... Wow! The pervasive leit-motiv of the entire book: divine inspiration! For everything and everyone...and claimed by all the interviewees. Like Beethoven, or Brahms or the rest would have ever claimed that his ideas came from God.... (something only Bush would do... ).Those great composers were rather modest and prosaic, and many a work by Puccini, for example, is mockery and cynicism at the idea of divine intervention ...(think of Gianni Schichi...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud.","review":"This patently fraudulent book was concocted by its author with a clear agenda. Its bogus-ness is clarified by the scholarly article by Jan Swafford \\"Did the Young Brahms Play Piano in Waterfront Bars?\\". Do not get taken in by its nonsense as it has no root in authenticity whatsoever.

When I first played it, I thought I may need to play it a few times to like it. Boy, was I wrong! I loved it for the first minute and played the 3 albums 3 times in a row. This is just some of the best music ever played by any guitar player. The musical ideas Zappa plays are just in a completely different division as any other guitar player. I am really glad he stup up his mouth, stopped making songs about eskimos, poodles and sofas and just composed live with his guitar. How I wish all of his albums were just instrumental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off remaster","review":"This CD has some great songs, and it also has some songs that just sound horrible. The bass drum sounds the same as the YAWYI CD, a notched low end EQ. That's about all they did. I mean, some songs on here have the most annoying guitar sound, with really annoying compressed drums. Yuk, it is mostly a sonic mess, aside from horsie and stucco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zappa for Zappa-haters!","review":"I do not like zappa at all but this is clearly fantastic. What I never found appealing was the excessive wordiness of his output. OK it is a matter of personal taste. But this is really very very good. Once all the vocals are gone, we simply have all the real virtuoso playing and no extras. Even I have to concede that the man was a genius and a fantastic artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Zappa's Guitar Work.","review":"What I like is the range of bizarre guitar sounds on the record and Frank's use of the guitar as a melodic instrument, like a jazz saxophone, instead of just a \\"rock out\\" guitar solo that is part of a regular song. The variety of guitar tones he gets are pretty amazing and fun to listen to.He has this crazy natural abillity that is present in his solos. Every once in a while during a solo, he will hit the most beautiful note that you never even thought he could throw in, but he does it and i am amazed every time.The title track is cool, so is Five-Five-Five, and I believe Steve Vai had some part in this record.

The playing is intricate and displays some complexity, but is just too scattered and self-indulgent.So for the 5% of people that love Zappa, I am sorry to offend. But for the other 95% out there.......forget this one after a quick listen. Give it a fair chance and be prepared to move on. It does not get better over time, just becomes more and more annoying.Great musician, may he RIP.

These leave my feet aching. So I wonder if this is a \\"second\\" or one that did not make the regular quality control? I only wear these now when I am outside and am going to get dirty since they are black and do not show the dirt. Good for mowing the yard on a riding lawn mower if you understand what I mean.

I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like 'Out of Sight' sdtk...","review":"Having watched this movie, I had the same reaction as I did when I watched 'Out of Sight\\". Great music by David Holmes. I purchased the soundtrack for 'Out of Sight' the next day. And there was the dialogue.Please, please, please don't do this anymore!The soundtrack for 'Snatch' has, if I remember, 3 dialogue tracks. But they are on separate tracks (not to mention they're only like 5 seconds long at most). So, if I'm not in the mood to hear the dialogue, I can skip them (along with 'Lucky Star' by Madonna, yikes...)It really is unfortunate that this had to happen to what would have been a great soundtrack"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragically Flawed","review":"Why, oh why, did they litter up what would have been a great soundtrack with all of the samples of movie dialogue? The music is a great blend of stylish and classic tunes that set the mood wonderfully in the movie, and they would have stood on their own beautifully on the soundtrack. However, every song begins with about a 15 second clip of talking over the music, which is incredibly distracting and takes away from the vibe that the music alone would have created.

The issues:1. dialogue inserted over music (not necessarily matching where it landed in the movie)2. music is missing (where's the cool intro tune where Clooney gets out of jail?)3. tracks are typically incomplete (either fade out or get cut off)Not that there's any chance of a re-release, but it would be nice to have all the orginally scored music in its complete, instrumental form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!","review":"As Crass once said, \\"Be Warned\\". While watching the movie, I liked the jazzy/funky music I heard in the background..went perfectly with the feel of the movie. UNFORTUNATELY, upon buying this soundtrack, I was horribly dissappointed! As one reviewer below me said, almost every track has dialogue from the movie laid over it. So, you do not hear Henry Mancini's \\"Theme for Young Lovers\\" (as I had hoped). You hear about 20 seconds of the song in the background, with George Clooney talking over it. Not good.I gave this 1 star for Perry Como's \\"Papa Loves Mambo\\". It's an excellent track, but the rest (...) Don't get played like I did. Enjoy the movie, but skip the soundtrack.

Wouldn't it be nice if this was produced like the musical instrument lesson books with CD's that have one set of songs as solo and one set of songs with accompaniment? I'd love that choice. Funny, though, how I never notices some of the background music in scenes. I love those old songs, and would love to be able to have those songs without dialogue.

C'mon, guys n' girls--I'm supposed to have my own memories that these songs bring back! Don't beat me over the head with yours!The Pulp Fiction soundtrack added charcter to its CD by making the featured dialogue separate tracks. I wish they had done that here.

You get those (and the Elvis \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" track) but there were two things that ruined this soundtrack for me.1. Almost all of the tracks contain dialogue voice overs from the movie, even the catchy tracks I was looking for weren't just music, they all contained dialogue to get in the way of the music.2. Even the Elvis song I wanted to get a copy of was faded out before it was over (something that happens to all of the tracks here) and blended into the next track on the CD.I guess if my description fits what you're looking for then pick this up. If you are looking for the same thing I was then I might suggest listening to this at the library or someplace else before spending your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Soderbergh soundtrack!","review":"Steven Soderbergh has done it again! I loved the soundtrack to Out of Sight and this one is just as good and even longer. I love the way he includes dialogue from the film in the soundtrack, it reminds me of the movie and helps set the mood. The songs are mostly the background music from the movie - no lyrics, and fairly repetative, but the definately capture the mood of the film. There's a good mix of catchy, upbeat tunes and more mellow tracks. There are also a few good songs w/lyrics that span a range of genres from hip hop (Handsome Boy Modeling School) to rock and roll (Elvis's \\"A Little Less Conversation\\")to classical (Clair de Lune). If you loved the movie (and especially if you are a fan of Soderbergh in general) you should love this soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this album","review":"Dialogue dubbed over the music ruins this soundtrack. I don't mind a snappy phrase here and there, for effect, but this album has entire minute-long scenes drowning out the music for no apparent reason.After a year of trying to like it, and hearing my random playlist's funky groove interrupted by George Clooney talking, and deleting the album every time iTunes re-synced it to my player...

On the 1st pair the right earphone was inoperable right out of the box so was returned. Both earphones worked on the 2nd pair but the sound quality was acceptable at best. Then the first time I pulled them out of the Sansa's jack the cover on the jack-end of the cord pulled off and deeply gouged the wire covering. I have sent them back again and will be looking for a different pair of earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing parts","review":"I love these Maximo earphones. The sound is amazing. It took a minute to get used to them as they don't just rest in your ear like the regular earbuds. I recommend them. The only problem is that even though the package states it came with sizes small, medium, and large, the only one in the package was the medium. Now I've lost one of the black coverings and have no other pair to replace them with and may have to buy a new pair. :( .. they are worth buying a second pair but it would have been nice if the package included everything it said to have inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for a month and then one of the earphones stopped working","review":"the good things- sound is v good, sounds full, good base- you can play your mp3 player on the lowest volume and still hear clearly in the subway, the isolation works pretty wellthe bad- one of the ear phones stopped working after a month, so my set became useless- if you listen to music often or for long, your ears may hurt due to the isolation created by the earphones ... especially while pushing the earphones into your ear or while removing the earphonesi liked the earphones, just wished they had lasted longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"two pairs in a row broke after about a month!","review":"i got these earphones for christmas and loved them. they fit great in my ear and had a nice little case to hold them in. they were so amazing at blocking out noise i was shocked. i thought only the big clunky headphones did that, but these did great. but to my disappointment the headphones stopped working in one ear after about two months. i hadn't done anything to damage them. we had another set of the headphones my brother was supposed to get but he didn't want them so i used that brand new pair. this time, they stopped working in one ear after about two weeks!! they would be amazing headphones if they just continued to work. if you get them make sure to keep the package so you can get your money back if they break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Work great, until they break","review":"I bought these and they worked great- good sound quality, the 'action' button worked great (although it was a little difficult to press) but within two weeks the left earphone stopped working. I kept them on my desk to use at work (I only listen with one ear) and within a month the right earphone had stopped- after just being sat on my desk.I don't mistreat my earphones- I've since bought the overly-expensive Apple earbuds (Apple In-ear Headphones with Remote & Mic) and they've been going great for two months in the exact same conditions as these earphones were.

You WON'T be dissapointed! I was not a fan of the in-the-ear headphones, but thought I'd give these a try since they were supposed to be a match for my Sansa MP3 player. From the first Jimi Hendrix note to the bass in Brass Monkey, these earphones are more than ready for the job.

The housings are solid and constructed of metal and look nice. The sound quality after burn in was rather decent. The lows were very strong and punchy, the mids and highs were acceptable for the price. Sadly, that is where the good news ends. One week later with moderate usage the left channel was dead. I'm guessing it's thanks to the mediocre cable durability and lack of proper cable relief on the connections into the earbuds. Also, the arms that come down from the earbud housings to take the cables in are way too long and get in the way. I tried all the tips and the mediums worked well for me, but if you're looking for headphones that will work while in motion, look elsewhere. They were okay for sitting down at a desk but fall out easily when moving, thanks to the long metal arms that the cables go in to. Pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"TING!","review":"While these ear buds do have a very nice bass sound, they do not stay in place. I was constantly having to shove first one and then the other bud back in place.But that isn't the bad part.The part that drove me nuts was the metal tinging that these made all the time. It was like someone was using a dog clicker or the top of a Snapple bottle... except it was inside my ear!Click. Pop. TING!AAAAAAAAagh!It does not matter how good the rest of the product is if the end result is that it drives you insane. And these were driving me insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound decent, then break","review":"I got these off Woot for $18 -- nice price! They sounded reasonable and I used them for about 3 weeks before I realized the left earbud had gone completely dead. Not that surprising; I tend to be pretty rough on my headphones. But I figured I'd try an RMA and got one and they sent a replacement back; it only cost me $2 for the shipping. Figured I'd be gentler and get 3 months or so out of them; so I use them one day traveling to/from work on the subway. Next time I go put them on, I realize the left channel is pretty faint, and I get a phone call so I take them off; I put them back on and the left channel is completely dead. Obviously a bit of a design flaw somewhere in there if they die that quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds worse than the earphones that came with my E280","review":"Yup, you read that right. I bought these Maximo iM-490S earphones to replace the ones that came with my recently-acquired SanDisk Sansa E280 MP3 player, only to find that they sounded WORSE than the SanDisk-supplied ones.The mid-range was muddy and the bass distinctly lacking. And what's with the weird reverb? It sounded like I was listing to music through a pair of toilet rolls pressed against my ears.The earbuds also had an annoying tendency to slide out of my ear canals, regardless of which of the supplied rubber rings I used.Needless to say, I'll be returning this product to Amazon for a full refund.UPDATE (09/13/07): I sent these earphones back to Amazon on 08/27/07.

While there's nothing ground-breaking here -- fairy tales are, after all, fairy tales -- the combination of characters and settings is unique, with just enough differences to make walking this well-trod ground a delight.

It had a 4.5 star rating and we said, \\"Go for it!\\" This is easily one of the worst movies we have ever seen. We have no idea how the ratings are high. It was a mixture of a bunch of random things such as weird witches who kept sacrificing alligators and other creatures, and a star (lady) who had no idea of what was going on. The ending was predictable. We watched an hour of the movie and then skipped to the end (it was that bad). We correctly predicted who was the king, who would die, and who would get married. If you know what you're doing, you will skip this terrible movie and spare yourself from the worst experience of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure...","review":"I like to think of myself as pretty tech-savvy and I have yet to find a machine that this will play on.

I think of it as the New Millenium Princess Bride. But guys, it's a fantasy - and if you're somebody into Lord of the Rings, Narnia, etc., this is not necessarily for you.

It's witty enough to appeal to adults, it's got the sort of sentimental romance that grannies and teenagers love and there's some cool spells and special effects for the kids. It's got all the usual trappings of a fairy tale - handsome princes, beautiful princesses, evil kings, wicked witches and some terrific transformations - plus some extras like Robert de Niro as a camp pirate and Michelle Pfieffer being a real sport in a very unflattering latex mask. As you would expect all turns out well in the end with true love triumphing, goodness rewarded and wickedness punished but there are plenty of twists, turns and laughs along the way.

It is not a film for children because plot goes in too many directions at times. It is meant to be a British production so even American actors (Claire Danes andMIchelle Pfeifer) have fake british accents that disappear half way through the movie. Robert DeNiro is a complete miscast as a transvestite pirate and he does not even make an attempt to fake his accent.Sorry, but I found this movie to be a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short of the Mark","review":"While writer Gaiman aspired to write an adult fairy tale, \\"Stardust\\" falls short on both accounts. Another reviewer correctly identified it as a new \\"Princess Bride,\\" an adult spoof of children's fairy tales. And, as a spoof, it might have worked, except for the graphic violence, exploding heads and several impalings. Bing Crosby once asked, \\"Would you like to swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar . . . or would you rather be a jerk?\\" \\"Stardust\\" chooses to be jerky. When will filmmakers realize that the successes of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are not about the gee-whiz special effects and sweeping vistas but about the integrity of the writing. \\"Stardust\\" insults the genre of fantasy rather than complementing it. Want to read an adult fairy tale? Try Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series. Want to see an adult fairy tale? Try John Boorman's \\"Excalibur.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, inventive fantasy","review":"I won't rehash the plot, but rather simply say that \\"Stardust\\" was a pleasure to watch. While it borrows a lot of fantasy elements you've probably seen already, it invents (or introduces) quite a few of its own. It's quite amusing at times and visually impressive, to boot. While Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer do very good jobs in their respective roles, they--particularly De Niro--didn't exactly fit, possibly due to their American accents. Claire Danes, however, does a masterful job, regardless of the fact that she was born in NYC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"This film uses the time honored talent of DeNiro and Michelle Pheiffer, along with relative new comer Claire Danes. This unusual fantasy story line unfolds brilliantly. I found it complicated, and requiring attention and thought. There is one scene where an annoying salesman (Ricky Gervasi) meets his end that makes me laugh every time I watch it. I mention this becuase I cannot recall ever laughing at a death scene. Cameo appearance by Peter O'Toole, but this movie is so much more than the people in it. It's well edited, acted, and has several twists, turns and surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't had this much fun since the Princess Bride!","review":"This is a hilarious take on the fantasy genre, and if you enjoy witches, magic and comedy all rolled into one delicious package, then you should see this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Claire Danes is great.

This movie's content has very little in common with the novel; even main themes have been entirely removed. By lacking these themes, the movie loses much of the motivation and drive the characters originally had. The movie may be decent in its own right, but having read the novel twice, I was frustrated within the first 5-10 minutes of the film.

I love \\"Lord of the Rings\\", I love unicorns and dragons and magical amulets, I love adventure and romance and humor -- but \\"Stardust\\" failed to meet my expectations, in any of those categories.This movie was so stupid, so downright lame, it nearly made me gag. I was barely fifteen minutes into the movie before I suddenly felt the urge to get up and do something else. Even the unicorn hardly made up for the rest of the movie.

Michelle Pfeiffer really does chew up the scenery, Robert De Niro and Ricky Gervais have a great set piece dialogue, Claire Danes is literally radiant.The reason this may appeal to non-fantasy lovers is that it has a kind of matter-of-fact approach to the magical pieces -- as though magic were like technology for us, just something that people live with, and they use it to achieve their real goals -- happiness, power, money, etc.The movie just works on a number of levels...romance, comedy, action, coming-of-age story, chase story, quest...as one of the producers says in the \\"making of\\" piece in the special features -- it might not change your life, but it will definitely entertain you for two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"I loved the movie!

The preview looked intriguing enough so I decided to watch it one morning.I'm so happy I did. This movie is filled with a little bit of everything: action, adventure, comedy, romance. The performances were great. Claire Danes is stunning. I loved Robert De Niro's performance as the flamboyant pirate. And Michelle Pfeiffer is still beautiful. It is a little long (2 hours) but the story wasn't slow at all. This is a great movie for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Rented it first, then bought the DVD - it's a keeper","review":"I never read the book, didn't even know there was one until reading the reviews below. So I had no standard to compare it to.I found this movie full of cute jokes that were safe for the kids, a bit of action, a touch of suspense, some fairy tale magic, a love story, a coming of age.I found the characters refreshingly unique - I mean a gay sky pirate - in a flying ship, that captures lighting for a living, is not one I had seen before.It is just a little bit long to keep the kids fully engaged from start to finish by the fourth watch, but we all have enjoyed watching it several times.It was a keeper in our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stardust","review":"Are you a fan of, \\"The Princess Bride\\"? Well sit back and be ready to become a fan of \\"Stardust\\". All the same elements and more are in this fairy tale, with surprise elements to please all. I discovered this title by accident, and it has quickly found a place in my library's all time greatest hits! The story will hold the most faint of heart and will entertain the young and the old!

Great all round fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfullly magical","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed Stardust. Saw it twice before I bought it. Both grandaughters (ages 8 and 14) said it was their favorite movie of the year. Pfeffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox did a fabulous job in their roles. A truly wonderful magical adventure. Some very funny parts as well.Stardust (Full Screen Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one surprised me.","review":"When I saw the promos for this movie, I decided not to bother seeing it in the theater. It looked like the effects would play best on the big screen, but I had this one pegged as what I call a \\"fantasy art\\" films. You know, the ones that rely too much on effects to bother having a good story, or the ones that are so clever, the audience never does figure out what the story's all about. Well, I saw the DVD, and I had this one pegged wrongly. The story was well-written, clever, and engaging. It had its twists, but it would only confuse those who would find any fantasy story confusing. Of course, the effects were good, too, and they probably would have played even better on the big screen. This one was a pleasant surprise. I doubt it is everyone's cup-of-tea, but it worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure for whom this is for, but charming, I think","review":"I will not into great detail about the plot. You can read the reviews for that. However let me share my impressions. I saw this with my wife in a theatre where there were only 11 people. Eight of them were on their cell phones through out the movie. I really can't say for whom this is geared for. It is not a children's movie and it has a old time feel about it. It is more like an adult is remembering something from his childhood. It is told from an adult perspective. There are scenes that are very intense for young kids and not gory enough for teenagers. Young couples and people in their 30's may not respond to it, but for older people it sits well with us and we find it enjoyable. It very lovely to look at and the pirates are rather charming. As I said is a strange movie for what kind of audience I don't know. It reguires patience to sit through and is worth the time, but it feels dated for the most part. A very strange moive to review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc didn't play","review":"I was very disappointed that this disc did not play on any of my devices; BlueRay Player, Mac or PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed","review":"i was very disappointed. this was a movie i was looking forward to seeing, but apparantly the previews are the only good parts. considering also the number of popular stars that were a part of this movie, it bombed.

The special effects are outstanding and I must say that I loved watching every single minute of this fantastic fantasy movie. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, wild ride with memorable performances","review":"Picture Princess Bride ala Neil Gaiman. This guy has a twisted, original and highly entertaining style. I'd love to peek into this guy's dreamscape. Probably a mix of Lovecraft and Disney.This movie is just plain cool. And fun.

Although it had Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer on it, the cover looked suspiciously like a sappy fairy tale. Finally, when I had run out of movies to watch on Amazon Prime (jokes), I reread the synopsis two more times, and started the film. I couldn't have made a better choice. This film was an actual adventure, with well-rounded characters that had complex stories and lives going on throughout the film. I recommend 100%.

The album cover notwithstanding, I think it's just great music to listen to once in awhile, lover or not. As far as \\"erotic music\\" goes, there's nothing like early Sade!But for this type of music, you might also want to check out \\"Hearts and Stories\\" by Stolen Identity, or \\"OM:Chilled,Vol.2\\" worth the price of admission just to hear Lisa Eriksson's voice literally melt your mind on the track, \\"Love Comes First\\"!

It is a complete course in that it reviews elementary skills and now includes advance skills, both in reading and, of course, predominantly in writing. Although I understand from others that this is typically a book for 12th graders, I think that is absurd. My homeschooled kids used the Complete Course, one in the 9th grade, the other in the 8th grade. I then gave away the textbook to another homeschooler and over the years, realized I missed it as a reference. Except for my college \\"Keys for Writers,\\" Warriner's is my go-to book when I have a question about useage or mechanics, because I am wont to persistently confuse \\"which/that,\\" \\"lie/lay,\\" and even \\"nor/or.\\" So, instead of beating myself up for my lack of mastery, I reach for the reference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair book.

Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Paradigm of Grammars","review":"I obtained the 1965 edition of this grammar in a used bookstore for a few dollars several years ago and have consulted it time and again. Its import is reflected in its going price on Amazon, ($550+). Its value is in its simplicity, logical arrangement, and expositional clarity, three characteristics of any good piece of writing or any textbook that is worth the use. The current-day textbooks of most any kind appear to have an underlying philosophy that the more hodge-podge on the page, the better. You open them and your eyes are greeted with an aesthetic disaster, a confusing layout, and impenetrable inarticulateness.Not so with Warriner's grammar. Based on customer images, the newer editions have kept the quality of the old.

While, they were lucky to ride that sales wave, I think it's unfair to say that they weren't talented or that their music was vastly inferior to all the hip \\"alternative\\" bands of the 90s. As this collection shows, the band recorded some very good, melodic rock tunes. Maybe they weren't alternative, or fashionably grungem or electronic, but their music was nevertheless memorable and well played. And Darius Rucker's voice was one of the best of the era. This collection shows off most of their best tunes, and good value for the money too.

It is a solid compilation of HATB hits and powerful songs from the very unfortunate unpopular follow albums. perfect for the novice Hootie fan. The only reason for a 4 star rating is that I would have liked to see \\"Can't Find The Time To Tell You\\" from the Me Myself and Irene soundtrack make it to the list.

No gimmicks, no dance routines, no songs made to go along with a video, blah blah etc etc. What you see is what you get.This cd contains a wide range of their best stuff from all of their studio albums, and also includes a new song (Goodbye Girl) that was on a soundtrack for the movie of the same name. The material from Cracked Rear View will be very familiar, but the rest of the songs on this disc will give you an idea of the talent of this band just in case you haven't heard their more recent albums.In this day and age of \\"video stars\\" and soft drink endorsing mega-artists, it is nice to see a band that truly cares about the music.

The three songs I love are Hallelujah Chorus, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and Do You Hear What I Hear? The way Johnny holds the last note on the latter is INCREDIBLE!! He also surprises us to an extent with an upbeat rockin' version of Jingle Bell Rock. Calypso Noel is a nice song I've never heard anyone else sing. If you don't have any of Johnny's holiday CDs - two things - What's wrong with you and get this one.

The music is great, and the scenery is remarkable. That is to say, the production quality is top notch. My only grievance is that the DVD claims to be \\"All Regions\\" on the back of its cover, but it will not work in an ordinary DVD player.So, in short, get this movie!

The decision to get out there and get moving is always plagued by a million reasons why there just isn't enough time. A dear friend gave me the fitness/nutrition video: \\"En forma tropical\\". Man oh man what a fun way to get beyond all the excuses and rationalizations and to just have FUN while regaining a healthy state. From time to time I've bought or been given other aerobics and exercise videos but I quickly became discouraged because you had to be a professional dancer to get the moves down....not \\"En Forma\\".

It took several months but she was eventually found by the police and returned home. I very much liked how the family found comfort in their faith during the months she was away. The story is told quite skillfully and it did not take me long to finish reading the book since I found it so interesting. There is also a section of pictures from the family which I also enjoyed seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abduction","review":"Elizabeth Smart's parent's story told by them, concerning their search for their daughter. This is not Elizabeth Smarts story. If you are researching abduction, this book is probably of only secondary interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing Elizabeth home","review":"The book should be called \\"Bringing the bucks home\\". The book is very poorly written. The reader gets the impression that it was put together the day after the rescue and printed the following day. There is no continuity and I won't even go into listing all the grammatical errors. (Were did you find this author?) It's kind of hypocritical to complain about lack of privacy and then exploiting the situation for monitary gain. My question is \\" Why was this book necessary?\\" The press did a much better and more thorough job telling the story. The book taught me one thing: that nobody...nobody is immune the bite of the almighty \\"greed-bug\\". Unfortunately the Smarts were bitten by that bug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was not impressed...I guess I would have been if I wanted to join the LDS church, but this book lacked detail and seemed to be Ed and Lois' attempt to make money off of thier kidnapped daughter. This book left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Testament to Faith","review":"It's an powerful lesson that we all learn at some time when our faith is put to the test; the lesson that we must accept how little control we have over our own lives and that we must carry on with faith and hope. That's really what's going on in the Smarts' book. It's not Forensic Files, CSI, or Cold Case--It's not a tabloid fodder tell-all. I admire Ed and Lois for trying to put some dignity into the media circus surrounding their daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written - a disappointment","review":"Whoever edited this book must have been under the influence of something - I can't believe that he/she let such a poorly written book go to press. At the very least, a competent ghost writer should have been hired to make sense of this mess!I concur with the reviewer who couldn't believe how stupid the Smarts were in allowing homeless persons into their home. I am all for helping the homeless, but the man could have donated to a local shelter or assistance program. He's got 6 kids - what was he thinking???????Other reviewers have noted the tense shifts, the awkward phrasing, and excessive proselytizing. I second these findings wholeheartedly. If you really must read the book, do what I did - read it at a library or bookstore. Don't buy it! I am normally an avid re-reader, and I have no desire whatsoever to read this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me with a bad feeling","review":"This is one of the few times when I've read a book and found myself unable to complete it. The ghost writer did a fine job with what she had. The book is literate, the grammar is correct. Many of the passages about Faith are actually moving but this thing is so distasteful that I don't want to say anything good about it. A young girl is kidnapped, molested, held hostage and her dad writes a book about it so the \\"true\\" story can be told. Ick. The whole thing left me with a very bad feeling. I'm sorry I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was waiting for this book to be released. Surprisingly I had trouble completing the book.

Although the book is well written, you can see Mr. Smart running to the bank!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I found Bringing Elizabeth Home a well-written account of what Ed and Lois Smart went through when Elizabeth was kidnapped. It details their ordeals with the media and law enforcement and their frustration with the political limitations in finding lost children. It also is a continuous witness to their religious beliefs. In these areas the book is informative and may provide needed changes for our society in helping these lost and stolen children and their families. However, the book tells almost nothing of Elizabeth's ordeal, giving no more information than already reported in the media. Understandably the criminal case cannot be compromised but some testimony to what she went through and how she survived would seem to be warranted. It would be like reading the Jessica Lynch story of her captivity in Irag and only hearing about what her family thought and endured here in the states. I found the book a disappointment and still await Elizabeth's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning tragedy into cash","review":"When I saw this book in the bookstore recently I picked it up just to take a gander at it. Upon opening the book I heard a loud \\"Cha-Ching!\\" Everytime I turned a page I heard sound effects of carribean cruises, Elizabeth's first Lexus reving up, and the sound of Ed (her father) jumping into a pool of money just like Scrooge McDuck. Gee, I'd kidnapp myself if I thought it would mean my family would become millionaires.Guess what? Everyday a child is kidnaped and families go through similar torment. Guess what else? Most of the time these parents never see their kids again, unless its at a funeral. Having Elizabeth back should be reward enough. But no, they have to do the \\"Christian thing\\": which means exploit their tragedy and convert it into cold hard cash. First Utah loses Karl Malone, and now dignity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragedy the Incident & the Book","review":"It was and is a tragedy this young girl was victimized as she was. The sick criminal that did this could never be punished enough to give Elizabeth back her innocence.If the reader is looking to learn all the details and facts about the trials and tribulations of Elizabeth as a hostage they will be disappointed.This book is a story about Christian faith. It should be about a parents failure to teach their children about the brutal realities of life and their naivete towards strangers. Be cautious with who and what parents allow in and around the home of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart? He was not!","review":"I have learned little new from this book as I have been following this story from the news. Thousands of children go missing every year and no mention is made of them. Had this happened in inner city Chicago or New York, it might have gotten a cursery mention on the nightly news and quickly forgotten. Elizabeth is very lucky to have survived her nine month ordeal. How many others are so fortunate? And Ed Smart had transient people work on his million dollar estate? He has six beautiful children and loving wife. Why would he bring in transients in to work on his house rather than hire contractors with licenses? Smart? He was not. I wish the book would address these issues rather than bash the police for not doing their job."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have an idea!","review":"I have an idea, Mr. and Mrs. Smart! Let's actually HELP missing children! Let's, ya know, give them equal coverage that their very lucky daughter got. Let's NOT capatalize on a family tragedy. I'm sure those six kids just want to get back to normal! Why are these parents dragging them through everything?! It was nice that Elizabeth was found. In fact, ti was a miracle. But, we don't need preaching. We don't need every screw-up of the PD listed. Maybe they should have taken some heat. Letting a strange man in his home, his home that houses six young children? Hmm. I'm not blaming him; but he and Susan Smith's mother are all about the blame-game.We're happy your daughter is home. Now, let's bring the thousands of children that go missing a year home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be nice...","review":"Yeah, it would be great if the whole Smart story were as storybook as we were lead to believe.

Let the girl live her life and try to put this horrible thing behind her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and very real","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Not only does it faithfully tell the painful story of Elizabeth's disappearance and the family's efforts to cope with such an event, it also succeeds in portraying the parents as real individuals forced to deal with a horrific trial. I also respect the fact that the book respects and protects Elizabeth's privacy - the poor girl has been through enough already without us knowing every detail of what happened to her during those 9 months! Overall, a very touching, heartfelt book with rays of hope throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me get this straight","review":"These critcal reviewers bought the book and now they accuse the Smarts of being exploitive for writing it. If something is wrong here it is that kind of cynical hypocritcal schitzophrenic reasoning. Why don't they write their own book? Go ahead just make up your own story since you all seem to know more about what happened than the people who lived it.This is the Smart's story. They are the best qualified to tell it and they have done a very nice job of it here. I admire their faith, courage and tenacity. I wish all of them love and healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I was skeptical before reading this book. It seemed a little strange to be coming out with a book so soon. However, I was deeply touched and pleasantly surprised at this book. The Smarts share an honest and open account of their ordeal. They offer an example of how to use faith and a belief in God to make it through something so terrible. It was an inspiring read. They were very respectful of Elizabeth and were tasteful not to be too specific about her experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Flavor!","review":"I tried this curry paste after I found it recommended in Pressure Perfect by Lorna Sass, a cookbook with recipes for pressure cookers. Well, the first thing that I made with it was curry chicken. It became an instant family favorite. Since then, I have tried it in other dishes and I was never disappointed. The flavor is rich and intense without being overpowering. I have also used it in Hot and we like it too, but it would not be good for people who are not used to heat.

UK. I have tried a variety of sauces, including the chutney from Patak and they all share a similar, unfortunate attribute : They all taste of vinegar, ketchup, more vinegar and more ketchup. I am truly surprised that nobody has mentioned this abomination. It was as if somebody poured salad dressing over my chicken, dumped out half a bottle of ketchup on top of it, soaked it overnight in a bag of vinegar, and then crapped over it with a can of manwich. This company should be out of business.If you want to try the most authentic indian food in a jar that I've found, try Tiger Tiger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tough to Read","review":"This is a book that is supposed to be works of surrealist poets, but not all of it is.

Luckily, there was enough action and dialogue to keep me entertained throughout the book. The only problem I have with his later novels is that Wiltse has been making Becker too witty and light, forgetting how tormented he usually is when on the hunt. The humor's always a nice counterpoint to the psychos though, so the light tone works effectively in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A no-brainer","review":"I have often enjoyed David Wiltse's works, but this one is a no-brainer.

You have all of the edge of the first Becker books with the added humor of bit players. He has you chewing your nails one moment and laughing out loud in the next. Wiltse has perfected the serial killer books and John Becker is the most intriguing characther I've read. With his wife slowly recovering from injuries and coming upon an unknown 'type' of killer, Becker could not rely on the instincts that has guided him in the past books. I cannot recommend David Wiltse enough. He is the best kept secret in fiction.

And John Becker has emerged from them as one of the most interesting series characters in fiction today. Unfortunately, after the remarkably poor BONE DEEP, Wiltse has plummeted even further to banality with BLOWN AWAY, a true stinker of a novel. The villian of the piece, Swan, is a laughable creation, and his association with a repressed homosexual gangster is uninteresting and poorly shaped and detailed. There's no suspense, no plot worth engaging in, and Becker is left with practically nothing to do. The result is a complete disaster from a usual first-rate writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing book after splendid series.","review":"What I really want to know is whether David Wiltse is going to write more Becker books.

We had one of those record players where you stack up the records and the play one after the other. The mix was made up of Ray Conniff, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Christmas with Chet Atkins (if you don't have Chet Atkins's Christmas CD... check it out..)Depending on how much Ray Conniff Singers you want, either buy this, or skip it and buy the other three.4 stars because I think the original 3 are a better choice. The music itself is 5+ stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go back 40 years...","review":"This Album and with the \\"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\\" Album (many songs are on both) are the two I grew up with listening to in front of our giant old stereo, when these were on 33 LP records. I couldn't believe when I spotted the 'girl in the Santa Mini-Skirt' in the Christmas CD section and like so many others, instantly recognized the album from when I was just a kid. I both both albums a few years ago on CD and listen to them every year. Amazing the memories the songs bring back, it's not today's music, but why should it be? :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic, spirited performances: great choice of material.","review":"This album always puts me in a good mood. It is happy, upbeat music, that is never raucous...just simple and melodic. The tenth song, \\"White Birds\\", is rather haunting. It is a nice album to have on in the background when you are working quietly or have friends over and want to be able to talk. It creates a positive, festive mood without being nerve wracking at all. Yet it is worthwhile to sit there and listen to it for its own sake, too. I find that I reach for it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"pass me the poi","review":"this is a great CD of authentic Hawaiian steel guitar music from the 30's. All the famous artists are on here: Sol Hoopii, King Benny Nawahi, Kalama's Quartet, and a lot of others. Some of the recordings are old and scratchy, but who cares? If you like Hawaiian steel guitar music from it's Golden Age, then you will enjoy this CD tremendously. This is fun music, combining elements of traditional Hawaiian sounds, ragtime, and a little tin pan alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but does not work well","review":"Only fits on the passenger side for a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe.

It seems unlikely. You can almost hear Goldman hissing and sneering in the background as you read these pages. John and Yoko are presented as two really loathsome characters, and I guess I was supposed to come away from this reading experience despising the two of them, but I actually feel a lot of sympathy. Nobody deserves this kind of character assassination."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lives of John Lennon","review":"This book is full of exagerations and many falsities, i have done research on Lennon over the past few years and the book i feel gives a very good overview of his life would be \\"Lennon: the defenitive biography.\\" I am not saying \\"The Lives of John Lennon\\" is just one big lie, it has truthful, and quite factual information, but it sensationalizes many incidents in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this guy's angle??","review":"An absorbing, if sordid, biography of John Lennon. While it's clear that Goldman did extensive research, did he ever verify his sources' information? It appears to me that he has published alot of and rumor, and this doesn't seem to be a particularly good way to write nonfiction.

However, in \\"The Lives of John Lennon\\" so much of the story is Goldman's armchair psychology. The author puts a negative slant on every aspect of John's life. It is difficult to know how much is fact and how much is made up in the mind of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldman is trash.","review":"Do not buy this book. This man is a liar who only intended to tarnish the reputation of a legend. Mind you, Lennon had his downs as well, but Goldman is ridiculous. He wrote that John could hardly stand to be around Sean and would not even hold him, but we see in countless interviews and footage that this is not the case. We see a man smothering a little boy with love that he did not receive from his own father. All we ever see is John with Sean. Let me just say that when Albert Goldman died nobody really missed his critiques. This book is garbage. Goldman was well-known for destroying reputations of people we love. He did an excellent job with Elvis and was working on Jim Morrison when he died. Do not waste your money. Lies, lies, lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ugly truth about an ex-mystic who blew it big-time","review":"Lennon reminds me of no-one so much as Charley Gordon, the protagonist of FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON. Lennon started out as a banality-mongering showbiz butthole. But then LSD transformed him into a mystic. And then he descended back into banality and showbiz buttholery. And needless to say, there were plenty of other lysergically-transformed people who underwent the same scenario. Lennon's worst trait was his repulsive solipsistic self-absorption. My favorite quote from Goldman is in regard to George Harrison's wife and her reaction to LSD: \\"While Cynthia struggled to throw off the drug, Patti lay down and snuggled with her cat, worried only about how she would explain the next day that she was now a different person.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanest, Nastiest Slam Of A Dead Person I've Ever Seen","review":"I picked this book up having never heard of it and thinking it might be a nice way to read more about the life of one of the 20th century's great musical geniuses, John Lennon. WRONG! This terrible excuse in slandering a murder victim who cannot speak for himself is disgusting beyond words. This is the lowest, meanest tabloid-esque exercise in character assassination I've personally ever seen set to print. How did this ever get published? What person would knowingly buy this? (I unwittingly got it at a library.) I didn't finish this trash talking badly-penned mongering of gossip and I hope this review persuades someone who might have unknowingly strayed toward this evil piece of maliciousness to find a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary","review":"My question is why? I'm realistic enough to believe that rock stars don't deserve sainted status. But I do know how to recognize musical abilities and talents. Do I really need to know every sordid detail, does anyone? I finished this book by sheer force of will, and I felt psychologically dirty afterwards. I listened to some Beatles & solo albums and realized that it was about the music, not the painfully tortured lives behind the music. This book is a reminder of how invasive we really are. What kind of cruelty is it to reveal all the faults and failings of man who is now dead and can never have the opportunity to respond? Maybe some of the book is true. But I really don't care. I'm sorry to Mr. Lennon and his families for the exposure this has brought to them(even though it was written over 15 yrs ago)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Others who don't know me have their opinions --","review":"but they don't know me, so their opinions are without validity.The photograph on this edition is misleading: it makes it appear that Lennon is lying on his back, drunk or stoned or what have you.

I went to the library and was excited to take out an extensive biography on Lennon. I couldn't finish it. The book is obviously a distorted version written by someone who hates the Beatles, especially Lennon. In the first 100 pages that I read, not a SINGLE good word (?). 2 examples, amongst many: Goldman describes John as \\"clapping like a seal and stomping his club foot\\" on stage during a concert; Goldman puts down all their music, for instance the music of \\"All You Need is Love\\" is no more than a variation of \\"Three Blind Mice\\". I certainly wanted to read an in-depth study on Lennon, including his weaknesses, but I must discredit this one by its one-sidedness. It's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage; John is probably turning in his grave","review":"I was lying in bed last night when I realized what an evil thing Albert Goldman has done here. He has taken the memory of John Lennon chewed it up spit it out and then stomped on it. Its disgusting. It has been proven that most of this book is garbage. John is gone. He is not here to defend himself against these horriable alligations. Any true Lennon fan shouldn't touch this book with a ten foot poll. I\\"m sorry that I did.

Refreshing, considering the amount of fawning rubbish that has been written about the biggest and best sell-outs of pop.

For anyone reading this book, don't make it your first glimpse at John Lennon, as it is a harsh version of his life. Read something a bit more sugar sweet first. Not recommended for average Lennon fans, who know him as a great musician and honest man. The only reason I gave it two stars was for its detail. Just a very true, but disheartening book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putrid, Poisonous, Infuriating","review":"I can understand why I picked up this book in a bargain bin, it's simply awful. That might sound harsh, maybe, but once you start reading this book, you'll understand why I'm so critical of this trash. I was a third of the way through the book before I gave up altogether. Racism, bigotry, homophobia, hysterical overwriting...Goldman's obvious aim is to simply try and destroy a legendary figure. I recognise that Lennon wasn't a saint, but there should be a fair play for a dead man. Goldman does not provide it.Oscar Wilde once said: \\"A man in life has many disciples, but it is always Judas who writes the biography.\\" That explains this book perfectly. If you are are looking for a biography of Lennon, I refer you to Ray Coleman's excellent, thoughtful study."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tabloid Trash\\"","review":"The validity of this book compares to the validity of every loony story in those tabloid magazines. Goldmans references are uncredible, and he robs Lennon of his dignity in this book. Most any other source on Lennon portrays completely the opposite. I think that Goldman's book should be sold by taking an ad out in 'The National Enquirer\\" or some other trash talking paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair.","review":"Although my opinion is biased, being a life long Lennon fan, I still feel that Goldman unfairly painted a bleak picture of a social icon, just because John Lennon was exactly that. I guess it's easier to defame the deceased, they can't defend themselves. It's also easier to write a biography with out actually interviewing the people who were there, it allows for more freedom with plot development. Goldman should recieve some credit where it is deserved. Though fictional, his work did invoke the response of many readers throughout world. I give him two stars for sensationalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give it a more suitible rating- \\"0\\"","review":"This is the worst example of biography there has ever been .

And though I'm sure that the dates are correct ( they are common knowledge to Beatfreaks ) I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and say that the rest wasn't . and in closing , I think I can shed some light on who the author might really be - Mark David Chapman himself , in sheeps clothing .

It sounds a little bit messy (especially \\"Brown Shoes Don't Make It\\" - really horrible version of that song), synths are horrible-sounding , there is a lot of filler (spoken tracks or some boring melodies like Easy Meat or Fine Girl), and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta is nowhere as great as on Joe's Garage or Shut Up and Play... Yes, there are a few good (not great) songs - for example the title track, one of a few really tight songs here, but most of this album sounds like an half-mess or very minimalistic on Zappa standards.

I followed the directions to the letter on the box which wasn't too difficult but, like the others low rating reviews, it came out like a watery flat omelet. It had a strong taste of eggs, it didn't rise very well. I chucked the rest of the box out. You might get a better result if you cut the mix with a little regular flour or add more mix than recommended on the package, but I don't think its worth the effort.

The appearance of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Portugal in that fateful year of 1917 brings it all home. I have long been fascinated by the events of the Russian Revolution, but until I read this book I had only a vague notion of the pattern, the proof, that these were not just random events happening without reason. Human beings brought about the terrible First World War, and all the tragedies and disasters that led to Russia's fall to Communism. But God has managed to let all things work for good, ultimately. This is a fascinating and educational book. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Message is good but...","review":"This message about a man's life who now does good things for others is good, but I wish there were not so many typos in the book, and there were not so much disturbing press available about the author.

If you're into to supporting that kind of crap then go for it. But anyone who wants the real thins will be happy with the money spent on the Real version.This is a good buy, however if you are into season 2 and stongly feel that it is the best season then you may want to invest in the OVA's at least Trust and Betrayl, AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT!! They kinda botched some things up. The Widescreem implimentation means that they simply cut off some of the top and bottom of the frame, because the OVA was drawn in Pan and Scan format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untrue to the Series","review":"This third installment of Rurouni Kenshin is all right, but not great. It has the same good ole humor, but the enemies are very different. The previous episodes tried to be somewhat realistic in their action and events, nothing very magical. In the Meiji Era, though, the events were extremely far fetch, from finding the Elixir to the flow of this huge electic wave of Chi running all over Japan. All strings to reality were chopped off.The Legend of Kyoto had a fantastic ending with a huge, epic battle. Unfortunately, the series never reached the same amount of adrenaline in action. It didn't even come close. I also greatly missed Saitou. I never saw him again after Legend of Kyoto. He made the set of characters perfect with his awesome lack of pity.If you want to keep a good impression of Ruruoni Kenshin, do not buy this DVD box. If you must know how it ends, then borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The circle is complete...","review":"The Meiji Era is kind of like the first season - lots of small stories put together with a few episodes that stand alone. Christian cults, German knights, Ninja clans, more fighting styles (some even from Europe). The art work, camera style and appearance of some characters from the other seasons helps bring it all together even with the lack of a season long story. The last episode's use of real photographs and film footage mixed with the anime cells really brings it to a lovely and heart warming close.The wandering samurai, Rurouni Kenshin, returns to the place where he started in the first season.

The Quartet's sound is distinguished by elegant four-part harmonies and the interplay of two steel guitars. Even though they worked on the mainland, a lot of their repertoire is notably old-school in comparison to their pop-oriented contemporaries; although accomplished, they have a folkloric, 19th Century feel to some of their rougher material.

It takes about 8 seconds to power up, as others have said, but it also takes one full second between presses of the channel button to change the channel again, and the remote control the TV came with broke very soon after I got it, which meant that I had to suffer the slow channel changing through 82 channels every time I needed to get to another channel.Overall, not remotely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a hammer...","review":"i love this hammer. in this day and age of nail guns i hardly ever use a hammer anyways. i find it easier to carry the lightest hammer possible.like the other reviewer said the heads were loose on both of mine. but all it takes is a second to drive the pin into the handle from the top of the hammer. mine loosen every once in a while but i use them just about every day.this is a trim hammer don't try to use it for anything other then trim. i switch to a 24 oz waffle face for framing and a 16oz smooth for decking and other jobs were a waffle may be a problem and this 8 oz is to small.overall for ~$20 this is a great trim hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, burnt or stale, throw out","review":"terrible, burnt or stale, no favor (double vanilla creme), should take out of stock and should not carry brand or charge to return, coffee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful matlab reference","review":"Excellent text.

There are large sections devoted to male \\"misconceptions\\", parental issues, and other such obvious things.My wife has concerns with the book because it seems to promote the stereotype that in a Christian relationship the male is supposed to be dominate and the wife is supposed to be subordinate. I have to say, it bugs me too. It can be a little irritating night after night.Lastly, the book seems to talk down to the read as if they are just beginning their faith journey. We have actually stopped reading the book after only a few weeks. Before anyone says anything, I have made these observations by reading through many of the other days to see if we should keep going or just stop...we just stopped.My recommendation is to skip this book if you have been together for a time, if you have been together for a while, have a good relationship, or are not just beginning your faith journey together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not for couples in trouble","review":"I bought the book for me and my husband.

Needless to say, we were rather disappointed. In addition, the author seems to have grabbed Bible verses at random, then writes examples based on, not only his, but his family's experiences....and the vast majority of the verses he used had NOTHING to do with his stories.

Haven't these people seen that the man and the woman in marriage are EQUALS....with the \\"relationship\\" they present, the man gets all he wants and the woman is left with nothing.

The primary feature I was looking for was something easy to clean. This definitely fit the bill, but I did not foresee the problems I would have the very first time I tried to use it.The first annoying thing is how heavy it is. I thought that I'd be able to brush things using my wrist, like a paintbrush, but it weighs just enough that all the movement has to be in the elbows. Stinky.The more annoying thing is the connection between the black part and the metal part. The silicone was designed (poorly) to be removable and then suction back onto the metal, but it's not a tight fit at all. The silicone part with the bristles will pop off occasionally during use.Now, I just use the silicone part without the handle to brush small items. I'd recommend a different product that is made of silicone but comes in one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creeped Me Out - a Great Read!","review":"This was my first Cree Black book and I've already purchased Land of Echoes and getting ready to read it.

Like a good old fashioned ghost story and murder mystery rolled into one great story. Hecht paints a vivid backdrop of the places he writes about. I've lived in all three places in the story. Boston, Seattle and New Orleans. The descriptions are accurate and are written as if the author was there watching it unfold and he brought me right there with him.As fun as the story was it did slow in the middle and drag a towards the end but only a little. There were a couple of cultural mistakes but only a person who lived ther would really know the difference but they did not distract from the story too much. Overall I enjoyed reading it and am moving forward in the series onto book two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Between the Typos","review":"This book became so annoying to read on my Kindle. There was at least 1 typo/misspelled word on every page! Also, the author felt free to invent his own words as he went along. Doesn't anyone proofread these things? In addition,the main character is very pathetic. What kind of a psychoanalyst can't have enough sense to seek help for her own emotional instability?"},{"rating":"1","title":"MiddleSchoolLevel","review":"I will never pick up a book by this author again. If one can typify a 'female' writing style, it would be Hecht (although the author purports to be male). Overly descriptive of places, clothing, psychological states. Does she love him/does she not quandries. Why should we care? Less tension than your typical teenaged romance. I expected to, perhaps, learn a bit of voodoo/hoodoo lore. Nada! If it were the first book of it's sort that I had read, perhaps it would be fine - 'nice' might be the better word, but for anyone who has lived a bit and had some small contact with the 'unexplained' world, this is BORING. Get the feeling, by the author's style, that she/he is trying to attract a movie deal - being rich on visuals and lacking in depth. Gimmee a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting premise...disappoints","review":"I really started out liking this story. Loved the New Orleans setting and the idea of ghost hunting combined with a possible hoodoo/voodoo connection. But the character of Cree Black got on my nerves so bad that I found myself not caring much about her one way or the other. She is supposed to be a 'brilliant' Ph.D in psychology, but she's an emotional train wreck who can hardly navigate her way through life. Why anyone would pay her thousands to exorcise their ghosts is beyond me. She's ineffectual, totally incapable of intimacy, lies compulsively to her friends and family, and seems stuck in this self-pity time warp over her husband who died 9 years ago!

Though not immune to the complaintsof lack of support on top, Despina doesn't demand as much vocally butshe is perfect as a sort of camp companion. What is best is thescore is given complete which isn't the case in most DVD productions.I can't understand how Muti who insists on including every inkblotin verdi, cuts Mozart. It shows how Mozart and Da Ponte knew exactlywhat they were doing. Shankle might be a real find-- he sings allthree arias quite well.

Mink Car is just plain bad. Three or four tracks, like the opening cut \\"Bang\\" are passable songs in TMBG's familiar style, but most of the tracks are virtually unlistenable. Typical example: \\"Drink!\\" in the hands of TMBG, ought to be a witty, eccentric parody of drinking songs. Instead, it's just a really lame drinking song. There's no humor, no spirit, not even a good melody. It sounds like John & John weren't having any fun when they wrote and recorded \\"Mink Car.\\" There sure isn't much fun to be had in listening to it.

Let me say that I'm a huge TMBG fan whose favorite albums are Lincoln and Flood, but still enjoyed many parts of later albums like John Henry and Factory Showroom. This album seems to be a collection of failed experiments in different genres that lacks any of the lyrical cleverness or originality usually found in their songs. The lush production of many of the songs often only make them sound all the more painly conventional. And what's the deal with \\"Another First Kiss\\"? Are TMBG trying to squeeze their way into soft rock stations across the country? The song is an embarrassment. Skip this dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great CD from TMBG","review":"Mink Car is an album I think anyone can enjoy, you just have to be willing to let it grow on you. Certain songs (like \\"mr. xcitemtnt\\") you may hate at first, but then weeks later (or months later in my case) you begin to dig it. Other tracks like the first single \\"Man, it's so loud in here\\" and \\"Bangs\\" are so catchy you just have to listen to them again. While Mink Car is not even close to being as solid an album as their best, Flood and apollo 18, when it hits the target....it really hits the target. \\"Man it's so loud in here\\" and \\"Hovering Sombrero\\" are without a doubt two of their best songs ever...although sombrero could benefit from an extra verse or two.

For reference, let me state that my favorite TMBG albums are John Henry and Factory Showroom. I really like the full band sound and when the electric guitars are prominent. This album seems like a throwback to Lincoln and the first album to me, with many catchy and weird tunes but no cohesion. Many songs seem experimental little bits that were extended into song length, not fully realized pop songs. This album just doesn't flow. Supposedly the Band of Dans are all over this album, but it is hard to tell. Mr. Xcitement and Wicked Little Critta are 2 of the worst things TMBG have ever put to album and sound like bad B-sides. That said, I do like It's So Loud In Here, Another First Kiss, and Mink Car alot. Bangs is OK also. The rest do nothing for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises....but Heck, who needs em?","review":"When it's They Might Be Giants, you know what to expect - chorus after chorus after catchy chorus, with quirky, funny, witty lyrics. And the boys do not disappoint here. Mink Car is full of pop gems. The title track is particularly brilliant and somewhat removed from their usual style, but the rest of this is classic TMBG - \\"Working undercover for the man\\", \\"Hopeless bleak despair\\", \\"Bangs\\", \\"Another first kiss\\"... I could go and on, but you get the general idea.I deduct one star for the annoying \\"Mr. Xcitement\\" and \\"Wicked little critta\\" - two low points in an otherwise fine record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album With the Full Rock Band","review":"I'm a huge TMBG fan. I bought this disc and thought it was okay. Then I taped it and listened to it over and over in my car because I wanted to like it more. And now I do. The songs that I didn't like right away I \\"get\\" now. Wicked Little Critta is the best example. I truly hated it at first listen, but now I get it and I like it a lot.In 1994 TMBG released \\"John Henry\\", their fifth album, which had a full rock band on most of the songs. Previously they had been a quirky duo making more esoteric sounds. I was disappointed by the sound of \\"John Henry\\". I found it to be a sad capitulation to the grating sound of \\"modern rock\\". Mink Car is their first full band album I have truly loved the way I loved their first four albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great not bad","review":"I'm a huge TMBG fan, so I'm a bit bias. I think it's a decent cd. I'm usually rather partial to the Linnell songs, but this is the first CD that I prefer the Flansburgh songs better. It seemed like Linnell was always singing in character, which is funny for one song or two, but not every track. I think that the remake of \\"another first kiss\\" is incredible and listent to it over and over. \\"It's so loud in here\\" is a strong song, love \\"working undercover for the man\\", and most of the others. \\"Drink\\" loses a bit of the great live feel on the cd that makes a song like that work, and the biggest disappointment for me was how they settled on producing \\"finished with lies\\". The working version that you'd hear in concert was INCREDIBLE. I was very upset with the current version. Where was \\"museum of idiots\\"?Great cause they're great, but not as solid as many of their other efforts.

Extremely well written, Dr. Orion takes us on a horrific journey, while educating us along the way. Using many compelling examples from her own case and others (including some of the more notorious celebrity cases), she proves the point that stalking is not taken seriously enough by both law enforcement and other mental health professionals. Time and again, we learn that when the victim, the victim's family or others entrusted with helping the victim don't take the stalker seriously, at best, the behavior escalates. At worst, it turns deadly! This book should be required reading for law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, and those in the mental health field. It should also be read by anyone who likes a beautifully written thriller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It looked like a good idea......","review":"But once I bought it and started using the recipies I was dissapointed.

I bought it for the 'innovative' and 'new' recipies, hoping that I could use hamburger for more creative meals since we're on a grocery budget. Every recipie I tried came out mushy and bland, even following the directions carefully.If your only method of cooking with hamburger currently is with hamburger helper, this book may be of help to you. But, if you already cook fairly frugally, and can make some decent hamburgers, chilis, spagetti sauces, a caserole or two and tacos/burritos with hamburger you probably will not be able to put this book to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ceilling fan","review":"Love the look .

Most tracks feature one of his several guitarist friends -- always high energy and kicking. They do smoking versions of Bruford's \\"Five G\\" and Billy Cobham's \\"Quadrant 4\\" while the rest are all originals in a similar vein. A few tracks feature horns or harmonica although Carl's powerhouse drumming is never far behind.Overall this is a consistently pleasing set of \\"pure\\" music by some of the top sessionmen around.By the way, ignore Amazon's \\"product description\\" -- there are no DVDs in this CD.

Mrs. Cunningham was a food maven in the San Francisco Bay Area for years, and I always enjoyed her column in the San Francisco Chronicle for her wit and common sense approach.

HARDLY!!!!","review":"I am amazed at how some people hate the camera control in this game.

Sadly, almost every RTS these days has a stationary camera, locked above with no way to zoom in or out, or get better angles. For me, this ruined Warcraft III. I hated being a static observer, not able to enjoy the game because of the lack of camera control. Warcraft III is still a fun game, but Myth II still stands above all.P.S. - Try playing the tutorial three or four times. It should help you acclimate to the camera's controlsP.P.S. - If you liked Myth II, don't bother with Myth III.

Weapon system disarment, overtaxation and a decadent and lazy culture are all discussed against a young and cold weathered enemy. Sound familiar. This should be published agAIN, JUST BECAUSE IT IS GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who believes in reincarnation","review":"I have read this book before & always end of giving it away, so hopefully I can hang on to this copy! The story behind this book it what makes it great. The fact that Taylor Caldwell wrote this when she was only 12 years old & supposedly it is based on her memories of a previous life. Read it for yourself & see what you think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very similiar to \\"The Arm and the Darkness\\".","review":"Again book was very similiar to \\"The Arm and the Darkness\\". Pages coming loose, very worn, yellow, etc. Haven't read this book yet either-just do not like the smell, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie.","review":"A classic movie of innocence and respect for that innocence. One of the great coming-of-age-movies of all time. But that sounds like a cliche. This movie stands alone as a great movie. It's wonderful in it's simplicity. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst movie of all time","review":"That said, it must be watched from beginning to end for the pure sociological aspect of the seventies and the unintentional humorous fall down laughing lines and cinematography. (Dumb lines delivered in sincerity. Slow motion jumping up and down). If you enjoy making fun of bad movies, put this one in your must watch list."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money, sorry","review":"This book is a waste of money. Some of the exercises are the direct way to injury (e.g. full squat and leg press \\"lowering the resistance as far as possible\\" good-bye sweet meniscus!!). The exercises are ok, but how on earth can somebody introduce them without explaining the risks and safety instructions!?! Same with stretching in hyperlordosis....!The author comes from basketball and didn't even take the time to redesign the sketches of the court drills. ...not very professional.The general introductions into the different topics are mainly ok.I recommend \\"Complete Conditioning for Volleyball\\" and \\"The Volleyball Coacing Bible\\"; that is helpful and professional sport literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book on conditioning.","review":"This book was pretty good. Had some very nice exercises that I hadn't thought of using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best anime","review":"While Black Blood Brothers tries to throw overblown action in the form of high-flying vampires spraying bullets at their enemies, the story is really lacking. The characters are flat and not compelling enough to draw the viewer in and the animation offers nothing that cannot be found in other anime series. I've tried to like it, as I enjoy quite a lot of anime, but I simply could not find anything worth recommending in this one. I have not obtained the succeeding chapters and will not do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark humor, occassionally compelling","review":"Chapter 1 of the Black Blood Brothers introduces us to this new anime in which vampires and humans work together to stop a family of stronger, mutant vampires. With moments of gore and even occassionally racy language, we watch how the Mochizuki brothers and Mimiko combat the resurgency of the Kowloon children and develop as individuals as they deal with these powerful vampires coming back to the planet.Overall I found this entertaining, if not stereotypical, anime. The violence and action kept me watching it, the archetypes of characters remaining compelling interests as they grow away from the human relationships into more... vampire ones? It's a strangely intriguing show and worth watching, to at least get a chance to see whether you like it. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the level of Hellsing or Trinity Blood","review":"I must admit I haven't heard of Black Blood Brothers, despite having the whole Hellsing and Trinity Blood collection, until it appeared on my Amazon Vine mail. It's a little more juvenile than the aforementioned two despite stylized violence. Also, the characters are not quite as interesting and comes off as a little shallow. It may be argued that character development do take several episodes but from the first few episodes, the introduction didn't pique my curiosity to make me want to get the succeeding collections.Another thing, all of my above comments would've been made irrelevant if the animation was in the league of Ghost In The Shell or Naruto. But it's quite stilted and ordinary similar to those disposable anime/toy tie ins. Better wait for this on your cable channel, if it does make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda boring","review":"This is a very average anime movie. The animation is average, the storyline is average (and borderline boring), and the characters have average interest to them. The movie would be a good interests to anime fans that like vampires but to those that could care less about them, this is a boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting beginning","review":"I'm not a huge fan of anime (my knowledge of it is pretty much Speed Racer and Gatchaman), but I wanted to give this a try. The storyline is a battle against the vampires thing (like Blade), but the story is much deeper than that. While the storyline it tells comes to a partial conclusion, there are still many plot threads left open for the next chapters that follow. Also, since this deals with vampires there are a number of scenes that get fairly bloody, so this isn't necessarily for the kids. Still, the characters are interesting and there's definitely enough action to keep you watching and even wanting more when it's finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitched to kids, lacks poetic license explicitness","review":"This is another anime that has a good concept and material but surrenders its promise to the constraints of self-censorship to qualify as a kids movie. The idea of having a mutant race of child vampires disrupting the current order of things is a promising one, which could even be taken in some sexually explicit interesting directions, yet because of the producers' inhibitions and maybe also because of societal taboos, legal and otherwise, we the viewers lose out with a bland version of what might have been. This is a good example of why censorship is so insidious and destructive. Let parents decide what their children can watch, but allow a free market in expression so the more seasoned art connoisseurs can enjoy true art that is beautiful, ground-breaking and innovative, not rendered impotent and sterile for a narrow audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Those of us old enough to remember Speed Racer know just how bad badly done anime can be. I love animation but anime is a different breed of animal and I just don't see the point. Black Blood Brothers is about 2 brothers who are Black Bloods, there are also Red Bloods, as well as, Kowloon Children, a 3rd type of vampire.The music and grapics are extremely well done, thus the 2 stars. What I did take away from the series was a sense of a caste system, even in the vampire world. You have the old school vamps who seem to be revered, they are the Black Bloods, you have the newer group of vamps who are the Red Bloods and you have the Kowloon Children who are feared, despised, and avoided. What I didn't care for was not really understanding what was happening, even at the end of the first disc. It is obvious that the story is going to unwind slowly over the course of several discs, but this makes it hard to follow. The storyline left much to be desired also.All-in-all, this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely anime","review":"Like all good anime, Black Blood Brothers starts right in the middle of the action, not giving quite enough information to understand that first scene. Gradually, as this first DVD unfolds, bits and pieces of the missing story fill in, showing main characters who are flawed but powerful, and overshadowed by a violent past. The only ones who are untouched by those dark times are the children.The story is familiar in its general terms, but the characters are distinct individuals with powerful pasts. By the time the first DVD finishes, I'm addicted, plain and simple.The art is clear and beautiful, and the DVD quality is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and mediocre","review":"BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS, CHAPTER 1 is the definition of \\"average.\\" If you're an anime fan who will try anything once, you may get some enjoyment out of it; everyone else might as well give it a miss.First, the story: there's not an original thing in it. If you've watched HELSING, TRINITY BLOOD, and TRIGUN, and are also familiar with BLADE and ANGEL, there's probably not a thing here that's going to feel original. Overpowered heroes, chibi kids, girly girls, talks about vampire \\"bloodlines,\\" nonsensical fight scenes ... you name it. Typical anime, and terribly unimpressive.The animation is nothing to write home about, either. It's not awful, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Character designs are uninspired--a long-haired hero in a red trenchcoat, how avant-garde! It's basic studio-churned animation that, again, we've seen 100 times before.I doubt I'll ever seek out Chapter 2 of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little (silicon) grease will go a long way.","review":"This Olympus Silicon Grease is an item you don't want to be without.

This film is just raw and captivating (am I repeating myself?). It captures the gritty essence of street life and draws the viewer right into the middle of all the action as if just tagging along. There's no big plots or mind bending conspiracies... just a raw documentary like glimpse in the lives of some young adults in Brooklyn. I can't remember the last movie that drew me in like that EVER.

George is at a science museum on a class trip with children. The teacher is trying to teach them about rocks and minerals, and the children are all whining about how boring it is. George runs away from the group and climbs all over the skeleton of a dinosaur in a nearby room. He is scolded by a member of the museum staff (as right he should be!!!) but then the class catches up with him and the children are interested in the dinosaur bones. The story suggests that the only reason they are interested is because George is climbing on it!

It's just another rich girl story who has a famous father and doesn't do much of anything besides, shop, go to clubs and do drugs. I would skip reading the 226 page book and just watch a few episodes of The Simple Life and you'll be all caught up with Nicole and Paris Hilton's life.

Despite knowing much of the backstory, it was still fun reading about Chloe and the other people. Unlike many books I've read (regardless of genre), \\"The Truth About Diamonds\\" has some one-liners that just go to show how witty and genuine Nicole is. Granted, the book is light and definitely not something along the lines of Jane Austen or Kate Chopin (I'm reading \\"The Awakening\\" for an AP English class at the moment), but it's something that stands out and is a good read.I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The Truth About Diamonds\\" and am looking forward to reading more from Nicole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joy Behar said it best","review":"As Joy said on The View - \\"This book is so stupid, I can't believe it's not written in crayon.\\" Nicole Richie's 15 minutes are up. Please return to your regularly scheduled programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I really enjoyed this book - it seems as though Nicole is just trying to write what she knows, rather than give a dirty expose or attempting to make herself even more famous. If you are a fan of books like The Devil Wears Prada and other high-fashion, people-oriented novels, then give this one a try! I bet that you will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for her next novel!","review":"i loved nicole's book!keeps me wondering whether her fictional characters are real , like if nicole and paris were really ever bestfriends?! it did crush some positive things i saw in paris and nicole though, i always thought paris was so kool and her an dnicole were perfect togehter but that makes me sad that SIMPLE LIFE may have just being a fake. =( . but all in all, i like nicole better now. i want to see how paris handles this book and her view on it? i wonder if she reads it? welli hope nicole write another book and i hope paris does too (besides her 'how to write a diary' one! that is put together so not thoughtful! just to complete with nicole i think. )i hope nicole reads this maybe and does write another book! because you rock like diamonds and pearls nicole!! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"****Warning Spoilers****In Nicole's first book (hopefully not last), she tells the story about Chloe Parker who was adopted when she was a little girl on Prince's 1984 purple tour. Sound familar? Chloe grows up in clubs dancing to the music. She starts doing drugs at age thirteen and is thrown into a reality commerical with her \\"fake friend\\" Simone in her early twenties. At the beginning of the reality show, Chloe decides to check herself into drug rehab and comes out sober and fifteen pounds heavier.Anway, not to spoil the rest of the book, let's just say after a major gossip scandal she gets the biggest surprise of her life.I really liked this book, Nicole can really write and her book only has a few pictures unlike a certain person who's \\"autobiography\\" is filled with nothing but pictures and quotes.\`\`Katrina"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that I was expecting great literature, but...","review":"I read it in about a day with extremely long breaks otherwise it would have taken me about one hour and a half. And I'm not a particularly fast reader.It's so predictable, and soo slow! I wasn't expecting anything special, just some kind of trashy novel about people with nothing to do. That's what it is, but it's flat and unexciting. It's a real pity, it had potential.All in all- okay if you have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun weekend read","review":"This book certainly isn't important or literary, but if you read People or Life a Style, you'll enjoy it. The plot focuses on Chloe, one of the two girls chosen to be the new spokepeople for Magdalena, a makeup line similar to MAC. They are the stars of reality-style commercials, and through their trials, Chloe ends up finding herself and growing up. Even though the character comparisons are pretty transparent (Chloe as Nicole, Simone as Paris, DJ Ray as DJ AM), I thought Nicole did an excellent job as a first time novelist of pop fiction. Her pacing is really impressive, and I had a hard time putting it down. Even though I never felt super connected to the main character, I still enjoyed the book. All in all, a fun light read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"i was very excited to read this cos i thought it would dish out on a lot of \\"gossip\\" about the stars. it did, however, it seemed like a very pointless story. no intruige into the main character and the fact that nicole herself was the narrator made it worse. i suggest if you can borrow it from someone, do it and dont waste money on a purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your only encouraging her","review":"If you choose to read this book you should strongly look at yourself, your values, and why you would promote/encourage this untalented bimbo to take your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the world coming to...","review":"when people who are simply \\"friends\\" of someone famous have the nerve to write a book?

Sure, she did pay a lot of money to have some one else write it for her and I am sure that she didn't even read the whole thing.

It was cute, sarcastic, and totally Nicole's style. The story of Chloe Parker was the story of Nicole Richie, with a few changes, of course.

Paris Hilton's music is burning up the charts, so now Nicole is trying to get a recording contract.I think both girls are cute but why on earth does Nicole now look like a shorter version of Paris Hilton? Good grief, she even has adopted the same poses as Paris. I guess my point is, I'd like to see Nicole do more original things instead copying Paris Hilton. Writing is not Nicole's forte, we can tell that much from reading her book, but she seems like a fun person and I hope she can find her niche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"Thank G-d I borrowed this book from a friend instead of wasting $25 on this load of garbage!

The books amazing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, lousy, and pointless","review":"Well, may be not pointless because I guess she made some money off me, right? I always found Nicole to be the nicer of her and Paris. But wow, was this book awful or what? I hope she doesn't try to do another one, becuase there wasn't much to this one except a lot of nothing. Try to figure out what this book is supposed to be about, because I couldn't. And after a while, I just stopped caring, and now I'm not sure why I'm bothering to even write this.

I recommend it for young adults and older!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and badly written","review":"So I'm really not super picky about books, I like both light and heavy reads and knew this would be 'a day at the beach' type of book... but it's horrible. I've never written a bad book review until now. I hated the book mainly because I never had any attachment to characters or cared what happened to them... bad character development. Also, if the book is written from her voice, but she's also two characters... that confused me a bit and is a very bad way to tell a story. Overall there was nothing in the book that caught my attention. The story was boring. The characters are dull. The writing is really bad.Do not waste your money. One of the worst book I've ever read and I'm not even exaggerating at all.. it was that boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story telling","review":"I bought this book to see how Nicole writes and I absolutely love her style.

I completely recommend this book for some leisure time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of CRAP I have ever read.","review":"I had to FORCE myself to get through this book! It was a struggle to keep going because it is so self indulgent, poorly written and the story line is lackluster as well. I picked it up, because I like Richie's style, but when it comes to her books DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Seriously. I wish I could get back the time I spent reading this book to instead have read something actually worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Novel","review":"When I first saw this in a book store I was Like Do I really want to read this?, in the ead I did end up buying it and I read it in one day, it was that good.This story is about Chloe Parker's struggle with fame, drugs, and romance. I found it to be a page-turner and always interested in what was going to happen next. I was actually shocked at how much I enjoyed this book.It gives you an insight into the live of people in the spotlight and what can really go wrong if you don't have people in your life to keep you grounded. I've read reviews from other people saying it was badly written and wasn't that great, but there where just as many good reviews as there where bad ones.Really enjoyed reading that novel,I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Nicole Richie's but also anyone else who is looking for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Interesting but Disturbing Adventure","review":"The book focuses on the use of electronic implants to control one's thoughts and reactions.

Unfortunately, Mr Delgado has very menacing intentions in other areas. He is one who believes in the administration of implants to individuals for behaviour modification. The intention to psychologically abuse anyone who deviates from societies norm. An interesting great question, who decides who is wierd and how do you define normal?

Anything that might have worked was just sunk by the combination of the awfulness of the multiple problems.

I managed to sit through the whole thing and nothing can save this one from being one of the worst films I have ever seen.

This film seems to think that those are sufficient elements to define a quality movie. Other than sex and nudity, all other required elements for a quality movie are painfully lacking. The plot is ridiculous, the acting unforgivably bad and the production quality is grating to the eyes/ears. I am a huge fan of low budget and B horror, but common among all those films is a decent plot, decent acting, decent production values. This film is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!!!","review":"this is a fun and original take on the 80's slasher movie. it comes in at about 75 minutes, so there's little filler, and though it is working within the constraints of the genre, it finds ways of being inventive so that you don't get the feeling that you've seen this one before. the production values are atrociously bad, as has been noted by other reviewers, and if that's important to you, avoid this one. believe it or not, though, this movie's better than the horror-comedy garbage hollywood has been throwing at us, largely because it doesn't take itself so seriously. if you enjoy b-movies, i think you'll not only enjoy this one, but it'll even surprise you a few times.

In my area - epidemiology - we do not report standard errors, we report confidence intervals.

This cdg should play on any cd player unless maybe you have an old one that was made in the 1980s or it maybe needs cleaned. To see the karaoke lyrics you need a cdg player.

I would rank the quality as high or higher than any iPod speakers I have heard/used.Even with the volume at a low to moderate level the output is loud, clear and has decent range. Use in an office, or even a large room is possible. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, but still want to enjoy sound quality I would recommend these Altec Lansing speakers. Great as a gift, or for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I was replacing a damaged IM7, and figured to give this fairly highly rated newer Altec unit a try. The smaller size and built in rechargeable battery make it easy to take around, although lack of a secure ipod cradle preclude listening to the ipod on the go. The FM radio can be handy, and was not featured on the IM7. It's a handsome unit, perfect for an office desk, and the balanced quality sound belies it's size. I do miss the higher horsepower sound of IM7, in part fueled by the sub-woofer built into it, as well as the adjustability for bass and treble levels, not available on this unit. (The ipod's generic settings menu don't cut it for me.) All in all, a nice unit, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room filler/Bose DESTROYER","review":"Amazing speakers. Use them at parties. They aren't going to \\"blow the windows out\\" but they'll impress your friends and family. The portability is a fantastic plus for such small, powerful speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product at a great price","review":"I have been very pleased with this product. My husband and 5yr old keep trying to take it away from me. It has great sound, is so portable, and compact. I wanted something convenient to take outside and this works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"The Altec Lansing has terrific sound and having a FM radio feature is an added plus. Setting up the product to hold, charge, and play an MP3 player is easy. The remote to select the mode, volume control and staion selection is also a plus, and the long battery system is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altec Lansing iM600","review":"After reading many positive customer reviews about this unit, I placed an order for one. Being on the West Coast, I assumed it would take 1 1/2 to 2 weeks to receive it. I was pleasantly surprised to have it in hand within 6 days! I've used the iM600 for about a month now and I totally agree with the majority. It could use a bit more bass, but for it's size and price, the sound quality is outstanding. The sound quality is best when using the SFX mode. When playing it indoors, there are no issues. However, when outdoors, I notice some distortion with the volume \\"cranked up.\\" But, it's no more than what one would expect for a unit this size. The battery life is really good. I get over 4 hours of continuous use on a fully charged battery. I wouldn't hesitate at all to buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value for money","review":"Very good sound and options (subwoofer output, external input, radio).What's missing is a transport bag/pouch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"It never worked and was difficult to return to them.

I was trying to use it with the new iPod nano (4th generation), but the unit *won't charge* the new iPod. Worse, the iPod will discharge very quickly if I leave it the dock! This \\"feature\\" makes the unit almost unusable for me.Additional flaw is that the remote won't work if you turn OFF the unit. That is, you cannot remotely turn the unit ON. Again, this \\"feature\\" almost defeats the benefit of having a remote control in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly as advertised!","review":"Amazon delivers again!

It would not change songs, forwards or back, would not pause, and did not turn the Ipod off when it turned off the iM600 . Nothing in the manual addressed whether or not the remote was intended to do these functions. But if not, why would they refer to it as a full-function remote?Is that why they say to sit within three feet, to reach the Ipod?I returned it to Future Shop the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable, works on 220V and sounds great!","review":"This unit has all the features I need and is great for travel with the batteries and its fold up design. Radio works good for me. Over all a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect system for listening","review":"I spent hours shopping online for a system that would allow me to listen to my iPod in my living room. I wasn't concerned with portability - I just wanted something that was unobtrusive and still had great sound. Somewhere online I read a review that said this new unit had great sound. It does. Inside what is about a 12\\" wide by 6\\" high sophisticated black box, the highs are very clear and the bass is right on. (It has a fm option that I tried just to see if it is working but other than that, I haven't given it a real listen.) I paid about $150 and am very happy with this. Easy to set up - although you have to be intuitive as the directions suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"sooooo portable; big sound","review":"For some reason (and not paying real attention to the measurements), I thought this item would be skinnier and generally a bit smaller. But that said, it's really light, and really portable, and I've been using the hell out of it while helping someone move out and then in to a new apartment, not having a stereo set up and all. It does provide excellent sound, and the little remote is fantastic, and it really does everything I was looking for in an ipod speaker system. Turn the volume up past 20 and it really fills a room. It's about the size of a thick book, but not as heavy. The battery lasts a long time. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... while it lasted.","review":"This product lasted for a little over a year before I started to notice malfunctions. The power button and other function buttons such as \\"Source\\" and \\"Volume + and -\\" stopped working soon afterwards. Despite the advertisement, it was actually unable to fit ipods and iphones snuggly without the purchase of (separate) docks. Very disappointing for the amount of money that was invested in this product. Warrantee only covered for one year. What a waste of $!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AC Cord Failed after 1 year","review":"Loved this unit until the AC cord connection in the back of the unit no longer made proper contact with the unit and ceased charging the battery. For a while, I taped it into position but eventually this stopped working as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless after only 2.5 years!","review":"Bought this product new from Amazon on 2/19/2008. By mid-October 2010, all the controls had stopped working--no response to any of the buttons (on/off, volume, source, radio, etc.). Some days it would turn on as normal, play part of the playlist in my iPod, then suddenly stop and could not be re-started playing anything. Some days it would stop playing the iPod, but not shut off. Never relied on the rechargeable battery, always used the plug-in connection.Very disappointing. Paid $109 for this unit. It was quite good while it lasted--good sound, good bass, very nice looking unit. But two and a half years of service is just not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Bought this for my son for college, initially sound quality was great, in fact his brothers would use it for outdoor parties etc. Then something went amiss and the the unit kept shutting down. Tried to troubleshoot and that did not work. It is now in garbage :-( So, it only lasted about 1 year. Looking for another and hope it lasts longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"delicate","review":"the unit is flimsy and written instructions were poor; sometimes it would charge my I touch and sometimes it would not. It had difficulty adapting between I touch and I pods and now, seems to have given up entirely (have had it for about a year). Sound quality was adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not support Nano 4th generation","review":"I researched extensively before buying the Altec Lansing IM600. I absolutely loved the sound that came from the unit. It was easy to use and gave a nice, rich, room-filling sound.I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that the unit does not support the new 4th generation Nano. It will not charge the 4G Nano and the controls don't always work smoothly. You will not find this documented in the online description, nor even in the user's manual you receive with the unit. The only place you will find this out is if you download the online manual from Altec Lansing.If you have a 4G Nano, pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in a week","review":"It lasted one week.

By the reviews it recieved it seemed like the top of the line for a reasonable price. This is not the case. I recieved the iM600 and it looked great, it was exactly what i wanted. But when i plugged it in, it just didn't work. There was absolutely nothing. I tried everything, I called Altec Lansing customer support, which was a complete waste of time. They were useless, no help at all. So i returned the item to Amazon, which was very easy, and got my refund. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outstanding functionality, poor durability","review":"I really liked this product because the sound quality was good. It was easy to use, and it had an FM tuner. I have no complaints about the product while it was alive.Unfortunately, it had a tendency to break. The first one lasted for about 1.5 months. The second one lasted a little longer (2 months). Luckily the return policy at Best Buy is outstanding. They allowed me to exchange the items after they broke both times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Great","review":"The sound is great for it's size, the battery lasts forever, and the digital FM tuner works great as well. Only thing missing is an alarm clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit for the Price","review":"Bought the Bose portable first but returned it for the iM600. The Bose does have superior sound (it certainly should at $400!!) but it's only noticeable at or near full volume. The iM600 does have some distortion if you push the volume to the max. But factor in the FM radio and the iM600 is a much better buy. Only consider the Bose if you like your music loud or you will be using it often outside where you may need more volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance!!","review":"I bought this product after about a month of reviewing. I chose about 10 different iPod compatible stereos that would meet my needs, then reviewed all the pros and cons in both the \\"product descriptions,\\" but mainly in the \\"customer reviews.\\"I finally narrowed it down to the \\"Altec Lansing inMotion iM600!\\" It was a well-deserved choice!!I mainly wanted something I could slip into my backpack and bring with me to work. This stereo folds up neatly, is not heavy, is compact but with a big sound! It's got different adapters included to fit all sizes of iPod (mine is a 20 gig) and plays on both a rechargeable battery or a plug-in. The only thing to make it better would be some sort of padded case in which to transport it.But,all in all, this is a great sounding, durable product to which I've gotten many compliments, and the price is unbeatable!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Battery...","review":"I think this is a great sounding system for such a small form factor. Not as dynamic as the Bose system but can fit easily into a suitcase. The FM radio is not as good as the iPal (I also own one) at pulling in weak stations but the iPod dock and remote make up for it. Now for the bad news: the battery refused to hold a charge even after 2 days on AC. I got a RMA from Altec Lansing ( I should have returned it to Amazon) and returned it to the company. One and a half weeks later I called them (Altec Lansing) and was told that I was on a fulfillment list for backorders: the item was unavailable without an estimated due date. So now I paid for an item that I can't use and don't know when I'll get it. I will not buy Altec Lansing products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Touch 2G doesn't charge on dock","review":"When I docked my new iPod Touch 2nd generation, the screen showed \\"Charging is not supported with this accessory\\".

We take it on vacation with us and can play all our iPod music. Sounds great and is not too big so I can pack it in our checked luggage. Remote is great. The ability to play disconnected from AC is nice too as it does have a built in rechargeable speaker. Perfect for what we need it for. Only down side is that it doesn't charge an iPod Touch 2 generation which we now have. It plays the music, just doesn't charge. Later model now charges 2G iPod Touch and we may buy a new model as we are very happy with this one. FM tuner also is nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SYSTEM!","review":"This speaker is everything it says.

The unit has been returned to Altec Lansing for replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Purchase","review":"I bought mine a while back for less than $150.What I like about it:-Portability-Chargable battery-Very good sound quality and volume for size-Radio & SFX functions-has AUX/composite/Subwoofer input/outputs-has different docks for different iPods that are interchangeable-remoteAlso, when you're charging the device or have it plugged in, it'll also charge the iPod. I recommend it for children's rooms, dorm rooms, even outdoor get-togethers. As a party device it's OK.Cons:-Remote connectivity is rather annoying since it only connects at certain angles-Battery doesn't last that long...only a couple of hours at half the maxOverall, a decent piece of machinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but.......","review":"I have a 3 year old Altec Lansing inMotion which weighs half as much as this new one and uses AA batteries when I travel. I will keep it for travel, as the Im600 is very heavy..plus if you are in an area where you can't charge the battery, you are out of luck with the Im600 as the battery is built in! I plan to use the new Im600 around the pool, for parties elsewhere and if the power goes out. It sounds great and having a nice built in FM radio is a plus. However, my much smaller older unit is perfect for travel and I will keep it too. The best of both worlds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD PRODUCT","review":"Great Sound even at higher volumes. Fills a room and more. It's a sleek design and looks good too. Comes with a mini remote and there's an adaptor port for different modles of mp3 players. I bought this for my boyfriend who travels. However, it'a a little larger than I pictured and probably not the best for the kind of traveling he does (he's in tents, not hotels). He's happy to have it, anyway. It would be great for hotel traveling or of course visiting friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Speakers for your Ipod","review":"The item arrived in brand new condition.

Very versatile, light, excellent sound, good FM reception.If the Bose system had had an FM radio I would have bought that, since the sound on that system is by far the best I have heard on a small system. It's a lot bigger and bulkier though and does not have the rechargeable battery which is a very nice feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec Lansing Like new","review":"I purchased a \\"Like New\\" version of this item from Down2bizniz. I received multiple non or partially working or older model units over months of e-mails and frustration (78 e-mails, I saved them). I finally gave up and took a unit that worked (somewhat)but had no battery power. This was the worse on-line buying experience ever. By the time I got a partially working unit it was too late (3 month limit) to submit seller feedback. Customer service always responded, but all I received was junk or older models than advertised. Who has the time for this? Spend the extra money on a new one rather than on postage returning junk and avoid this seller. I wish I could tell you more about this unit, but I do not believe it ever worked right. It certainly did not work for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is mediocre","review":"I bought this unit based on the reviews here at Amazon.Frankly, I am suprised to see all these rave reviews.I wasn't impressed with the sound at all. It was medicore at best.In addition, the remote control doesn't seem to work, and it has been documented. I have tested this unit with my ipod touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unimpressed","review":"I'm not an audiophile, or terribly picky by any stretch, but this product totally failed to impress once it was turned on. The slightest bass (not gangsta rap or hip hop or 1812 overture)caused the whole unit to vibrate and the distortion was terrible. Sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Battery & Volume Problems with Nano","review":"The sound on this unit is very nice, and the controls are easy to use but other than that it's a total lemon. Unfortunately, the battery on ours stopped holding any charge at all so the unit must remain plugged in to use it. That's a major downsize since we liked to move it around the house without the hassle. Also, on our Gen 3 nano, it causes a problem where the volume just goes up and up until it reaches the maximum. The nano does this even after it's unplugged from the dock until you issue a reset command. This of course loses some of the settings so we only use the dock with our Gen 2 nano at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs reset button","review":"I bought this product based largely on the positive review by MacWorld. When it arrived it did not function. Following the manual, I removed the battery cover and unplugged the rechargeable battery to reset the controls. This worked, but then after one round trip with my laptop in a backpack in the car (not very adverse conditions), it did not work once again. The bigger problem with this is that the screws for the battery compartment are very small -- my not young eyes have trouble seeing them and a small jeweler's phillips screwdriver is needed -- and they are difficult to remove. Given this issue, Altec Lansing should have incorporated a reset button. I am disappointed. This product is not living up to its claimed portability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Stereo","review":"This system was OK but too many of my songs -- especially the operatic and classical ones -- sounded distorted. I, therefore, had to send it back. I do not recommend it if you care about true sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be perfect with a clock!","review":"I reviewed and tried out numerous iPod speaker systems prior to buying the iM600 and found that, for the money, this is a really good system. Two things would make it perfect for me - if it had a clock as I use it in the morning when I'm getting ready for work and if it had a carrying case to take on trips with me. Other than that, I'm very happy with it! It's got a great sound (even when playing the radio) and I can dock my 80gb iPod with the case on which I love since I'm usually rushing in the morning. That way, I can just grab it off the dock without having to put the case back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic value for money!","review":"I bought this after extensive research and specifically wanting a portable item that I could take to the beach but also had a built in radio. Its nice neat slimline size is also an added bonus. I must admit, the sound quality is much better than I expected; my husband bought some surround speakers to go with his TV and I think the sound quality is as good as them and they were way more money!! ($$$!) For a little machine it really delivers really fantastic, crisp quality sound.Any purchaser will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I purchased this item about 1 year ago. Starting around the 2 month mark, it began to lose all my radio presets, despite frequent recharging. This occurred about once per month for a while, then once every two weeks. Now it won't hold my presets at all unless the unit is plugged in at all times. On top of that, the remote no longer works (and yes, I changed the wafer battery). The radio sounded good when it was working, but it's very poorly constructed. There must be better options. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loved it !","review":"Bought this for my wife's office and she loved it!4 reasons to buy:1. Price - better value over the Bose dock.2.

Nice find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laptop Compatibility","review":"When I was looking to purchase an iPod dock I really wanted something versatile enough to use with my laptop. The reviews here were great and very helpful, however noone seemed to comment on compatibility with a laptop. I tried Radio Shack's \\"customer service\\" twice and couldn't get a straight answer. Altec Lansing's site only gave diagrams (the universal language). I posted an inquiry on forums. . .nothing. So I wanted to let any other unsure customers know: this item works very well as a laptop speaker. When I placed my order I took a leap & added a double ended 3.5mm 1/8\\" cable - it works perfectly. AFTER receiving the unit I realized there is a port for a mini-usb connection. But I'm happy with my setup. The unit has very good sound. I live in an approx. 900 sq. ft. apt. and the sound is very good. If I go into another room the sound is still pretty rich. I would recommend this to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money if you have a nano","review":"I once swore by this product. I bought it for recreation and for work since I do massage and would bring it on client calls. The sound was great and was extremely portable.After a couple of months it stopped taking a charge through the wall adapter. So I bought a replacement. Strike one.The specs say it is compatible for the nano but it IS NOT. The nano is too small and light and so I had to always place some kind of prop to keep it pushed forward so the system would recognize it and would play. There is something that comes with the nano that is designed to alleviate this but unfortunately that didn't help either. Over months of this propping the \\"motherboard\\" on the system got ruined and now it won't play ipods since it ruined the connection. I am VERY dissapointed since this was a total waste of +$120 !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for ipods","review":"I bought this for a Sansa view--and I'm glad I did. The sound is remarkable. It's light weight and easily portable. The FM tuner works quite well. The remote is a great feature, especially once I worked up the nerve to remove the film over the face of the remote (it impeded switch action a little). The rechargeable battery--what a great feature. It seems to last at least as long as Altec-Lansing says it does. While not heavy on bass, it is there... with the custom EQ on the Sansa you can punch it up a bit. High end response is terrific. Vocals clear but not brassy. Sounds especially sweet when my computer's audio is run through it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This product goes anywhere.

When I received it and connected my ipod to it, I was surprised with the sound, which sounded really tinny. I then played a song that starts with a bass line, and I discovered that the bass was not reproduced at all! The song only started playing when the other instruments started.It goes without saying that I returned it immediately for a refund. This may be acceptable to some people whose ears are not well trained to hearing music, but to me it is unacceptable. I used to have a Creative Playdock, and the sound was heaps better, to the point where you could use it outside for a party.

Great sound, handles all my music (hip-hop, reggae, latin) cleanly and with bass. SFX feature makes it sound bigger than it is. I really picked it out because it's one of the FEW (almost the only one) travel speaker systems on the market where you can keep your IPOD in its protective case and still sit it on the dock. My 60GB Video Ipod has a soft InCase on it with a built-in belt clip and I can still shimmy it on the dock of the iM600...making sure I don't keep scratching my Ipod going in and out of its sleeve. I'm probably going to get a portable battery (Tekkeon MP3450) to keep it charged while on the road or camping for long periods of time. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Contrary to the description, this is not a clock radio.

The battery charge holds for a whole day of swimming. I connect my Sirius stilleto(I just needed to get a connector cable) and enjoy satellite radio with no outlet needed! The size is very compact and easy to take wherever you go. Works perfect with the ipod classic and nano. Charges them too when connected to an outlet. The sound is not Bose quality but very good considering the cost of the product. Highly recommend this product - great buy for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better that bose!","review":"Altec Lansing inMotion iM600 Portable Audio Speaker SystemGreat product. Easy to use. Portable and also works with your computer as a speaker system. Great sound. I also have the Bose iPod speakers and prefer the iM600. Sound quality is just as good as the Bose, the price is much lower and you can't use the Bose with your computer, only with the iPod. iM600 also has portablity with long life rechargeable battery, which the Bose does not have. Definitely a better product at a better price."},{"rating":"2","title":"iM600 portable audio sytem for iPod","review":"I am impressed with the quality of this product, good bang for the buck. Music is crystal clear, remote control comes in handy. I would have liked a little more control over the bass instead of spending extra for a separate system. Overall, I happy with the product, it has met my need"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},N={key:1};function j(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const O=d(B,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-d658717f"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/47.md","filePath":"glossary/47.md"}'),H={name:"glossary/47.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
