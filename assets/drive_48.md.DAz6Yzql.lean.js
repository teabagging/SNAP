This performance was one of the last to keep the older tradition of recording just the music and leaving the speaking out. Fussy modern purists may reject it for that reason, but for me Klemperer's interpretation and the magnificent singing win out. I have listened to this very recording scores of times and have always found something new and inspiring with each hearing. Klemperer's tempos are just right -- not the too slow speeds he fell into, for example, in his Beethoven symphonies. This recording strikes just the right balance between the serious and the frivilous. It is a joy to listen to this outstanding opera performed with such energy and beauty.For those who MUST have the full dialogue, I recommend the performance by Mackerras on Teldec. For all others, you will find both depth and beauty in this version by Klemperer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance with character and depth.","review":"Performance with real atmosphere and humour.

I'm also a fan of composers such as Christopher Rouse, for example, and Joe Leniado Chira is my cousin. Modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore, demand more of and nurture. We afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre. Meanwhile, John Adams has impressed me with this disc. The Chairman Dances is my favorite. I can just see Chairman Mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this, and Tricky Dick feeling jealous.

It may have been the extremely over power odor or the oil soaking into our systems and actually messing with our equilibrium.

They're making money and having a good time and that's why they made this album yet this album is about hatred and evil, which doesn't make sense. No inspiration, no new material, no originality, the most disappointing album I bought in 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves all the praise it has got.","review":"First, a confession: for the most part, this album was my first introduction to really listening to KoRn. I had heard a few of their songs in the past and had placed them in the dead nu-metal camp in my eyes. For some reason though, I thought I should give them a chance and since Untouchables is more recent than their earlier stuff, perhaps it would be different. I was very, very surprised.This album is so creative and so different from the nu-metal genre, shedding away the hard-to-digest rapping in lieu for more melodic vocal melodies (which is something this album is exceedingly good for). The occasional programmed drum beats over the rest of the band are done to great effect and the subtle synths used behind many of the tracks are fantastically layered.I was left with one clear impression after hearing this album; Untouchables is almost hauntingly vampy. Those in the vampire subculture would find much to be interested in with this album. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't like it at first....","review":"....so it stayed in my CD case for awhile.

Good bass blaring guitars, loud and bassy! Just a great song all around. It's kind of slow, but good nonetheless.\\"Make Believe\\" is a bit faster, not much, just a bit, still a great song with some really cool sound effects and stuff like that.The songs get progressively faster, not by much, just very very slowly, until we get to \\"Wake Up Hate\\", the speed is noticeably faster, and the song simply just ROCKS!!!!The CD ends with a remix of \\"Here to Stay\\" which is a very odd remix...but I still like it. It's kind of quirky, but good."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever","review":"i think this is the best single ever to be made not to mention the amazing video absolutly amazing I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music with a message lacking","review":"The music is (as always for KoRn) incredible. But there is something about this album that is very lacking. There is no message. All of the songs have the same message. I feel that the whole album is one big f**k you. Once you have heard their first single- here to stay- you have heard all of the album's message.The music is still very good. The 7-string guitars still pound awaay. David's drumming is still incerdible. The bass riffs are still inventive. Jonathin's vocals are still great, and, in my opinion, better than before. All of the riffs are new and dont sound like bad, recycled Black Sabbath.If the album had more of a message I would say that it is the greatest KoRn album yet, as well as one of the best new albums out. But personally, I find that a message is needed to make a top-notch album. But still musically great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak cd","review":"This is a weak cd.

I have been a KoRn fan for years, and have never been disappointed with a CD. However, I was extremely pleased with this one. It goes full circle back to the original sound, but in the same nothing like the first CD. The sound is totally new for them, but you can feel the drive like they had back in the beginning. Jonathans vocals are so much better than they ever have been, and the bands music sounds tighter than hell. Beat It Upright is one of my favorite tracks on the CD. The first single, Here To Stay is an awesome song, but the rest of the CD is just as good. There are not a whole lot of CDs that I can play all the way through without skipping at least a song or two, but this one I could play over and over.

It is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have been a KoRn fan ever since Life is Peachy,and when I opened the cd case to Untouchables and put it in my cd player, I immeadiately knew it was excelent.

My favorite songs on Untouchables would definately have to be \\"Thoughtless\\", \\"Embrace\\", and \\"Make Belive\\". But I love the ENTIRE cd. Ive already recommended it to ALL of my friends. Me and my friend camped out infront of a Best Buy two days before Untouchables was released,luckily it was located next to a Taco Bell and a Target. Untouchables was well worth the wait.

I guess if your Issues fan get this cd otherwise please dont waste your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my fav. cd and it is the best 1 that korn has made","review":"hey wud up, if u r a korn fan, hard rock fan, u have 2 get this cd there is not a bad song on it. and i love how jonathan exspresses himself in all of his songs. and juss the how he makes the songs r so tyte anyway if u r thinking about getting this cd dont think about it juss get it u will b very happy wit it"},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn KoRRupted!","review":"KoRn's claim for Untouchables was that it was to be the hardest cd they'd done to date. After listening to it, it must be the hardest to make and not the hardest sounding. It doesn't measure up to their self-titled debut cd (often refered to as the definative new metal cd...I agree!!!!!!). True, it has its merits. Here To Stay is by far that hardest rocking track on this cd and stands well on it's own, but the rest is more of the popish-rock variety...I heard the phrase, \\"DMX on acid\\" and honestly feel this is accurate...If anything, it's a mellower sound than you expect from Davis and crew, but Silvera's drumming is radical, strong and out there, as well as Munky and Head's guitars and Fieldy's thrumming bass. More of an achievement for the sound people and musicians than the composing. Kewl, but not stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"what sick puppets Korn has become","review":"With their fifth release Korn moves further away from what made them great...the pure emotion of thier music and lyrics...davis's voice doesnt have the hard edge that he did in Korn and Life Is Peachy, they try to show they are the same band but fall way short, and even worse...they try to show how much theyve grown by having Davis actaully sing songs...something he should not do...i write this review not as someone who dislikes korn at all...in fact they were my favorite band for many years...if you want to hear GOOD Korn listen to Life is Peachy and Korn...and if you crave that emotion i highly recommend Daddy on Korn...if your favorite Korn album is Follow the Leader...go ahead and buy this album...if you arent one of the millions who joined korn after that album and heard them in the beginning...DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM...KORN IS DEAD"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is korn's masterpiece","review":"in my opinion this is jonathan davis breakthrough record.I havealways been a fan of korn i think this is the record that provesthat jonathan davis can sing .Unlike past records that mostly consist of crazed whispering or raged screaming this one he actually has good vocals and really cool medolic choruses.but itstill includes some screaming and jibberish but without that it wouldnt be korn.so if you have been a past korn fan this record will make a much bigger fan i really recommend you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Badass as always","review":"Korns new album is one of their best. I'm a little partial to \\"Life is Peachy,\\" but this one just shows how they wont let anybody stand in their way. They wont let all these poser bands discourage them from making a new sound. I'm sure in the coming weeks we will hear of some new bands coming out the woodwork saying how Korn inspired them. I mean its cool to have bands and singers that inspire you, but for the love of god, you need to have a sound of your own. I'm kind of contradicting myself by saying some of these new bands are posers cause i kinda like some of them. I guess my views on these things kind of vary from day to day. But one thing i'm sure of is that \\"Untouchables\\" is a great cd, and Korn is the best band out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"they have done better","review":"i think that korn's new cd is an ok cd but i know that their past cds have been much better. i think that all the songs sound to much alike and that they didn't have enough differences between songs. i will still like korn but i miss the old stuff.~sonia~"},{"rating":"2","title":"The TLC Has Paid Off","review":"KoRn once said that their odd numbered CDs were their best ones, KoRn, Follow the Leader, and now Untouchables. Well, this certainly holds true for this CD, a brand-spanking new explosion of anger, spite and all those wonderful things that KoRn sings about.The CD is on the whole much heavier than 1999's Issues, but also manages to be much deeper, as Jonathan Davis' (much improved) vocals ring true with more raw emotion than ever.The guys say that they have worked hard on getting this one just right, and have put a lot of TLC into this one. In a world werecelebrities often couldn't care less about their fans, its nice to see that someone still comes through for the people that got them where they are. Good Job, Guys!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To The \\"Old\\" KoRn???","review":"I've listened to KoRn for forever. I love em, but what the heck happened to ya?

The first time I listened to it, I was very disappointed. All of the songs seemed to sound the same as the previous ones. But as I listened to it more and more I noticed how good it really is. You have to give it a few listens before you can get into it. This certainly isn't anything like issues or follow the leader, it's more like their first album (except this time around they know what they're doing). There are many hard, heavy and melodic songs like Embrace and Bottled Up Inside, and almost every track has beautiful melody over the chorus. There are still a couple of tracks that I do not like (Make Believe, Beat It Upright & Wake Up Hate), for they lack the melody that makes this cd good. I just think this is by far the best album KoRn has made, but the most hard to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"r.l.gordon on Untouchables","review":"I have been following KoRn since their early days in bakersfield and I have to say this is what I've been waiting for! This album has it all: The heavy 7 string guitars, pounding drums, and more. The most impressive part is the vocals by Jonathan Davis. Searing, catchy, big sounding, heavy, sad-like, this album is a must have for any KoRn fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"uhhhhh, i dunno i'm bored","review":"they are untouchable in the fact that no one can sell that many records and be that bad. it's tough being horrible musicians and huge rock stars aye? well, life is peachy ain't it? -hardy har har"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best","review":"This is not just one of Korn's best CDs, but one of the best CDs released thus far. Korn's flawless transition from Issues to Untouchables is, well, untouchable. The Korn fans wanted a heavier album, the band was more than happy to give it to them. Untouchables is an experience to say the least, I have listened to it at least 10 times already and I got it on Tuesday. Music making at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untouchables is awesome!","review":"Hey, I think Korn's new cd Untouchables is really really awesome. I think a lot of Korn fans will agree. I have waited a long time for this cd to come out and I feel it was worth the wait. Everyone has been saying that Korn sux when they heard Issues and i think that was a great cd too. Well I think this cd will change everyones mind.

Its one of the most amazing cd's ive evr heard. Track after track is just one mind-blowing song after another. The cd is everything what KoRn said it would be.I couldnt expct more from the best band in the world. They deffinatly deserve all the credit and fame they get. Those boys of KoRn worked ther [behinds] off (espeicly David,playing with his healing wrist) and they should be just as proud of themselves and their 5 miracle as I am. \\"Untouchables\\" is most deffinatly the BEST cd of 2002 and will continue to be the best cd around until KoRn relases their 6th album, the follow up to \\"Untouchables\\". I know I alreay cant wait for that great day to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak.","review":"It actually took me about a week to listen to this all the way through. I found it very dull.

Its been over 2 and a half years since there last cd - \\"issues\\", its noteworthy that there newest drop of a cd \\"untouchables\\" is a mix between there last 4 cd's, but its a good mix. Mr. Davis is back with the rockin lyrics and everything seems to blend perfectly. If your a fan of Korn then BUY this, there 1st single \\"here to stay\\" is off-the-hook and there are many songs where Davis actually sings on the cd, but it sounds very good in a korn-hardcore way. After all Korn is the band to introduce heavy rock with bands like linkin park, slipknot and so on to follow, so all in all a VERY good cd, pick it up, its a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn, great cd, everything I expected","review":"Even upon driving to best buy to purchase this cd today, I was exited, the packaging itself is very appealing, I was blown away by this cd, even though J.D (vocalist of Korn) said it was the heaviest they had done, the music flows chilling you all along, it is \\"dramatic\\" as well as articulate and well done, the best tracks (my opinion) are \\"HATING\\" the title doesnt define the song, it is very emotional, but more just expressing the vocalists feelings, by it today"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge KoRn fan, but honestly, they've gone majorly downhill since the days of Follow The Leader. They exploded onto the scene with their self-titled debut. Jonathan made it clear that KoRn was here to say (oh, the irony). But, honestly, each album carries less of the original, which is rather depressing. They've gone soft as far as music, though the lyrics are pretty good. I think it's time for Jonathan and the guys to return to the old sound or just put down their instruments and walk away with what little dignity they have left."},{"rating":"1","title":"--------------------------------------","review":"There is nothing good to say about this album.

Jon blew out his voice back in 98 when follow the leader came out and hes been singing like a sissy ever since. If you can \\"relate\\" to this album because you get beat up or harrassed its because you listen to garbage like this. Wake up Hate is horrible, i really cant even grasp the reason why a decent band would put out garbage like this.

I was dissapointed because I thought Korn could have done a lot better. I loved all their other CD's. Well Issues was ok, I wouldn't say that was Korn at their best. They had forever to put this album together, and it still [was bad]. The only really good track on here was; \\"Alone I break\\". That was it. If I was Jonathan, I would bag Korn.

I back this band, and will listen because they deliver!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On","review":"This CD is a must hear. The best songs on the CD are I'm Here To Stay,Blame,Thoughtless,and Hating. Don't gett me wrong all the other songs are good. ...

They sound amazing I plan on seeing them on the 23rd. This cd is so great johnathan's voice is so good on it he sings higher than me. My favorite songs on it are track 1-3 track 7 and track 14 they're so amazing I honestly love the whole cd I've been listening to it non-stop since I bought. I got it the day it came out it's so great I can't say that enough. I love how you have find a personal meaning for yourself in every song.

The whole band is amazing and their sound is so good. Jonathan Davis on vocals gives all he has on this album, and really seeps into his music. But what would the band be without the amazing talent of Munky, Head, David and Fieldy who add their hard sound to make this album better than there past two. Give it up for Korn. There one hell of a band. They have the orginality, the talent, the vocals, the bass, the guitar, the drums, and they'll be my favorite to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untouchables","review":"Korn may be one of the first of the nu-metal wave, and are probably better than most of the drivel, but that doesn't mean that their latest album deserves any kind of credit, especially when it sucks so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"the emperor has no clothes","review":"I am a metal fan. but this album and the whole scene right now is a big disappointment. I believe the end of the world is coming soon if people think this is good metal... It seems all contrived and redone and polished in the studio. no surpises, no songs with any messages of value. Just sell the albums to dopey kids who are willing to buy them. Whats next, Korn is going to have their own fashion show?? Put another string on their guitars and take some voice lessons and maybe you will have a group. Thank goodness it will be over soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kreamed Korn","review":"Korn has always [stunk],but they sink deeper into poseurdom withUNTOUCHABLES. No matter how hard they try to sound ominous,it'sconstantly ruined by Jonathan Davis's self-indulgent whining.I could barely stand to listen to UNTOUCHABLES; it's absolutelyawful and utterly bereft of intelligence and artful thought; this CD just glorifies meaningless rage. Quit listening to Kornand discover intelligent bands like Circle Of Dead Children andIntense Hammer Rage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love Korn, I've loved them since 95 when I got their 1st album. After owning this album since the day it came out it pains me to say this album sucks. It's boring and I can't remember a single song from it. The lyrics are boring, the drums are boring, the guitars are boring the bass is boring. Also before the album came out they made a big deal that this was recorded in some brand new style, I hear know difference with any other CD I own. Their 1st 4 albums are great it is too bad people dismiss them because they are numetal. Now that Head has left the band because he falsely believes he found God, Korn is more than likely finished. Stick to the 1st 4 albums which are very enjoyable, skip this one and Take a Look in the Mirror another disappointing album. Bottom line this album is a waste of money, so use your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"KoRn Lost It's Kernel...","review":"I can't belive what I'm saying, but this album is so terrible it's sad!! It pains me to think the ONLY song on the disc is \\"Here To Stay\\" but it's true. I have never disliked any KoRn album (and never thought I could). To make this as painless as possible...I feel like I just ran thru a KoRn field backwards.You to will feel KoRn-Holed after you buy this insult of a new album!! KoRn needs to drop the K and spell it CoRn. Don't get me wrong...Of course after you wasted your hard earned money on it, you will try to make yourself believe that you actually like a song or two on it. But deep down you'll know the KoRn legacy is over. I know what your thinking...Either I don't know what I'm talking about or you have to hear it for yourself to believe it.

You've been warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Brutal","review":"Once upon a time I was a huge Korn fan, but with each passing album, I like them less and less. \\"Issues\\" was a bad album, only surpassed by how completely awful \\"Untouchables\\" is. This band is regressing badly, and they are in desperate need of something new. After \\"Follow the Leader\\", I was excited to see the direction they would take, but they have been a dissapointment since. This album rehases their formula, which was once inventive, but now is boring. Jonathan Davis sings about the same whiny problems in his life, as though he could not think of any new material to save his life. When I heard the first single, I laughed out loud because it was so bad, and after about 30 seconds of Here to Stay, decided that I would not buy this album and no longer be a fan of this band. Needless to say, I gave it a chance, and that was an hour of my life I will never get back.For fans of Korn, if you still want to like them, do not get this album, stick with the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn must of gotten a queef.","review":"THIS.

You must be all those people who came up to me when follow the leader came out and said \\"Have you heard Of Korn\\" F yes I did. They came out in late 94. Once Life is Peachy came out and addias became a hit they have lost their touch. I remember in 95 they were opening for megadeath. WHO REMEMBERS that? Also in 96 they played a small club in nashville and did not sell out tell an hour before the show and were playing with THE URGE of all bands. I never thought i would ever right a review like this about korn but they have gone commercial which is acceptable to a certain extent everyone needs money but they have lost their og style! What happened to \\"ARE YOU REEEAAADDDYYY?\\" After i seen the 1st family value tour 3X i gave up on Korn and understud they were not the same.

(took 3 tries)","review":"Well, after thinking about it, I finally got Untouchables. Issues was a total disappiontment in my opinion. This is a full recovery of Korn.

This album has some VERY hard tracks, such as Wake Up Hate and a few others. At times during those songs when Jon is shouting he vaguely sounds like Corey the frontman of Slipknot.

Anyway this is still an exellent CD to own!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unchanging Change","review":"On June 11th 2002, after long anticipation, the newest korn album was released in stores, and marked the comeback of the band. Untouchables is by no means a step down from the intensity of the previous albums, but with no question different from what we're used to. Where as the theme of the album Issues was to start nearly every song with an haunting guitar riff or some sort of soft melodic tune before blasting into a screaming blast of instruments and vocals by Jonathan Davis, Untouchables starts most every song on the album with a torn, or distorted guitar riff, never letting their music get too soft. This album is by no means meant for beginners into the world of metal, and Hard rock. korn has definitely given Heavy metal a new face, and with the Untouchables album, only made it better looking.-Erik Dante"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!","review":"I'd have to say this is korn's finest hour my all time favorite of their cds, this is a must have for korn fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album!!!!","review":"Unlike so many people out there, I believe that Untouchables is a brilliant album. It is Korn's perfect mix of both light and heavy nu-metal. Although there is such a stark contrast between many of the songs on this album, it all just seems to work!Davis' lyrics and voice are extraordinary to listen to. He puts so much emotion into each song, making you feel sad, angry, hateful, etc all in the one song. You really want to hit something with songs like \\"Blame\\", \\"Hollow Life\\" (a light, but powerful song) and \\"Wake Up Hate\\". Munky and Head produce some brilliant guitar riffs with \\"Here to Stay\\", \\"Hating\\" and \\"Beat it Upright\\" all perfectly rounded with Fieldy's bass and Dave's drums.I think people bag this album out because it takes on many different forms. Korn really experimented with different sounds, but you still know its Korn! That's the great thing about it! Though their music takes on so many different forms on Untouchables, the music is still signature Korn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappiontment","review":"I was, and still kinda am, a Korn fan, but this album was such a big disappiontment. All the tracks seem to blend together and by the end of the album, I had fallen asleep. This album is far from the groundbreaking and memorable sound of the first two albums. I just hope that their next album's songs are actually distinguishable or else I'm going to rip their sticker off of my instrument case."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Unlistenable\\" is more like it","review":"I was once a Korn fan. Their first album was one of the greatest hard rock albums ever. \\"Life is Peachy\\" and \\"Follow the Leader\\" were also very good. But something very bad has happened to them lately. The music, which once challeged the boundaries of what defined \\"havy\\" (yes, even on \\"Issues\\"), has now turned into bad synth-goth, sort of like maybe what Orgy wanted to be. The lyrics, once angry and throaty, have finally delved into unintentional self-parody and are delivered in an annoying whine. This might be the single worst album I've ever spent money on. If you're new to Korn, get one of their first three albums. If you're an old fan, this is going to disappoint you greatly. You're better off downloading this one. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we listening to the same album?","review":"I'd give it 3 stars, but I feel compelled to offset all the 5 stars that people are tossing out like candy.I think this is Korn's weakest offering to date. It's OK, but a certain sameness permeates throughout. For me the only standout track is 12.This album doesn't have the raw power of #1, the anarchaic quality of #2, the power and innovativeness of #3, or the amazing riffs of #4.Most dissapointing is the overall rythym. On many of the songs the rythym section could just as easily have come from a drum machine and sequencer.Korn's now sounding a lot more like everyone else. Is that good or bad? You decide. This is an OK album. Better than a lot of the other stuff out there. For me vaguely disappointing considering thier previous stuff. Is thier best now behind them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAREWELL KORN...","review":"The change on the sound of KORN on Untouchables is absurd...The KORN formula is not very varieted, but albuns like LIFE IS PEACHY and KORN'S debut are raw and insane and got many good metal songs like BALL TONGUE, BLIND, DIVINE, SHOOTS AND LADDERS, LOST, ADIDAS and NO PLACE TO HIDE...On Untouchables, Korn puts a lot of eletronic textures and the music became much more depressing and sick, which i don't like at all... Besides the great opening track HERE TO STAY, i don't like any other song..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughtless, yes indeed","review":"Don't bother buying this rip-off. If you want a good Korn album, buy the only good one: the first one, self-entitled.Johnathan Davis clearly abuses from his winning formula, which made him so famous at the first place. I think Korn has to stop screaming like dogs, and start doing something that makes sense. As I said, please keep your money and buy the first one. It's really good. After that, they suck, except for some of the songs on Follow the Leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korny??","review":"Korn are a band which is all over the music press. Highly respected and with a huge fan base. I though this album would be ok or at least good. But no. It is really not anything at all. There is two genres of song here.1. Very heavy intro, very chunky and difficult to make out.2. Synth intro, adding instruments, not very catchy just dull.All the songs within these genres sound the same. And are not really good at all.The most annoying thing about this album is the lyrics, Every single song Davies (korn singer) is constantly complaining about his \\"hurt\\". It gets really annoying, just shut up and get over it! It is really korny. (like this pun)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"to rate this album more than 2 stars... you would have to be a foolthe korn we all loved has been asphyxiated by an attempt at \\"expensive\\" production.If you could over produce an album, i think korn has done it...was that a guitar... or a computer?What the hell did jon davis just say?Where they real drums? they didnt sound like it!hahahahthis album is a joke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Korn ever","review":"Best album ever, it rates along the lines of \\"Are you Experienced\\" as far as complexity and all around originality!!!I am the biggest Korn fan ever!!

Thanks Korn for making music more interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I have been a KoRn fan for years and greatly anticipated this album. I was almost embarassed as a KoRn fan when I heard it for the first time. The raw energy and emotion is lacking in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"AND TO THINK- I USED TO BE A KORN FAN","review":"KORN HAS ONCE AGAIN FIT THE ROLE OF THE EVERY DAY AVERAGE ROCK BAND. THEIR INDIE STUFF WAS PROMISING AND HAD POTENTIAL. THEIR FIRST COUPLE OF ALBUMS WERE THE BOMB.'FOLLOW THE LEADER' ROCKED........... BUT THEN CAME 'ISSUES', WHICH IS STILL OVER PRICED AT [price] ON [local store]. WHEN I HEARD 'HERE TO STAY' ON THE RADIO, I KNEW I HAD TO GO AND BURN 'UNTOUCHABLES' OFF THE NET. BUT ONCE I DID I REALIZED IT WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MY TIME. 'HERE TO STAY' IS THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, GO WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON A CD THAT SOUNDS ENTIRELY THE SAME FROM ONE SONG TO THE NEXT. I USED TO LIKE KORN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn of 94?","review":"It seems to me that Korn has rekindled with the hard pimp metal of old, that originally brought them the millions of fans they have today. A touch of that was on \\"Issues\\" with the track \\"Falling Away From Me\\" but the rest of the album appeared to be going in a new direction. This album \\"Untouchables\\" has put Korn back on top of the metal genre again. A incredible album from track 1 to 14, the artwork is incredible and the new enhanced technology is one of kind aswell. All around, it was put together incredibly, i'm not sure if i'd rank it better than the debut but it is very close.*Note* the debut is my favorite of ALL time, not just of Korn, but of anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Korn we all know and love","review":"To say the least the new Korn cd is a mindblowing piece of art. It is as heavy and we know Korn to be but still expands into new topics and shows the full musical talent of all of Korn. I am troubled however how some of the people reviewing this CD are calling it poor compared to the band's previous work. I have been a long-time Korn fan and own/love all of their CD's. Even as a true fan I understand that you cannot compare the new CD of a band to their debut in 1994. Bands change over time, there is no way to stop that. You should appreciate the new CD as it is, a great, awesome, heavy, amazing CD and not worry if it sounds different from previous albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn is yummy","review":"OK, i admit im not the best person to review Korn since im a huge fan and all (explains the 5 stars) but you have to admit they do, what they do, everyone was expecting the pain and emotion expressed on the self titled, but that just not gonna happen. People change and they changed for the better, personally. Untouchables is a great album with more of a groove in it (beat it up right), It still hits the same angry-at-the-world overtones (hate), but for all the real korn fans the heavy stuff we loved is still there.. dont judge KoRn on FTL (he still screams through all the lyrics) or issues (which was a really emotional album) remember the old korn..listen to this one, there are a hell of alot of good songs. I love KoRn and this album, take it from a true fan, not one that hated them after FTL, one who enjoyed what they had to bring to the table. Go out and buy it.Then buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn untouchables review","review":"I have been waiting for Korn's new album \\"untouchables\\" for a while. Now that it's out i sat down and listened to every song. i think this cd is very good! i enjoyed alot of the songs. there were only a couple i wasn't found of but this cd is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hard Rock album","review":"Korn is back and better than ever. Untouchables has 14 great tracks on it. Including a remix of Here to Stay. This album is their usual hard rock/metal but they also throw in some mellower tracks. Also when u buy this cd u get a sampler from a metal band Otep, and a single cd of the Remix of Here To Stay. But of course the main product is Korn. I feel the best songs are Hollow Life, Here To Stay, and thoughtless. But the most important thing is that this cd has no bad songs on it. I really recommend this album for all korn fans and all rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of Korn's best","review":"It definitely has the trademark Korn sound that us fans know and love. There's a great mix of really heavy and not-so-heavy songs. It's just a great album all-around."},{"rating":"2","title":"attention demanding","review":"This by far korns greatest album so far, it takes all the best elements of the first album and combines it with elements of the highly under-rated Videodrone, along with some serious muscisian/songwriter-ship, giving a much more mature contempary edge over a lot of nu-metal bands, remember the little ditty's on \\"issues\\" that left you begging for more.The good thing is they haven't denied their fans any of the heaviness and inaccessibility, that bands like linkin park, slipknot,ill nino,limp bizkit,etc. (with their sing along choruses and chart-friendly mixes) yet they still have hooks that you can really sink your teeth into.this album is probably their most vital release, and the most untouchable band around at the moment (except Tool)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy This CD...","review":"One of the most notable aspects of Korn's music is that it has continually evoloved. Some bands constantly churn out the same material and ultimately stagnate. Don't get me wrong, this CD is most certainly Korn; i.e., Fieldy's percussion style bass, etc.. But, Untouchables is certainly the current pentacle of Korn... My personal favorites off the CD are, Here To Stay, One More Time, Embrace, and I'm Hiding. The song Hollow Life, alone, has added a new dimension to Korn while at the same time showcasing the bands incredible musical talent.... In other words, Buy the CD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure crap.","review":"Oh god, what happened to this band. This is a disaster.If you like some sick hybrid of pop mixed with death metal then you will simply ADORE this album. Don't forget whiny vocals and terrible, childish lyrics.If you like metal (good music), then buy Life is Peachy, Self-Titled, and yes, even Follow the Leader.STAY AWAY FROM ISSUES AND UNTOUCHABLES! ESPECIALLY UNTOUCHABLES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"utter [junk]","review":"This is just commercial metal at it's worst. Korn is just another band that needs help selling their music so they beg MTV to help them. Their music reminds me of a bad dinner, a few minutes after listening to it, you vomit it right out. Korn claim to be metal, but to me they look like a bunch of white boys posing with their guitars trying to form a cool rap band. This music just raises one issue, nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old stuff","review":"Is it just me, or does every Korn album sound exactly alike?? I'll give em credit because they were at one time ground breaking and original. Korn's 1st album set a new standard for up and coming metal bands. But now almost every nu metal band sounds just like them. They're not really a bad band, they're just stuck in a rut. All their songs sound exactly alike - the same guitar riffs, basslines (Fieldy is a pretty good bassist), drumlines, and same whiny vocals. If you have one Korn album you have them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NU-METAL REIGNS SUPREME!","review":"This is the new Korn album. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you surfed to this page on accident. If you are truly dense and must hear this, borrow it from one of your mooky pals."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Untouchables\\" Best Since Self-titled","review":"Korn's new album, \\"Untouchables\\" scores big with melodic metal and Jonathan Davis' vocal range. This is the most mature album from Korn. In their ten years together, they definitely have progressed into a very solid group. Each members' talents compliment the others in such a way as to achieve a sound unlike anything else out there. Korn is truly an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"untouchable?","review":"i bought this album thinkig it was going to be great what a letdown. this is easily the worst korn album ever when issues came out that was quite a let down to but this is just PANTS. if you dont have all the korn ablums dont bye this one buy one of the other far superior albums as buying this is just a waste of your cash!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Are Here To Stay","review":"I enjoyed the album, every single song.

(not that there other albums weren't good) Jonathan really got the best out of him. And instead of singing only about his childhood he also involved some other issues. My oppinion: this is there best album so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of KoRn's best!!!","review":"When I first heard this album I was so amazed. They had totally changed into a new style and nobody can even touch them now. This much anticipated album has to be one of the greatest album's of all time. If you like KoRn or you're wanting something new, I suggest you buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and crappy","review":"I dont know what happened this cd really really really sucks the only good song in this is Bottled Up Inside... wow what happened KoRn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be a big fan","review":"I loved 'issues', it was inventive for them and fairly cinematic with odd hooks. Their original disc has great songs. 'Life is Peachy' was great when very angry and 'Follow' was kind of fun in a sick way. Untouchables is really unappealing to me, all the songs are just dull, like it's a parody of the band, I thought Jon was supposed to be more mellow from the prozac?I think they need at least one decent guitar riff, make new instrumentals, find a new way of expressing with better, less blunt lyrics or do not continue making music. Do something exciting, maybe a concept album with drawings or SOMETHING new. Get a haircut maybe, I dunno..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untouchables-Korn","review":"By far this is there best album so far and shows how diverse they are and how they can shake up the music world yet again!

Im just waiting to see who will try to immitate them Next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullies Beware","review":"I do admit, the new Korn album, Untouchables was not what I had expected at first. It took a little time for it to grow on me. But after sitting and listening to the lyrics, I can relate to nearly every song on the disc. In my eyes, the whole album pretty much warns anyone who likes to bully people around that the day is coming for THEM to get walked all over. It states that we all have minds that can think, hearts that can have feelings and anger that can build to a point beyond extinction. I myself have been walked on in the past and the lyrics in this amazing album touched home with me and made me realize that I wasn't the only one thinking these thoughts. I thought sometimes I was on the brink of insanity. Untouchables has helped me remember that I'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I still love and admire this band for staying themselves their whole career. They are a fan's band. Nice to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Then The First","review":"This Is The Best KoRn CD Ever My Fav.

When Korn first came out, they were new to the nu-metal scene they were change from grunge. Their first few albums were classics, now they have changed their style of music to compete with various ... like Linkin Park and Sum 41 which does not compete with Korn's classical old style. I think they have had there day and they are just trying to keep in the runnings of the new millenium bands, which in my view are utterly ... maybe it's me or is there no room left in the world for decent music. Unlike this new commercial farce of nu-metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"i like korn a lot, as a matter of fact they're one of my favorites. but this album is no good. not one track sounded good to me. there were a couple that i found almost listenable. what happened? his voice is different in this and there are no drums. it's all synthesizer. my favorites are issues, follow the leader, and their self-titled album (awesome cd). this album is not like any of those. no talent was displayed on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly different, but good","review":"If anyone's actually reading this, this is a pretty good album. Not the best in the entire world, but worth its price. It is not quite as hard and intense as some of KoRn's previous work, but it should not dissappoint music listeners. It is more devastating, and emotional in different ways than their other albums. At times, it is so ugly that it is beautiful. At others, it is so beautiful and heartfelt that it is ugly. You won't be dissappointed by Untouchables."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really like this, it ranks up there with zeppelin,","review":"I heard J Davis got voice lessons, cant you tell? Boy, from the first single I thought it was Korn featuring Robert Plant. His voice is amazing. And Fieldy is getting so much better at the bass, and the Head guy is shredding out beautiful power chords. Korn rocks, I've never been to a Korn show, but if my mother ever let me go, I would meet my boys of Korn and ask them how come they are so remarkably talented and how Davis can get his voice to sound like he was being pinched by a crawfish. Korn will SAVE ROCK AND ROLL. we need more bands like Korn, well wait... I shouldn't complain, we do have Paparoach, limp biscuits...you get my point. Real music fans love korn.Let me rate the songs for all you::::1. Here to stay - Terrible an absolute mockery of everything rocknroll once stood for2. Make believe- Terrible.

Forget about the rage and emotion from the first 2 albums. Korn can be defined by their first 2 albums, period, the rest of the \\"experimentation\\" side of the band is pure crap, where are the dark, sick and full of emotion Jonathan's screaming? where is the funky-fast riffs of \\"Divine\\"? forget it, it' gone! When i started listening to Korn (back in '94) I was amazed by the refreshing and incredible sound, specially for the emotion on the lyrics and the singing...but now, everything is about money, MTV and fame...just like in the song \\"Got the Life\\" but the saddest part is the video clip for that song became real...so sad.

Don't forget about the compelling CD Extras which includes the original \\"Here to Stay\\" video, 7 songs from their live show, free KoRn Kamp membership and more!

The wait was well worth it, however korn does not disapoint fans, they give them what they asked for. The album brings a new sound to the band, they are straying away from the rap/rock scene and it is really working, the album is their heaviest album and their most in depth lyrics ever written. with Jonatan Davis' voval lessons it has made him not just a great front man, but ifact the best frontman in the music industry. Four years of waiting was all worth it, if you plan to burn the cd from Kazaa or morpheus, don't, it is a trully great cd worth buying. My favourite tracks apposed to the great song \\"here to stay\\" are \\"Bottled up inside\\" and \\" Thoughtless\\" truly excelent vocal and instumental work, tis album will go down in history.- #1 KoRn fan Dan the man"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Finally the new album from Korn came... And when I listend to it, I got pretty surprised. Jonathan Davis shows a new way to perform his lyrics. The also call it the heaviest album ever, I would say it's not in the music, but in the lyrics its heavy. Korn shows a softer side of them, which I actually think is a great turn. You can almost say its the softer perspective that makes the whole album heavy....

Really Follow the Leader was there last good album. Issues was a mess. Untouchables is better but with only so few great songs on the album we have go to worry where they are heading. We all know they can do better. Anyone that things this is a great album is in denial about this band. Unfourtanetly this will probably be the last Korn CD I buy.

All of the 14 tracks (plus the bonus track), are the best songs I've ever heard. The banging guitars along with Jonathan Davis' voice make it a simply perfect heavy metal album. Ever since I picked up a copy of \\"Issues\\", I have been hooked on the different but amazing sound of Korn. From the head banging guitar riffs in \\"Here to Stay\\" and \\"Embrace\\", to the perfect slow sound in \\"Alone I Break\\", makes this a great CD with a wide variety of songs. I recommend this CD to heavy metal fans and everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst korn album!","review":"I was a huge korn fan until they released this album. Everyone of the songs is a disappointment. \\"Here to Stay\\" sounds good at first, but the bridge of that song is rediculous, and listening to one song over and over again is sad.

DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"KoRn has never let me down!! with each album they promise things and they follow through, and then some! For Untouchables, they said it was very melodic and that the guitars were more tied in with the music. The songs on Untouchables are very melodic but still very heavy!

This cd is definitely harder than anything theyve ever done in the past, just as it was planned. I cannot put this cd down, it is a masterpeice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbridled ferocity....","review":"I never liked KoRn very much until I heard this CD; it is now my reigning favorite.Combine unbridled ferocity with undulating, catchy rythms and you have music that simply will not get out of your head.

Brutal, intense and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn has sold out","review":"I have been a Korn fan for many years and I was hoping they wouldn't sell out like other bands do when they become succesful. Musically speaking, Korn did a good job with 'Untouchables,' but I think they tried too hard to appeal to the mainstream-pop crowd. When they first came out, Mr. Davis was full of rage and aggression, which is why I liked Korn so much. Now the vocals have a whiny feel to them. Unfortunately, Korn has gone soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"KoRn has Lost Their Touch","review":"Don't get me wrong, I L.O.V.E. KoRn, and must take a lot for a KoRn fan as deticated as I am to say anything by them [is horrible], but this album [is horrible]! The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one was because of the songs 'Here to Stay' and 'Embrace', the only songs that have something I can bang my head to. The other songs sound all sweet with Jonathan makeing all thses squeeky noises, and with Munky and Head playing one or two strings at a time, and with Feildy gently plucking at his bass, and with David lightly tapping on a tambarine, instead of rocking hard like KoRn is supposed to. I for one wish they had stopped with Follow the Leader, because KoRn has really lost their touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall this is a good album!","review":"the only bad thing that i can say bout this cd is the fact that they have to rely on there chorus. the chorus's of there songs r very good but the verses r just terrible. and most of the songs sound alike. the best songs in the album r \\"i'm hiding\\", \\"thoughtless\\", \\"here to stay\\", \\"hating\\" and \\"blame\\". the rest of the songs r either ok or is terrible. but overall this is a good album and i recomend it to all the ppl who likes metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn' s leadin the way into the music front","review":"KoRn is a highly charged band, I have to admit that \\"Untouchables\\" is not one of their best ablums but, as usual KoRn is leading the way. You have to give Jonathan, Munky, Head, Feildy, and David alot of respect, they are 4 MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT because they care alot for their music.

KoRn is in a leauge of their own. Yeah, maybe this album is a bit less raw and a little more manufactured than the rest. But, even with that fact, it is incredible. It is worth it alone for track 4, \\"Hollow Life\\". \\"Here to Stay\\", \\"Thoughtless\\", \\"Alone I Break\\", and \\"Hating\\" are my other personal favorites.

So, I decided to perchase Untouchables, which turned out to be my favorite rock cd on the map.

I personally enjoy 11 out of the 15 songs on it, the cd says 14 but their is the bonus remix song of Here to Stay as track 15. They comined a musical sound of both metal and rock music into the same cd. I actually enjoy this new cd of their's because of the lryics in the songs Hollow Life, Thoughtless, Alone I break, and No One's There. I didn't care for track 2 Make Believe, Track 3 Blame, Track 5 Bottled up Inside, and track 10 Embrace. But if your looking for a good mixture of music both lryically and for the music then this rock metal cd will be great for you to enjoy time and time again. Just keep an open mind and ear to the music on this cd and see how many songs you end up liking out of the whole cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst KoRn album to date!","review":"I can never say I've been a KoRn fan but I know what heavy metal is,...and sadly this is not it! I think KoRn has been getting softer after every album and more commericial. If you were looking for another KoRn CD like there first one then don't buy it, but if your looking for something like poser wannabee rock (*cough cough* Limp Bizkit) then by all means buy it! I gave it one star cuz of \\"Here To Stay\\" was pretty much the only \\"heavy\\" song on the CD or else I would have gave it 0 stars. But if you like new metal & who doesn't go downhill after every album then I suggest Slipknot or Mudvayne."},{"rating":"1","title":"KoRn's Worst Album Ever","review":"I have been listening to KoRn since before they hit it big with Follow the Leader, since the self-titled LP. KoRn has never been able to make a better album than their first, but Life is Peachy was still raw and had the same energy and even though Follow the Leader was a commercial success, it was still KoRn moving in a good direction. A couple years later KoRn has been reduced to absolute .... This album is horrible. John Davis does not even scat or play bagpipes on this record, and there is none of the emotion, demo-type rawness in the music that made KoRn so excellent in the first place. I will forever respect KoRn for their first three records, but I cannot even acknowledge Issues or Untouchables as KoRn albums...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont get it","review":"I cant believe people still listen to this (stuff).

But this cd is not on the level of their older stuff. Im not sure I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the other ones but its still cool. Some of the songs kinda seem boring and sound similar to other ones in the album. I guess I was expecting more aggressive (sp?) stuff and this album didnt really bring that. I give it 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of The KoRn","review":"HO MY GOD!!!! This CD is so awesome if your into korn's old stuff you'll like this. The music has so much energy, It makes your want to start moshing and crazy from the energy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think Jon should put more of his hardcore voice in some of the song's. He sound's good singing but I think people want to hear the voice from the first KoRn. If your into old school KoRn I recommend you listen to \\"EMBRACE\\",\\"BEAT IT UPRIGHT\\", and \\"ONE MORE TIME\\". I have a filling that KoRn has returned and is HERE TO STAY and take back the throne of rock, on which sucky bands like slipknot have been dominating.

Jonnathan Davis' vocals once again send chills down the spine, even more this time due to his actual SINGING instead of pure yelling. The guitarists prove just what use 7-string guitars can be put to. Field's bass lines keep the bumpy, heavy feeling of Korn going strong. And David's altogether awesome drumming makes you want to stand up and jump around. I totally recommend this CD to any rock fan. It has a little bit for everyone. Definately worth the money you'll spend. Just altogether a great great album. Korn's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn comes back with a bang!!!","review":"This Korn album is incredible. I am very impressed, this is a true work of art. Korn's inspiration and creativity is showing through in its true colors. There are some songs on this album that grabbed me from day one. One of those songs is Wake Up Hate, its one of those songs that sticks out, and is absolutly incredible. I love Korn, I've loved them for a very long time, and I must say this only stregthens my love for them. I also got the DVD when I bought the CD, and it is very intersting, and I suggest you check it out. Its a maze that is a bit of mind screw, but wow, it will blow your mind.

This book emphasizes the mathematics by showing the proofs used by key thinkers in the history of mathematics. You learn about the thought processes of the great minds of mathematics. Well written and aimed at those who have a good high school mathematics background, the author analyzes how each key thinker derived his famous mathematical proof. A good supplimental reading for students who are required to do proofs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful approach to Mathematics","review":"I bought this book for my husband and had the opportunity to read some of it, it has a fun and light approach to topics usually considered mysterious and difficult, and though it does go to deep details, it can be read either as a deep but enjoyable Mathematics book or as a light anecdotal book about the history of Mathematics ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The art of mathematics","review":"This is indeed a thrilling book to read. As the title claims, it is about the great theorems of mathematics that we have probably already read about. The book provides not only the description of the great theorems, but also it provides a historical account of the great mathematicians invloved in creating the art of mathematics. These historical accounts or biographies are very well written, and easy to read and most of all enjoy. There is one drawbaack to the text and that is the \\"Fermat's last theorem\\", where the author states it is the greates unsolved problem, where the problem has been solved by A. Wiles. However, this is the problem of the time that the book is published. This book is indeed a great reading for many mathematicians and non-mathematicians, where many can find it very understandable and find themselves in love with mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Galios?","review":"Either a solid highschool math background or a college algera course makes this book worthwhile. The author has his favorites, but he puts a real face on mathematicians who have changed history. It's a great resource book for teachers and an inspiration for those like mathematics and also the first book I've read that included the converse of the \\"P\\" Theorem. The story of the solution to cubic equations was fun. Fermat aside, the great theorems, which often seem quite simple, are a result of focused dedicated effort. The book is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Math","review":"Dunham selects several mathematical theorems and discusses their meaning and their proof. The book is arranged chronologically beginning with Hippocrates (Quadrature of the Lune) and follows with Euclid, Archimedes through Newton, Euler up to modern scientists.

Still, the book was arranged well with many graphs, formulae, pictures and charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great","review":"This book is for one of my classes and its very interesting. I really enjoy it and recommend it to other people interested in math"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice book","review":"This is a very nice and elegantly written book. The proofs of the theorems selected as great are presented in simple terms. They require no more then high school mathematics(although some of these proofs are not rigorous, for example on the summation of infinite series). The only problem I can see is with the choice of the theorems (too many from geometry) but of course that is a matter of taste. I would have given the book five stars if there had been a chapter on Godel's theorem in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing in so many ways, yet not for everybody.","review":"The content within the book is truly amazing, but only for those who love mathematics. There are a lot of proofs discussed and explained within the book but it does not explain how numbers were even created! If a book was going to give theorems in mathematics they should at least start with how mathematics was born as a subject. Furthermore to a mathematician this book might be a blast to read. But to the layman this book might get a bit tricky as it gets to the end and will lose interest in reading it. This book is definitely for those who love mathematics and are willing to learn the ideas behind each theorem.I suggest those who view this book to have at least completed high school math to read it so you will be able to understand and grasp the beauty of everything inside this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written view of mathematics at its most creative","review":"This book presents some of the most important theorems of mathematics, from the ancient Greeks to approximately 1900. It is a well-written sampling intended to be readable by people whose background in mathematics may be relatively limited and in fact it requires a command of the mathematics of only about halfway through high school to understand.The only thing that should be understood is that some of the theorems (such as Heron's formula for the area of a triangle) while requiring no more mathematics than a high school sophomore geometry class, require you to follow a rather long chain of reasoning, which may lose some of the less-mathematical readers. But if you're willing to apply yourself, you can get a lot out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for math-lovers","review":"I was looking forward to this book, but was disappointed by the amount of math it contained.I guess I was hoping for a book more likeFermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem, which \\"explains\\" some of the most complex math in the world (I guess) in a way that even non-math-lovers can \\"understand.\\"Still, it's very well-written, and I'll probably be absorbing it, bit by bit, in very small chunks.

Here's a hint by way of a question: if you have nothing but a compass, an unmarked ruler, and a pencil, how do you bisect a line?

Very few belly laughs in this one, some might not even laugh once throughout the entire thing. So why 4 stars? Because I have never heard a better examination of American life by anybody. George shows us a man who has lived through America in its best and worst times and his examination into our need for consumption is thought provoking. While death is the overall motif of the CD, almost everything ties back into how over privelleged we all are and how truly animalistic human behavior is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing old material by Bill Hicks now too ???","review":"There's no denying Carlin's importance as a comedian or his brilliance as an original voice and thinker. But you wouldn't know it from listening to this CD. George is way past his best with a misanthopic laughter-lite performance you won't want to listen to more than once.But worst of all is hearing him do a piece on how it's always the good people(Jesus, Martin Luther King, JFK, John Lennon) who get assassinated - a complete steal from an identical routine from the early 90's by the late great Bill Hicks, except without a funny pay-off.I can understand an opportunist like Dennis Leary notoriously stealing from Hicks, but the great George Carlin too? What's going on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Carlin Album","review":"When I saw this became available, I immediately had to have it to go with the rest of my Carlin CD collection. If this is his last album, it is a sad reminder of what was once a great career. This has to be the most unfunny comedy album ever released. I'm not saying just Carlin, I'm talking about every live standup album ever. I think I smirked at maybe two observations. As a whole, it is like Carlin mailed in this album and figured he has a built in fanbase so it'll sell at least a few copies. I'll recommend one not buy this album and purchase 'A Place for My Stuff' or 'Parental Advisory'. This album will remain in my collection but it will never get any play time."},{"rating":"1","title":"george carlin swimming in stale routine","review":"I feel as if George has become a bitter old man.I haven't heard much cursing since i stumbled into a local dive bar near the fishing piers.I had the priveledge to see him perform too and after awhile it got old.You can be funny and he is but without the profanity.It worked well for Richard Pryor but stuff like pussy farts and necropheliacs and suicides?!?!? Come on now! That is not funny thats just sick.I stopped buying his albums and somehow i don't think he's going to mellow any time soon.Oh well he still packs people in to his shows and as long as he's happy working profanity into everybodys eardrums thats all that counts.As far as I'm concern I'm not subjecting myself to that.....Good Ridence."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I have all of George's albums, this being the last one I bought. And I'm certain this is the least funny. I went through long stretches without being the slightest amused. In fact, these stretches (mostly in tracks 3-5 and 7, talking about suicide, hopelessness and the awful behavior of the human race) were downright depressing. George normally talks about depressing topics, but on this album there are no funny asides or humorous points of view -- so that all that's left are the depressing facts. Throw in his normal \\"glass half-empty\\" point of view (which is OK when he's being funny) and you realize he's making these topics more depressing than they really are.

Not one of them performs with the capitivity, the mystery, and the illusivity of Apple. Extraordinary Machine, Apple's latest album, is a testament to the power of angst and heartache without the usual whining.It has a 40s influenced sound style, but it does not belong on a record player. Jazz, cabaret, blues, funk, rock, and soul all permeate the essence of this album. Forget what you thought of \\"Tidal\\". Forget what you thought about \\"When The Pawn...\\". Extraordinary Machine is on a whole other level. On this album, the 28 year old Apple is saying to the 19 year old Apple of \\"Tidal\\" that she is here to stay.

After her first album, all her music became angry like she was doing a horrible Alannis Morrisette impersonation.Didn't she know that angry chick done wrong music went out in the early 90's? Noone cares. It's a good thing that some people think that's she's pretty and know of her tragic past that she's not afraid to cash in on by retelling her sad story over and over again otherwise noone would buy her stuff after first album. The first album was the only one she ever put out where she actually tried. The rest of them are just jokes. She is just a tool using the reputation of her first album and her good looks to put out junk and knowing people will buy it based on that even though it's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Fan","review":"I've been a fan of Fiona Apple ever since I saw her first video on VH1 for \\"Shadowboxer\\". TIDAL is a terrific album and my personal favorite of hers. All the songs on it are filled with deep emotion and soul. Her voice and lyrics are heartbreaking. I give it 5 stars. 1999's WHEN THE PAWN... is a little more up beat but still has all the same emotion. 4 1/2 stars. I was thrilled after 6 years that she was coming out with a new album. Once I bought EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and listened to it I have to say I was very disappointed. I just don't know how to describe this record. Five of the songs are the same Fiona Apple I have loved for years but the other seven are just NOT her. The lyrics are great but the music with hip-hop and techno beats DO NOT do her extrordinary voice justice. Overall, EXTRAORINARY MACHINE is just not worth the $15 bucks. Even for the most hard core Apple fan like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"Until this album I don't think Fiona had done a song I didn't love. So I bought 'Extraordinary Machine' without hesitation. Unfortunately I do not like the album at all. Obviously others disagree but I found none of the songs memorable and most have an unfinished feel to them. Many even have hints of previous songs that would normally not be so bad but in this case it simply feels like she is searching for something she knows the current songs lack. If nothing else try and hear as much of the album as you can before paying money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I know there was a long wait. And I also went through an eighteen month period of complete devotion to the vocals stylings and dark poetics of Miss Apple- (Tidal, of course) during which I thought the woman could do no wrong. But with the exception of the title track (in which the lyrics speed-dance through in a gorgeous self-affirming ditty of a song), I found this album to be a great disappointment.Gone the delicate gestures of Tidal, Apple stomps words into her songs with clumsy and over the top imagery. Her melodies and voice are still pretty (I do like the sound of Oh, Sailor) but her poetry seems thinner, falser. Broken-hearted, hate-him-so, \\"on my knees\\"- themes she mastered in her previous two albums that lyrically, just don't cut it on this one.A reverting to teen angst that sounds pretty but leaves no mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Bring back the bootleg version!","review":"As I sit hear listening to one of my fave artists, I wonder what brilliant decision maker at Sony/BMG decided to completely change around production-wise the ORIGINAL well-documented bootleg version of \\"Extraordinary Machine\\". This is simply a pathetic attempt at making a great recording better. It didn't work. The new production lacks instrumentation and Fiona's signature eerieness. I say Jon Brion got the raw deal here. The beauty of Apple's records is that she MADE IT big without being mainstream. This CD may sell because of devoted fans and mainly to individuals that were unfortunate not to hear how it was really recorded; how it was MEANT to be recorded. I predict that in the long run, this CD won't have too much shelf life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not about internet album","review":"To write something new about \\"Extraordinary machine\\" is complicated. I just can say is one of the best records in 2006 and maybe ever.I'm a Fiona Apple fan since \\"tidal\\". I'm not in the opinion is better the internet version, you know about it I guess. In the internet copy music covers fiona's voice in a way destroy her best, her voice and her piano playing.Now you can listening to her in a very clear way, and there are treasures as Parting Gift, so simply and stunning.My favorite songs, whatever, are \\"Window\\" with best lyric on Fiona career and Oh Well, so beatiful...So, forget about al the noise about internet album and Sony conspirations and all these stuff and enjoy this extraordinary record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordplay and tunesmithy aplenty on Ms. Apple's latest release.","review":"On her third album, Extraordinary Machine, Fiona Apple invites us into her extraordinary mind once more, to soak in her disjointed melodies and biting lyrics. A strong album that will have you listening to it again and again to catch all the nuances and clever musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regrettably awful","review":"Thje most important aspect of her first album is missing here. The chord changes on this album are dreadful. What makes music compelling is the way chords progress, one to the next, in a manner that amazes us and makes us want more. Think of Beethooven's Ninth. Dah-dah-dah-dah.....compelling right? And the difference between that and mediocre music? Not compelling. And that's the problem with this album. Not compelling. Many of the chords progressions are similar to Shadwodancer but where Shadowdancer's changes were delicious andsublime, songs you could listen to again and agian, this one is missing all of that. The changes are dischordant and utterly lacking in that harmonious resolution that makes you want to hum it, sing it and play it over and over. I ended up going from track to track, looking for that one \\"hit\\" and never found it. I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too overrated","review":"a friend of mine told me this album is a piece of musical genius and much better than the mainstream music out there so I gave it a ilsten and this is what I have concluded:her voice is pretty and smoky but she is by all means NOT a musical genius! So what if she uses live instruments and broadway influences in her music? It doesn't give her credibility if the lyrics are crap and the music is redundant! For instance one song had a nice beat and then she starts chanting YOU SILLY STUPID BLEHHHH she sounds like my 14 year old having a tantrum when she's supposed to be in her late 20's. Lisa Marie Presley's dirty laundry CD would be a better choice over this, her lyrics are much better than fiona's, she has more emotion, and their voices are very similar so I think her album would be a better choice over this. It's no wonder her record label wanted to save her the embarassment of releasing this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"fiona","review":"What ever happened to Fiona's passion?

I gave it a fair shake, and after it was done I ejected the cd from the player and snapped it in two via a trip to the wastebasket where it now lays. The problem? It's just not that good (with the exception of \\"O'Sailor\\", which is good). Yes, she has an interesting, smoky voice but the material doesn't stand out at all. It's quite dull, despite sincere efforts to come off as unique. This is yet another album that fails to generate any palpable excitement. I ended the cd wondering, \\"WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT?\\". I was utterly nonplussed. Perhaps she should think about abandoning contemporary music and re-establish herself as a jazz / torch singer, which I think she'd fare much better at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra-unordinary Machine","review":"I hurt's me now to say that I am a Fiona Apple fan because this is her worst CD I ever heard.

After several heartfelt attempts to like it, I eventually had to retire it to the depths of my CD cabinet. The fact that I truely find it to be impossible to listen to is devasting because I have so enjoyed Fiona for many years. The songs on this album are terribly depressing and musically I just don't find this work to be pretty or inspiring.

This is a strange overly quirky assortment of bizzare songs with melodies that do not grab me. With the first album there was more hooks and angst. This is some pretty tepid stuff here. I really wanted to like this album and I am still trying, but I leave asking the question: Is Fiona Apple really in essence a One Hit Wonder, besides Criminal what other hits does she have?? This is a cacophony of strangeness. Talent or not I am dissapointed. I also would like to see Fiona use some real instruments like guitars and rock out a little, I know with her voice she is capable. Somebody want to buy a almost new Fiona Apple CD? It is a good thing she has a huge fan base because this is a really really bad entry on her behalf. It is like bad poetry set to really bad music. Just listened to \\"When the Pawn\\" 100% better, what happened to this miserable offering?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly tuneless","review":"Very disappointed. There is almost no melody on the entire album. For virtually every song, the musical theme is so constricted that there is virtually no melodic line to speak of. Her vocals and imagery are occasionally beautiful but frequently banal and her delivery lazy with more vibrato than I've ever heard from her. I have to agree with her record company - there is no record here. It's too bad, her previous albums were so good I was expecting more, not less."},{"rating":"1","title":"a much more tired version then the \\"internet release\\"","review":"It's really problematic listening to this record.I'd really like to own it like the rest of her records, but as most of you already know - there was a pre-released version that leaked to the internet and downloaded by many.Something in this official release sounds somewhat \\"tired and tamed\\". All the songs are great, except that they are NOT.How to describe it...just download the original release - and feel the difference.. here passion is lost somewhere in the process (when Sony people are standing behind the one way mirror)Sadly, dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiona Apple is awesome, this album however is awful","review":"Ive just about burned my eardrums out listening to pawn, sleep to dream, etc, the \\"early days\\" of Fiona apple, some of my favorite music. The angst is present in the new album, but theres no soul and depth in \\"Extraordinary Machine\\", its flat, unmoving, and a lifeless corpse. Just listening to the songs brings images that shes thinking \\"i need some more $$, heres some more music, blah blah, zzzz\\", she just sings it like she lost all her soul, and that shes got a gun to her head and someone is forcing her to sing. Just no soul at all in this album, its not in the same ilk as her earlier works. Absolutely love Apples music, to the Xtreme in fact, but this collection is a snoozefest without soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now, I understand why there were problems getting this released...","review":"I've tried to like this album, but it is just painful to listen to. Tidal is by far her best work; and, I bought this CD in hopes that she was back in full force. Unfortunately, the lyrics were very flat and uninspiring. The piano was the only saving grace for this CD. If I could give it a half star, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken teeth","review":"Tidal was a masterpiece; a soulful texture of diminished and augmented chords with clever lyrics and strong, digestible harmonies...this was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"What is all this hype????? I simply dont understand. Fiona Apple's \\"tidal\\" is by far her best album. From beautiful ballads like \\"Shadowboxer\\" to the sinfully naughty \\"Criminal\\" the album is absolute perfection. Such a far cry from the days of yore. \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" finds us once again with our frail subject steering in the furthest direction from anything conceptuallly pop-like. The songs are meloncholic and monotonous. Boring and unnerving. You either find yourself asleep or running towards the stereo to end the misery. So many people pushed to see this album see the light of day; I think the label was right in shelving this one. Such a beautiful voice, but this is far from extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It might be a better version of her","review":"I don't consider this a good album but a great one. I've listened to Extraordinary Machine twice since buying it this afternoon and rarely do I ever listened to an album from beginning to end without skipping songs to get to the good part. The good part is all there in every sonic scape Ms. Apple poured into her latest effort. While it might seem subtle and light, it is still quite a feat for an artist to release an album worthy of our attention after being gone from the music world that has changed oh so drastically. Sure even the corporation that is Sony might have wanted a more commercial product but you cannot put this work into that category. What we get is a beautifully crafted, written and produced piece of work so that it's polished for any iPod or CD player. I haven't had the chance to listen to the original version of the songs but I don't care to. For now I'll just enjoy her fine album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vinyl I've heard","review":"I bought it thinking, \\"How bad can it be?\\" There is noticeable distortion on the vocals on several tracks (\\"O Sailor\\" and \\"Not About Love\\" are the best examples). The mastering is all over the place, and levels noticeably will jump up and down. Overall everything sounds a bit top-end heavy and tinny. There are also waaaaay more pops and clicks for what should be a brand new vinyl. I didn't think a vinyl could sound so bad - looks like I was wrong! I guess anything from Plain Records is definitely still to be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both versions are worth having","review":"After many listens to both the released and unreleased versions of this album,I am actually changing my original review.I give this released version 4 stars,but I give a combination of the two,5 stars.I was surprised that over the long run,I actually prefer more of the released version.That was not the case initially.Certain tracks on each seemed to drag and not hold up to multiple listenings.Specifically,\\"Better Version of Me\\",\\"Tymp\\"(or \\"Used to Love Him\\") and \\"Window\\" I prefer on the unreleased version.On the other hand,I much prefer the simplicity of the released version of \\"Red Red Red\\".The unreleased is a bit heavy handed and convoluted in production.\\"Not About Love\\", I like both versions~even though they are quite different from each other.The addition of \\"Parting Gift\\" on the released is quite missed on the unreleased.I really enjoy this combination and ,thanks to the internet, we can have the best of both worlds."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!","review":"If I had never heard any of these songs before listening to this version of this album, I would have given it 4 stars. Unfortunately for Fiona, I have heard the leaked version she produced with Jon Brion...and they are FAR superior to the majority of this album. God bless her for not destroying the song Extraordinary Machine the way she did Window and Better Version of Me. The new verion of Red Red Red is better than the original, and the song Parting Gift is the best track on the album. All in all, I'm going to listen to my illegal mp3's of the original instead the retail version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rearranged Songs","review":"Before this album was released, the songs were circulating on the internet, but these songs aren't exactly the same songs.Of the new songs of Extraordinary Machine, two remained unchanged: Extraordinary Machine and Waltz, nine were rearranged and one was a new song: Parting Gift.I think that seven of the nine rearranged songs are better of the bootleg versions. I like more the bootleg versions of \\"Better version of me\\" and \\"Not about love\\". They are rougher and faster than the new versions.But I love this album. It's just excellent. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Fiona Apple is one of the most talented musicians in history. This album does falter at all. Also, don't listen to the people who say that this album is worse than the original (production wise). They are completely different beasts. Having heard both versions of the album I can say that neither is better than the other. The JB version is more lush and orchestrated whild the ME version is tighter and more rhythmic. Either way it is great stuff and her voice is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word of warning about DualDisc","review":"Just a head's up, the album itself is great but the CD audio side of the dual disc will not work with many (if not most) computer CD players. As a result, depending on your specific computer (I personally have an Apple G4 powerbook) you might not be able to burn the tracks and transfer them to an ipod or other portable mp3 players. I've written DualDisc about this and they replied back with a form letter acknowledgine the issue and claiming that they're \\"actively developing technologies\\" to improve playability on CD/DVD-ROM drives, but for now their best advice was for me to try to return the dualdisc and exchange it for the regular CD version (most stores do not allow exchanges of opened CDs/DVDs for different items). I would advise anyone who wants to listen to the album on their mp3 player to play it safe and just stick with the regular CD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique album showing extraordinary talent","review":"Fiona Apple's 2005 offering Extraordinary Machine remains one of the most challenging and strikingly original pop music albums to emerge in the 2000's. Unpredictable, yet pretty melodies and dangerously intelligent lyrics make the record not the kind you play when you chill, but rather when you want to spend your \\"listening energy\\" on something potent. Anytime is plays, it assures of the genius lurking within this artist. Music once reminds of a Broadway show, other time sounds like a composition from 300 years ago played by modern instruments. However, the album never leaves much the realm of pop, which makes it rather -- if not completely and for all listeners -- accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great follow-up to when the pawn...","review":"excellent record...just like a great wine goes well with great food, this is an excellent follow-up to when the pawn (to me her masterpiece) ... listen to her previous album before this one to get the whole picture... excellent, very weird record... fiona is getting even more radical.. and shows she really is one of the best artists of the decade..."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Grammy goes to...","review":"Something happened to Fiona Apple over the course of these post-success/struggle-with-the-industry years. She went from an interesting singer/songwriter to a great singer/songwriter - and great musician.This is Fiona's Great Leap Forward. The album is not only one excellent song after another, but one great decision after another (when to use strings, when to amp up the percussion, when to be slick, when to be raw...). Apple has allied herself with musicians who support and complement her, and the spirit of discovery and that intangible musical magic is all over this cd.I believe Fiona Apple will make better albums in the future, but this is where the real story of her musicianship begins. She's earned her audiences respect and admiration - and our trust. If she'll continue to follow her instincts, and her muse, anyone who's heard Extraordinary Machine will be right there with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, whiny, adolescent transparent attempt","review":"Other than Extraordinary Machine which is an \\"okay\\" song, this is the whiniest, most adolescent, transparent attempt to use a CD to talk to a guy who obviously won't take her calls anymore.

It is not good music and I usually love solo female vocalists."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened....","review":"...to the frank passion and energy of her first release.

Vocally She is about in the same Boat as Hillary Duff,Lindsey Lohan&Ashley Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Extraordinary, all right...","review":"This is truly an extraordinary album.It's extraordinary that Fiona Apple would release a CD that I find so annoying, bland and unlikable, after having loved her first two albums to tears.It's extraordinary in the way that it actually makes me like her first two albums LESS.It's extraordinary, not in that its release was delayed, but in that it was released at all.And finally, it's extraordinary in how quickly this album got moved from my \\"active listening\\" pile to my \\"archives\\" box.What a let-down! I still like her first two albums, but this work will cast a long, dark shadow over her career for many years. Hopefully, she will turn it around on her next album, lest she wake up one day and find that she has devolved into Bjork-esque teeth-grating-nonsense hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm not a huge fan but have really enjoyed some of her prior songs. This album is very disapponting-to me, all of the songs end up sounding similar. There are few hooks, no great musicianship, maybe the lyrics are the attraction, but I don't understand all the great reviews. If you are not a huge fan, I'd think twice before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Wow. What a dissapointment! I am surprised to see so many positive comments on the album, but glad to see that a few know what I am talking about. I have both of Fiona Apple's prior albums and found that this one cannot compare. Maybe she should have stuck with Jon Brion? Maybe there was a reason her record label didn't want to release it?I bought this album based on the title track which I loved when I heard it on the radio, as I felt that this track showed some growth, musically and personally. But the rest of the album seems to lack in melody, direction and substance. Even her lyrics don't seem as profound as before, but that could possibly be because I grew up too.I would NOT recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly Unusual","review":"Fiona is a true artist - her songs are unusual but masterful. I have a lot of respect for those who bring forward their creations when they aren't square or symmetrical but rather just a true reflection of what they feel. Fiona's music is not my typical style, but I bought her CD after hearing Tymps at a dance show. I've listened to the entire album many times and enjoy every song.If you are new to her music I'd recommend sampling Tymps, Extraordinary Machine and Waltz. But, once you get used to her music you'll find it all enjoyable. When you really pay attention to her words you'll find an amazing depth. If you like it I'd also recommend checking out Nellie McKay for some more crazy, unusual creations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, amused, Fiona...","review":"Musically pretty. Fiona has been experimenting with her own music, creating new sensations and illusions; this is just a step further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knobs and more knobs...","review":"Good to a fault... JB's version has more soul, depth and intrigue...Some tracks have improved based on technical merit and cleaner production, but there is no substitute for the \\"original\\" version.JB version - Imagine Fiona playing in a smoky downtown music hall with a troupe of gift musicians. A musical stomp of styles ranging from baroque to chamber to carnival-twirling numbers. Great richness.This version - Imagine Fiona playing solo or with a few musicians at either a university club or a mid-sized music venue. More polished and shiny. More direct. Better than most, but more average in comparison.Great to have two versions, but for those missing out on the original... seek it...(My four-star rating is based on 3.5 stars for musicianship and lyrics, .5 stars for cleaning up a few of the tracks and stripping the rest)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, as always.","review":"If you have an issue with the brilliance of this artist, you are off of your rocker.Artistry is mostly dead, yet Fiona keeps it alive with her wordsmith like vocabulary, and poetic interpretation of even the simplest scenarios."},{"rating":"2","title":"My amazing intro to Fiona Apple!","review":"It's true: I'd never heard a Fiona Apple song before I bought this CD. (I stopped listening to pop radio in 1994.) I bought \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" based on an article about Ms. Apple and a review of the CD that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine ... and I am thrilled with this piece of work.First off, her voice is amazing. So smooth, expressive, versatile and angst-ridden. She sounds like a more sultry version of Tori Amos doing funky cabaret music. Brilliant!Secondly, this gal can really write a song! Catchy melodies, and she can turn a phrase on its ear. Tons of emotion in each of the songs.I'm a fan now, thanks to this great new CD! Keep recording, Fiona Apple ... I'll keep buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Jimmy became Conan.","review":"Gosho Aoyama, Case Closed vol. 1 (ViZ, 1994)Back before I switched cable companies, I got a station called ColoursTV of which I was greatly enamoured. Prime time weekdays was reserved for Funimation, an importer of anime that managed to come up with the some of the coolest shows I've ever seen come out of Japan. One of them, and the one I miss most dearly these days, was Case Closed. So when I found the manga sitting at my local library, I was overjoyed and immediately dove in.Volume 1 gives us the story of Jimmy Kuda, high school super-detective, before he becomes Conan Edogawa. (Because the idea of a high-school super-detective just isn't enough weirdness for a manga, it seems.) We see him solve a few cases, meet some of the main characters, and get himself into the tangle that results in the creation of his alter ego, pint-sized primary-school sleuth Edogawa.

If you are expecting to find the detail and development in her novels, you should look elsewhere. When I bought the book, I was looking forward to a dense read and found instead stories that were thin on plot, development, and text. If you're a die-hard Lynley fan, you might enjoy the one story where he briefly appears. Otherwise, wait until her next novel is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"A puzzle.","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ms. George's work and I was puzzled by this short book of mystery stories. They seemed like something a person would write for an adult education language arts class - maybe they were, for something she was teaching? She joined her students in the exercise? I don't know the background. They seemed like skeletons of stories. Why release them, then? They didn't even serve as something a fan could use to tide her over until the next novel, because her usual characters don't appear (except for a cameo by Lynley and his wife in the first story). Please Ms. George, write another full length novel that features Barbara Havers heavily. It's what a lot of fans are waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the novels, only shorter...","review":"The three short stories in this volume contain all of the elements of George's novels; I was pleasantly surprised that the author displayed her talents so handily in these pieces, and have read each of them more than once. I recommend this book for George fans, George beginners, and anyone who appreciates a well-structured short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nikon Field Guide","review":"As an amateur photographer I found the book to be pretty much a complete waste of time. The author has given no creedence to readers who havn't invested heavily in purely Nikon gear such as lenses and flash units. Descriptions of shooting scenarios are too concise and again apply specifically to all Nikon apparatus.I would have found it more useful if the author had concentrated his advice with information specifically on how to get best use out of the functions available on the camera body itself i.e. Aperature & shutter priority modes when shooting in different conditions. I found the glossary of camera's which takes up a good 100/150 pages to the rear of the book a waste as all this information is copied direct from the user manual of the associated camera's as anyone with the camera's reviewed will know.All in all a very dissappointing read and one which I now never refer to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to have!","review":"Good reference book for field.

Not once. I was so disappointed in the lack of faith and trust in God.Karen has written yet another gut-wrenching, tear-jerker of a story but the spiritual aspect was dismal.I sincerely hope that she quickly abandons this format and returns to her previous way of writing. One that actually contains scripture texts and prayer by the characters instead of angry bitterness and acceptance of circumstances that don't seem to have anything to do with God's grace.Not her best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Karen Kingsbury has long been one of my favorite authors, but this book let me down. I found it exceedingly hard to believe that a thirteen year old boy, with absolutely no roughstock experience, climbed onto a bull and rode for eight seconds. I've seen bullriding--more importantly, I've seen bullriders who have never been on bulls before ride for the first time. NONE of them stayed on.And then Ali--a girl with a fatal lung disease that holds her breath for the better part of twenty seconds? Even if her lungs were in top physical condition, it would be difficult at best, considering the fact that unless she's just hanging on and letting the horse do all the work, she's putting her body under stress and wouldn't be able to hold her breath for quite that long.Ali seemed to have faith in God, but I never saw it in Cody. I wanted to like both of them, but I had a really hard time believing them.

Just when you think she has dealt with most of the controversial issues of life she finds two more to deal with in a way that can't help but touch every reader. Three years can sound a lot longer and a lot more hopeful when you think of it as \\"A Thousand Tomorrows\\". This book's main emphasis is the Downs Syndrome issue as seen because of Cody's brother introduced in \\"Beyond the Clouds\\". The other issue was probably addressed more in the earlier book but continues with some follow up in this the second of this series. I could have read \\"A Thousand Tomorrows\\" as a stand alone book, but was glad that I had found and read \\"Beyond the Clouds\\" first as it made the whole story much richer. Somehow, I had missed it when it first came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary & Juvenile","review":"If you are a reader who enjoys being challenged, this is NOT the book for you.

Powerful with a gift for storytelling that reminds me of Nick Waplington (see Living Room & The Wedding), but Billingham here is much more intimate. The courage to put your family on public view, is breathtaking.So Why do Scala try to mess it all up, with really poor layouts.

All their standard songs were changed to what THEY thought the ALL WHITE AUDIENCE would want. If they sang their normal songs, they would have been great- but they had to be RACISTS. To be RACISTS they held their notes until their voices cracked. They sang louder until they were yelling- yelling to be yelling, not praising. For this reason they were lying- pretending to be praising but were realing singing to suit their own racist minds to please the all-white audience.2. Ray Charles kept on forgeting his lines. At one point he was taken off the stage unexpectingly. Ray Charles should have paid everybody in there to have put up with him.

This twist of personalities helps to make the story interesting.The characterizations and the evoking of a keen sense of place were highlights for me.

Alas it wasn't worth the wait. There are numerous problems with this CD. Firstly, Zan doesn't have an even half decent voice. Secondly the production seems lazy, and predictable, and hasn't lasted the test of time. I only liked \`I wanna be with you'.

Halliday's obsession with Jefferson's sexuality and his speculation about his relationships tells us nothing about Jefferson the man or his legacy. The fact that he is the acknowledged father of several illegitimate children is really of no interest and has no impact on the things he should be remembered for. I am no closer to understanding Jefferson but I might be a little closer to understanding Halliday. Surely he is too young to have been born during the victorian era?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly Clintonesque picture of Jefferson","review":"This is truly a book of speculation, fluff and bad biography.Most of the book focuses on Jefferson's sex life and the author's speculations about it. (Did he or didn't he? Could he or couldn't he?) Even if there were a shred of evidence about any of this, I wouldn't care to know, and since it is all just guesswork, it is even less interesting.It would be a terrible shame if this were the only Jefferson \\"biography\\" that one read. There are so many great Jefferson biographies out there, that your time could certainly be much better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible on several levels","review":"First, Halliday has just re-stated many things that have long since been known about Jefferson and he covers that in a brief overview of Jefferson's life in two chapters. Secondly, he spends too much time on things that are relatively irrelevant. An entire chapter has been devoted to pointing out what he feels is right and what is wrong with all other Jefferson biographers. Lastly, Mr. Halliday doesn't seem to have a decent grasp of English and makes several very distasteful comments. Overall, I say big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"please change the title.","review":"The title is seriously misleading as this book is mainly about Jefferson's relationships with women and his postcript really doesn't make sense.

O'Rourke serves up a stunning batch of whistful pop tunes which will stay in your head for days. This record is more on the acoustic tip, with less pomp than the arrangments on EUREAKA, however that's not to say that the songs aren't complex or engaging. \\"Halfway to a Threeway\\" is certainly the stand-out track with hilarious lyrics, and a sort of Leonard Cohen-ish vibe (like when he has children or soft female voices accompany him).

It's pretty clear that the author is unclear on the concept, sure, some of Al Franken's skits weren't that funny, but that isn't the way to attack a comedian, especially one with such a sharp satirical bent. The truth is, Mauro is just a humorless right wing sorehead, and that's the way he comes off. The cover is a good indicator of what is to come, Franken's cover is funny as it is a play on Limbaugh's, with goofy old Al aping Rush attempting to appear thoughtful, Mauro just takes Al's cover and tries to make him look buck toothed. Funny? No. Original? No. Pointless? Yep. The best comment ion the book, and the most revealing, is where Mauro admits republics don't care if their leaders are politically corrupt (i.e. taking brides) as long as they don't have sex scandals.

Republicans have always been renowned for their biting satirical skills (think of Gordon Liddy and Put Buchanan), but this is perhaps the finest example of the fact that Republicans can do more than speak at racist, anti-Catholic colleges and triple the national debt in eight years ('81-'89)--they are also sans peer as political satirists. With this book, \\"J.P. Mauro\\" demonstrates that someone can actually write three hundred pages worth of \\"jokes,\\" and still fail to include one that is actually funny. No small feat. This book is a truly pathetic attempt to counter Al Franken's brilliant, hilarious \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" (perhaps the most accurately titled book of the '90s) with some right-wing barbs.

As a Republican I was insulted when after reading Mauro's attempt at literature, I found myself asking one question: Since when did liberals get a higher education than a member of the GOP? And why does Mauro choose to advertise this fact to the public? With weak insults to JFK and a basis for wit, Mauro starts up a humorous story line but can't seem to shift out of neutral. A loyalty to the GOP may well be the only reason to even contemplate reading this book, and still, that loyalty must be incredibly strong, like that of a puppy to its master. I was surprised that even I could muster the Republican spirit to agree with even a couple words of Mauro's drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book actually HELPS liberals!","review":"We constantly hear from conservatives, especially Rush Limbaugh, how liberals are \\"touchy\\", and overly \\"sensitive\\" to critisism. Limbaugh makes it a habit to point out that liberals can't handle opposing view points. Well, here we have Mr. J.P. Mauro, a conservative who apparently was so rattled and upset over a COMEDIAN'S book on the conservative icon Limbaugh, that he exposes the conservative side of \\"touchiness\\" by writing this weak, poorly thought out knockoff of Franken's humorous and interesting book. Obviously, conservatives consider any sort of investigation or analysis of Limbaugh to be \\"off limits\\" (how American!), and Mauro displays his lack of wit and integrity throughout this book. It's a perfect example of the conservative mindset of attack and discredit the messanger, even if the messanger has a valid point. So overall, this book actually helps the left by exposing the \\"overly sensitive\\" and desperately touchy attitude of the right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad","review":"I had to stop reading halfway through because this is so awful and painfully bad. Frankin did a nice job with his book - it had flair and wit - but this is trying so hard to wring any humor out that I finally gave away my copy. Find this in a library or borrow it from a friend.Too bad zero stars is not possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you dislike Franken and had your sense of humor surgically removed . . .","review":"This book is a bad response to a well written book by Franken. Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot is a side splitter even if you do not agree with Franken's politics.This is a tired response to Franken's book and an attack on him. I can live with a public person I like being satirized. I am sure that Al Franken would probably agree that no one is above being poked fun at. I was hoping for a good laugh.The problem I have is that this is completely unoriginal and tries to mimic Franken's style too much. Satire requires a subtlety that Mauro fails to deliver. What makes it bad is that it just comes across as an attack and what is worse is that it's just not funny. I think it takes a bit of brilliance to mimic and come across as fresh Mauro just does not have the talent to pull this off. Good effort that falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Book Ever","review":"I believe that the author was trying to write the stupidest book ever, and succeeded grandly.

Personally I found it one of the funniest books in the English Language. But don't take my word for it, read the back, cover flaps, or skim through it. It is brilliant satire from one of ther National Lampoons former editors. witty, insightful, and yes garanteed to offend those with a more \\"Enlightened\\" (Purtanical, judgmental) perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franken's probably laughing at this.","review":"Probably, because he dosen't even know that it exists. It should have been titled \\"Al Franken is a hook-nosed parasite.\\" The Republican party is guilty of perpetrating as many contradictions as Franken's book. Only they are running this country, not Franken. We didn't need this subhuman to elaborately and systematically break down his book for us (well, maybe for some of Limbaugh's slower audience or the one's that gave the book a cursory read). Mauro's vacant humor not helping the brew one bit here. Franken's book was full of witty epigrams and some great caricature and satire. This book only serves to solidify Franken's standing with the left and media. The only literature the right put out in the last few decades that served not to put them in an unfavorable light were, in my subjective opinion, Buckly's Blackford Oakes trilogy. The Jew is laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solo Pollard album you won't need to skip tracks on.","review":"Although there are some Pollard solo albums I've not heard (God, there must be some that even HE hasn't heard), this is my favourite, second only to the previous years' 'Waved Out'. Every song is a winner, or a close second, if 'Waved Out' keeps its top position (certainly of his 96-01 albums) its only because all instruments here are overdubbed by Doug Gillard, with Pollard adding vocals. Resultingly it sounds a little dry and atypically clean at times - the recording process is very obvious - but with such a plethora of great songs, it's not hard to forgive this. And I think there were only 1000 of this pressed! Good God. Then again that's about as many as their first five albums put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain-Bustingly Beautiful indie pop!","review":"The sole savior of indie pop delivers a great set which is greatly enhanced by secret weapon Doug Gillard. The cohesion between lyrics and music is as tight as it gets. Instead of playing name check tag, all the influences blend into a frothy brew. Though if you find Pollard's lyrics to be difuse and obscure, this will not change your mind. Then again if you find Do The Collapse to be too much of a sell out, this album will assure you that Bob is following his paisley pop punk muse where ever it takes him. Get it and get immersed! My unit moves, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of a kind","review":"there will never be a record like this again. every song is great. the production is simple and relaxed. doug's musicianship is utilized here better than on anything he's ever been on (with the possible exception of do the collapse, on which he dominates.) pop zeus. that was my ex-wife's favorite pollard song. god, i miss her. there will never be a record like this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man is amazing","review":"Just when I'm ready to say Pollard's best days are behind him, he cranks out a masterpiece like this. I'm half-tempted to say this is the best GBV related offering since Alien Lanes. This is gorgeous, majestic, old-school Pollard rock. It's like he took a couple huge steps back from the troubled, overwraught Do The Collapse and went back to doing what he does best. I'm still a believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly at times but wide range of music makes it uniche!","review":"Away from solo albums Dweezil trys project with brother Ahmet!

But this album for me came out of nowhere and just blew me away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saga of Andy Burnett","review":"This book was an excellent way to teach American history. My father read it to us and we were spellbound. It covers westward expansion during the years 1830-1860. The bold statement on the Missouri frontier was \\"Manifest Destiny, from sea to shining sea\\" The reader will learn of the exploration of the west by the fur trappers and mountain men but told in a gripping tale of adventure generously salted with factual history.My father's copy contained all four parts of the saga. I have found them all as separate books but I'm still searching for the original. I thought I had found it but when it came it was really just a condensed version of the first book, The Long Rifle renamed as The Saga of Andy Burnett so if it is under 500 pages, you probably don't have the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"blue cats are enlightening!","review":"This book made me laugh and made me cry.

The best read in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A parable of truth and beauty in an ordinary world.","review":"I read this book as a child and love it still as a grandmother.

Sing your own song\\" {From the book} This book is wonderfull for children and all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blue Cat of Castle Town","review":"The copy I received was sent promptly in good shape. This is a lovely paperback children's book about a little blue cat searching for a home to match his song. It has a mature message about the importance of beauty in art, rather than creating art for money alone. It is based on historical information which gives additional interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Thick Cheese","review":"I picked up this album at Target for some Hawaiian background music for a party. What a joke! Every tune is a cover, much of it with synthesizer. One piece even has 3 seconds of dead air while waiting for the track to loop back for a second verse. It's pop for the most part, and doesn't speak Hawaiian at all. If your idea of a luau is a hotel buffet line in a ballroom, or a hibachi bbq in a trailer park, then this disc might do for you.Instead, if you're looking for some authentic Hawaiian music, check out Gabby Pahinui, Dennis Kamakahi, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, Raiatea Helm, and similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun time","review":"The music was great fun.

A comparison between the rural plains on the west and the contemporary city and college on the east. You don't have to be from Kansas to enjoy this book, but will enjoy it more if you ever tried to ride a horse later in life or make a binjy cow do what you want it to do. Just trust me, if you enjoy authentic characterizations of plains people, you will love this book. A cross between a Ken Haruf and a David Sedaris."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic but hilarious","review":"This book is true classic. It is a hilarious account of cattle drive across modern day Kansas. The book is written from the perspective of an city boy who has just graduated from college and takes a job teaching at a small town in western Kansas. He takes a job with a local rancher for extra pay and ends up driving cattle across Kansas. Its more than about cattle but a lot about the characters found on the Great Plains. The route will be a familiar one to Kansans but the drive will be one never to forget for anyone else reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pray there is no sequel.","review":"If you are a native of Kansas this book may be a delight. One gets a profound sense of the bifurcation of the Kansas Plains to the industrial machinations of city life. However, if one is looking for literature I recommend looking elsewhere. Even though Cattle Drive is a delightful little tale it leaves the reader with a bad taste in his or her mouth. Why? There is an implicit urge present in the story that verges on Egotism of the highest sort where it is obvious the author struggles not with narrative but his own fascination at his ability to type words. Moreover, the novel would work better if the voice were autodiegetic instead of didactic. If you found that last sentence furstrating don't read the book. Incidently I do recommend the movie City Slickers with Billy Crystal, a tour de force of cinematic comedy. Crystal got it right. Day didn't. Sorry, Mr. Day I hope your next novel acheives what this one obviously aspries to but ultimately fails at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is the best of Chaikin!

But it's not just rhythm - there's an intelligent structure and organic pulse to this CD that begs to be played over and over again.

Manufacture recommends the case length to be at least 2 inches longer than the rifle, however, I believe it should be 3 inches of clearance to be safe. There's lots of stress on the zipper at the end corner due to the tight fit, so the teeth are mangled but functional. Lesson learned, make sure to have at least 3 inches of clearance.I can still use this case. I never really planned on using the strap because it turns the rifle upside down (scope on bottom) and I was concerned about damaging the scope when placing the case on the ground.The price is right, however, I would recommend passing on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for price","review":"I received this today, it was better than expected.I found the padding to be good, 5 pockets for storage fit magazines nicely.The shell looks like cordura or similar, zippers feel sturdy.I found it to be a tight fit for my colt with the clip installed, much better with the clip removed, and 36\\" just long enough.Nice case for the money, exactly what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Case","review":"Good gun case.

The only reasons I saw that people didn't give it five stars are that it didn't fit their mags (it fits mine perfectly), and it was too short (really folks...don't but a 32\\" case for a 30\\" gun). I highly recommend this case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"Purchased the 36\\" digital Camo case for my AR. Impressed with the quality, expected less for only $17!

After reading reviews after reviews, i concluded this bag was the best bang for the buck. Although, my AR(rock river arms lar-15) fits nicely inside, it seems like the bag was not thick enough. I noticed last week that the butt side of the bag has a large rip on the seam, where the zipper has torn apart from the fabric. I'm not thrilled about it, because now i assume this product was so cheap because it was cheaply made. I'll probably have to end up buying some blackhawk $100 bag now.

For example: the Handles on the NcStar case are of a heavier more comfortable construction, the zipper features two pulls instead of one (which I personally prefer as it gives you options for how you open the case), and the padding is thicker.Note: The 36\\" case is just about perfect for a Beretta CX4 with Magpul AFG fore grip and Trijicon Reflex sight (the 32\\" case would be too short) and you would probably need the 38\\" case if you add the barrel shroud (which I haven't)For $20 this case is a definite buy. If it survives normal usage (back and forth to the range and storage) for more than a year I would up the rating to a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case!","review":"The pockets work great for storing clips or other items.

The case is completely different from the item that they advertise. Instead of individual magazine pockets on the exterior there is one zippered pocket. I specifically ordered this case for the individual pockets, not for one pocket that can hold maybe 3-4 mags. Everything that I have ordered from or through Amazon, I have been happy with up to this point. I can't say how good or bad the case is since I just received it but, I'm not happy about the misleading advertising. I hope I'm the only one that got screwed."},{"rating":"1","title":"36\\" Not as pictured","review":"The 36\\" case looks nothing like the one pictured. It's shorter in height, and doesn't include the magazine pouches. This wasn't made for an AR, as pictured, either. I would suggest not buying these if you're looking for a case for your AR15. My basic 16\\" barrel basic carry handle AR with no accessories barely fits. My 16\\" barrel flat top AR with an Eotech and Magpul stubby VFG won't fit, even with the stock collapsed completely. Lame.I feel a bit cheated here as the picture shows an entirely different bag with an AR15 in it. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great basic gun case","review":"this gun case is great quality for the money. the exterior is high quality ballistic nylon and the interior is a nice soft fabric (interior fabric is navy blue, so don't be surprised) with plenty of padding.

I put my SKS in this thing and it worked amazingly I loved it. But the pockets on the side of the case weren't big enough for the 30 round SKS mags and it certainly did not like the \\"duck bill\\" on the mags. I just through the mags in a bag. It's not like you're going to haul your gun around with the mags loaded in the pockets anyways. Well, maybe you but not me.

The writing is too full of weak coding analogies based on irrelevant stories from the author's past; it fails to provide concrete examples that would give form to the abstract principles of Object Oriented Programming. In short, it fails.The book will suit you best if you've trolled the Flashcoders list for the past few years, but for many more of us, the leap from 0-250 mph is far too jarring.

My favorites are the yearning \\"Future Boy,\\" beautifully sullen \\"Ma Solituda,\\" and stately \\"Thunderbird.\\" The greatest thing about Catherine Wheel is that they haven't really broken through so you can catch them at a club to truly experience the power of their music. Adam and Eve posesses considerable musical diversity. The mellower stuff reminds me of James (on Seven and Laid) while the aggressive stuff sounds something like Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream with far more ear-pleasing vocals. If you wish Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, and the '85-'88 version of U2 could fuse into one band, you may have found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I still like Catherine Wheel a heck of a lot.I wonder if the new direction of \\"Adam\\" caused the bands' riff. Seems like they're trying to replicate \\"Cats and Dogs\\". They would be better off trying to write \\"A\\" sides again.Here's less melody on melody, more forward vocals (thus more noticable lyrics, cry-boy, slightly sappy), and that formerly trendy \\"unplugged\\" feel (well sort of).I've listened to this quite a few times waiting for the dawn of understanding some others mention. To no avail. DAMN!Concept album or no, this is not a must buy. I kept waiting for a home-run like \\"Idle Life\\" or \\"The Nude\\". Nothing. Not even close.I'm glad \\"Wishville\\" showed up.

I almost made that mistake. On my first two listens, the only songs i liked were tracks 3, 4, 5 and 7. Disappointed with the album (especially after the acclaim my fave radio station gave it), I slipped it into the shelf along with my plethora of crappy Canadian-Rock CD's. Well, I decided to pop it back in after a year and a half of growth in my musical palate, and I was glad I did. I was blown away by many of the songs I did not enjoy at first. My faves now include \\"Ma Solituda\\", \\"Here Comes The Fat Controller\\" and \\"For Dreaming\\", but I still like \\"Delicious\\" and \\"Satellite\\".

I highly reccomend this album, or any Catherine Wheel album for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Listen","review":"I'm not a CW fan, but this is a very good listen. The alt-rock mood pieces are well performed and excellently produced. A minor complaint - not enough of the album stuck with me; I start to forget pretty much the whole thing soon after listening. The songs that stick in mind - \\"Delicious\\", \\"Here Comes the Fat Controller\\", and especially \\"Goodbye\\" - are quite good, however. Check out the samples, then pick it up if it piques your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crap on a cracker!","review":"Surprisingly, it took me awhile to really get into these guys. As much as I love the Stooges, MC5 and Radio Birdman I also like a little originality. I used to listen to 3 or 4 songs and then have to take this off and put on the first Radio Birdman record. But now I really enjoy this record and Volume 2. The only dud on here for me is their version of Gimme Shelter, but I don't like the original either.

I'll stick with Booker T and the MG's).Check out Mighty High...In Drug City."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classic books on the solar system","review":"Written in the style of a traveller's guide book, the authors take you on an interplanetary cruise describing each body in detail. The book runs from the largest (the Sun) to the smallest objects (comets and tiny asteroids) in the solar system. The illustrations are either photos from spacecraft that have visited the various planets and moons, or are hypothetical paintings based on what the surfaces may look like. One particularly striking painting is of the surface of Pluto, with the sun as a mere bright speck in the sky.I'd recommend this book to anyone with a passing interest in astronomy or the planets, it's a great read and never gets obtusely technical. Ron Miller and William K. Hartmann are without a doubt the finest planetary artists around today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I remember when I was a kid, this book was the first book I read from cover to cover.

Louise Bernikow not only captured the unique character consistently found in Boxers, but she kept the year-long story lighthearted and funny. This is a beautifully documented love story between woman and dog and how, in the helping of one, the other was healed. I looked forward every day to my lunchbreak where I would do more reading than eating. I've since passed my copy of this book on to my mother who will then pass it on to my daughter.

The inside jacket flap sounded great, so I checked it out. I did not, however, read the Amazon reviews before reading it; I wish I had. When I got to the part where she kicked Libro I was sickened and wanted to throw my borrowed book across the room. This proves that even an empty, selfish person who would be so mean as to even threaten to kick an already scared and pitiful dog - let alone kick him in the ribs \\"hard\\" - can write, and apparently sell a book. I wish Libro had bitten her - hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puttin' On the Dawg","review":"The reason I picked up this book was because there was a picture of a Boxer on the cover. The only thing that kept me reading it was that I was dying to see if Louise ever got poor Libro's bad leg checked out. I could have skipped to the last chapter to find that out but the story does give one an insight on dog ownership in New York. It is a completely different experience than anyplace else. The author is far too self-centered to own a pet. The dog seems more like an accessory that the author values less than her little black book. Maybe Libro can teach her a thing or two about unconditional love and the difference between love and lust. I never got the impression that Louise loved Libro. He was more like a puzzle to figure out and cope with. Even the title tells him to bark if he loves her. Get over yourself, lady!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow story that lacked insight","review":"I love memoirs and I love dog stories, but I found this book to be painfully shallow and whiny and too self-indulgent. A good memoir to me sheds new light on \\"the human condition\\" but all this sheds light on is the author's endless condition, and I found her hard to care about it. DOn't waste your time on this. Caroline Knapp did this story already, and she did it a thousand times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a real dog!","review":"I am a dog lover and usually I find books like these to be entertaining and sentimental. This one has a mock heroic, self-congratulatory air about it.

Until I got to the part where the author's dog eats part of her organizer one day when she is out. The author writes, \\"I kicked him, hard.\\" I was appalled! This woman adopted an ABUSED animal and then beat it the first time it did anything wrong? Anyone who has ever lived with a pet knows that you have to be flexible with regards to housetraining and chewing and all of that, and I just couldn't relate to the author at all after reading that passage.

Also check out John Entwistle's songs, always great black humor: \\"Doctor Doctor,\\" \\"Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde\\" (which supposedly was about Keith Moon, who unfortunately was already developing a love affair with the bottle and whose personality as such changed whenever he got inebriated), and \\"Someone's Coming.\\" And of course you can't forget the anthem \\"Magic Bus.\\" What more can you say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Ride This Magic Bus","review":"It would be generous indeed to describe most early Who albums as uneven.

For the casual browser - warning! This is NOT a live album, as it would appear from the title. These are all studio recordings, many of them B-sides to singles issued between 1965-67.For the more devoted collector, worth getting for \\"Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde\\".For the merely curious - save your money, and buy \\"The Who Sell Out\\" instead.

I do know that this is the version (from the single) of \\"Magic Bus\\" that I always loved from AM radio, and I still consider it vastly superior to the other short version with more talking in the break that is sometimes found on other Who greatest hits albums, and it's vastly superior to all live versions I've heard, which always omit the great percussion instruments (maracas & claves) and substitute electric guitar for acoustic guitar. There are quite a few great-sounding songs in typical old Who style here, especially \\"Magic Bus,\\" \\"Call Me Lightning,\\" \\"Run Run Run,\\" and \\"Doctor Doctor,\\" so overall I was pleased. \\"Disguises\\" is another decent song that would be much better if it didn't have those loud, annoying, scraping sound effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Musical Feast by the Famous Philadelphians","review":"This CD is one among a handful of fantastic (live) recordings by the Philadelphia Orchestra.This one was recorded (live) 1993 at Suntory Hall-TOKYO ,during their annual concert world tour.This great recording was conducted by one of their most well loved conductor's (Wolfgang Sawallish) pro nounced / SUH VOL LISH.The music on this disc was well chosen,played & recorded with the great accoustics of the hall.

The duets and lyrics are fantastic. Perfect production by Jimmy Iovine. I would probably give way too much to have another solo CD from Robin Zander. The man can sing anything.

I thought that Robin was going to go alittle heaver and go balls to the wall. Well, I was wrong. So, I let this cd sit for about a year or two before I gave it another try. Well, second time was a charm. I really liked it. The first two songs are great songs. (#1 reactionary girl) and (#2 i've always got you). Then skip to the best song on the cd( #5 time will let you know).

A French Sesame Street for adults. I found the CDs interesting -- often the vocabulary included words that had not been introduced so it made understanding a real challenge. I have trouble enough hearing the French even when I *know* what the words are.I purchased this text because an alternative language school designated it for beginning French. Interestingly, they barely use it, instead coming in every week with copied material from other sources.A note on the book itself. It is made of very slick paper with a lot of pictures and color graphics (see Sesame Street above) so don't get it wet. I spilled a cup of coffee, and all the pages *instantly* glued themselves together. My book is completely ruined.

I recently bought their newest release, \\"God Will Make A Way\\". Their sound hasn't changed a lot over the years. It's still that endearing hometown gospel sound that isn't found much any more. I love them. They don't have the \\"beautiful voices\\" of some of today's more contemporary artists, but because I've met and gotten to know them personally, I know that they are some of the warmest and most goodhearted people in the gospel industry. This release, \\"By His Spirit\\" is good. It's not all Tiffany (Tu-Tu) anymore. Amy and Tamara (Tammy) get to show off their vocal talents as well and it's a very nice well-rounded album. I hope to hear even more from them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply, the best","review":"this is a very special album that reminds me most of Motorhead's first album. it is not as fast as many expect, but it churns out more power than the hoover dam. i don't really want to write a review, i just want to offset the one star vote by some fool who can't tell a classic when he hears it. this should have been another grammy nomination for the band because it is heavier than any other disc on the shelves today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorhead the kings of metal!","review":"This is some true hard metal music.

I was expecting a bit of a faster album like the last one. This one is more a rock n roll CD done Motorhead style. I think overall it is one of their better releases in the last few years-all the songs are very good. My faves are Dr. Love, No Remorse and the thrasher Red Raw.My only complaint - they included a live version of Overnight Sensation - I wished they had included a live version of a song that didn't appear on Everything Louder live CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorhead still got it","review":"Motorhead, formed by Lemmy back in 1975, have provided us with some excellent albums and some not quite as good. But this one - Hammered - is absolutley one of the better since \\"Overnight sensation\\" or even \\"1916\\". One this record Lemmy and Co give us a rather melodic Motorhead, and it shows the band's blues and rock 'n' roll roots (just listen to the riff to \\"Mine all mine\\"). \\"Hammered\\" includes some tracks that have the potential to be classics as time goes on, such as \\"Walk a crooked mile\\", \\" Brave new world\\" and \\"Shut your mouth\\" to name a few.

I gave up and went to a dermatologist after trying to battle occasional breakouts, combination skin ( or i think that's what it is. . .it's oily, it's dry,... it's everything thrown together), and facewashes that left my face feeling tight. This is what she gave me. She uses it and the Neutragena Moisture with SPF 15...and that's it. Oh, and Aveno lotion on the rest of her body. No other products. No wrinkle cream. No eye cream.

It's not original (or not enough)... so to me, it doesn't make it back into the ol' cd player. Lets face it, we all have talent, but, it's that extra special twist, jive or groove you put into that talent that make runners constantly return to the starting tape. She just doesn't seem to have that (yet). Course, it doesn't hurt to be beautiful.. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana where are you?","review":"In her earlier tribute to Nat King Cole, Diana Krall seemed focused on the music-that is, great jazz tunes made greater by Mr. Cole. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel she simply sang each melody with wonderful timing, a luscious voice, and topped each off with uncomplicated but amazingly interesting piano.With this CD I was immediately struck by the fact that this recording was not about the music at all, but instead was all about Diana Krall. She seemed to be hamming it instead of singing. What happened to the melodies? Where was the piano? Where is the respect for the songwriter?Boozy drawling is OK, but Diana Krall can do much, much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I don't get it......","review":".......but I don't think Diana Krall can hold a candle to many of the other jazz vocalists of yesterday and today. Her voice is great and her stylings are all right, but the song arrangements are mediocre at best and despite the ability of the other musicians on her cd's, her own playing is little more than chords with an occasional 8 bar left hand riff. A jazz pianist she is not. If you want new female vocal jazz, you're better off with Stacy Kent or Weslia Whitfield."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Candle-Light Jazz","review":"This is a fantastic CD for \\"making out\\".These classic jazz tunes are well mixed and Krall's voice and piano are nothing short of amazing! There are many slow songs, like \\"Peal me a Grape\\", \\"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance...\\", and \\"I Miss You So\\" and upbeat tunes like \\"All or Nothing at All\\" and \\"How Deap is the Ocean\\" for good variety.This CD playing, a light meal and chilled white wine (with the right company) makes a memorable evening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit down and relax...","review":"Being next to her just as she sings... simply couldn't get better than that! As a jazz freak, it is nice to settle down and just enjoy little nicely composed tunes, in all sense just a great work! Very standard preserved jazz, well structured and entertaining, and Diana's piano skills just add more and more to the scene, not to mention her consonant beautiful voice that is always precisely adding more harmonic structure overall. The girl is talented, no doubt, but I recognize other than her virtuosity the fact that she sticks to her style, and she does it like few others, Sarah Vaughan et al... Great music, just get it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album by the premier female jazz singer of our time.","review":"This album is a wonderful blend of Diana singing swinging jazz, playful jazz and romantic jazz.

I am a big fan of a good love song, and Diana does a great job of putting her own special stamp on these old favorites. I recently had the pleasure to see her in concert (if you have the chance to see her live, I highly recommend it) where she performed many tunes from this album. I couldn't wait to get home and pop this CD in the stereo. Her soft sultry voice lends a great deal of passion and emotion to each song, from the fun and enjoyable \\"Peel Me a Grape\\" to the warm and soft \\"Gentle Rain\\".

Take all the best qualities of every great female singer you have ever known and put them all together. Diana Krall is even better than that. Just the right amount of breathiness with an outstanding clarity and a distinctive catchiness makes her voice easy to listen to, over and over. Her piano licks are marvelous too. In fact, I wouldn't mind having her do an all piano album. And it doesn't stop there. The album cover has several pictures of her that make me think Diana could hold her own with the supermodels. For goodness sakes, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired vocal & keyboard interpretations of old favorites","review":"Diana continues souful renditions of old favorites in the same vein of her \\"All for You\\" release.

A must for any jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational stuff","review":"I heard of Krall a year ago and she hasn't ceased to surprise me with her soulful , jazzy voice.

As the reviewer said, \\"if you're looking for the album to play while watching the city lights at 2 a.m., this is it.\\" Enjoy \\"Peel Me a Grape\\" and the great guitar/bass solos on \\"I Don't Know Enough About You\\" \\"Lost Mind\\"This is silky smooth, luxurious jazz, so well done and mixed.

He becomes a thief while parading around like the greatest detective since, er, Sherlock Holmes. Sheer stupidity. Tacking the name \\"Holmes\\" on it just adds insult to injury. I didn't finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study in subtle horror","review":"This is the story of some little girls. Girls who were about to die, and were given a new life, but the cost of that new life is to become inhuman. They become cyborgs; a little bit human, and a lot machine. The reason these girls were rescued from certain death was not altruism. Their new life is as assassins under the direction of their \\"big brothers\\". The series is set in Italy, so the \\"siblings\\" are referred to as \\"fratelli\\".They may be the most lethal little ladies around, but they are still little girls. Their emotions and reactions are those of young girls.Strongly recommended if you want a series that mixes masses of gunfire with some thought-provoking moral questions.The series is beautifully animated (something that sadly declines in the second season). This Bluray version shows off the beauty of the animation. I liked the DVD version, which was a good clean transfer, but the Bluray transfer is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teddy Bears and Bullets","review":"Do the ends justify the means? Apparently, in this animation, the Italian government believes so as they secretly programming young adolescent girls to become killers. The series never glorifies what is being done to these girls, it just tries to explore the many consequences and paradox between innocence and bullets.The storyline is well thought out, the drama and action scenes are good, and the character development is so well done that it could bring you to tears for the situation these girls have to go through.This animated series went on for two seasons and I wish they continue to do more, although it doesn't seem likely. As of this writing, the original manga is only now coming to a conclusion and it looks like it's going to be a tragic one.Although it's sad and has no comedy relief I think this is one of the best dramatic animated series I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I waited months for this to be released and was sorely disappointed by the video quality of this blu-ray. Generally love videos on blu-ray. When a blu-ray release is done well, the clarity and video is literally breathtaking. I can only assume that this is a DVD upscale since it is absolutely terrible.Had I known this I would have never bought this blu ray. There is no point in buying this when the DVD release is readily available. You essentially bought a DVD that cant be played on DVD players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving lives or making things worse?","review":"An organization helps young girls on the brink of death, but the cost is a hefty one. While they do save the girls lives they are used as assassins and put in high risk situations. Each girl is put into a group of two people which they use the italian word for brother and sister to call them by. These girls though have stronger feelings for their \\"brother\\" than any family relation. It's a sad and complicated story with action scenes, but they are not the main focus. It's short being only 12 to 13 episodes, but it is very good. The art work gives a plain feel which fits to the story and helps draw you into the characters. It's also fairly depressing so be prepared for that. This is a must have for my anime blu-ray collection and is better than the second series. I do recommend this title to anyone who is interested in story driven animes."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"2 or 3 good songs, the rest is not even remotely metal- not even rock music! someone please tell me what the @#*# is \\"American Trilogy\\"??!!

This would be a pretty good album, IF the entire Manowar catalog previous to this didn't exist. It just doesn't measure up. The fast, heavy tunes are just re-hashes of previous tunes, with the usual paint-by-number lyrics. You could just write a bunch of words on index cards, such as \\"death,\\" \\"blood,\\" \\"sword,\\" \\"metal,\\" \\"wind,\\" \\"battle,\\" \\"black,\\"etc. etc. Pick these cards one-by-one out of a hat and you've basically written a Manowar song.It seems the bands only purpose for existence now is to sell tons of merchandise with the Manowar logo.

Their lyrics sound like a little kid has been trying to write some poem for kindergarden or elementary school. Just listen it careffuly: fight, fight fight for the world , fight for the king, kill who doesn't like the heavy metal etc etc etc. What a hell is wrong with them??? It is so stooopid.Their first albums were good, and music is awesome, even in the \\"Louder than hell\\", but this album is a total joke plus primitive lyrics.

Many may view this as a toned down effort, with odd tributes (one most notably to a bunch of Elvis fans), the album still comes off as a typical concentrated effort from the Kings of Metal. Eric Adams sounds better than ever, and with such lyrics as \\"I'll hunt you down and tear you limb from limb\\" one can be sure that Manowar has not lost their edge.There are, however a couple of surprises, like the famous operatic Nessun Dorma, and this is where Eric Adams truly shows his versatility in vocals. 6 year absence, two stellar live albums, and now this, Manowar truly show that they are Warriors of the World, fight for metal, metal that's real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I really enjoy this album, as Call to Arms, Warriors of the World United, and Hands of Doom are perfect for when I'm playing Warhammer Online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warriors of the World by Manowar CD","review":"The Warriors of the World CD by Manowar is a VERY interesting blend of music- Heavy Metal to Classical. \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is from a Puccini Opera. \\"American Trilogy\\" (originally done by Elvis Presley) reprises the War Between the States.

But the most important part of the Rosenstolz music is the voice of AnNa R., the lead singer who had a classic music-education in the former GDR.

It was quiet, light-weight and easy to maneuver between my flower beds and lawn. It had a handy guide for edging along pavement. My only complaint was its so-so power. The battery would sometimes run out before I was done, but that was usually at the beginning of the season when the trim areas were particularly overgrown. After many faithful years, the Black & Decker died.So I thought I'd try the Troy-Bilt. It's louder than a German biplane. It's much heavier than a cordless and feels even heavier for each minute of use. It's impossible to maneuver between my flower beds and lawn. And, you have to buy the separate edger attachment if you want a pavement guide. I used my new Troy-Bilt twice.

I have taken it apart and now will see how costly the parts are, and how difficult they will be to install. I am not satisfied because I bought Troy Bilt thinking this product would last a long time with minimal repairs.

This thing is so hard to start and once you get it running it stalls every 10 seconds, again thought it has to just be me .. nope was recently telling a friend how much I hate my weed whacker and he chimes in how he hates his as well and has the same problems, go figure he has the same POS . Lucky for me it just died and I got a new one -different brand- and this is when i realized what a hunk of junk the troy bilt was.

I was wrong. I had this trimmer for two years and last week the motor just seized up. I have no idea why. It has a significant design flaw. The pull string should be elsewhere on the trimmer. It is situated right next to the motor. When starting, if you pull too closely to the motor the plastic housing will shred your knuckles. I cannot tell you how many times I have torn the skin on my knuckles starting this thing. I finally resorted to wearing gloves every time I used it. Also, after a season, it was extremely hard to start- and I service my stuff. In addition when it got hot it would run smoothly for ten minutes then shut off and it was nearly impossible to start again. No way, I would recommend this string trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"All terribly arty","review":"I suppose I should have realised that if I hated \\"L'Avventura\\", I would probably hate this, too.

This is the last film of the Antonioni tetrology with Monica Vitti to come out on DVD and it is very good to add it to the DVD editions of L'Avventura, La Notte, and Il Deserto Rosso.This film is a long way from the almost Vergillian mood of L'Avventura. There is more of Persona here, and a foretaste of The segments in the EUR district south of Rome are haunting. The final minutes are--if you haven't heard--unforgetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute...","review":"A very cute, sweet, quick read for your child.

Having just finished it off today, I came to check out the reviews and i was completely surprised.\\"5 stars? comparable to Dan Brown?\\" I am not one to disparage my country or my compatriots but I believe that these reviews are extremely over-rated.I found the style childish and immature; if the subject hadn't been so adult I would seriously have thought that I had bought a children's book by mistake. I was also annoyed by the large number of mistakes in the book, there are several name swappings which make it quite confusing.While i can only encourage Mrs Anderson to keep on writing, I would be a hypocrite in saying that i found this book an inspiring read. It is perhaps adequate for a magazine story, but it is far from the standard i expected in a novel.

This CD is full of short guitar pieces by masters such as Villa-Lobos, etc, and every song is beautiful and well crafted. None of the music featured on this CD is cheap - it is top quality latin classical guitar music. Another reason to get this CD is that many of the songs featured on this CD are rare and not easy to find. Lastly, the sound quality is surprisingly good and most audiophiles won't be disappointed.Currently on amazon, this CD is going for 99 cents used.

The book title is somewhat misleading, since the book forays into Crete (the fabulous center section, I wish he had expanded into a book of its own), and ranges all across the Greek world through history as well as geography, although Northern Greece, and some of her strangest corners, are well served. The prose is gorgeous, in a sort of Edwardian fashion, and very erudite. Fermor is obviously a polymath, and his understanding of Greece (and apparently the Greek language) extraordinary. This is a book I treasure: I've bought multiple copies to share with relatives and friends. If you are the least bit interested in modern Greece, and smart enough to do a crossword puzzle, I suspect this could become one of your favorite books as well. Just buy the damn thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It will definitely grow on you if you're a Wyclef fan","review":"If you read the review on this site and in Time magazine, you wouldn't even want this cd if it was given to you for free. Well, a friend gave me this cd and warned me that it isn't as good as his previous work. I gave it a chance and the first 2 times I agreed that it wasn't that good. But then since there are some catchy tunes on it, I thought i'd give it a few more listens and then return it if i really couldn't hang. I must say that it's definitely worth buying. The tracks i live best are \\"oh what a night\\" \\"daddy\\" \\"peace god\\" and the reggae track \\"war no more\\". If you like caribbean songs, you'll love the bonus track \\"mvp kompa\\".

This man is a genius, I used to listen to this one and Preacher's Son over and over again until I learned the lyrics by heart. I miss him when he came to Boston but I still check once in a while to see if he has any new material or if he is coming close by to go see him. I enjoy his work, he is THE MAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"clef can't miss","review":"I was expecting something wild, out of the ordinary, and eclectic. And thats exactly what i got with this CD. Wyclef as usual goes all out on his effort mixing in different rhythms and songs that any other rapper wouldnt dare touch and turns it into something all his own. You'll hear remakes of Bob Dylan, Tom Jones, and the December 1963 (oh what a night) song. And while the songs are entertaining and infectious, they could have been made better. The lyrics are the same, just about every song about how much he suffered in the projects and everything, and it gets old after awhile because that was the subject matter of his 2 previous CD's. There are some great standout tracks on the CD (keep it gangsta, pj's, daddy, etc) while there are some that are just mediocre. It is a great rap CD and better than almost anything else you will find out there, but i dont think it measures up to his last album, the eclectic. But i'd reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but too many skits, a great buy though","review":"This is a great album, my favorites(in order best to worst): Peace God, Two Wrongs, PJ's, Masquerade.

There's not much actual gore in any sort of interesting or convincing way so you don't have that. There's no nudity so you don't have that. Not a single scene played for laughs but not a real scare either. What is it those people liked about it? Oh, yeah, they liked that someone paid them to give this a good review. Hell, the DVD isn't even anamorphic...in this day and age. A new dvd. WTF? And Flavor Flav's introduction? He shows up and says, \\"I'm the Timekeeper\\" and walks off. Literally, that's it.

He plays piano with a big sound, very often just chords. The band he assembled for this date could hardly be bettered. Michael Brecker and Randy Brecker team up to produce some luscious sounding but intricate duos, and Michael's solos are especially fine--harmonically inventive and technically thrilling. Ron Carter is his usual elegant and perceptive self, adding a grace note to the splendid ensemble. This is hard driving music that is not afraid to take a look at itself and smile. The sound engineering is brilliant, among the best I've ever heard on a jazz recording. I have no idea why this is out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Not really sure what happened here. Billed as a reunion with esteemed past members of the Horace Silver Quintet (especially the Brecker Brothers), this CD disappoints. The batch of tunes Horace assembled is quite undistinguished, mostly simple blues forms with some hesitant soloing by the leader. Each tune seems like a pastiche of a real Silver song.Obviously, he was told there would be no vocalizing this time out, even though he had written a complete batch of lyrics. Was Horace disappointed? Resentful? I also think that symptoms of his later affliction may have begun to appear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Night's Dream~Marcel Khalife","review":"An awesome album filled with emotions, sweet toons and the silenced voice of an entire generation. Marcel khalife is a master composer whose songs and rhythms celebrates the beauty of Levantine (oriental \\"Middle East\\") culture and the aspiration of its people.

Although there are few complete performances here, the DVD is marred by the frequent and all too predictible overtalk by the punter who narrates the DVD, riuning the said performances. In addition to the annoyance of such narration, the people who do it usually don't know as much about the band in question as those viewing the DVD. Bottom line. Pass on this. If you want high quality Kinks performances, I'm certain you will be able to find plenty of \\"alternative\\" DVDs out there.Don't buy this garbage or anything like it.

I am a die-hard Kinks fan and I couldn't even make it half way through. . . the video quality and sound quality are dreadful, and to be honest, it just seems like they pieced together various clips together with no rhyme or reason to it. If you want to watch a high quality documentary on the history of the Kinks I recommend going to iTunes and downloading The Biography Channel's fantastic Kinks documentary for $1.99!! It is cheaper and 100000000x better than this waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be the worst DVD ever released","review":"Thank god I had the good sense to check this out from the library before buying. I can't stress enough what a waste of money this DVD would be. The production value of this is only slightly better than some of the videos I put together in high school back in the 80's. Poor video, poor audio, poor naration. Just a complete mess all around. The Kinks deserve so much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves the highest recommendation to fellow music lovers from all walks of life","review":"You Really Got Me: The Story of The Kinks is a rousing DVD collection of footage from The Kinks, one of few British bands that has been commercially successful in America.

The movie mixed Gavin Friday rockers with Van Morrison's Madam George with The Buffalo Springfield's For What It's Worth and added several really great songs by virtual unknowns. Unfortunately, whoever selected the songs for this CD thought commonplace marginal songs like Patti Page's How much is that doggie in the window or Bobby Goldsboro's Honey was the key to capturing the essense of this movie. It boggles the mind. There are a few good songs on the CD like Sugar Baby Love,Children of the Revlolution and a Gavin Friday or two song but It's unfortunate that you can't get all of the really good songs from this movie and have to settle for watching the movie so that you can hear snippits of the best songs in the movie....but I'd rather do that than listen to dribble like Morris Alberts Wedding fare, Feelings.

It does have some bugs and seasonal stuff in it but not to much boyish stuff. Dont get me wrong, this is a very good book with lots of stuff in it, just no to much for boys.

Hopefully the next one will reach back more to the underground."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP Does It Again","review":"When I first heard about Our Lady Peace's newest CD, I was so excited! And the boys definitely didn't let me down. I listened to All For You with an excited smile on my face. If the first song is this good, imagine what the rest of the CD holds in store! Halfway through Do You Like It, only the second song on the album, it was official- I already loved Gravity. It is certainly a different album for the band, but even so, we don't miss out on OLP's unique sound because of songs like Made Of Steel, Sell My Soul, and Bring Back The Sun. New guitarist, Steve Mazur, has brought a new, bigger sound to the band, which helps the new songs ROCK! Part of the reason I adore this album so much is that I find myself relating to the lyrics of a lot of the songs. It's hard to relate to lyrics these days, because most of the popular songs are all the same. But once again, OLP has managed to stand out in the sea of sameness. Their diverse sound, songs, and attitude have won my heart again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Lady Peace does it again","review":"OLP has done it again with their new release, Gravity. Occasionally recalling hits from their previous 4 releases (most notably Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch), the Canadian group breaks new ground musically on this album. Songs such as the opener, All for You, and the increasingly gritty Not Enough bring back the edge seen on the band's earlier CDs, while the soaring Sell My Soul, Bring Back the Sun, and the debut single Somewhere Out There scream \\"radio-friendly\\". Raine Maida's lyrics still retain the dark optimism that led the band to their previous success, yet somehow seem more straightforward. This album seems destined to propel these rockers to the top of the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not their best","review":"Out of the 10 songs on this album, 7 of them are good or better. Those 7 are similar to songs from their last album \\"Spiritual Machines\\" but have a little more of an edge. But Our Lady Peace is still more mellow and soft than other rock bands. \\"Spiritual Machines\\" is a better album than this album and is probably the greatest Our Lady Peace album ever. But This album still has some great Our Lady Peace songs like \\"Somewhere Out There,\\" \\"Innocent,\\" and \\"Sorry.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best","review":"I love OLP, and I have for years. That's part of the reason why I won't listen to this album. I gave it 2 stars simply because this band can't produce anything that completely sucks. The 'pro' who reviewed this album for amazon.com must not have listened to any of OLP's other albums, because it's a crime to say they aren't 'inventive'. Listen to Clumsy, to Naveed, and especially to Happiness..., but leave this record for the radio. I understand there's a point in any musicians life where you just want to make a buck, but when OLP moved in this new direction, they lost a lot of what makes thier fans love them. I'll always support OLP, but I can't listen to this album without wondering is they've left their fans behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I am a huge fan of Our Lady Peace. I became a fan about 4 years ago with \\"Happiness is not a fish you can catch,\\" and my love for them skyrocketed with \\"Clumsy,\\" and \\"Spiritual Machines,\\" so when I found out \\"Gravity\\" was coming out, I took the first chance I got to pre-order it. And what did I think when I heard it? \\"Is this the same band?\\" They lost almost all of their individuality with this album. Gone are the soulful lyrics of their previous 3 albums. They went from amazing to cookie-cutter in 1 album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sinking of the titanic","review":"I've been an OLP fan for many years and this album isn't quite worth the acclaim the others have been noted for. It was a breakthrough album helping the band regain a large portion of recognition in the states because of one large radio hit. \\"Somewhere Out There\\" is a good song, but they somewhat crossed over into the radio-friendly world of pop and left their breathtaking creativity behind with Mike Turner in the dust somewhere. Notable tracks \\"All For You\\" and the Leppard-esque \\"Not Enough\\" give this album a rating of 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Lady Peace Rocks...as always....","review":"I loved everything about this cd, as i did all their cds. Here's a brief over-view of the songs.1.All For You: i always end up singing this one all day long 10/102.Do You Like It: This is another great song, i give it 9/103.Somewhere Out There: Is absolutely one of my faves!! 10/104.Innocent: i love that song, its very sweet and touching, 10/105.Made Of Steel: Very very cool song...10/106.Not Enough: This is probably my fave off the album very smooth and beautiful, it always makes me cry. 10/107.Sell My Soul: This is probably my least fave off the album, i just don't catch with the melody, but its still ok. 7/108.Sorry: A really good track but not one of my faves 8/109.Bring Back The Sun: its a really slow moving song but i personally love it, 10/1010. Story About A Girl: Is another awesome song! 10/10Yaeh so as you can see i love this album, GET IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCK AND ROLL!","review":"Our Lady Peace's latest effort, Gravity, is their greatest yet. All of their albums are unforgettable, but this one stands above the rest. Our Lady Peace simply make straight ahead GREAT rock and roll.From \\"All for You\\" through \\"A Story About A Girl,\\" this album is a blissful listening experience. Every song is heartful and gives you now choice but to sing along.While the radio is filled with a whole bunch of bland rock that pretty much all sounds the same, this band defines what rock and roll was, is and should always be.Our Lady Peace is, without a doubt, the best rock band around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Rock-ed","review":"There's not a whole lot that can be added to what real fans of OLP have already said. Compared to most of what you hear on the mainstream radio today, this album will stand out a bit. However, compared to all of OLP's previous 4 albums, this one is crap. The vocals are boring and repetitive, the songs are boring and repetitive, the lyrics are boring and repetitive... basically, \\"boring and repetitive\\" describes this cd. What kind of a name is Bob Rock, anyway?? If you are even friends with someone with a name like \\"Bob Rock\\", it should be a clue to you that youre a tool, and everyone is probably standing around making fun of you. The only people who will buy this album and love it are 9 yr olds and tranvestite strippers, or both. If you plan on buying this album, take the $18.99, buy a good kitchen knife, and castrate yourself so your future retarded children wont be around to promote crappy sell-out music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Not nearly as good as previous releases (Clumsy being my favorite). This is formula rock, and I suppose if this is what you want then go for it, I would just prefer to listen to some of the other albums. I'm just glad I got it for [less]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissipointing, But I knew that before I bought this.","review":"This is Raine Maida's Our Lady Peace. I dont like to say bands sell out, but they really did here. There is nothing unique about this record except that there is a few decent songs. Without longtime gutair played Mike Turner and Saul on the cover, there just another EMO band thrown into the mainstreem. \\"All For You\\", \\"Not Enough\\" and \\"Bring Back The Sun\\" are very good different songs but the rest of the cd is poppy. Happiness(thier 3rd cd) was hard with a pop tinge and had alot of different sounds that made it unique but this cd is pop with out the crazyiness of \\"Clumsy\\" and the pefect of thier best cd \\"Naveed\\". This dosent destroy OLP's career but certainly wont help. So anyone bring back the SAUL.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"gone too pop...","review":"I was sucked into buying this CD after reading some decent reviews and hearing the new single \\"somewhere out there\\", and actually enjoying it. Our Lady Peace has a great fanbase and they used to be able to seperate themselves from the other rock bands with creative riffs and good lyrics. but this cd is terrible. From the minute i popped it in, i kept thinking corny radio-friendly music played at top 40 radio, like linkin park, puddle of mudd, and nickelback. i know they are better than this, but this CD shows no talent or creativity onesohever and i am very disappointed. they have gone to their last resort to find success in the US--> selling out to top 40 radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Complaining","review":"This album is awesome. After reading the other reviewers give it 4 stars yet complain through the whole review I think I need to tell everyone that the songs on this album are catchy and you wil find yourself singing along. Bob Rock didn''t ruin this album like everyone says, he makes it. I hope he makes every OLP album from now on. The vocals on this cd are some of the best I've ever heard. After you listen to it two times you will love it. I reccomend this cd to any rock fan who likes songs you can sing with and doesn't complain about it being to radio friendly. I hate the radio but I love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"I'm grateful to Gravity, and the song Somewhere Out There. When I first heard the song on the radio a few years back, I fell in love with Raine Maida's voice. It's a good CD, and if you're not already familiar with the band this should be your first. Even hardcore fans should give it a chance. Gravity is certainly more mainstream than the others, and Raine's lyrics are \\"dumbed down\\" a bit (The blame for this falls on new producer Bob Rock). But compared to the rest of what's out there, OLP is still the greatest. I would definitely recommend this CD. Some personal favorite tracks are \\"Bring Back the Sun\\" \\"Made of Steel\\" \\"Sorry\\" \\"All For You\\" \\"Do you like it\\" and \\"Somewhere Out There\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the hardcore fan","review":"Many of these reviews state that Our Lady Peace has gone more mainstream but this is an awesome album for their hardcore fans. Being a hardcore fan myself, I can tell you that the positive messages Our Lady Peace intended to pass through their music is most present in this recording. My favourite song is track six, 'Not Enough' because it never fails to pick me up when I am down. Many of the tracks like \\"Made of Steel' and 'All for You' are great for this. There is only one song that I do not like on this album and that is track nine...maybe I am missing the message or maybe it is just too slow moving for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Sold Out","review":"First off... everybody needs to stop whining saying OLP sold out. If there is one thing great about this band, it is that no two cd's ever sound the same. Each project is unique and different than anything you would find in mainstream rock. OLP is by far the best live band I have ever seen and not only is the performance awesome, they know their fans put them where they are and they will never forget that. My advice: BY THIS CD AND ANY OTHER OLP YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON. The lyrics will speak to you and you might just find a new favorite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...","review":"It's been nearly a year since this album came out and I'm a U.K. fan as well as a long time fan. The truth is I can listen to this album and think its good... its okay... but that's all. Hate to sound like everyone else but while I like it as an album I hate it as an OLP album. All for progression and moving on hell I even liked adore... but this is a devolution designed to grab the nu-pop generation. Nothing against there new guitarist he's good and all but Mike if your out there i'm with you it was time to leave. The sound is, well you've heard it before its creedish very typical and radio rock. The albums sound lacks the depth of all previous releases. Its almost laughable to think that if you sat around a table with these guys they'd try to convice you that this was there finest hour... I'd love to hear there arguements, i really would it would be comical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh well","review":"I have been a fan of OLP since Naveed, and I am slightly disapointed in OLP. I fell in love with OLP because of their differences and their different style and how nothing else sounded like it, then they sign on Bob \\"Ruin the Band\\" Rock. I dont believe that it is OLP's fault that they sound mainstreamy. I believe it is Bob Rock. They should have stuck with Arnold Lanni. However, this is an overall good CD, even if you are not an OLP fan, and even if you are. It gives a good perspective of some hidden urges to go with the flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"if this album had arrived after naveed or clumsy, i would have received it better. but after watching the band grow better and better with each album, reaching their peak with spiritual machines, gravity was quite a disappointment. bands who experiment should keep experimenting, not produce a way-too-made-for-radio product. newer fans may enjoy this album, but for we longtime fans, it's rather a letdown, especially after such an eager wait.it's nowhere near as soulful, or strong lyrically. many of the lyrics play heavily with repetition, which is good for a few songs, but song after song of repetitive lyrics is a bit grating.for a cd, i admit it's okay. but for our lady peace--not good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clarification to my previous review..","review":"It seems I was in error on a bit of text during my review of Gravity, and I am writing to clear one thing up. During my section which mentions the aim of producer Bob Rock to make Our Lady Peace \\"the next big Canadian group\\" to break out in America, I mistakingly identified him as having produced Nickelback's Silver Side Up, which I later found to be inaccurate. These two albums do share the same mixing engineer, Randy Staub, which likely led to this incorrect correlation, so I guess I was only half right! Still, with that said, I feel the aim of this production team here was to throw OLP onto the Nickelback bandwagon by homogenizing the quirkiness that gives OLP such an engaging quality, and shaping them towards something more commercial, thus breaking them out by riding on Nickelback's coattails. Given the sudden hipness of mainstream Canadian bands in America, I'm fairly sure this was exactly their intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is better than Gravity it's self","review":"My sister made me listen to this cd and I absolutely hated it because I didn't want to listen. However when I got it and listened to it out of my own free will I instantly put it in my top 5 favorite cd list. Not only does this CD have an amazing track list, but they are all very catchy tunes. After listening to this CD once, you won't want to take it off your deck. I haven't and it's been over 2 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"It's hard to believe this album is almost ten years old. WTF. Time flies. Anyway, its a great album. I remember buying it when it came out and taking long drives listening to it. The first half of the album is amazing. You can't go wrong with Our Lady Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gravitating Indeed","review":"This album demands listening. The vocals and guitarring stlyes on this album are just spellbounding. Its something I definitely enjoy while on the road. In simple words , its energetic. The songs never really die on you instead they grow. \\"Not Enough\\" is my favourite track and I think I have seldom heard anything better. It has this amazing build up.Other songs of the disc that really rock are \\"All For You\\",\\"Bring Back The Sun\\" , \\"Innocent\\" , \\"Sell My Soul\\" , \\"Made OF Steel\\" ,etc. Some say the band became commercial with this album well Im sorry but I just couldnt possibly care less.Amazing album from an amazing Band.Our Lady Peace rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another rockin OLP Album","review":"Our Lady Peace is an awesome band. I dont know why people say or think that they've \\"sold out.\\" Personally I don't believe that a band \\"sells out\\" ever. When a band releases an album with a different sound than what they've known for ie Spiritual Machines, Gravity, its an experimental album. All the best rock bands at one point in their career have released an experimental album or two at one point or another, and all the best rock bands experimental albums are usually genius ie Spiritual Machines and Gravity. This is an amazing album, with incredible songs.As an Our Lady Peace fan, don't be upset or mad that this album doesn't sound like Naveed or Clumsy, praise it and listen to it because once you do, you'll realize this is an album with great creativity and lyrics, and just another Our Lady Peace album that rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who'd have thunk it?","review":"Let me make this clear. I've been a faithful, dedicated, loving fan of Our Lady Peace ever since the release of their mainstream debut, \\"Naveed.\\" I've loved every release. With Spiritual Machines I was sure they had reached their plateau. They had written their masterpiece, being Spiritual Machines. However, Raine, Jeremy, and Duncan shocked me with the new release Gravity. This album is such a departure from all other work done by the band, focusing more on a melodic hard rock sound rather than a progressive grunge. Let it be known by one and all that Gravity breathes fresh air into one of Canada's best straight ahead rock groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Damn Time!","review":"Every OLP CD is awesome, but this is the CD I've been waiting for since \\"Clumsy.\\" Raine toned down his vocals (but still very distiguishable) and the guitars are full and heavy. Finally OLP sounds like what they should sound like...a rock band. I've sat back baffled as to how this band never got radio airplay, but this record will definitely change all that. Even though I think every OLP song could be on the radio, this disc is a lot more radio friendly. Despite the fact that they made their sound more \\"commercial,\\" as some call it, it does not sound like they \\"sold out.\\" OLP have always written catchy rock songs, but this CD is just produced differently.Hopefully OLP keeps up the pace they are making music at....3 records since September 1999 - all while giving each disc a very different sound. This CD just came out and I already can't wait to hear the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glen Ballard is The Kiss of Death to All Artists","review":"This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on \\"Happiness\\" or \\"Spiritual Machines\\" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raine Maida said Mike was limited no Raine this is limited..","review":"My feelings about this album... well it is poor because Our Lady Peace always had a unique sound and now quite frankly now they sound like everyone else out there. I'm going to agree with the others who have reviewed this album that Bob Rock is no Arnold Lanni this is a luke warm album. They produced the whole thing in ten weeks and believe me you can tell the whole thing feels rushed, I mean even the cover look at it, grey yeah it is quite fitting. Some think this is a return to OLP's roots I disagree I've been a fan of there's eight years If there going to make more albums like this they should change there name I don't want the words Our Lady Peace on this material. Thank you Mr Bob Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I was expecting a lot more from this. I have been into OLP since Clumsy, and I have seen them live three times.I think, that the Bob Rock production is good, but the songs just don't have that classic OLP feel to them.Hopefully next album they will get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"making a record to make money","review":"this album is the most trite inane pile of crap possible. it is not only a bad our lady peace album, it's just a bad album. other reviewers have mentioned words like radio friendly...synonyms for can turn a quick buck, OLP isn't mainstream and that was one of their charms, they were comfortable being different. i have been an OLP fan since the day Naveed came out, and have followed them on the bizarre and ever expanding musical journey they went on. after losing jamie and more importantly mike before the release of this album though, it is obvious mikehe was the driving creative force in the band and inspired everyone else. do not waste your money on this awful disc, buy any of the previous four albums and you'll have an amazing record to add to your collection....buy this one and you'll have a terrific coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good times rolled off a cliff...","review":"I have been an Our Lady Peace fan for some time now. I bought Spiritual Machines and it was great. Bought Happiness...one of the best albums I own or even heard. Ended up buying Clumsy too and it did not disappoint. Gravity on the other hand did disappoint. I heard Somewhere Out There on the radio and I was less then impressed. But it sounded like radio type music, popular stuff, so I figured Id check out some other songs. That was a waste of my time. I didnt really think about its Creedness until I read a different review, and Id have to agree. Not worth the time or the money, especially for a college student like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album","review":"What fascinates me about the reviews for this and other OLP albums is that unlike other bands, the fan base really splits into two camps on their body of work. If you like this album, you'll also praise and love Healthy in Paranoid Times and also Clumsy. You may not be as fond of Naveed or Spiritual Machines. You enjoy the refined sound that makes the music accessible and yes, this can mean 'radio-friendly.'Or, you rip on this and the similar albums as a sell-out and their worst material and cling to their previous raw, unrefined works. If you can't guess, I prefer the music in this album and rank it in among my top albums, let alone OLP albums.This is a great 1st OLP album to introduce someone to their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"The single \\"Somewhere out there\\" on this album is NOT the version Fievel sings in An American Tail. This one is about some purple haired girl who tastes good, probably like grape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am extremely disappointed with Our Lady Peace's new CD. I am a great lover of their music, and anticipated the arrival of their new Cd with excitment. However, as soon as I listened to it I discovered that it was of lesser quality than any of their earlier music. This CD has none of the charateristic voice prominent in their earlier CDs. As much as it pains me to say this, Our Lady Peace now sounds like any generic rock band. None of these songs are up to the level of Clumsy and Superman's Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been a lot better than this.","review":"I bought this CD a week ago and it was a bit disappointing. The music isn't hard enough. I like hard rock/pop and heavy metal, but Gravity is nothing more than just another boyband. The only song I really liked was track # 6 \\"Not Enough\\", which is very moving. Tracks # 2 and 5 were O.K. but not worth listening to all the time. Our Lady Peace is a sellout. This album proves it. Buy Vertical Horizon or Linkin Park, but avoid this. The singing is cheesy and the music stinks for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shame Guys, For Shame","review":"I absolutley enjoy listing to OLP's older realeses, but this new more modren, less Meaning full lyrics, and vocals has caught me dissapointed.

The heartwrenching, insightful lyrics and experimental sound that set OLP apart aren't on this album. I disliked Somewhere Out There because it was so mainstream sounding. It made me feel as if OLP was dumbing down their music for Joe MusicFan, and abandoning the rabidly loyal fanbase they've set up over the years. I used to take something away from every OLP album, and this one could have been any other run of the mill alt rock band. I hope OLP realizes their music is good the way it is, or was, and goes back to what we know and love. Gravity is a quality album just because of the caliber of the musicians that play on it, but other then that, it's just not the band what I've come to love.To anyone looking to buy this album, I would say, listen to Happiness... Is a Fish You Cannot Catch, Clumsy, Spiritual Machines, or Naveed if you want to hear Our Lady Peace. This album doesn't do them justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing.","review":"The band has completely given in. Either they've lost their minds or they've given in to make more money. They had so much potential, so much more to do, and they just threw all that away with this crappy ass album. Raine's still got the excellent lyrics, but Jeremy's awesome beats have turned to crap, and the tunes are basically asking you to wear dress and start prancing around like some goddamn fairy. The last four albums were completely GODLY. Now it's morphed into some pansy ballerina stuff. If you like this kind of music, well good for you, don't listen to me. But if you've been an OLP fan before this turd came out, I suggest you listen to me and stick with the last 4 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Commentary...","review":"Zzzzzz....Este disco da guevaSi te gusta Backstreet Boys y los ultimos discos de Oasis y Santana, esto es para ti."},{"rating":"1","title":"I smell another creed knock off...","review":"Yes, these guys smell a whole lot like yet another creed knock off band that is trying to imitate a band that, although very succesful, is wholey remarkable themeselves. Dang, the music just gets worst every year, and the fact that these guys are from Canada, home of Default and Nickelback, certanly does NOT help there cause! I didn't like Creed when they first came out, and I haven't liked them or any band that has tried to cop of there formula since.So thus, in short, I smell another Creed, which is why they must be stamped out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP's Best Yet","review":"Gravity, the fifth studio album from Canada's Our Lady Peace is nothing short of a musical masterpiece. New listeners will be lured in and left with insatiable cravings , giving them no choice but to track down previous recordings.The first single \\"Somewhere Out There\\" is but a taste of the OLP experience. Each and every song has its own story and gets better every time it reaches your ears. Raine Maida's heartfelt vocals leave you mesmerized on tracks such as \\"Innocent\\" and \\"Sell My Soul\\" where every note is pumped full of feeling.In this era of remixing the old, it's quite refreshing to have a group that quenches our thirst for new brilliance. The only complaint one should have is that there are just ten songs to savor. You will be left hoping they return to the studio as soon as possible.-Becky Ledbetter"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"I've been a fan of OLP for awhile, not as long as most but i started when \\"happiness...\\" was released, then i bought \\"clumsy\\" and then i boguht \\"sprititual machines\\". Then i bought this one which is not the best but its still a great cd. i cant stop listening to it. although they gained a new producer and lost a guitarist and replaced him they still sound great. not enough, innocent, made of steel, and bring back the sun are by far my favorite. id wish OLP would put more than 10 or 11 songs on they're cds. but some of you call this cd a sell out cd which it isnt.Its a great cd OLP you guys rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"After their last effort(Spiritual Machines), those of us old-line OLP fans were waiting excitedly for the next release.However, during the hiatus, they cast off their lead guitar player and took up with the King of Homogenized Rock(Bob Rock).The result: A quite boring outing. A sound not that far from the other bands. Creed.....with a different singer. You could see Metallica doing this stuff(without the snarling singer).One of the salient truths of rock and roll: Everybody sells out, eventually.This is OLP's sellout album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh....","review":"of the 4 OLP albums I have (I'm missing Naveed), this one is the worst. It does not contain anywhere near as much feeling and soul as Clumsy, Happiness..., and Spiritual Machines have.

While some of the songs are definitely good, on the whole, not anywhere close to their best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Shakes head sadly*","review":"I've been a big fan of Our Lady Peace but this new record is not Our Lady Peace.

I mean, look at it..- the first verse about a boy named Jonny- the second verse about a hurting little girl- the chorus chanting the same words \\"we are, we are all innocent\\"; to P.O.D's \\"we are, we are the youth of the Nation\\"- the bridge about how we need to change..- and the final chorus with the kids singing.*Shakes head sadly*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphosis","review":"I have loved Our Lady Peace since I first heard \\"Starseed\\" back in 1995 and always look forward to their albums with great anticipation. This album does not disappoint, though it marks a distinct change in their sound. Whereas especially on the last 2 albums their sound had a distinct edge and ethereal quality to it, Gravity marks a turn to more solid, straight out rock a la Bush or fellow Canadians Nickelback that they have only displayed to any extent on Naveed and somewhat on Clumsy. This sound will probably score them more radio play for singles from Gravity than they have gotten since Clumsy. I admit that I still think Spiritual Machines is the only album to live up to the high standard they established with Naveed, but Gravity doesn't leave you dissatisfied by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"ew","review":"before this album came out, i was siked and looking forward to it. once i bought the album, i was extremely disappointed. our lady peace WAS my absolute favorite band. one of the reasons was because they didn't sound like anyone else. i own every single album that they came out with. they were brilliant when they had lead guitarist, mike. as soon as he quit the band and they gained the \\"new guy\\", our lady peace sounds like everyone else. it [is bad]. if you admire our lady peace's old stuff for what it is worth, you will not buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band isn't the same since Mike Turner's departure","review":"I wholly agree with the first review posted. OLP used to be a wonderfully talented band, but when they ventured out in to the land of commerical success, their music lost something. Much of this has to do with integral member, Mike Turner (guitars), departing after the release of Spiritual Machines, the predecessor to Gravity. Turner did not like the direction the band was headed in, and for good reason. OLP was better when they were less about commerically sound, catchy tunes and more about writing interesting, eclectic songs, with crafty guitar work. Many of these aspects, most notably the good guitars, are not to be found on this latest album. I had been a fan since 1994's Naveed, their first album, but I am a fan no longer. OLP has sold out, and they will never be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"For everyone that is this far into wanting to build a honda, this book doesnt have anything you don't aready know. The main theme of the book (dyno charts) might appear to add to the appeal of this book, but the methods used to demonstrate hp gains are correlated in a rather sloppy manner and do not follow any consistant methods of comparison (e.g. stock setup vs. specific bolt on only). The only situation where i would recommend this book is if you are literally 100% new to the tuning scene.

Whenever an episode runs more than the standard one hour (about 40 minutes without commercials) the DVDs cut that episode short. The Teen Mom 2 Season 1 DVDs cut the episode where Leah and Corey marry, cutting out the entire wedding, which for many was the highlight of this season, if not all of Teen Mom 2! This continues to happen with Teen Mom/Teen Mom 2 DVDs. The final season of Teen Mom was recently released on DVD and the final episode of Teen Mom \\"Wake Up\\", which was an extra long episode, was cut. Only the first 40 or so minutes is shown on the DVD set, despite it being a 90 minute episode. MTV/Teen Mom really need to fix this issue with the DVDs.

In time, Shadow Zone would be a far better CD if ARP dropped one ballad and included one more rocker, especially because the slow tunes here are not as diverse and inventive as in past efforts (listen to \\"Eyes Of The Lost\\" off of \\"Magic\\").The top songs here are \\"Follow the Sign\\", \\"Edge Of The World\\" and \\"Coming Home\\".Anyway, with ARP you don't go wrong, even if you don't get one of his top works.

Peter Kerr writes about his life in Mallorca, having moved from Scotland to get a taste of a more idyllic lifestyle and away from the rat race. Except for the occasional familiar Spanish expressions and terms, this book tries to emulate the style of Peter Mayle's hugely successful and popular series on Provence. In my humble opinion, it failed quite badly. Peter Kerr tried to describe very minute details which may not interest readers. He tried to be humurous- marginally successful at times. If you want a good read of life in a foreign countryside, pick up Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence, anytime. I may have been biased and it could be possible that I may like Peter Kerr's books on Mallorca had I begun with his first book on Mallorcan winter.

It was very entertaining I loved Elizabeth Bennett with her quick temper and witty remarks especially to Mr. Darcy. And you have to love Jane with her sweet temper. I really enjoyed this book I've read it twice and will probably read it again. I've also seen the A&E special presentation movie and I really enjoyed it. The book is really great and I hope more people will read and enjoy it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"I love this book, I love the movie, I love everything about it. Jane Austen's genius is unmatched. I have so much affection for the characters... even Miss Bingley! ;-) I think Elizabeth is \\"one of the most delightful characters to ever in print, and how I will tolerate those who do not like her in the least I do not know.\\" Really, this is that rare, wonderful kind of book that even the most fervent words of praise do no justice to. So, the solution? Read it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have 2 favorite books, this being one of them.","review":"Jane Austen has a wonderful style of writing. She has written many wonderful novels, this being the best. 5 girls out with thier mother insisting they find a husband. The oldest falls in love, only to find that his sister and his friend are out to keep them apart. But the real dilema however is when Lizzy finds herself in love with the nastiest, most proud man she has ever met. Go and read this wonderful novel the first chance you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters","review":"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth. Lizzy, and to an extent Charlotte are the only two who are 3D. Jane Austen\`s ideas of poverty are laughable, large house complete with servants is not poor. Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor paper quality","review":"I wish that I can rate 0 star, not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant!","review":"This was indeed one of the most foolish novels I have ever read. I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it. The infamous character portrayals seem hugely worthless. Such a book is suited at best for the coffee table. Two stars because I never had the energy to finish the entire book, so I might have missed the so called \\"good parts\\" of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Font Too Small","review":"The font is too small. I'm not sure what point the author is trying to get across with this tiny font, but it fell on deaf ears, mostly because I couldn't read the book. I tried using a magnifying glass, but because I like reading outside the pages caught on fire. The book's only redeeming quality is the picture of a pretty dress on the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le book","review":"Freaking awesome, but a little less romantic than I expected. It tends to focus on other people's affairs just as mush as the main characters, and at one point I skipped through some of that extra jazz.

Drama starts when the young Elizabeth Bennett crosses upon a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Darcy who soon falls madly in love with her. While thats going on, Elizabeths older sister, Jane has fallen in love with Mr. Bingley, the \\"new neighbor\\" in their town. This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion \\"love talk\\".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15. If you don't like romance novels, don't even dare to pick up this book.I still think Jane Austen is a good author. She demonstrates a lot of personality in one person and sometimes it feels like you were almost in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"People who order this cassette should be wary! In order to \\"save space,\\" the publisher, Brilliance Company, has recorded the tape twice on each side, requiring special equipment in order to descramble it when listening to it on a Walkman-type casset player. The equipment goes under the name of \\"Bookcassette Adapter,\\" and there is no indication how to get hold of one.

I however find those to be lies. Although it took me a while to read, i was perfectly able to understand it and any girls that like romance should read it. It's a true treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy thought indeed","review":"Jane Austen has created a very believable world in P&P. Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read, although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say, a \\"happy thought, indeed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen writes the best book ever written!!","review":"Jane Austen has become of the most renown authors around the world for her witty and classic characters. It doesn't suprise me that she is able to write such a wonderful novel as Pride & Prejudice.It is a story of a young woman named Elizabeth Bennet ,a.k.a. Lizzy, who has a great dislike for a handsome and rich man called Mr. Darcy. The story takes Elizabeth through twists and turns and some how she ends up in love with Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice Review","review":"Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice, a classic love story","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story. When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book. The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them. It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them. After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic. You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love. I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a favorite","review":"This book was not on any of my school reading lists so I did not come across it until I was almost 30. I am now 50 and have probably read it 10 times and seen every version of it on film...twice. It is a becutiful story of women and human nature. I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations. Women may be more independent today, but there are still women who seek marriages simply to validate themselves or their lifestyles. Not only have I enjoyed this book, I have learned from it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever!!!","review":"This is in my opinion the best book ever written. Having read the other excellent reviews here there is really nothing i can add except to say that i love Jane Austen and everything she wrote, and that Pride and prejudice is my favourite book of all time.

What I can say is this: this is probably my all-time favorite book and seems to be the same for countless others.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are the two main protagonists and are surrounded by the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the fatuous Mr. Collins and his condescending patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham. As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST LOVE STORY EVER IN THE LITERATURE HISTORY","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN. JANE AUSTEN SUCCESSFULLY DESCRIBED EACH PERSON'S HUMANITY. THE FIVE SISTERS OF BENNET REALLY PULL OUT A LOT OF INTERESTING SCENES IN THIS BOOK. AFTER READING THIS, I FEEL LOVE CAN REALLY PULL TOGETHER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH PERSON, AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE LOVE IN OUR MIND, THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT IS UNSOLVABLE. WE SHOULD GO BACK AND READ THIS BOOK EVERY COUPLE YEARS, BECAUSE EACH TIME WE READ, WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FEELING. AND THE MORE WE READ, WE WILL DISCOVER MORE NEW MEANINGS FROM THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, terrible printing","review":"The book gets 5 stars of course. But the printing of this particular version is TERRIBLE. It's apparently a \\"print on demand\\" book from Tribeca Books. Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly. I had to walk into a bookstore and buy a different publisher's version of this book it was so annoying. The one I got was only $5 and much easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting story","review":"I didn't remember reading this in school so I thought I'd give a try.

Recently I read it again and was far more impressed. It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful. There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book. Her humor is subtle but witty.

It is a very funny, interesting story and any reader has to give Jane Austen credit for satirical view of the world around her. But, come on. Great Literature? It is a fluff book that leads the reader to no great revelations about their life or enviroment. To me, a novel is only as great as the thoughts it provoked. My \\"great thoughts\\" coming out of the novel were only \\"I'm glad Darcy and Elizabeth fell in love\\" and \\"Gee, I hate Lydia\\". Don't misunderstand me. I like the book and recommend it. It's just that there are so many more deep, meaningful things to read. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE was the first Jane Austen novel I read.

The vivid and detailed literature with underlying hints of sarcasm didn't make me laugh because I was illiterate to the writing at the time. I had even resorted to cliffs notes and such to help me through the book, even though I was reading it on my own accord. Now that I am older and far more wise, i read this book and love the romance, social placings and every moral connected to this book, but the male sex will turn up their noses to this amazing novel because it will be \\"too girly\\" for them.

I have read it many times, and love it more and more with each reading.Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy's journey to find each other was brilliant. The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women. Her writings foreshadowed and inspired succeeding generations of women as they fought to obtain equal rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In trying to get books imported to my newly-purchased Kindle, this one made it to the Kindle but was not really a title I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer torture","review":"I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the \\"plot.\\" The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bland and dry","review":"I am sorry, I know that this book is loved by millions and I should love it; but, I do not.

Correcting this mistake proved interesting. While the style is dated, Austen's take on \\"polite society\\" is very funny and the title particularly apt.The characters remain true to their own inner logic and this comedy of false assumptions plays out to a pleasent and thoughtful end. I don't know if I feel obligated to read the rest of Austen's work, but I do agree her work has withstood the test of time very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!","review":"This timeless classic's appeal remains undiminished through the ages. Drawing on the universal topic of love and marraige, Jane Austen's most \\"sparkling\\" work addresses the role in society of women, social/class differences, and well...pride and prejudice...with scintillating wit. Producing two of literature's most loved protagonists, the witty Elizabeth Bennet and haughty Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice remains a joy to read. Having inspired books and movies such as Bridget Jones' Diary, P&P is one of the must-reads of English literature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh Jane Austen","review":"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates.

Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one.

While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is classic.

This is, however, the finest work that the average man can actually read without being entirely baffled by the intrigue of the female mind. This, my second Austen, is perhaps the best to get anyone interested in Austen's style of writing. But be warned, \\"Pride and Prejudice can keep you rivetted for hours..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy Read!","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride or Prejudice?","review":"Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"i absolutely adore this book. i have read it 4 times and i would recommend it to anyone. it has interesting characters, a very complex and engaging plot, and you learn alot about english society during austin's time. jane austin is a very gifted writer. i have also read sense and sensibility and presuasion, both very good books, but pride and prejudice will always be my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite","review":"Pride and Prejudice has been one of my favorite books since I first read it at the age of twelve.

I fought my way out of the pilot seat against the compiling G-forces and scrambled with a sob in my throat through the open hatchway.Tumbling in free fall. Feeling of helplessness.

I thought P&P would be a good start since they just made another movie on this book.. but I was wrong! the book was boring and plotless. Sure nowaday women are still searching for Mr.Perfect like Lizzy was. But today's women have to deal with much more complicated life problems and worries while searching for the right guy.. The whole book was about drawing room,dinners, and occasional conversations with some ladies urging Lizzy to get married. I better off stick with the modern love stories with real people problems. Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I care?","review":"This story was written in the early Victorian era, and hence it is quite old. I was pretty much forced to read this book for a summer reading assignment. I found it to be utterly boring. The real question here is why do I really care if the mother has all of her daughters married off to wealthy parnters, or any partner if it must come down to it? Maybe it was a big deal back in the time, but nobody cares nowadays. Maybe it is a 'literary masterpiece', but then why the heck is it so boring? We need to move on from the old 'classics'. They mean nothing to readers (are there many left?) of the modern society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible horrible horrible!","review":"I hated this book. It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly. The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissolusioned youth","review":"Please, this was an utterly unconvincing and boring novel. If it wa written today it would be internationally acclaimed for being a dummed down soap opera. Unfortunately, having been composed in, what, the 1830s, it has become a period drama style romance novel, where instead of foreplay, they have to bow and curtsy and everything. Althought this may appeal to worthless romantics, it will not perform well to the MTV generation. The movie starred Hugh Grant. Please........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and prejudice","review":"Beautifully written from start to finish. The story captures all of your attention as it slowly unfolds.

I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So slow...","review":"I think I got about a quarter of the way through it and hoped it would get better.

Nope, it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!!!","review":"i read this book becuase i heard how great it was. it has so many great reviews. honestly i think the book was just ok... too much of nothing was written. i found myself forcing to finish the book thinking it was going to get better. the best part was the end. now i can read a better book. sorry jane austen but this now makes me think twice about reading your other books. i was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fave","review":"This is probably the most classic romance novel of all time.

I would like to update on what I read since then, now that I have finished the book. It is very well written, with a great plot.

I hightly suggest that you read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"although I am only half-way through...","review":"Although I am only half-way through this book, I am finding it very interesting. It IS a romance, this fact may turn people off, but (as far as I have gone anyway) there is much more to the story! So far, it is very enjoyable, and is teaching me a lot about that time period--what it was like for women in England then. I suggest you read it! Even if you feel that you are a little young. I am 15, I read a lot, and perhaps I'm not understanding everything, but it is enjoyable nontheless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story that graps you by the heart and does not ever let you go.

Austen's wry humor and perceptiveness shine through in all her characters. I know it sounds cheesy, but I still do get excited over whether Elizabeth and Darcy will ever see eye to eye. Elizabeth is one of the strongest and most admirable female characters in literature, the book is worth it just for her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen's finest novel!","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago. In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the Test of Time","review":"This tale is a classic, and for good reason. It has managed to stand the test of time and even after so many generations, Jane Austen is still able to capture your heart and pull you into this charming, little world and endear you to her lovable, fleshed out characters. It's witty, heart-warming, funny, filled with wonderful life lessons and just an overall fun read. Easily one of my favorites books of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A romance classic!

This downloaded book serious sucks because it is badly formatted. Every second line breaks in the middle and paragraphs are separated by 2 lines. This is a classic formatting error.

It's wonderful to read from one of the best known authors in british classic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece!","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a work of perfection. Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story. You also get to see what life would have been like back then, you get to see and experience something you would not have otherwise experienced yourself. I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person. Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another? The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and I truly did not want to put it down, until I had read it all. If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it took me so long","review":"I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"I bought this product as a gift for my mom for Christmas, who loves Jane Austin books. For some audio books, the narrator is boring and drones on and on. Or, they put to much dynamism into their read-aloud, making their story seems over dramatic and almost comical if it wasn't so disappointing. This was not the case for this product. The female narrator reads all of the character's dialogue, but in a way that is easy to listen to. She doesn't overemphasize, nor is she monotone. It's the perfect companion if you are taking a long drive alone, which my mom often does. I recommend this product 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics are mesmerizing","review":"What can I say this classic literature really have me insight to the past and kept my attention piqued.

I had seen the movie but never read the book until now and wished I had sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've yet read","review":"I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"HUMOROUS AND IRONIC LOVE STORY/SURPRISINGLY MODERN","review":"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"I love this story! The characters are so consistent and so very realstic, it's amazing. You can't help but admire them, not only for their realism, but for who they were, and especially Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, whose opinions changed so very much, and how they came to accept each other. Not only is the main plot excellent, but secondary characters such as the droll Mr. Collins and the imperious Lady Catherine are real gems. This whole novel is well worth taking the time to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! even on Kindle","review":"This is, in my opinion, the best novel Jane Austen wrote, although Mansfield Park follows close on its heels. And while there are a few spelling and grammatical errors here and there in the kindle edition, it is worth it to have it on kindle. This fast-paced story is hard to put down, and if you have not yet read it you really should give it a try. Forget the many versions you may have seen of the movie, which even the best of does not do justice to the novel, and sit yourself down with this for a wonderful ride. Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You decide","review":"One thing I have learned form reading this book and then reading some reviews, is that one can either hate it or love it. Or love it and hate it at the same time.In my case, I loved the tale, it is one of must-read classics, and who ever enjoys romantic novels of any sort will fall in love with the story.Jane Austen, a great author, certainly has captured my heart making this tale to remind me of love when everthing else doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy it - you can read it.","review":"Last Fall I saw a A&E version of P&P. I enjoyed the movie. If I had not seen the movie I probably would not have finished the book. The problem with this is that one can not develop their own picture or opinion on the characters.What I liked the most was the amount of wit displayed between the characters interaction. It is a true book about people. It is funny, charming and romantic. It really opened my eyes to society in the 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome of course","review":"Never fear this is not a novelization. It's the classic story with a revamped cover. If you are interested in getting the book this is not a bad choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic.","review":"For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read! Definitely in the top 10! It is a book of real life drama and intense love. I couldn't wait to see if Miss Elizabeth Bennet would drop some of her prejudices or if Mr. Darcy would look thru his pride or if Miss Jane Bennet would end up with the one she loved.This book is excellence in writing and in overall story! It was a book that I will read again!! Beyond doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the tape version...","review":"I use an audio copy of P&P when teaching it in class - we read through important passages together without the loss of my voice. I previously owned a tape version - horrible because you had to FF to whatever parts you wanted. In fact my player ended up eating 2 of the tapes. This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work. If you're just planning to listen from start to finish, however, this is an excellent version- the reader is splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Enlightening","review":"Hours of tremendous enjoyment from reading the book. The incredible depth of the characters and the richness of the detail creates a wonderful read. However, should you find yourself lost in the middle of the forest with only matches and this book in your hand in dire need of light and warmth, don't hesitate to rip out several pages from the middle of the book, gather a few branches and start a fire... you thus will have the light to read by, and know the start and the end of the story. Resign yourself to the thought that the middle pages who thus furnished you and provided for your comfort were nothing more than the middling and confused thoughts of a swooning fop chaser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"I know Jane Austen was a famous author but this book was written 200 years ago.

I had to buy the book to get more out of the movie so far I have not finish the book yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Austen's Most Memorable Work","review":"Jane Austen's stories have endured for years, and this one is probably her most famous work. It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters. The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century. Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was). The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story. It is a charming and wonderfully warm tale that I never tire of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a marvelous book...","review":"As I read Pride and Prejudice, one thing struck me--that I reacted to the twists in the plot rather strongly. I laughed aloud at the wit; I smiled at the *ahem* 'cute' romance; I shouted at the characters when they missed obvious signals and acted like idiots...but such as it is, lets just say that I was truly affected by this book. Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel. I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Happy","review":"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book.

Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous edition","review":"This is a gorgeous little edition of Pride and Prejudice.

It is the best love story ever. It truly teaches us that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. A definate must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons Learned","review":"The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book!","review":"I was so pleased when I received this book.

Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an \\"ironic comedy.\\" The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless read","review":"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed.

It's so incredibly boring and stupid!!! It was without a doubt one of the most torturous reading experiences for me. Now, I can appreciate great pieces of classic literature (e.g. Moby Dick, Red Badge of Courage, Gullivers Travels), but this assuredly does not merit to fall within that catagory. It is friviolous and devoid of any real substance. No plot whatsoever. Essentially, it concerns a bunch of smart-aleck, stuck-up self-righteous phonies who try to outdo each other with their sarcastic and smart-aleck remarks. Give me a break, all of you who supposedly like this dull, monotonous, shallow book!! It is utterly beyond my comprehension how in the world this garbage is considered one of the great books of world literature.

Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satsified and Happy","review":"I've read this book a million times.

Also yay Mr. Darcy","review":"Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"P&P = Painful for non-romance lovers","review":"Wow is this book boring. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like \\"Why, doesn't she look pretty today?\\" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage, Love and Customs","review":"The portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair although not truly noticable was very strong and forgiving. Neither knew that they had feelings for the other until a rash judgement was made on both sides. Elizabeth declines the hand of her cousin Mr. Collins and therefore goes against the customs of the time period. Elizabeth defies most traditional customs when it comes to men. She wants to marry for love not money, or anything else. This novel keeps the reader interested and wanting more. Jane Austen is a superb author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rave Reviews From A 15 Year-Old!","review":"Pride and Prejudice is such a wonderful book. It should be, considering it has been a classic for so many years--it was written in 1813! But some people are pushed away by classics for just being \\"classics\\"--don't be pushed away from this! I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on \\"Wishbone.\\" It was my favorite episode. I decided to read it after finishing \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and aching for another great book. This is it! It has wonderful characters that you fall in love with, a wonderful love story, and insights that really make you think about . . . pride and prejudice of all things. It's wonderfully written, and it's fun to try to get used to the different usage of English.

The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout.

I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting or the writing style very engaging; in fact, this was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. All the characters were very pretentious, only caring about how you looked and what family you belonged to.

This is one of my favorite books, and I know it well enough to realize when sentences are being left out, which happened in several places (I did double-check with my print edition). At least one of the omitted sentences was important for understanding the characters.The other quibble I have is that the recording I purchased consisted of two SIX HOUR tracks. Heaven help you if you lose your place while using an mp3 player.I cannot dis-recommend this recording enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth, too predictable","review":"Vapid and pompous! Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical. Yes, this novel is a classic, and an original of the romance genre, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it, in fact, is romance genre: WAY to simplistic.Couldn't stand the book, not when I read it at 20 and not when I gave it another chance at 49. Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens. Despite her myriad adoring fans, in my opinion, Jane Austen's writing lacks depth and cannot truly be compared to Dickens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice is a great book!","review":"I can relate to this story, for there is a \\"Mr. Darcy-ish\\" character at my school. Well, anyway, this book is cleverly funny and I would truly recommend it. The characters come to life because it's so wonderfully written. Mrs. Bennet is a person you would like to laugh at! Jane is sweet and delicate and obviously Mr. Bingley would love her. Lydia and Kitty are funny in there chase for a man in uniform! Mary is plain and Elizabeth is a character so sweet in manner. <= that's why Darcy falls in love with her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"It's one of the first books I've read in English.

You will love Jane Austn !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"The greatest love story of all times! I can't help but love everything by Jane Austen!

It is wonderful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly abridged Kindle Edition","review":"I was very very disappointed when I downloaded this book for my Kindle. According to Amazon customer service, there is no way to tell if any of the free Kindle editions of books are abridged before you download them.

I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice, A True Masterpiece","review":"This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"eBook Formatting needs some work","review":"I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted. There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues. Great book, but the formatting needs a bit of work"},{"rating":"2","title":"4th reading and counting...","review":"This is my fourth reading of this book and I become even more enamored of it with every single read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pride and Prejudice","review":"this version of Pride and Prejudice is authentic and easy to read.The quality of the illustrations do not measure up to the lovely cover though.I use the third sized font and have no problem at all.

Right now I am 13 years old. I started this book when i was 10. I am totally obsessed w/ this book. u should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truelly a most have","review":"I love this book!, I think the love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is timeless. I believe, eventhough the story was written in the 1800's, mostly anybody that have been in love could relate with the complexity of feelings portrated in this story. As well as to relate, not only with the main caracters but also the surportive; the embarrazing relatives, the adoring aunt, the beloved sister, the lost love, etc...What ever I could say will not do justice to this master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Lovely","review":"Just finished my second time through on this beloved novel, but first time on the printed page with this cool cover that I won online! Just as fun as I remember. Darcy and Elizabeth are destined for one another, but they both have to overcome their pride and prejudices in order to see the reasons why they should be together and fall in love. I know there is a lot that I'm missing since I'm not an Austen expert on her subtleties and innuendos on society, but that's what makes it a timeless classic...it still speaks to everyone even without knowing everything that she was intimating in her social commentary. My husband even enjoys watching Pride and Prejudice with me! He's a sucker for the romance! So give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth reading if your a rom-com fan...","review":"Read this, and then re-read this. You will see elements to most every romance novel, play and movie produced since this work was published. If you're a bit obsessive, you may even become an Austenite, seeking P&P rewrites, continuations, movies derived from it, etc. My faves of these are Bridget Jones's Diary (the first book and movie), The Bar Sinister (book continuation), and Lost in Austen (movie). There are TONS of these types of adaptations and explorations of the original novel, and for good reason: it is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa's Eclectic Bookshelf Reviews","review":"As I find with most \\"classics\\" this novel took some time to completely capture my interest. Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austin is the best!!","review":"I like when that what I read is realy interesting. I must say that Jane Austin wrote about life in England in the begining of 19th century. Lots of my friends think that it is'n actual at the moment, but I think it is nesesery to now how live people 200 years ago. I like her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have to say that I like this book so far.I have never actually read Pride and Prejudice before but i have seen the movie many times. I have seen the new version of it the 2005 movie.My cousin who is a HUGE Jane Austen fan loves P and P but hates the new movie becaue she says its nothing like the book.I happen to think that its quite similar.Is this the original book? Even if it is not the original i still love this book.and ifit is the original i will still love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Favorite","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the books I turn to when I need a break from my real life. I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Darcy!!!","review":"Well it's quite simply a classic! I was only 12 when the TV show came on and remember becoming transfixed by it. It propelled me to Austen's books and I haven't looked back since.

Each re-reading highlights Austen's genius, as new gems are discovered throughout in various forms. 'nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a good book, I really like it. Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attempting to give justification to a wicked book","review":"I loved the book, it is before its time.

Now I am a lover of it and the time peiod. As many have said every time you read it, it dosen't matter that you know, you can't wait to see if lizzie will marry Mr. Darcy.

But if like books set in time peord of this time peoid, I think you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you love reading about ballroom dances, castles, romance, and classic British humor, than Pride and Prejudice is the book for you. This 19th century novel has everything you want. It is filled with romance, passion, and drama, with just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in. Elizabeth Bennet's fiery personality captures your attention and holds it. Also, the mystery of Mr. Darcy's' true intentions of romance is held up in the air as you whip through the pages of this captivating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whose pride?","review":"It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake. But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important. I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title. Clever and astute, as usual. But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced? Or vice versa? Or are they both proud and prejudiced? These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Another Classic, but it just drags for me.

This version is in the latter group. It's AWFUL. Sometimes you only get half a screen, other times the text is different sizes. It has no table of contents for navigation. I love the book, I hate the version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book, Kindle version poor","review":"It goes without saying Pride and Prejudice is a classic of all time. My concern here and the reason for the low rating is the poor quality of this Kindle version. There are typos and in several places in the text very, very simple errors are made: in a few places, the same word repeats itself along the lines of \\"the the chair,\\" a couple malapropisms I am positive were not in the original text, and other typesetter's error that, if this Kindle edition had been subject to even a cursory review by a proofreader, would have been caught. I too would like to mention the FACT that emphasized WORDS are all CAPITALIZED in this version as AMAZINGLY annoying. I have never seen an actual book loaded with so many simple errors as this ebook is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book perhaps was inspired by Lytton's séances with Daniel Dunglas Home. A character Zee is mentioned. \\"Z\\" was reportedly a spirit who influenced Lytton to write Zanoni. It is a very short book. It took me about an hour to read. I can see how it might have been interesting 140 years ago, but I think it can only be recommended to hardcore fans of early fantasy/science fiction. Lytton has a sprawling style of writing with paragraphs that sometimes drag on for a whole page. The one thing that I found slightly interesting was that with the concept of the \\"vril bath\\" he appeared to anticipate Wilhelm Reich's orgone box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vrillified","review":"This is a dreadful novel, whose only claim to fame is that it inspired a large bunch of nutters to create the Second World War. It's content though entirely fictional prompted the creation of the Theosiphists, the Vril Society, the Thule Society and ultimately formed the philosophy of the NAZI Party. As entertainmant, its a total loss,a poor version of A Journey To the Center of the Earth. Even Tarzan at tne Earth's Core is a more enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this book hoping it would explain the inspiration for the Vril Society. Why would anyone be moved by this book to form a society following the idea of Vril?? Not only is it boring, but it is written like a children's book. Everything is explained like this...the grass was green and everywhere there was light...blah blah.... horrible imagery! I'm being biased only b/c I've read so many things about how the Vril Society influenced Nazism...and now I can't imagine why. This book sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Romantic Piano","review":"This is one of Vox's sleepers as the performers are not well known but the performances are impressive.

I obsessed about buying this book, and after several fruitless recon e-mails to vendors and the National Trust, I bought the book. WASTE OF MONEY. It is an edited version of CPW's original papers. Without serious psychological interpretation it doesn't illuminate his life at all. It's not even tactilely satisfying. The book is a flimsy small paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE SETS!","review":"We purchased this set for our son's 4th birthday and he was SO excited when he opened this gift. That is, until we actually got into the box and realized that half the paints were hardened, rubbery, and dry. The 4 sea creatures are made of cheap and thin rubber and are actually super or hot glued together, poorly. There is glue all over these creatures. The paints that were usable are water based and do not adhere to the rubber material. Needless to saw, we tossed the entire set out of frustration.

I much prefer either the older Robert Shaw, Atlanta Symphony recording or the James Levine, Chicago Symphony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"First off, it's good to point out that the title includes the words 'QuickPro', not 'Quickstart', What this means is, unlike other quickstart books, the book doesn't assume you're a dummy. It instead assumes you have some non-linear editing experience. It's intended at getting an experienced editor up to speed with Final Cut Pro. Coming from AVID and Premiere, this book was great for me. Having said that, it could be possible for a beginner to learn Final Cut Pro using this book, possible, but not the book's intention.The book doesn't have tutorials, but you can still follow along on your computer, or, because they're lots of screen captures you can read it away from the computer and simply imagine you're at the computer.

Not having purchased this brand before, I didn't realize the picture is actually showing four pads, sandwiched together in groups of two, making them look far sturdier than they are.The reality is that they are extremely thin -- the thickness of each pad is conveniently omitted from the product description. They measure just over .75\\" thick, something I only realized after receiving them.If you're buying them for use in a plastic frame, sold separately, this probably won't be a problem for you. If, like me, you intended to buy them for stand-alone use, they are flimsy compared to other brands.I have a holiday-themed round scratch pad from last December, designed to look like a peppermint, which requires no frame. It's more than double the thickness of one of these pads, and my cats have only just worn through it, after nine months of daily use."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless toy","review":"I bought this toy more than two years ago adn it's still in pristine condition.

The cats use the pads many times every day, rushing up and really getting their backs into it. Eventually the pad gets used up, worn away until only a small cob remains. Then the cats carry the remnant around or use it for their cat volleyball games.

Yet, you have to be grateful a Westerner is daring enough to do it on your behalf for the sake of enhancing your awareness in the comfort of your home. His depiction of Africa and Central Asia are unforgetable if not almost terrifying.His specific analysis of Pakistan is fascinating, looking at 'social' factors and then the 'physical' factors. He borrows this social vs. natural factor analysis from Homer-Dixon.As mentioned above, a dimension to his writing, is Kaplan's quality as an \\"intellectual aggregator.\\" He borrows material from tens of luminaries on various subjects. So, he rarely develops a theory in vacuum. He first aggregates different blocks of a political theory and then connects the dots between the blocks. He does that better than most. This makes for a very insightful and informative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beltway Talking Heads book disguised as travel narrative","review":"I was severely disappointed. Other than the Togo sequence early in the book, Kaplan isn't interested in \\"travel\\" at all; he hardly ever talks to people on the streets, preferring to talk to each country's equivalent of Beltway insiders.

I recommend buying the paperback; that way you will not only enjoy the amazing story but also the book itself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I only read two chapters of the book before I stopped reading. I found these chapters full of clichés and sensationalized stories (at least they appear to be). They also lacked original work and rely too much on other references. As an African, I've read many such stories and I feel that such type of books fail to give one a good understanding of the continent that I know. They just reinforce the stereotypical image westerners have about Africa. If you are expecting a good and honest travel narrative book, this is not it. Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice read, though a bit too shallow and wandering","review":"Although some parts are of great interest, I was surprised at how much time the writer uses getting a hotel or waiting in customs. I bought the book hoping to get a brief review of some remote corners of the world, and to some extent I did, but too many chapters seemed to be about dirty toilets in Uzbekistan. Some chapters, such as Iran, were very informative though too many others lack focus. Every now and then I buy a book (sight-unseen of course) from amazon.com that I know I would have never bought if I could have leafed through it in a store. This was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Colorful Descriptions with Brilliant Commentary","review":"I purchased this book expecting a bit of a travelog having never read Kaplan before. However, to my pleasant surprise, Kaplan gives wonderful insight into a host of socio-economic issues facing the countries he visited. He also never seems to forget to mention the upside of sometimes intolerable living conditions. Although a number of his opinions are derived from his personal experiences, he also sprinkles his commentary with the opinions and thoughts of other authors, researchers and philosophers making for a nice balance. A great read to say the least!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Provocative Travelogue","review":"Kaplan presents more than a travelogue of some of the most inaccessible places in the world, he also makes a compelling case about why these forgotten pockets need to be of more than passing concern to citizens of developed countries. While the author's characterization of these \\"frontiers of anarchy\\" is provocative, his arguments cannot be ignored.This book's first third, which focuses on West Africa, can be profitably read alongside an in-depth study like LIBERIA: PORTRAIT OF A FAILED STATE by John Peter Pham, published by Reed Press, which gives a detailed analysis of the strategic importance that Kaplan ascribes to regional conflicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't confuse the kids!","review":"Christmas is sacred to me, and it's something that should be taught to young children in a way that does not confuse fact with fiction. Fantasy stories that are clearly about things unrelated to the actual birth of Christ are fine as long as they are not promoted as truth. The real events surrounding the birth of Jesus should not be told with fantasy of such a degree mixed in. If you want your kids to know the Truth, especially if they are very young, don't read this to them, and make sure they don't really believe in Santa Clause either, 'cause if they do, then when they find out one day that he is not real, they might wonder if Jesus is real or just a fairy tale too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare miss for Asprin","review":"Robert Asprin is a great writer.

I enjoyed watching it. The material felt fresh, and the relationship between the two main characters was fun.I want to particularly point out that Funimation did a nice job on the packaging. The entire season (13 episodes) is included in one box, no larger than a typical movie. Further, the two discs contained in it, were secure, not sliding about, so they arrived scratch-free. This means a lot to me as an anime collector, because shows sold in many separate boxes cost a lot more, and take up an enormous amount of space.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Spice and Wolf to those interested in a sophisticated series in a late medieval setting. Technically the show can be termed Fantasy, but the show really concentrates on the personal and economic ties between people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrifing quality for finances, the Funimation way.","review":"Perhaps if Funimation would use three to four discs, instead of sacrificing quality by using only two discs for thirteen episodes, this might be worthwhile. Seriously, do they think people would not notice? Answerman, a reviewer from Anime News Network, agrees with my assessment. He states:\\"In North America, maybe Funimation will finally get through their concrete skulls that putting seven episodes of anime on one DVD makes it look like decaying raw sewage, and will wake up and delete their squeezeboxes and re-release all the affected series (including Fruits Basket) with no more than five episodes per DVD.\\"Here is the url, if you are interested:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue-ray","review":"Great anime show!

It doesn't smell like vinyl or plastic - it smells like some sort of insecticide or industrial chemical to me.

However, about the last 30-40 pages of the book were given over to polemnical-type statements/rants of paragraph-length coming from the characters. It was really tiresome and boring at that point.

Kudos to Nathalie for even taking these daring pieces on- this is some of Mozart's most challenging and stratospheric writing, but while I find Ms. Dessay absolutely sparkling in French repertoire, here she is just little nasal sounding in her Italian. And, this is a singer that can pull a nice, solid high G- and I heard a wicked recording of her doing it live!- but here, the 'Popoli Di Tessaglia' high notes are somewhat strained. Also, her considerable acting chops seem on pause here; I think she is a creature of stage and does not come across as well in the recording studio. Having said that, the long lines of 'Vorrei Spiegarvi' and the coloratura runs in 'No, Che Non Sei Capace' are close to perfect and the whole album is well worth buying if you like high flying Mozart arias, some of which are not even available anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are 40-packs, not 60-packs","review":"I bought these trying to save on packaging--usually they are sold as 40 count.

It contains 304 pages with more than 1000 very large, sharp, full color photos of every type of lunch box, from metal to vinyl to plastic. Everything is arranged alphabetically for easy location of items. Many of the photos include both the front and back of the lunchboxes to facilitate identification. Manufacturer data is also supplied. Prices appear to be realistic, and the authors have taken actual Internet sales into account when pricing the items. There is sufficient background information provided, of interest to seasoned collectors and the novice. Topics include a Timeline, Major Lunchbox Makers, Care and Cleaning, Artists, How Lunchboxes are Made, and Reproduction Lunchboxes. A glossary and bibiography add to the books usefulness. A very nice, useful reference work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good help for idenitification of lunchboxes.","review":"I like this book for identification of lunchboxes. I believe the value of an item is what another person will pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference material...","review":"As a newbie to the lunchbox collecting world (a few years), this is a great reference guide for lunchboxes. Great to see this vintage lunchboxes. Like most guides the costs are not very helpful but this is a well done book. Excellent photography. The history information and grading information is well done. Enjoyable and will reference for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love em and good for them too","review":"I purchased these for my picky eater. He totally loves them.

Night scenes lack detail in particular. This was known in the Japanese release, and remains uncorrected in this North American release. I recommend getting 1.11. Not only is that one color corrected, but it has 2 minutes more footage explaining the complex narrative, and is offered in Blu-Ray. Skip the 1.01 release and just get 1.11. Otherwise, it's a great edit/retelling of the original series, with new characters and different events playing out. This is volume 1 of 4 pending releases, and represent a more mature director's master work. Old fans wont be disappointed, and new fans can ingest more of the main series in much less time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"The first movie sticks pretty closely to the original anime. In terms of story, there isn't much new material in 1.01, but they did spiff up the graphics and make it very pretty to watch. This is a nice, somewhat condensed presentation of the first few episodes of one of the greatest animes of all time. It is also a good foundation for 2.22 which is significantly different from the original anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, but I'd wait","review":"This show is very good, but I would wait for v.1.11 which is on blu-ray and has been extended by approximately 2 minutes.

Anyone who thought the backlash was over will revise her thinking after reading this book.Krasnow waxes poetic on the subject of stay-at-home motherhood and makes a few good observations. What she doesn't do is explain what the woman who sacrifices all for family is supposed to do if she finds herself a single mother with a husband who doesn't pay child support, or a 55-year-old displaced homemaker with nothing to show for her troubles but an ex-husband who's found a younger model and grown children who seldom phone. The author fails to explain why only women are expected to put themselves in this precarious position. I could have sworn it took two people to create a child.One senses a certain amount of dishonesty here, in that the author has managed to turn out a book while preaching the joys of total self-surrender to family.To be fair, Krasnow writes well.

I am a stay at home mom of 3 under 3 who was fortunate enough to be able to walk away from a big career with even bigger potential. I was hoping for some words of wisdom to make the transition a bit easier. But, alas, all this one has to offer is self-piteous name dropping and repetitive stories of a search for spirituality. Get over yourself. Her writing is insulting at times.

You just can't glamourize motherhood, even by writing about picking up egg from the floor. It is not, and it will never be, intellectually stimulating. I have to agree with other reviewers who called it disingenuous and pointed to Krasnow's many other vocations besides motherhood. But what really irked me throughout was the repetition of the same \\"wonder of motherhood\\" speeches... I'm reading Mary Kay Blakely's American Mom right now and it's much better.

Mark Knopfler plays on only three of the albums 10 tunes, while Dave Edmunds input is limited to picking up instruments on only one of the tracks while producing/co-producing 4 others, none of them bearing the stamp of Knopflers trademark licks. If you have the money to burn, go for it.

Someone is obviously trying to cash in on MK's subsequent success. Three early-70s tracks on which he allegedly picked but did not sing are the sole excuse for this album; it would not have sold without Knopfler's name on the cover. Nuf said. Unless you're dying to hear what he sounded like before he found his style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music from good guitarplaying people.","review":"This album is a little underrestimated. This album is not a big blockbuster, and not so good as the Dire Straits records, and the rest of the M.Knopfler albums, but it's a very good album, anyway. M.Knopfler is the best musician on this record, and Dave Edmunds is also good, but not so skillful as MK. Dave Edmunds and the other guys does show up more then M.Knopfler in the songs. But MK is not whith on only one track here, he appears on more tracks here. Mostly on guitar. And don't forget about Pick Whiters, a great drummer, he's playing drums on some tracks.And a very good typicall picture at MK to, from the on every street tour. Can't be wrong. He look's a little bit like me.It's all about real rockblues music. So if you really are a great strait-fan ,and then of cause, a big MK-fan, then you better buy this Album too. / Thanks.

It contains a (very) short introduction on make-up & clown character, & then launches into the meat of the book - a collection of skits suitable for one and/or two clowns. Some skits are 'classics', while others are variations. All are funny and quite 'do-able' even for beginning clowns. The book is interspersed with nuggets about character, character development, entertaining, working with other clowns, audience control, etc. Frankly, as a professional clown, I don't know *where* the negative reviewer is coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very creative","review":"So I was expecting a lot more. This book does not have a big variety of skits like I hoped. It lacks creativity and doesn't give the skills needed to easily create your own.

This is more like an intro and some ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Degrading look at Clowns","review":"I cannot tell you how horrifying it was for me to read this awful book about clown skits.

Her sound had a very soft jazzy feeling that went very well with cruising in the car on a beautiful day; but also had a soulful gut wrenching emotion that wasn't difficult, just a soulful, easy strut. Still the emotion is felt and each song is different which is a breath of fresh air .... not just smooth jazz, not just R&B, not just Alternative..... just Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite concert performer!","review":"I saw Rosey, and just in fact heard of Rosey, as the opening act for Melissa Etheridge in Hershey, PA this past week.

Afterlife is my favorite song, also I love Desperate. I am very impressed with her and hope she goes far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of tracks for anytime listening","review":"Classifying this album would be pretty hard to do, but I think it fits closest to folk-pop if there is such a thing. Rosey has a great singing voice, but I'd cross Fiona Apple with Toni Childs instead of Beth Orton (Amazon review - Beth gets a bit monotonous, Toni has soul).Rosey hasn't gotten any radio airtime that I've heard in Atlanta, but if you like female pop artists, pick this one up... it's a great price for a great addition to your CD collection.Rosey would have gotten 5 stars, but I think the album lacked any songs with strong emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew!

However, her work as a talent scout apparently didn't teach her what was catchy and what wasn't. There is no hook anywhere at all on this album. I'm not a pop fan in general, but all songs need hooks. Its what gets you to listen to them, to want to sing along, etc. This cd, while varied in musical styles, stays at a slow dreamy pace throughout. I suppose if you wanted something to sleep to, this would be good.Her lyrics are weak and nearly every song follows the same pattern as far as vocal delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like A Toad With A Cough","review":"Her voice is far too husky and choked up.

There is a very small range of water pressure, and that's not always the right range for your application. I like to take a shower at very low pressure (less wasteful) and fill my spaghetti pot at full pressure (less time to fill)...neither of these is satisfactory with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works, second bad board in under 3 years","review":"We wanted an energy efficient option when we built our house 2-1/2 years ago. Just under a year old and the circuit board on the water heater died. We live in rural east Texas and finding someone here to service was impossible. Bosch hotline was not very supportive or helpful, and plan on spending a minimum of 45 minutes on hold. Between hotline, the plumber and electrician they finally decided it was a bad control board. Told me they would overnight a whole new water heater, but shipped it 3-day ground instead (which with the weekend meant 5 days). Now 15 months later we have the same problem all over again. I think we will just go back to a standard tank heater. The tankless is fabulous when it works, but not worth the hassle and expense when it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Alert","review":"Purchased from CPO and found the unit took 27 seconds to have warm water delivered to my tap 2 feet away.

The technicans said the 27 seconds for warm water to travel 2 feet is correct. My old hot water heater 25 feet away took the same amount of time. Check for your self, call Bosch technicians and see how long you have to wait to be helped before you purchase. CPO wouldn't take it back because I had installed the unit. In this case I had been better off lying to CPO than tell the truth.

But regardless I have to have the tech come back out and walk thru the testing with Bosch on the line, at Bosch's convenience of course, to confirm it's a problem. Oh and then the tech will explain how my professionally installed & permitted water heater is installed to ensure that doesn't void the warranty, because of course professionally installed, permitted and finalled and inspected by PG&E doesn't mean anything.

I ended up purchasing a Stiebel Eltron 29 and I finally have hot water again. Also, after review of internal components, the Stiebel contained a much higher level of workmanship.

We originally did not have a water filtration system so the water heater corroded and needed to buy a new unit since it was our fault. We bought a brand new AE125 water heater, since then we have had no hot water multiple times due to the system breaking on us. When there has been an issue, it has taken hours to problem solve what is wrong, one can only reach the company from 8am-5pm, and it has taken days for them to ship a new unit or new part to us.

The first one I purchased was nothing but problems and after receiving the second replacement, it did work approx. 4 yrs. and then the control board went out. It is an expensive product and maintaining with parts is not cheap. I cannot see investing any more money in Bosch's AE125. In the long run, it does not save you on your electric bill considering the expense involved with parts and electricians! The concept is great if it was a good product.

I live in the panhandle of Florida where the climate is mild in the winter and steamy hot in the summer. The unit is installed in the linen closet inside the bathroom so it is not exposed to outside climate changes - which is apparently an issue in northern climates.The water has NEVER been above 100 degrees and is not consistently hot.

If you have rural water or well water do not even waste your time and money. I have owned this product for over a year and have never been satisfied with it. The water pressure must be perfect for consistent hot water and should that pressure fluctuate be prepared to be frozen or scalded. If you need to contact a technical support person for help be prepared to wait on the phone for upwards of an hour and then be transferred to someone who has no clue how to fix your problem. At the present time my husband has been on hold for 1 hour trying to get help once again.

Certain photos look, at first glance, like the same location. But quite a few are actually not. And some that do match the location are taken from a different vantage point, making it hard to understand what exactly you are looking at. I do not believe that the authors reside in the Twin Cities, which may explain the sloppiness.The photographs (both old and new) are nice, hence the two stars. But Larry Millett, a local architecture critic, created a far better volume which was impeccably researched and meticulously rephotographed.

It works well on many different types of violins since it is pretty decent, predictable and gives a middle of the road tone. When it is new, there is a slight metallic feel, but that goes away after it is stretched out. Some people like the metallic feel and insist on new Dominants. They do take a few days to settle in though and last about 2-3 months.They feel supple under the finger and are not high tension strings. They start out on the bright side with good overtones but then they go dull. The E string is just ordinary, and many people substitute a different E string (such as Pirastro Gold).

Avoid this book!","review":"This is the WORST book on Hanjie I've ever seen. The author has tried to construct on the regular 5 block grids, but he can't seem to get the hang of it, so on almost every puzzle, you have rows and columns, sometimes up to three or four on each side, that you have to black out. This makes the 5 block grid almost useless for counting and placement. The easy puzzles are too easy and the hard puzzles have too many puzzles that you have to guess where to start. I am really, really sorry I wasted my money on this book, and I recommend that nobody else do it.The only reason I gave this book even ONE star is because Amazon won't let me do this review without a star rating. In reality I would rate it as a -3 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst","review":"The compiler, Timothy E Parker, has not even bothered to check that these pixel puzzles are solvable (let alone the degree of difficulty). While able to solve all puzzles in other books, I am stumped on number 66 for example, without being able to fill in a single cell!

I got so frustrated everytime I had to leave an unsolved puzzle behind and move on to the next one. I really started wondering if I was too dumb for this. Now I know they do require you to cheat...I'll just leave this book alone as soon as I get other puzzle books."},{"rating":"1","title":"More tedious than fun","review":"I am a big fan of this type of puzzle; however, the puzzles in this book are put on too large a grid, so that it is a pain to color in the squares.

If you are already familiar with these puzzles, though, I'd opt for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!!","review":"I have loved this type of puzzle for a long time.

Buy this book only if you've gone through every other hanjie puzzle available to you. As other reviewers mentioned, some of the grids are way to big for the puzzle (lots of padding). But my biggest complaint by far is the fact that some of the puzzles are indeterminate. In fact, the very first puzzle I did in the book forced me to guess. I'm guessing this book was a quick cash-in by the author. Obviously, he didn't do his homework on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang ie more lik ie","review":"I was disappointed with these puzzles.

They are perfect for blocking out the noise of small gas engines like found on mowers. I can usually open a pack and have it last for a few months worth before I need to replace them. I have also used them when visiting the gun range and found that they work well. I recommend these ear plugs as a good and reasonably cheap solution for noise reduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pivotal & Engaging","review":"Strachey's book was published orginally in 1921 and was a pivotal biography according to Linda Wagner-Martin in \\"Telling Women's Lives - The New Biography\\". This book broke away from tradition and provided a deeper look at the Queen and all those around her by abandoning the notion of promoting a person's successess and strengths and instead paints the portrait of a human with weaknesses, motivations, strengths, and stuggles. The reader sees the Queen in relationships that become history and see the impact of personality in making decisions.The book is engaging especially once Victoria moves beyond childhood and becomes Queen. The portrait of Edward and Victoria's relationship is vivid. The story provides a rich understanding of places in the lives of the royal family that continue today, namely Balmoral, and give a glimpse at the royal family culture that can be seen in current events. It is more than a book about Queen Victoria.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read a biography...and I liked it!","review":"This is (I'm ashamed to say) the first biography I've read since high school. It was well written, engaging and descriptive without being boring. I'm so glad I stumbled across this book. It has inspired me to find other biographies of the royal family. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that a third of the book was essentially a biography of Prince Albert. However, the book also eloquently gives a tangible picture of who she was as a young woman before the throne and how she matured as a daughter, a wife, a mother and the Queen of England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"This Black Hair product did not cover my wife's Gray Hair at all...It did, however turn her Gary Hair a nice bright coppery orange....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"Please don't waste your money.

Although it's a bit of a puzzle as to which concert actually got recorded (likely both), it really doesn't matter, because this is as good as it gets.The single CD version omits far too many of the superb medleys, and in any event, why would you omit any of this concert? The brothers are singing better than ever, they're backed by a crack band of seasoned pros, and the recording is ALMOST flawless.If there's any complaint, it's that the recording level is lower than it should be, but that's a minor problem at best.All the hits are here, and in a lot of ways, they're performed better than the originals. Absolutely essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh to turn back the clock","review":"If you are a fan of the Everly Brother's or ever have been, this is the music you want to hear.

I know he may be trying to sing as many songs as he could squeeze in for the show but in doing so he blazes past most of them as if he had a plane to catch (maybe he did?). After the loving is sung so fast he barely can squeeze the words into it in time! Unforgettable and When I fall in Love sound almost like totally different songs from the originals!

The author, a newspaper reporter, cannot keep her facts straight and consistently contradicts herself thoughout the book, sometimes within the same paragraph. There is no continuity and the timeframe jumps around for no rhyme or reason. She is more interested in dropping names and describing hairstyles and wardrobe than telling a good story. Due to the large amount of inconsistencies, it is obvious that the publisher spent little or no money in proofreading or editing.

I will state, however, that, in my opinion, the author, Michelle McPhee, is without a doubt one of the best true crime writers around today.

I remembered most of the stories that she relates and it was fun reading about the New York haunts that I myself, have been to. I really recommend this book and hope Ms. McPhee writes another one.

Finally, it gave out after five yrs and I called the 800-798-8161 line for assistance. The person I spoke with was very difficult to understand as he was foreign. He also had a terrible attitude and acted as if he was doing me a favor by speaking to me. He was unable to solve the problem and was not able to advise how to proceed.

It was better than I ever anticipated. The playing was sometimes a cacophony sometimes melodious, but always sublime. If possible this band was underrated, they soared to heights previously unreached. And took Jazz where it needed to go, out in unexplored territory. Jazz had been a little mainstream, and had needed to be shaken up. And by who better than, the most intense band going? If only modern players would take a few chances with their playing, Jazz would be in a far more progressive state than it is in. The fact that Coltrane tried to explore the same tracks with different variations in the personel, say's to me; that the man was on an almost spiritual quest for perfection, in his music.

Music -- like literature, a painting or a sculpture -- either speaks to the listener or it doesn't. I've been listening to jazz most of my adult life and understand that its very improvisatory nature, especially in live performances, often results in hits or misses when it comes to exploration of a theme. I've heard eight or ten different live versions of some of Monk's classic tunes -- Blue Monk, \`Round Midnight, Misterioso, Straight, No Chaser -- each rendition different. Some were hit out of the ballpark, while others left men on base. I've seen Brubeck perform three times and he almost never failed to hit for extra bases.When it comes to musicians like Monk and Coltrane, a listener either gets them or they don't.

They give only one side of the story. And their objections to the now widely accepted Alvarez Theory have all been satisfactorily answered. Aside from this, however, this is a well worthwhile book.

Unfortunately, the author falls victim to both temptations, and the book suffers because of it. The book will serve those who don't know much about Schmidt fairly well. For those who know more about him, you won't learn much that is new. The book also lacks meaningful analysis about Schmidt's career. In summary, I expected more on this subject and from this author, and I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Much New Here","review":"The danger when someone writes about a childhood hero (which the author admits in his introduction) is that the author can idolize the subject without question, apologize for certain aspects of his baseball life, or worse, both.

Of course in real life, this wouldn't happen but it made for good reading, not only for kids but also for oldsters and academic types if they simply lounge back and enjoy the story.

All have different situations, some more unusal than the next, but no matter the person, we all have struggles.I liked this story. It was interesting and had wonderful descriptions of everything-especially in the royal court. It sounded SO beautiful.

Movies like Garfield 2, Face-Off, Big Business and Double Dragon have been based on this trick. Where did it all start? Probably with this children's classic by Mark Twain. Set in Renaissance England, it tells the story of two boys who look exactly alike, except one is a prince and the other is a poor boy. The two meet each other, exchange places, and have loads of fun.

You can even by them one sausage at a time on AZmazon for less than $1.25 each so why buy it from THIS vendor for 3 times the price!!! I did just that by mistake thinking it was for FOUR boxes of the 34 count and not ONE. BTW, You can buy ONE of these little suasages for less than $2,00 RETAIL at most pet stores.The MERRICK product is GREAT! This vendor is ripping us off.

At least that is Wendy Baker's take on Donna's healing. She doesn't attribute it to the horses; she attributes Donna's healing to the Lakota culture and the Lakota community.The book concentrates on 9 Lakota Indians and 3 Lakota families and their stories about the importance of the horse in Lakota culture.It's by no means a comprehensive book; it's primarily a picture book with stories. And it isn't about the healing power of horses in the Lakota culture.Many people believe that there is a real spiritual and a healing connection between horses and humans, but this book is not a source for that information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial and uninspiring.","review":"There is a lot of potential in this subject, but the author didn't begin to do it justice.

This is a blues ballad with a rock feel.Wouldn't You Like to Know Me?:7/10 Pop song that has Great vocals.Take Me Away (Together as One):9/10 My favorite song from the album. Such a strong chorus.It's Alright:7/10 Another decent rock pop song.Hold Me, Touch Me (Think of Me When We're Apart):8/10 Nice love ballad.

Although he has done a lot of things I dont agree with, I have to say that I respect Paul Stanley as a musician and that he comes up with a spectactular album here. The best songs are 'Aint Quite Right', Goodbye', 'Love In Chains', and 'Tonight You Belong To Me'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second best of the solos.","review":"Paul Stanley proved he could write songs with this album. What makes this album listenable is Paul's voice. He is the best singer in the band. The music is well done as well. Apparently, unlike Gene, Paul took this venture seriously. Not as heavy as Ace's effort and about a billion times better than Peter's. Then again, what album isn't better than Peter's?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best, But OK","review":"This is an okay album. The only thing is, almost all of the songs are forgettable and don't leave any impression. They just sound on the whole like filler.

Early on, he meets the president of the United States, an idiot who caused the war, and he kills him. He also meets another survivor who managed to survive with the help of an ant colony and who is now the queen of that colony.The writing is gripping and the characters are unique. I was hooked and wished the book was longer (it's a little over 80 pages long). Johnson's imagination is vivid and inventive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Absolute rubbish. I can't understand the positive reviews and multiple stars. This book had no story line and no ending. I feel sorry for the tree that was cut down to make this waste of time. What's worse, I actually ordered this book from a store and am unable to return it. It will definitely be sold at my next garage sale.The main character has no depth whatsoever and the plot goes no where painfully slowly. The idea of creating a suit to withstand the end of the world actually had potential, but tragically this novel does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twinkies and cockroaches WILL survive!!","review":"Take the old adage, \\"Only cockroaches will survive a nuclear war\\", and build a unique, hilarious, disturbing, and surreal apocalypse story around it. That is what Jeremey Robert Johnson has done. Interesting from beginning to end, Johnson's 'Extinction Journals' takes you on a strange but thought provoking ride through a nuclear wasteland and though I enjoyed the book very much, I feel, as many other reviewers have stated, that this story had so much more potential for a fully engrossing sci-fi drama but fell a little short. That aside, I can still appreciate the work and always wish for more. Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Cliff","review":"This is actually my second Jimmy Cliff collection. I have his best of from Mango/Island, which is his earlier work. There's not much duplication from that album, which is also recommended.This one features a lot of his later work when reggae, in general, got a little more cheesy and over-produced. Jimmy Cliff's earlier stuff is much rawer.On this album though, despite being from a bad time in reggae, nearly every one of the songs is quite good. There are some good, bouncy, upbeat, more-synthesized beats. The choruses are strong and easy to get into.Also, this compilation features \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" from Cool Runnings, which means you don't have to buy the soundtrack just to get this one great song.Overall this is really good, fun music. A good intro to Jimmy Cliff. Also, it's definitely a good starting point for any reggae beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful music and wise words","review":"Wow!

They were fine for learning about painting a house, but I'm hiring painter, so I don't really need that information. What I need is help choosing the right color. Obviously I don't want to make a mistake. I already know that I want a yellow house. But none of the colors I have tested look right. They are all too bright or dark even though they look pale on the paint chips. When I saw this book, I noticed the phrase \\"choosing paint colors\\" right in the title, so I assumed it was the answer. But, I felt every bit as stuck at the paint store as I did before reading the book. My expectation was that I wouldn't have to start going through paint chips anymore, but the information in the book wasn't specific enough to be useful to me. The book did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"More attractive than helpful","review":"I bought the book because I needed help figuring out what color to paint my house, but it really didn't help me.

Instead it gave detailed information on the paint process itself with scant few houses where the whole house shows. Its mostly pretty photos like the rooftop of a house with a weatherwane on it, or a window with a window box of flowers under it. Where are the painted houses? I can't figure out what color to paint my house using this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate for the north","review":"This book is good for the southern half of the lower penninsula, but it is lacking in the Northern half from what I have found. I too have discovered that it shows roads where there are none, doesn't show roads that are there, and quite frequently (probably 30%) has the wrong road name. Don't venture into Norther Michigan and depend on this map or you'll end up in the middle of a National forest lost with out a reliable map to get you out. However, it is usually accurate in regards to highways and most main county roads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate","review":"Although the books detail looks impressive, when you get onto the small back roads, where you really need detailed information, the maps too many times are not reliable and not accurate.

The extra gentle cleanser is very gentle, but it doesn't clean very well, I use it before swimming and noticed, after leaving the pool, that i still had big mascara stains under my eyes. I am still looking for a good cleanser for dry/sensitive skin that foams and that I can use with water. This is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for adult sensitive skin","review":"I have oily skin and have battled acne even into adulthood. I tried this by accident because it was on sale at the store and my skin started to clear up over time. I didn't think it was the cleanser, so I later bought a cheaper gentle cleanser at the store and my face dried up really quickly and then I started to break out again.The cleansers out there made for acne is formulated for teenagers and are really harsh on the skin. The difference between this and some of the other gentle cleansers out there is that it moisturizes also. Dry skin typically tells your face to produce more oil (at least that's what I read). I give it 5 stars because it seems like my skin needed \\"extra\\" gentleness and this worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Stuff I Can Use","review":"This is the only face wash I can use in the winter when my skin gets dry and flaky.

In the summer I want something lighter and use Cetaphil."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fragrance free facewash","review":"Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser is a great fragrance and soap free product. I agree with another reviewer that it does not necessarily wash make-up off well, especially around the eyes when used as a normal cleanser per the instructions. I generally use a wash cloth or face sponge (lightly) with this product, which helps take off waterproof makeup.Remember, this is a gentle cleanser! I'm not sure many facial cleansers would remove makeup without a little friction unless they were specifically designed to remove make up. To remove makeup without scrubbing, try as a tissue off cleanser.If your skin is really sensitive to a lot of things, follow up this facewash with Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Sensitive Skin. If your skin is just sensitive to fragrance, try the Oil-Free Moisture in SPF 15 (or 35), especially when going outside, both are fragrance free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as I thought it would be.","review":"I thought this products was going to do well But this product did not get all of my make up off and it doesn't moisturize my skin.

I will not purchase this item again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gentle cleanser","review":"I bought this product because I wanted to try a gentle cleaner out for a change.

But overall I would recommend this to people with highly sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of Clinique","review":"For me, this product doesn't work for removing makeup (I use Bare Minerals and Waterproof Mascara). However, I like to use this product after washing first with a scrubbing foaming cleanser which removes my makeup but often leaves my skin dry. The Neutrogena Extra Gentle will then make my face less stiff and dry and provides a better base for applying makeup.

My son is very fair and I'm conscious of avoiding excess sun. Since sunscreen is not advised for babies under 6 months and is very slippery and difficult to apply, this is the perfect solution. With this rashie, one only need apply suncreen to lower legs and feet, pop a wide brimmed hat on their little head, and you're good to go. (I don't put sunscreen on hands since my boy jams them in his mouth so much). It has snaps along the bottom for quick diaper changes and a front zipper for easy-on/off. I plan on buying another one when he outgrows this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you wonder","review":"Novelists should be daunted by moments when a character describes his feelings. Shepherd, however, has the worst debriefing habit I've ever seen. Characters often discuss a scene that has just passed before readers' eyes, gambling that what the character says will align with what the reader feels. In this novel, people often say how much they were moved. What happens, however, if the reader wasn't, or, worse, if the scene before left the reader flat? In Shepherd's novel, we are supposed to believe in Henry's transformation. Through righting a list of wrongs, Henry \\"The Assassin\\" Chase is supposed to rediscover the idealist he once was. It's a fun premise, but for me the \\"supposed to\\" was its most vivid element. I never reacted as Shepherd thought I should, and who moves a reader by proffering he or she ought to react?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Craptacular Sentimental Pap!","review":"I finished this book, threw it across the room and yelled a swear.It's drivel based soley on melodrama that really goes no where. No hurtle is crossed, nothing is lost, and nothing is really at risk. The guy is a jerk, he decides not to be a jerk (a big step) and goes about doing it. In the process of not being a jerk, he's a jerk. Everyone forgives him with almost no resentment or question, and we are supposed to be moved by this?

Instead, Sophie Reilly takes him on a journey to purge his past transgressions and start over. Along the way, he falls in love with her and in the end, saves her just as much as he is saved.A man wrote this book, so there is no time wasted on cheesy romance - which I truly appreciated! I didn't like that everyone seemed so capable of forgiving his evil ways. He plowed through 6 in a long weekend for Pete's sake!!! But, it was a nice touch that Elizabeth popped back into the picture in the end and Henry got to make the real choice to be with Sophie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stayed up late to finish this good read","review":"This book had enough twists and turns to make it fun and interesting. Henry and Sophie are memorable characters in a fun and funny read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Assassin? Maybe","review":"A truly enjoyable story about a guy who's a ruthless, self-absorbed jerk. In a moment of blind panic, Henry Chase realizes that he's done a lot of damage in the past ten years while he tried to make his life something he can flaunt in the face of his high school love. But Henry realizes it's gotten him nowhere. Sophie, a would-be psychologist and part time hotel maid, urges Henry to make a list of the bad things he's done and do his best to correct them.I enjoyed Sophie quite a bit, although she got pretty weird toward the end. Unfortunately for Henry, little revealed in the book shows him as The Assassin, except for his past exploits. I wish there'd been a little more Assassin in Henry throughout the present portion of the book, just for comparison. Besides, he's kind of a spineless wimp, it seems. But, it's a good read otherwise, and the way it is written keeps the reader entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be deep..","review":"This book reads like a script for a TV show or bad movie. While entertaining at times, nothing stands out. The characters are paper thin and the plot is unbelievable. A guy goes from being a nice kid to a complete a-hole with a killer instinct over the course of ten years and then reverts back to a nice person again in a matter of days. The maid helping him has a surprising past that is not believable at all. I kept waiting for a bombshell to be dropped about who she really is and instead it was a dud. The whole time I read this story I kept thinking about the tv show, my name is earl. Not really an original idea. If you like a quick read that require little thought, then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp","review":"I'm currently in the middle of this book and enjoying it thoroughly. The dialogue is dead on and some of the situations are very funny. What I'm getting from this story is that we all should be so lucky to get second chances to make past wrongs right no matter how much we have to \\"suck it up\\" to do it. Henry, \\"The Assassin\\", is a marvelous character once some of the layers are peeled away and Sophie is the friend everyone should have when traveling on the road to redemption even though some of her behavior is pretty disturbing at times. I'm looking forward to finding out what her secrets are. Overall, this is a very funny and very poignant book... a real page turner from me. Also, the acknowledgements in the back are just as hysterical as parts of the story. The author has a wicked sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Must-Hear Perfomance","review":"Richard Woodhams' perfomance of the Strauss Oboe Concerto is for many oboists the difinitive interpretation of Strauss' masterpiece. From the expansive opening phrases to the pieces final flurry of sixlets, Woodhams sustains a wonderful clarity of tone and elegance of style that is unmatched in any other recording of the piece I have heard (and I've heard a lot). Especially amazing is Woodhams' sweet, tender,relaxed--though never \\"flat\\" (in terms of prasing)-- performance of the deceptively difficult second movement. Woodhams' precision in the few technical passages is amazing as well. In my humble opinion, Mr. Woodhams' performance out-does all others, even that of his old teacher, John DeLancie, who inspired the creation of the work in the 1940s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artesian Road Sugar & Creamer","review":"I purchased this sugar and creamer set over the holidays and am very happy with my purchase.

They've got a hard rock edge to them similar to bands like Smashing Pumpkins or The Vines with some vibes of more classic bands such as Guns N Roses. Davey's powerful vocals mixed with Mark's edgy guitar work, Shane's backing bass lines, and Isaac's energetic and driving drum work make this album a true work of Rock art. If you don't like this album at first, listen to it again. If you still arn't sure about it, give it another try. Because there isn't any reason why you shouldn't like them.

This is an album for anyone who loves it hard and a little weird. The only reason why I spared the 5th star is the fact that Megaherz are still way too serious about themselves. They are among the best, so they could afford a more relaxed attitude. No need to prove yourself the way all these oh-so-extra-hard metal bands do.However, the guys are starting to improve on that. Track 11 - Totet den DJ [Kill the DJ] has some of the ironic twist that has always set Rammstein apart from the crowd.

No other book has attempted to do this, and Secrest does a fine job. This book is an absolute feast for Sondheim fans, because the Great Man himself reveals several illuminating insights into his own life, conflicted personality and peerless work.

There has not before been so personal a view of Sondheim's life. I did find the need to reference the other books to get an absolutely clear picture of Sondheim's professional merits, but this book's motivation was to stress the personal.Now and then there were lacunae in the text which were daunting, considering that they were coming from such an experienced author and such a prestigious publishing house.

As fast as a house on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her sweet imbecilities tumbled so rapidly onto my lap.","review":"As a Sondheim addict, my hopes for this new biography were high. Unfortunately, they weren't met -- not even close. As has been stated in other reviews, there is little new here, very little insight; Seacrest does talk to a number of interesting people from Sondheim's past, but the passages she chooses to use are ho-hum at best. Perhaps most off-putting is Seacrest's almost unbearably dry writing style. The fact that she could take a subject like Stephen Sondheim and make him boring to read about has to be one of the new wonders of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This new biography of Stephen Sondheim doesn't tell us all that much about the man. I also found the discussion of his work fairly simplistic. The author often relies on other sources and reviews rather than stating her own opinions about Sondheim's compositions. I often got the impression that the writer hadn't even seen his shows on stage. The more interesting parts are about his growing up period and his recent romantic life. Perhaps this will appeal more to those who know nothing of his contributions to the musical theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any Sondheim fan","review":"This book is a wealth of information for anyone who loves Sondheim or musical theatre in general. I consider myself a Sonheim fanatic, but I still found information in this book that I had never heard before. To top it off, the book contains anecdotes and black and white photos of other Broadway legends like Harold Prince and Jerome Robbins.The author does stray from the topic at hand from time to time and goes off on some interesting yet irrelevant tangents. Also, in attempting to briefly summarize some of Sondheim's shows, Meryle Secrest is, at times, incorrect about the events or actions in the play.Aside from these minor infringements, which any semi-knowledgeable reader would easily recognize, the book is interesting and compelling. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully Unfocused and INDULGENT","review":"This is simply ridiculously bad, just ridiculous. Many characters are introduced, many storylines are established-- and not ONE is developed satisfactorily. Novice filmmaking from everyone except the actors. No great performances here but all competent. I particularly enjoyed Rory Culkin as Michael Douglas's young son. Culkin provides the film's one genuinely funny moment when he asks a surprising question of his mother (who is concerned he isn't speaking to his parents enough).It is always nice to see Kirk Douglas still performing and he has great courage to do so. However, giving him foul-mouthed dialogue and dirty jokes- as this film does- is not very dignified. Parents beware: this film may appear to be fairly good natured, but there is an awful lot of 'language' and 'adult themes'.This is a big ensemble piece, but it doesn't add up to much of anything. This movie wanted to be about so much, but it honestly doesn't end up being about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This film was listed as a light-hearted comedy, however, there was absolutely NOTHING funny in this entire film. It is about a totally dysfunctional family -- two of the family members die, the son is a drug addict -- I just did not see any humor in this film at all. Actually, I found it to be totally depressing! I certainly would not want someone who is already feeling down to see this movie, it might just send them over the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY CLOYINGLY TIES ITS LOOSE ENDS..","review":"A reviewer here called this movie a 'vanity piece' of the Douglas clan. That's a bit harsh because many parts of the movie are actually quite endearing and could easily have been just about any family in a big city. The first 10 minutes leave you wishing for something to happen, a wish that unfortunately remains ungranted until the credits roll. Acting wise, it's decent but amounts to little. Younger generation, in particular Rory Culkin as a young kid and Cameron Douglas (Michael Douglas' real-life son) as a wannabe casanova tween, display an easy charm and grace that makes them watchable. I recommend getting a complete picture of the movie through its quicktime trailor, because the actual movie adds very little to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Runs in the Family","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase. It was sent very quickly and in great condition. I will buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and shallow","review":"There is nothing funny and entertaining about this movie. It is about three generations of a dysfunctional family. Kirk Douglas is extremely unlikable and Michael Douglas is no more appealing. The movie drags on and on about family problems that are purely depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth seeing","review":"This is the worst Micheal Douglas Movie I saw so far. It is about a dysfunctional Famliy. it has little comedy in it un like others that have dysfunctional families. it is downright boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Shows Its Age.","review":"I enjoy hardboiled fiction. Always have. But this book, although its wartime California setting is interesting, definitely creaks with age. I sympathize with the put upon bride (second time with the same heel) but I don't want to spend a whole book with her. Or her bridegroom. Then, too, no body bothered with even minimal line editing so the typos and very odd space breaks are off-putting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bamboozled","review":"The story line is weak and rambling; the ending no surprise. This was a big disappointment as Dorothy Hughes is overall an awesome writer and a forerunner of mystery/detective stories with strong characters. Not bad for a beach read but not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Instrumental Jams","review":"Welcome to the shadowy world of Dr. Octagon. Gothic, hip-hop dubs, sad, gypsy violins float in and out of stoic compositions. Airy, jazz-driven flutes, bleak and barren rhythms, and a palatable emptiness where ephemeral public service announcements materialize and evaporate..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the day.......","review":"I remember back in the day...sitting round the coffee table, with a can of Red Stripe, and a packet of Rizla. Good company, lots of laughing... and a soundtrack donated by Dr Octagon.Instrumentalyst isn't a one on one album. I wouldn't sit down and give it my undivided attention because, quite frankly, it could get a bit boring.But if you need some beats to freestyle to, if you're happy to chat but need something a bit less depressing than Unkle, something that can remind you of the new dawn of Hip Hop fusion - look no further.And can I add, the gentlemen who did use these beats as late night backing tracks whilst brooding over their beer - they're well respected artists now.Who knows where this could lead you to."},{"rating":"1","title":"To simular","review":"hes got two albums out.

I like stories of African Americans in the Civil War"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book is the story about the Massachusetts 54th Regiment during the Civil War, which was all African American. This book appears to be designed for early elementary students, but the nature of the artwork would be appealing to older students, including English language learners. This perspective story could be an excellent way to engage students to talk about the Civil War, ethnicity, bigotry, exclusion, and tough diversity issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reckoning with Schaller","review":"I found this book to rather tiring. There was too much useless and unnecessary information. Schaller also tended to make former President Regan look like a bumbling idiot who let his Cabinet members run the Nation. I found that Schaller did not tend to highlight the positive impact that Reagan had on the Nation. Without having to know much about Reagan and the Nation during that time, it is clear that Schaller let his personal opinion interfere with his professinal one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the madness","review":"It seems that there is no escape from these hazy sweet books of Ronal Reagan. Let's just hope that they do not turn into the cottage industry that books on the Kennedies morphed into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price","review":"This product line has gone up almost 100% in price recently (different packaging/same product) and this is a good deal if you use it regularly, even if you aren't a salon. Me and my husband both use it daily and we won't have to buy a small bottle of it for $25 bucks every 2 months. This was a great deal. Shipping was costly though because of the weight. It came within 3 days. The pump that they sent with it was not the one for that jar and broke within days though. Overall very happy with the deal I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not going to be expired soon!","review":"A friend in Cali told me about this.

Due to the copy protection, this game won't run on some computers.If you have any type of CD/DVD burning software installed that's more advanced than the basic stuff that comes with the computer / drive, the game wants you to uninstall it.If you have any type of virutal CD software installed, yup, you guessed it... The game wants you to uninstall it.As far as I'm concerned, when a game company expects their customers to remove software from their computer just to play a game, I'll look elsewhere. I use my computer for games and work, therefore burning software and vitrual CD software is a lot more important than a game that's broken out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"NFS most disappointing AI","review":"The game can be quite enjoyable to play, but extremely aggravating when 20 second lead times are erased because you're not allowed to win by that big of a margin. If you outsmart or out drive the computers cars you will see them granted acceleration speeds that can only be measured in Mach, and the cornering ability of a cheetah.The recovery times of the AI's cars when tricked or pushed into obstacles seems like a huge hand follows them and quickly corrects any mishaps. When you find yourself losing because you nick some corner within 100 feet of the finish, but had been in the lead until then, you want to chuck the cd's out the window. I used to be a fan of NFS series, but this installment has me doubting I'll every purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good game","review":"If we do not need to put the disc in our driver when we start the game, it will be much faster to get into the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"I never played any of NFS games before; I was debating on whether to purchase 'Most Wanted' or 'Carbon', and I'm glad I chose this one. In this game, the storyline isn't so bad for a racing game. You have a substantial amount of cars to purchase and claim (utilizing the pinkslips). The map is huge with many cities to drive in. The most intensifying quality about this game is the fact that a number of law enforcement pursue you, and they become tougher to escape the longer they chase you, being engaged by racers to helicopters. I won't compare this game to 'Carbon' as I do not want to post negative reviews about the game nor do I want to type another paragraph, just know that 'Most Wanted' IMO was a whole lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need for Speed/ Most Wanted Black Edition","review":"I purchased this game for my husband last year.

Its impedance matching characteristics are not too ideal when compared to standard ultrasonic gels either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful playing","review":"Han-Na Chang plays all of these pieces so beautifully. Her sound is so lovely it's practically painful. It's wonderfully played, both beautiful and nice sounding all at once. While every piece on this CD is spectacular, Kol Nidrei by Bruch is my favorite, because Chang gets the sound across so beautifully in that piece. Every other song (the concerto, the variations, etc.) is just as amazing, but of them all, Chang's playing of the Bruch is my favorite.It's a great CD, played by an amazing young artist whose talent cannot be argued with. Chang is an extremely talented cellist, and this CD shows it off with a group of superbly played music. I recommend this whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"i love it!! i've listened to it so much. one can hardly believe that she is only 13 or so! it's amazing and also inspiring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"There oughta be a law against anyone this young being this talented.

The purple one which I am thinking is oil-free or something because I bought these at the store since it was all there was and they are DISGUSTING. I am surprised no one else has commented about this. It makes everything all oily. It removes the makeup great but makes me want to vom with all the oil on my fingers and face. Do you like to rub oil on your eyes? BlehI am going to see if CVS will take it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly oily.","review":"I normally use the oil-free version of this product but I decided to give this one a try. First of all it took over three weeks to arrive, which is unusual for something coming from Amazon. When I opened it the pads were rough and dry but still somehow soaked with oil. After removing my eye makeup with it there was an oil slick under my eyes that was still there when I woke up the next morning. Over the course of the day my mascara transferred under my eyes until I looked like a raccoon because my skin was so oily, which has never happened before. I tried them for about three days and then just gave up and threw the rest of them away because my whole face was oilier than it had ever been before.

Anything released by the Carpenters is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection","review":"The songs on this album seem to lack a full bodied sound, but that may be the the original recordings were mixed. A good collection of this group featuring the pure vocals of Karen Carpenter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Touching Ballads","review":"A nice compilation by this brother and sister team. The songs are very well structured and Karen's voice is oh so beautiful. The omission of A Kind of Hush is pretty glaring and there are too many ballads. It would be intersting to hear Karen Carpenter rock out a little more like she does on Please Mr. Postman.Nonetheless classics like For All We Know, Superstar, We've Only Just Begun, and Only Yesterday will live on for decades to come. I Won't Last A Day Without You is a less commercialized gem that fortunately made the cut here. Worthwhile for those who appreciate easy listening music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sentimental Journey","review":"This is one of the best Carpenters collections I have ever heard.

Off the top of my head; A Kind of Hush, Sweet Sweet Smile, Honolulu City Lights, Calling Occupants..., and other Singles that came out after the original The Singles 1969-1973 do not appear on this album. From the first time I heard Karen's voice and Carpenters music I was hooked. No artist since, and likely ever will touch my heart and capture my emotions like Carpenters. I do like this album including the great cover. I appreciated the extended version of my favorite song I Won't Last a Day Without You. I believe just about everyone has a favorite Carpenters tune, some are just 'closet' fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cover but...","review":"This was a total disappointment. Not only were several hit singles left off (\\"There's a Kind of Hush,\\" \\"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft,\\" \\"Solitaire\\" and \\"Sweet, Sweet Smile\\"), but all except for \\"Close to You\\" and \\"Touch Me When We're Dancing\\" were remixed. Also, once again, the original \\"Postman\\" wasn't included, which was the Carpenters' biggest internatinal hit.Overall, this is another showcase for another rehashing by Richard Carpenter.

I bought the vest in black which is the required ghost hunter color of course. It arrived promptly and in good condition. I really like the variety of the sizes of pockets. As I began loading ALL my various gear into different pockets, the vest began to get sort of heavy. Also if you load up the front pockets and don't put anything in the rear pocket the vest will want to pull forward and can cut into the back your neck after wearing for long periods. I then moved some notepads to the rear, took out the extras and the vest worked excellently. It took me about 3 investigations to get the gear distributed to where I found it the most effective. I've only had the vest for a little over a month so I can't rate the dependability.The only thing that kept the vest from getting 5 stars was the fact that the rear pocket is very large and things tend to bunch in the center of it which interferes with sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to travel gear","review":"The medium is perfect for a 5'4\\" 126 pound female.

The only difference is, they are sold as just lollipops (not a morning sickness cure) and thus are a fraction of the cost. In regards to effectiveness, these drops unfortunately did nothing for me.

Hate it. So during my first pregnancy I was anxious to find anything that might work to help me lose the morning sickness. I tried Sea Bands (no effect, returned them), saltines (ok), ginger ale (also ok), prescription meds (wonderful) and preggie pops. I thought they would be convenient as I could carry them around with me in a pocket or purse and not have cracker crumbs all over my growing tummy. Although the preggie pops are indeed portable, that's about all they are. They did NOTHING for my morning sickness - they're just a more expensive lollipop. Apparently they're supposed to help with dry mouth, but ANY candy sucker or mint will perform the same function for a much lower price. Although some people have said these pops have been helpful for them, I can say without a doubt that I would not buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept but doesn't deliver","review":"This product is a great concept but unfortunately didn't work for me.

The 'special blend' of herbs really is a gimmick in my opinion. they don't tell you what's in them and i truly feel they are just glorified hard candy. They didn't work for me and as I was sitting in my hair appt. sucking on a lollipop it all seemed a little juvenile. I did buy the preggie pop drops which eliminates the need for the lollipop so it's a little more discreet. If I had it all to do over i would just buy some organic, naturally sweetened hard candies and call it a day. I ended up having a special tincture mixed for me by my local herbalist called 'pregnancy nausea relief' and it worked like a charm.

It is in all points disappointing: the record does not capture the voices and the drama. Alagna's beautiful and expressive singing becomes a shouting on the CD, the silver voice of Mattila sounds strange, Meier's seducing and expressive singing turns into something witchy, van Dam looses all his characterization of a broken king, only Hampson survives the recording. Yes, they all manage the French language, yes, they act perfectly - but Pappano is not following them and the recording destroys it all. One of the greatest deceptions on records there is (the video is a little better)! But, why not get the Solti version (if you don't care about the Italian language)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Don Carlos is both musically and dramatically superb --","review":"Having both listened to this production on CD and viewed it on video, I can't recommend it enough. Despite much pomp and choral panache, Don Carlos is a drama about human relationship and conflict. Early into a viewing of the video, it became quite clear that this production was special -- Mattila, Van Dam, Hampson, Meier and even Alagna come through with consistently fine singing and the emotional/dramatic chemistry that are a must in order to pull off these roles. Far from overdone with the usual dark sets and heavy costumes, the smart-looking production actually supported its somewhat more youthful-than-usual cast. Kudos to conductor Pappano as well -- he was obviously inspired. I only wish I could have been at the Chatalet to see this gem of an opera ... I would have known what to say to the rest of us who claim that there are no more memorable opera productions ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for small manufacturers","review":"The business advice in this book applies to manufacturers of all sizes, not just \\"small\\" ones.

Janson an the orchestra have full measure of these pieces. the wind and brass are marvelous. Strong Mediterranean atmosphere and a bittersweet nostalgiac feeling pervades.

It's great not having to worry about putting on a second product. This products moisturizes my face from the moment I put it on in the morning (feels soooo good when my skin is especially dry).

Decent as in if you use it youll bet the boss, most of the time.The book tells you what items there are to find in a section, but its incomplete and wrong. Most of the time there are at least 2 items i found that werent on the list, and at least 1 item on the list that wasnt in the game in that area.The walk through is good if all you want to do is go directly to the boss, but it doesnt take you to the weapon/armor upgrades neccesary to defeat the boss.The game is great, this book is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Brief","review":"The reason why people buy official strategy guides in the first place is because they need in depth helps.This guide book is really brief hardly telling you where key items are and how to defeat bosses and the right team combinations and skills to use.Legend of Dragoon is a complicated game and the guide book does not help by briefly describing on the dragoon power, how to boost it up .......It could have been better"},{"rating":"1","title":"no info","review":"like the others said, if you are looking for something to tell you where to go next it is good, but for one it does not tell you where all the items are and hardly anything about the sub quest. overall it is a very rushed and poorly put together strategy guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"From an avid player","review":"If you're looking for a strategy guide to Legend of Dragoon, look elsewhere.

To me this was a rushed guide and not worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Walk-through","review":"This guide is good for a basic walk-through. It tells you where to go and does give some strategy. It makes a poor attempt at locating items. It does give a list before each section, but it is often incomplete. I wouldn't mind minor items, but they should've at least located all weapon upgrades and stardust(in the walk-through, not just in the table of charts in the front of the book).If you do get this guide, watchout for the stradust error. The guide tells you that you can go back for all stardusts at the end of the game. There is one that has to be taken before a certain event. Now in the list it has its location and (before event) but in the stardust section intro it says don't bother looking in that town until after the event. And again in the walk-through it doesn't mention that particular stardust. So beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Companion","review":"With any RPG you should consider buying the player's guide.

As long as switch is illuminated and the unit is on, the water is hot. Once it shuts off, it will not turn back on to maintain the water in the tank at 120 degrees.

That slang term is decidely too modern. I would not recommend this book for the novice history buff. Only those of us who have read extensively on Europeon royalty would understand the relationships between the families and would know who came from where and how closely related the individuals were.

I have never felt tired of enjoying the pieces on this CD, and got more of her recordings on other CDs instead.Sabine Meyer is a true master of the clarinet. In this recording of opera pieces, she demonstrated how well the clarinet could sing opera beautifully. My favorite pieces in this CD include Bassi's \\"Fantaisie brillante on Verdi's \`Rigoletto'\\", Danzi's \\"Variations on \`Là Ci Darem la Mano'\\", and Rossini's \\"Theme and Variations\\".This is definitely a clarinet CD to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another version","review":"We bought this collection - all public domain films - because we're big Cagney fans. We'd seen Something to Sing About previously. Not a very good film, but Cagney is delightful in it; we love to see him dance. And the music is good. While the other two films are in pretty poor shape, this one was absolutely wretched. Every few seconds there were cuts. Every single scene had missing pieces, missing dialogue, missing music. Most of the opening credits and the end were just gone. Yeah, it didn't cost very much, but it's still shocking that someone would market such a mess. Really unethical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch & Amy","review":"I REALLY liked this one. A lot. A lot a lot. It was a great portrayal of twins, and I'm sure any twins reading would have gotten a kick out of it. Again, classic Ramona-type material/humor. The alternating chapters were great, and surprisingly for once, I found myself relating to the male character, Mitch, more than Amy, who struck me as kind of a stuck up spoiled brat. The problems the twins deal with are common ones, though, particularly the bully problem (\\"He's the type who's nice to grown ups but not to kids.\\" How many of us know a person like that?) Minor detail, I adored that the kids considered \\"school\\" a bad word, I would have definitely done that as a kid. The only thing I disliked was the ending--I felt some more resolution, a more significant scene, was needed between the twins.Rating: 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sibling rivalry at its funniest!","review":"Nine-year-old twins Mitchell and Amy are opposites -- he's good in math and bad in reading, while Amy's good in reading and bad at math. She is serious and worries about everything, while he just plain doesn't seem to care. And no matter what Mitchell or Amy does, it generally results in the other running to complain to their parents.It seems the twins will never find common ground...until a bully comes along. Although he begins to torment them separately, it's working together that Mitchell and Amy will finally begin to see eye to eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 7th Grade Student from California","review":"Twins Mitch and Amy are totally different from each other.While Mitch does best in his multiplication tables, Amy does best in her reading. They fight almost constantly, about the littlest things, and they like to annoy each other, like when Mitch had to read aloud to their mom, Amy sat in the same room, and kept on bugging him by gloating on which page she was on, and when their parents forgot about making Amy do her multiplication tables, Mitch reminded them. They never had anything in common, until Alan Hibbler, the neighborhood bully, bothered both Mitch and Amy. The twins set aside thier differences and then they went against Alan.I think this is a good book, but then since I don't have any siblings, I couldn't really feel the pain that they go through at times, arguing and fighting. But then Mitch and Amy kind of helps. It also tells about standing up to bullies, such as Alan Hibbler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with ur Entrance Exam","review":"This book helps and give u tips on ur entrance exam.

I thought it was really going to knock my socks off.Instead, I wasted a spot on my Netflix queue and got bored, yo.I will give it this: I can appreciate how edgy the movie was *meant* to be. But it fell horribly, terribly flat. Page (who is supposedly *so* intense as Haley) is a snotty little creep. Kohlver is a snotty grown-up creep. I don't feel any sympathy or compassion for either of them. And I'm not buying the whole teenager-tracks-down-criminal-and-makes-him-pay routine. What is she supposed to be, Encyclopedia Brown or something?Basically, the story heads into areas that it really should just avoid.

In the movie it is heavily implied that the \\"missing girl\\" seen on a flyer at the beginning of the film, the girl Patrick Wilson's character witnessed being killed, was a close friend of Hayley's. Thus, as she admits on the roof at the end, she formulated this idea and killed the man who murdered her friend, but before he died he told her there was another person involved, and now she's come after him to finish the job. So, her intention is basically to avenge the murder of her friend. Get it now?*********SPOILER ALERT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I wish I could have given this zero stars. This movie is pointless. The dialogue is cheesy and the girl (Ellen Page) acts and talks far too sophisticated for a 14 year old.

This girl had more strength then a WWF wrestler. How in the world was she able to pick up this guy so that he is on the chair with a rope around his neck? This girl was beyond possessed. They made the guy look really weak and boy was she controlling all through the movie. If you want to see a strong girl take revenage on someone then this is your movie to watch. Notice while she was on the roof with the guy that all of a sudden the gun is missing. Wasn't she carrying a gun? heck, why didn't she just shoot the darn guy. Oh that's right, then the movie would only be a half hour movie. The director chose to take us on a long ride of watching the guy beg for his life. He could have just thrown her off the roof and then hang himself, now that would have been a better plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful.","review":"After watching this movie, i have to tell you... i thought it was horrible.

This movie was the worst feature I have seen in a long time. Ellen's character goes on some sort of crusade to torture a pedo (including castration.) Her character goes from bad to worse as the movie goes on. As always, she does an amazing job in the roll; however by the end of it you hope the man who was supposed to be the villian will win.

The performances of the two main actors are riveting and provide 90 minutes of compelling viewing. And it's these performances alone that make the film worth watching.Sadly, Hard Candy is simply too implausible and exploitative to be of any real value. Page's character is far more resourceful, remorseless, relentless, and self-assured than any 14-year-old. Her morality, which is pivotal, becomes increasingly ambiguous as the film progresses, and the violence, although it mostly takes place out of shot, verges uncomfortably close to torture porn, displacing any message that might have been intended, and polarising the viewer's sympathies. The shock tactics used here, which would be perfectly acceptable in a horror vehicle, are out of place in a film such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down for Ellen","review":"Ellen Page was so annoying in this movie, honestly the plot was dumb and the whole point of her doing what she did was not clear through out this pointless movie.

The main purpose of this film it seems, is to try and preach vigilante justice. Making the idea of it, almost romantic and appealing. The only reason i sat through the entire film, was in the hopes that a logical explaination of the motivation behind why this person does what they do during the course of this film , would appear. what i got out of it instead...was a generalization; an attitude of \\"people like that need to be punished, and i'm the one to do it.\\" it was annoying that the film makers did such a good job of making this about a \\"villian\\" and a \\"good guy\\"...when in fact, both the main characters were dark, frightening and twisted, and shouldn't have been glorified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Candy","review":"Hard Candy was a movie that threw me for a loop!

Why? Because although his character was totally inapropriate, the story did nothing to convince me that he was the monster this little tries to get him to be. By the time she was castrating him, I swear, I wanted him to kill her.If you're going to show a 14 year-old girl taking revenge against a monster, convince me that he's a monster, and don't wait until two minutes before he hangs himself on the roof of his building to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Men better think twice before hurting young girls after watching this movie!","review":"This was a very intriguing movie.

It's way unfair - he's already tied up and also she's smarter than he is and wins every verbal exchange. After the deed is done, the girl dangles a little hope by mentioning a teacher she had who got his finger sewed back on. Meanwhile she's inevitably wandering toward the garbage disposal. Finally we hear the crunching sound briefly - followed by - whirrrrr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the creepiest movies I've ever seen","review":"While the performances of the two leads are very good, I can find no excuse for this movie having been made. It is without a doubt the creepiest film I've ever seen. I don't really care what the guilt of Patrick Wilson's character is ... this kind of torture of a grown man by a teen age girl should not have been allowed whether Ellen Page's character is mentally ill or not ... it shows the justice system being turned on its head. No matter how deserving of death Wilson's character may have been, it is not helpful to a society to show this particular kind of justice being meted out. This is the first time I've ever been so severe in judging a movie and I hope I don't feel I have to do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I'm glad that I did not read a single review here before I watched this movie because I would not have enjoyed it as much if I knew half the story.So after having said that, I urge anyone reading to stop and go rent or buy the movie. I watched it based on one trailer at the theater which gave away nothing important but the basics: Internet predator (?) meets little girl for tryst (?)The question marks are because you don't really know if those statements are true. As the movie unfolds you're treated to one surprise after another, until you get to what I had to admit was only a half satisfying ending.You never really know the girl, or what her motive is. Remove one star for that. Some people may enjoy that. I didn't.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"for anyone who hates child molesters, you're in for a treat!","review":"Controversial? Definately. Enjoyable? Very much so. Recommended to me by friends, I had to try this. I was amazed by the restraint from graphic and sexual violence. Ellen Page is brand new to me, but she was great in this! A 14-year old, behaving like an adult, emotionally torturing this guy who may a molester, so many things happen in this movie that I wasn't expecting, and there were times you didn't know who to root for. The writer and director took an idea that may have been done before, and throws the audience for a loop. I've never seen a 14 year old girl do something like this-act like an adult, and take the law into her own hands. To me, this film was very original, everything was done very subtly, and sometimes that isn't a bad thing. Rent this film, it's worth it, believe me! It's also worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappoinment !","review":"We were expecting that this recording of the Concierto D' Aranjuez came out to be the best, but it shows one more time that only John Williams's recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra bring to the audience the authentic message from the composer. On Manuel's recording is very difficult to hear the guitar and the sound sometime is very weak. Manuel decided to take a lot of notes out on technical challenge parts, maybe he did not know how to practice those parts or he did not have enough time to prepare the piece. I would like to say that Placido Domigo is not a conductor, a good musician can tell the diference between this reocording conducted by Placido and a recording conducted by a real and professional conductor. I will buy twenty times John Williams's recording then this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"What a gem is Margaret Bonham's The Complete Guide to Mutts. Not only does she cover types of mutts, training, food, health and everything else a prospective dog owner needs to know, but I love that she emphasizes throughout the book that adopting a dog is a serious long-term commitment.

Bonham has a great section on mutt health, a good one on nutrition for \\"The Most Popular Dog in America,\\" and a good one on how to select either a puppy or adult rescue. She covers what you might be able to reasonably expect physically in what type of mix, what group activities are available to them, what to look for in a good trainer and what training equipment you should expect go get, road trips, how to choose a vet, introducing them to the cat, and Bonham offers terrific advice on how to select a dog that's right for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on mutts!","review":"This is the best book on mutts out there. For the first time, adoption, behavioral, health, and training is all in one place for mixed breed owners. Ms. Bonham offers a no-nonsense guide in determining what breeds might make up your pet.

Only 31 pages in the book discuss how to judge what personality traits the dog may have based on it's appearance. I also wanted information on how to judge how big that puppy will get and this book didn't cover that. Probably because that's a tough job, which is why I was looking for help. This book provided little useful information on choosing your mutt. It left me thinking that maybe we'll have to go with a purebreed after all.On a positive note, if you don't know how to take care of a dog, this book is full of information on basic dog care."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really a charming book!","review":"\\"Sigmond\\" is chock full of allusions to familiar fantasy elements, yet tumbled into an exciting new blend.

Set in South Africa during the days of apartheid, it's a gripping tale of a boy's journey to manhood.

Ibhubesi is a tale of an adolescent diplomat's son, John, on the verge of manhood in South Africa while it is under apartheid rule. John learns about the evils of apartheid through the eyes of an educated servant and then through some shocking events he himself witnesses. This book is an exciting read and a wonderful social consciousness raiser. It is perfect for kids in middle school and above, and is really a must-read for adults as well.

These stories varied a lot from one another and they were very ethnically diversed. These stories dealt with topics such as divorce, abandonment, forgiveness, estrangement, and basically just relationships between family members. Some stories were sad while some were uplifting.I truly enjoyed this book as the author's writing was clear, precise, and very conversational. Even though I am not a fan compilation of short stories, I truly appreciate the effort by the author and his staff to put together this collection. As the stories were so diversed, most readers could more or less relate to them or at the very least some parts of them. This is a very lengthy book but it is definitely one that is worth going through. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Stories About Real People Experiencing Real Things","review":"Provocative, compelling, enlightening stories of human beings grappling with what they want--and don't--from their families beyond shared genes, history and memories.

The real disappointment was the author's poor writing and lack of any thoughtful insights or understanding. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claptrap","review":"The stories in this book are pure claptrap. If you don't already know your family and know how to love them - without Bronson's guidance - some inspirational drivel is hardly going to change your life, though you may be reduced to tears because your own dysfunctional family just doesn't measure up.This former fiction author has only been a husband and father for several years yet has the pompous audacity to promise to show his readers how to love with the book's stories. I expect my teachers to carry some credentials.Loving is not a learned technique picked up by reading \\"Woman's Day\\" quality stories. Loving is learned through *personal* experience.This is just another example of a world gone voyeuristic. Thanks for some more *reality*.

My guess is loving family members and friends of his - because this is just huggy-lovey-touchy-feely sugar-coated hop up the kids on Froot Loops garbage.I DO NOT recommend it unless you are not getting enough SUGAR in your diet or if you are really interested in seeing a cutting-edge author turn into Captain Kangaroo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful biographical vignettes","review":"Po Bronson's WHY DO I LOVE THESE PEOPLE?, is exactly what the subtitle says...honest & amazing stories of real families.

We are an era where so much emphasis is placed on negativity and opposing forces (i.e., countries at war, partisan politics, corporate greed, etc.) and it is assuring to know that the family unit, however it may be defined, is thriving. One of the differences between Po and other authors is that he CONNECTS with his subjects and shares their pain and triumphs as he learns about their individual situations. He is an author in the truest sense. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become or remain a positive thinker, which is an essential factor in surviving in the world today.

Many evenings, after a grueling day in the office, John L. Stephens transported me to another place and time with his excellent gift for writing, eye for detail and sense of humor that frequently had me waking my poor spouse with irrepressible laughter.

With a range of spells the molded the landscape, and relativly little control over your people. How wrong I was.The game took advantage of the booming RTS trend. All the spells you can cast are now only usable through a unit in the game that is called a shaman. And your following are no more then pesants. If they need a house, you have to tell them to build one. Otherwise they stand around waiting. If you need a warrior, tell them to build a barracks, then order a couple pesants to train. All in all, the game amounts to an RTS with ONE military unit and then some guy who can cast spells. Imagine Warcraft with only footman, and you have Populous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This was one of the worst games that I've ever played. The graphics were alright, but the game itself was bad. I mostly play games where you conquer,rule and build cites. Populous did let you build things - the options were very limited. The pleges weren't anything to get excited about either. Say for instance you were to do the plege with all the lochus-it looked so fake, it was as if a small tiny cloud was flying by. The tribe people practicly don't do anything. When you did let your people attack another tribe, there hardly was any action. When I bought this game, I expected it to be really good. Once I actually played it I wanted to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever played this game?","review":"Well, don't! I can't tell you just how horrible it is. First of all, you are not an all powerful entity. The graphics are slick, but sometimes choppy. Things that die also have the tendency of blocking the screen. The spells you can cast ... . You must \\"worship\\" totem poles to gain these spells. They take forever to get and are extremely limited in range or power. There are few things interesting. There are only five units is this game, and most of them are illogical. Take my word.

It's one of those \\"what time is it\\" games that keeps you up until 3:30 in the morning. I really like the feel of the planets you work on. It's actually a small globe with horizons that curve. The twist, scroll, and zoom control kinda reminds me of Dungeon Keeper (that's a good thing). It feels like the landscape is a piece of paper you can twist or rotate to any angle you want. I only have one problem. I get my characters confused with the opposing guys quite often. This is due to the fact that your people are colored blue and cyan, and the enemies are cyan and light yellow, making it quite difficult to control dozens of little cyanish blobs during battle. But other than that, It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Populous: the Beginning","review":"This is one of my all time favorite games! Fast paced and crazy, yet very simple to learn.

It sporadically would \\"freeze up\\" and not do it's job, not even responding to the physical button press-much less the autoclose function it is designed for. There was no way to tell when it was on the fritz, negating the peace of mind I purchased it for.Response from Skylink was equally disappointing. After an initially encouraging contact that promised a replacement if I first tried reprogram the sensor, further communication was met with canned email responses that did not answer my questions.It should also be noted that this system is wireless, so there is an ugly wire antenna that protrudes from the button unit (not shown in the picture!) and the sensor unit is BATTERY powered, another point of failure. Don't bother with Skylink or the GT-100, I wish that I had not."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"It really is super easy to install and works great.There are only two wires going to your current wall mounted switch, take the old switch off, connect the two wires to the new switch, and screw the \\"sensor\\" (which is mechanical and works well) to your garage door, done!Your remotes don't need to be reprogrammed.The only difference (other than the fact that you don't have to worry about forgetting to close your door anymore) is that now you have to hit the close button on the wall mounted switch twice to shut the door manually (since the first push of the button turns the timer off (for when you DO want the door to stay open))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as advertised","review":"After mounting both pieces, one on the door, the other on wall, I attempted to program the unit with the three position switch.

I simply spent their allowance on this handy little device, set the timer for 5 minutes and now I don't have to worry about my tools being left in an open garage all day.The installation was as simple as could be, you just need a drill and a screw driver. Drill the holes in the door frame and screw the sensor onto the door, drill the holes in the wall, wire the button and screw the button onto the wall. Set the switch to the time you would like your garage to stay open and presto, my tools are safe again.

The installation wasn't bad, except for the flimsy design of the wire set screws, they wouldn't tighten sufficiently to hold the wires securely.But the biggest problem was that the single-wide door would open by itself. Now the purpose of these systems is security, and this one does just the opposite. I finally tossed this GT-100A unit and went back to the old button. Then about a month ago, when I was getting ready to leave for work, the double-wide door opened by itself; this was a first. I left a message at a neighbor's house to watch the door for me (they work from home often) I was so paranoid.So now I'm shopping around for another system.

Not only that, but Ken Burns seems to want to prove that the congress is more insignificant than we think. He talks at length about Everett Dirksen, who was a senator, and spends four minutes on each decade, and RARELY goes into specific congressman.

Odd that the pens open and close backwards, but last a long time and hold enough water for hours of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good purchase","review":"These extra pens and stampers are a great addition to the Aqua Doodle. I was surprised to see that the Aqua Doodle only came with one pen, and with friends or siblings that just isn't enough. So with the additional pens, and also the stamps, this is a toy that can be enjoyed by more than one person at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand it when companies do this","review":"This product is unjustifiably overpriced.

I had the dealer install both when I got my oil changed so can't speak of installing myself but probably wouldn't be too difficult if you're mechanically inclined at all. The quality is high, the warranty is unbeatable, and it does what it says. I'm convinced and wouldn't buy anything else if given the choice. The price is hard to beat on Amazon as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Software; good booklet","review":"I received the Wine Cellar System as a Christmas present. It consists of a very limited \\"database\\" for keeping track of wines, a folder with some fancy parchment paper, and a booklet on wine cellaring. The booklet is very interesting but should cost about $10. This is most lame program I have ever seen and the publishers should be ashamed to offer something like this. It has no preloaded content and is nothing more than could be easily created in Excel or Access. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software is awful","review":"I agree with the earlier reviewer. I was shocked at how simple the software is. The entry page for each wine is fairly comprehensive, but if you want to print a full list of wines, the program sets about half a dozen fields set fields which cannot be customized. Whether you want those fields or not, that's what you are stuck with. Also annoying, the software does not allow you to \\"minimize\\" the program. You have to \\"quit\\" the program to look at something else on your computer. This makes it impossible to easily reference other electronic materials (like the Wine Spectator's web site) or cut and paste from different source while inputting data into the wine software. It's like they never bothered to update software that was developed 10 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because there is no ZERO star rating","review":"This product is so bad it should be removed from Amazon's inventory.

He took one look at the AQ3 and said it wasn't appropriate. For one thing, Bosch mandates that the exhaust be constructed of 4\\" stainless steel. This equipment is 3\\" and the main exhaust vent pipe is aluminum. In some climates, the fumes react with moisture in the air and form acid (think acid rain). The acid and water accumulate in this corrugated pipe and drip back into the unit.

One makes reference to Haydn's Surprise,and the same comparison popped into my mind while listening. Kancheli has many more \\"surprises, though, and they are not meant to be funny. Instead, they are jarring, but I like the effect. The other notable part of the work is the countertenor, singing something to the effect of \\"aaaaaah, aaaaaah, aaah.\\" This may not be my favorite modern symphony, but it is an interesting enough work. But be careful about turning up your stereo during the quiet moments.I prefer Part's choral music, but I like the symphony and Fratres, two somewhat similar orchestral pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest albums ever produced - from all genres","review":"Highly ranks among my top ten list for great albums. Trent Reznor puts together a real work of art. In a time when bubble gum, teeny bopper pop music has made an dreadfully unfortunate comeback, this debut album by NIN becomes even more necessary for the listening public, who search for a sound that is both risque, and provacotive.What's really admirable about Reznor's effort on the album is that this still remains a rock album, despite its techno edge. There's distinctive riffs that can be found, and the album nevers loses a rock feel. For those who wish to find a happy medium between hard rock and industrial, this album is simply it. Reznor should be commended for his efforts to keep music great for those of us who just can't listen to the radio for too long. BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"A must for any NIN fan. Not quite as dark as many of Trent Reznor's other albums, it's staccato beats, frenzied synthesizers, and deep lyrics are still blissfully depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen before you buy!","review":"I bought this album because it was supposed to be a classic within the industrial genre. I was really disapointed, to me it sounds like dated synth-pop, typical for the 80-ish, with only a couple of decent songs ('Kinda I want to' is one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sick old school","review":"This is a classic cd if you are at all i nin fan you need this disc like a fat kid needs cake. I mean come on Ringfinger, Head like a hole this is Trent pouring his soul for the first time the lyrics alone on this disk speak volumes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative To Say The Least","review":"Picture yourself back in 1989. You are in a music store thumbing through the \\"N's\\" you come across this particular CD and think to yourself, \\"Who are these guys?, Nine Inch What?, Pretty Hate What? I don't think so..NEXT!!\\". You probably weren't alone. It amazes me that this album is this old. If you put it into context with other releases from artists of the era will you realize that this album was released before \\"Violator\\" - Depeche Mode, just four months after \\"Disinigration\\" - Cure. It's really a tribute to how innovative this album is musically. This is truly a must have for music fans everywhere. I mean, how can you not own this album? The keyboards riffs are just great as for the synthesizers. This is my favorite NIN album. I think that's a consensus with many of the other reviewers. If you only buy one NIN make it this one. It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The All-Purpose NIN","review":"I find this the most \\"all-purpose\\" Nine Inch Nails album. Others tend to be rather mood oriented: broken when you're angry, the downward spiral when you're feeling cynical, the fragile when you're in the mood for something completely different.Listening to the lyrics of these songs, I would believe Trent had just gone through a bad break-up, esp. on the song \\"something I can never have\\". While this album may be depressing, I find it to have very good music and be a great addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best.","review":"This record has more depth and raw emotion than 90% of the rest of whats out there even after 11 years. I'd recommend it to an one who's fed up with the current music scene. It' still my all time fav NIN record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. B gives it the thumbs up","review":"This is some pretty great tuneage. Every track makes a good listen, although 'Sanctified' is a little slow and the last 3 aren't particularly memorable. Overall, the effect isn't as strong as The Fragile or The Downward Spiral, but NIN's worst is still a hell of a lot better than 90% of other bands' best. As far as overall sound is concerned, its a little too derivative of Ministry but its equally dangerous, compelling and listenable, no easy task by any means. Rock and roll needs more Ministrys and Nine Inch Nails, bands who aren't afraid to take major risks and speak about controversial issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Nine\\" on the ten scale.","review":"This is the new album from Nine Inch Nails. Just Kidding. \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" was originally released in 1989, and did for industrial music what \\"Nevermind\\" did for grunge. Much of the success of this debut came because of the time of release (the beginning of the alt-revolution), as well as it's appeal to metal-heads, goths, punks, and alternative types in general. If the masses couldn't handle Skinny Puppy, they could handle NIN. Many would call this industrial-pop, but regardless of how you classify it, it's extremely good. \\"Head Like A Hole\\" is still one of their best songs, and my favorite \\"Down In It\\" and \\"Sin\\" were also popular singles. However, some of the other tracks are what really make this disc, underrated cuts like \\"The Only Time\\", \\"Ringfinger\\", and the moody \\"Something I Can Never Have\\". Overall, I do believe that 1994's \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is the one essential NIN album, but saying that \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" is no good is simply a \\"Terrible Lie\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking for its time","review":"This was probably THE most influential album in 1989. It started a huge wave of heavy industrial music that resonated throughout the 90's. The electric sound is similar to Depeche Mode, but the lyrics and subject matter are definelty darker in tone. Much like Mode's Ultra album. Definitely worth buying and listening to over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one kicked it off","review":"This is techno after a long line of coke. The first song, Head Like a Hole, is probably my favorite song NIN ever did. Terrible Lie is probably my 2nd choice of this album (a distant 2nd.) This album is good, but kind of soft. It one of those albums that if your in the mood for it, you think it is the best album ever, but if your not, it will get on your nerves. Honestly, the album is worth buying just for Head Like a Hole. This album blends together with their album Broken to give us The Downward Spiral, which is, in my opinion, by far their best overall album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Else Do You Expect?????Part 1","review":"First off I do not want to write like 100 pages of why NIN(Trent Reznor)is a Genius, because I can, but a quick review on this album that I urge everybody who has given this album negative reviews to LISTEN TO IT AGAIN. I've been a NIN fan since the beginning and each album is different and unique in it's own way. There is no possible way that I can put one album above another because they are ALL MASTERPEICES, and Pretty Hate Machine is no exception. If you don't like it at first just listen to it again with an open mind and I think that you will be able to at least give Reznor some credit. I'm all about people having their OWN opinions but at least give things a REAL try. I can truly say that this is as good as anything he has ever done. So If you don't like it, that is fine, and if you do like it then all the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"nine inch nails,nine inch nails","review":"i love nine inch nails. there the best band out there right now. any nine inch nails cd is worth buying. but i recomend this one for the first time listener because it will prepare you for the world of Trent Reznors awsome band that is Nine Inch Nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!! THE 2010 REMASTER IS WHAT YOU WANT.","review":"Anyone looking to pick up NIN's debut LP, Pretty Hate Machine, needs to steer clear of this fraud. Universal is trying to capitalize on Trent Reznor's recent success--namely an Oscar-winning movie score (The Social Network), as well as his scoring work on the upcoming American versions of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. No remastering has been done on this album. Do not be fooled by this. Trent himself has warned his fans publicly to avoid this release. Buy the original or buy the 2010 remaster, but not this one.

Those aren't qualities that mean much to narrow-minded fans of speed-metal, industrial, thrash or whatever else the flavor of the week is (all of whom will no doubt dis this review), but they are qualities associated with great art. This is great art. Trent Reznor's first and still best (Downward Spiral is the other must-have), whose career trajectory went on its own downward spiral with the unfocused and disappointing Fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly what you think","review":"If you like techno, you'll love this. PHM is one of NINs greatest albums which walks out of the mainstream and really gets into your brain. From the catchy \\"down in it\\" to the pounding intro beats of \\"thats what i get\\",to the electro shock industro of \\"ringfinger\\", PHM gives people new to NIN a slice of the pie. Not exactly alternative, not exactly heavy metal, but pure industrial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate attempt for the record company to squeeze whatever they can","review":"From Trent Reznor's word himself:\\"I wouldn't buy this one.

The music has not been remastered and you will be purchasing something you already own.Trent Reznor has asked NIN fans to avoid this release. In late 2010 Trent collaborated with UMe to release a remastered version of Pretty Hate Machine - you can easily find that release here on Amazon.Pretty Hate Machine: 2010 Remaster"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY 2010'S REISSUE/REMASTER INSTEAD!!","review":"Trent Reznor remastered and reissued his debut album \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" last year, now for some strange reason it's been reissued again. NOT by Trent Reznor who has no say in this!! He has even publicly stated his disapproval of this reissue.That's all this is it's just a reissue, it hasn't been remastered so it still sounds like it's 1989 original, the artwork is more or less the same, 2010's reissue had complete new artwork done by Rob Sheridan and came in a fold out digi pack as opposed to the original jewel case. Nor does this version have the bonus track that was included in 2010's reissue which is a cover of Queen's \\"Get Down Make Love\\".So while the songs are great and the album itself is brilliant and an important part of Nine Inch Nails history, this is not the version to be buying. This is the link to last years remastered versionPretty Hate Machine: 2010 Remaster"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Classic","review":"This is my all time favorite CD. I'd never heard of Nine Inch Nails until I bought this CD by accident. I'm not a big fan of techno rock or punk music but this is different. At the time I first heard this CD I was going through a bad relationship. I must have listened to \\"Something I can never have\\" a million times. What an awesome song. I can lay back, close my eyes and get lost in the slow, dark melody. Trent must have been in bad relationship when he wrote the lyrics to this CD. \\"Sanctified, Kinda I want to, That's what I get and The only time,\\" are all songs about a guy who's painfully in love but about to get hurt or dumped. This is one of those CD's that you can listen to the whole way through and not find one bad song. A must have for anyone that has ever had their heart broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD","review":"This is the best NIN album and probably one of the best albums of all time.

Just great, get this album if you don't already have it!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music wrapped around an enigma.","review":"I found this CD to be one of the most amazing I have ever heard. Not only is the music rivetting, but the lyrics have depth to them as well. Other music I have listened to (Marilyn Manson, KMFDM etc.) had wonderful sounds, but the lyrics meant nothing to me. With Trent Reznor, you can share in his grief and tourment, putting it into perspective witht the world around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cds that I have ever heard","review":"This album is definately worth buying. I have all of the 12 nine inch nails' halo cds and videos, and this album is one of the most emotional albums Trent Reznor has written. If you are a /\\\\/I\\\\/\\\\ fan then your life depends on getting this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, though somewhat angsty","review":"Things that make this album great.-Pulling industrial into the mainstream.-When you look at KMFDM and other industrial bands releases at this point, their technology is clearly dated. Reznor however makes something that would sound practically the same today.-Though he ripped off much of Skinny Puppy's ideas, he improves on them by adding a more musical side.It's only real weakness is that the lyrics are embarassingly angsty(compared to The Downward Spiral where its more angry than anything else), but otherwise this is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"good start","review":"This is the cd that started A great bands career.Kinda short for nine inch nails(only ten songs)some of the songs are kinda cheesy you can really see how the band has evolved.Best songs are head like a hole,terrible lie,down in it,sin and that's what I get."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is breakthrough?!","review":"You know, there are alot of NIN singles I really like. And when I read some of the reviews for this album, I thought \\"Wow, this'll be great.\\" So I went out and bought it, listened to it, and stopped it after \\"Sin\\". Besides the opening track and maybe \\"Sin\\", the rest of the songs really aren't that great. The beat in \\"Terrible Lie\\" reminds me of \\"Closer\\", however the actual song is alot worse. \\"Down With It\\" would be decent, but Trent had to ruin it by trying to rap, which really kills the song IMO. Anything after that really didn't catch my attention. Almost fell asleep during \\"Sanctified\\" and \\"Something I Can Never Have\\" so honestly, I can't really see where this is some breakthrough CD, nor can I see where I could even call it good. Maybe it gets better after \\"Sin\\" but my thoughts are if five out of the opening seven songs aren't that great, it won't matter how good the remaining three songs are. It won't make the CD worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"March of the Capitalist Pig","review":"Agnst? Try Nirvana, the The, The Cure, Frontline Assembly. You won't find it here. Anger? Certainly not existential anger; more like a tantrum to get attention (and $$$). The lyrics are silly and manipulative.NIN, along with bands like Bush, is the Spice Girls of what used to be \\"alternative\\" music. Inoffensive as background music, not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIN and Skinny Puppy?","review":"NIN did tour with Skinny Puppy efore PHM was released, but it didn't work out and Skinny Puppy is listed as one of NIN's influences in the allmusic guide. As for PHM itself, I really don't care much for this album. The lyrics get annoying after a few listens(\\"head like a hole, black as your soul, blah, blah\\") and it seems a bit dated IMO compared to other albums released at the time, like Ministry's Land of Rape and Honey and Skinny Puppy's Too Dark Park. I don't even consider it \\"industrial\\", more like abrasive synthpop. I suppose NIN fans will love it, but I've moved on to other \\"industrial\\" bands, Front Line Assembly , Pig, and Wumpscut."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hate Machine","review":"You cant call yourself a Nine Inch Nails fan if you don't own this album. Everyone should have this CD. Trent's (warped) genius is unparalled, compared to a lot of the stuff that's out there today, and this album shows it. With catchy tunes like Head Like A Hole, Down In It, Terrible Lie, Sin, Sanctified, and so on, you'll definately want to listen to this CD over and over again. It's really hard to describe how great this album is. The one interesting thing I noticed about this album is it doesnt have a title track associated with it (eg, The Fragile has a song called \\"The Fragile\\", etc.). Not only is this my favorite NIN album, but it's one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of The Best","review":"I have been a huge fan of NIN for quite some time. The CD is simply unparalleled by not only NIN's other works, but by the entire Industrial scene. Every song on this CD is simply mind-boggling. The truly great thing about this album is the simple fact that it does not only appeal to industrial fans, but nearly every music-lover out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction","review":"Nine Inch Nails' \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" is by far my least favorite of all their (his) releases. And yet I still gave it five stars because it is original and it's what got NIN into my earphones. But part of the reason that this album is last in my list of must-have Reznor collections is that I don't think Trent really had his heart in this release. The songs are fairly simple, and there isn't much variation between them. The lyrics are anxious and simmering but don't display the near-brilliance of his other efforts. I think part of the problem was that NIN was trying to get a fanbase going and get their stuff out there instead of really creating work that was personal and self-gratifying. I would recommend buying this if you are already a Nine Inch Nails fan, but if you are a newcomer to and want to know what NIN is really about, try the \\"Downward Spiral\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"This is my favorite cd of nin, my favorite song is head like a hole.

However, if you have only heard stuff off of The Downward Spiral, Broken or The Fragile, you might want to concider listening to the CD first before buying it, cause no NIN album is alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"This rocks","review":"This CD is really cool. I strongly suggest you get it, as it is one of the best Nine Inch Nails albums. This band is unique, and there's really nothing to compare it to.

Of Reznor's three albums this is my very favorite. Definetly worth 6 stars! An Album is like a puzzle. It can be put together right and make something beautiful that you can be proud of, or it can be put together to make the ugliest worst looking thing ever seen.

I know its only 10 tracks, but 10 very well put together tracks. I love all Trent Reznors music from the David Bowie stuff he did to the 8 minute remixes of Wish.

Great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly boy-band-ish.","review":"I had a sabbatical from NIN since 95 or so, and only recently went back and gave everything of Trent's a fresh listen. It's amazing what the years can do; \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" sounds not so far removed from the minor-key boy band stuff. Very, very weak, poor lyrics and most of the production is farmed out to old studio pros instead of Reznor going at it himself like he does these days. Only tracks for me are \\"Head Like a Hole\\" and \\"Down in It,\\" both muscular examples of tech-rock. Out of all NIN I personally recommend \\"Broken\\"-- concise and to the point, never wears out its welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"this isnt industrial and this isnt pop or anything like pop","review":"who in ...SATANS right mind would call this either industrial or POP...whomever mixed those together or even tried to define NIN as pop or industrial IS A FLAMING IDIOT....PHM lots of emotion...nto the greatest playing..but you have to give trent credit on what he did with what he had...'nuff said"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Reasons TO BUY This Version","review":"If you are an avid Nails collector like myself, this is another great addition to have. This is not a money grabber or a pointless release. All albums go into print circulation and usually every 5-10 years will be reissued ( not necessarily remastered ) sometimes without you even knowing it. If you own the 2010 remastered version, but want a copy of the original album in all it's glory, this is the best value through Amazon! I enjoy having Nine Inch Nails variants and this one is dated 1989, 2011. Missing are the following labels, TVT, TVT-NOTHING, TVT-Interscope ; and have been replaced with UMe, like seen on the 2010 version. 'Pretty Hate Machine' is a classic and should be enjoyed through appreciation for the original and remaster. This is the first reissue since 2005, in which the disc itself is pressed in color, simply Amazing !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dare","review":"Yes, this album is classic and we owe Trent a lot for being a genuinely talented musician, but more so for being poppy enough to generate interest in other industrial acts.The 4 good songs on here are good for the mix.But I dare anyone (who isn't a hot as Trent) to get up and read these lyrics in a coffee shop.I just DARE you.See if the most pathetic loser in earshot doesn't laugh you off the stage.He gets better from here, but who knows if it was the practice or the Diva-Withdrawal that helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the remaster","review":"I bought the remaster when it came out, and this original version is by far the better one. The remaster removed all of the dynamics of the original. Listen to HLH on the original as the second chorus hits. It hits hard, as it should. Listen to the remaster. The volume almost sounds like it decreases because it's been compressed to death. The remaster is Trent Reznor trying to double-dip on the album, and not even improving it. I think it's excellent that you still have the option to purchase the original in all its glory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Unsupported Cash-in","review":"This release of Pretty Hate Machine is just a cash-in on the part of the record labels without any involvement of Trent Reznor himself.

Every song on it, especially \\"Head Like a Hole,\\" \\"Kinda I Want To,\\" and \\"Ringfinger,\\" is catchy, rocking, and energetic. (Don't be surprised if you find yourself hitting the replay button a few times per song.)I have had this album for many years now and still pull it out and listen with the fervor I had when I first got it. It's definitely a classic for the band, for its genre, and for its time (and ahead of its time in some ways, too, when you think about it). This is also sort of NIN lighthearted -- a little more accessible, a little less heavy than \\"Broken\\" (an EP), \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" or \\"The Fragile\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Awesome After Many Years","review":"Pretty Hate Machine was a breakthrough CD that helped open the door for a new generation of industrial type rock. Trent Reznor is an absolutely amazing musician, his style is so varied and has evolved over the years with NIN's many CD's. Head Like a Hole, what can I say, is a great song, one of the best on the CD. Down In It is a somewhat different style, more spoken than sung, but definitely not rapped. He makes great use of synthesizers in some of the songs which adds some interesting aspects to the music. On the whole, this CD is more melodic and less heavy that some of NIN's more current works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son.

Well, guess what? This album has got to be one of the catchiest ever put out. From the hard, driving force behind Head Like a Hole, to the beautiful yet very dark Something I Can Never Have, this album rocks from start to finish. It defines the seething harshness of what everyone has come to call industrial, but it goes beyond just the sounds that Reznor compiled for his first release. The lyrics speak powerfully about all the issues everyone has dealt with. Reznor just puts them out on the table in an in-your-face-and-if-you-don't-like-it-screw-you type of way. Not connecting with what Reznor is saying in this album, or any other of his albums, is only defining oneself as inhuman and heartless. Like it or not, Nails are here to stay, and Reznor's debut album is a must for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballew Saw Review","review":"My second order with Ballew. Very fast shipping.

With so many styles of music on all of their albums, it's easy to see why fans enjoy their music.Any fan of rock/electronic/psychadelic music will be able to find something to enjoy on any of Death In Vegas's albums.If you enjoy music that you can just chill and relax to, these albums are for you, in particular Dead Elvis.

I've listened to it over and over and it seems to me that Death In Vegas are having a lack of ideas. The songs are way too long and this results in boredom. Iggy Pop's voice on Aisha is terrific, but even Aisha gets boring after a few minutes. They've put a lot of noise in this record, but I'm afraid it is just to hide the weak spots.

While it isn't so noticeable during the music, it really wasn't necessary.You get the well known Wolfpack and Buff Bagwell themes as well as a great remix of the current nWo theme with all the nWo quotes and all. nWo Flash is actually the song used by the Jung Dragons during the last year of Ted Turner's WCW.

It came on a few floppy disks and had no facy 3D graphics and a dire AI, however, it was one of the most playable games I've ever played.When I bought Fleet Command my lowest expectation was they had just copied Harpoon. On playing the game I realised to my horror they had kept all the bad bits (rubbish AI) and removed all the handy GUI dialog boxs, amazing database, formation editor, huge campains, groups of planes, etc.I assume if I played this game some more it would grow on me, but I can't but help get frustrated when I compare it with a game from 6 years ago! (and fancy 3d graphics count for anything)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleet Command is strategy game lacking strategy.","review":"Fleet Command was built on the concept of naval warfare strategy much like the classic game Harpoon. Similarly to Harpoon, it is a real time strategy game that provides top down control of every unit in a fleet action. Unfortunately, it has two fatal flaws. Firstly, the time compression only speeds up to 1 real second = 5 game seconds. This means that the missions start out with the antagonists at close range so there is no maneuvering. Without that maneuvering, there is little strategy involved in pummeling the opponent. Secondly, there is no way to generate groups to control items working in a coordinated fashion. So if you launch 20 planes on a strike mission, there are 20 planes cluttering the map. After playing this game, I decided I'd rather play the almost 10 year old Harpoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"My extremly critical review of Janes Fleet Command.","review":"This an extremly boring game.

This game takes a long time to play but it's an excellent time killer. You have to command Battle ships and even carriers and their aircraft. From the battle ships you can shoot anything from guns to Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. On the carrier you can control the aircraft and helicopters and you can even put aircraft on alert 5 which is on the catapult so if any goes wrong you can launch them right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harpoonage Review","review":"Well to be Frank, if your looking for a True full scale modern naval simulation dont stare to hard at Janes Fleet Command. At first Glance the harpoons flying off destroyers in a climatic scene looks very similar to CNN without a doubt. Shortly after playing i relized it was seemed to be more of an acion game than that of a simulation. As many others have said you are thrown into the battles which takes alot of planning and strategy away. Were is naval Combat without the strategy? The graphics are beautiful as a harpoon fan i always wondered what it would look like to watch my cruiser fire 8 harpoons in rapid sucession. Well now ive seen it. Great graphics, no strategy really the strategy is kinda forced on ya its either this way or take a few hits. Data is ok but nothing compared to the ship databases in harpoon of 10 years ago.

If you are looking for a very good Naval Combat Simulator, look no further. Very impressive 3-D graphics. For example, you can rotate your 3-D screen below the water and view the ship's propellers...just spinning away! On the slightly negitive side, I did have some installation problems, which were fixed by a patch on the Jane's website. Once the patch was installed, the game does work well with Window's 98. I have not had a crash during a game yet (have had it for a couple of months). It does tax my poor old Pentium II 266 in some of the larger missions. All I can say is... it beats the heck out of Harpoon.Leigh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, It's pretty good","review":"Having owned several Jane's games. I know that some of them can be pretty overwhelming. Fleet Command is one of the better games that has come from the Jane's series. One, is that there is no big book to read.

I have to agree with Mr. Mathews in regards to the time compression problem. It is a little frustrating to be thrown into a conflict when the operation first loads. Before you have a chance to view the scene, your are under attack. Modern fleets cannot be that surprised with the advanced monitoring systems on board. It would be nice if you were able to sail in to an area before action begins and set up a strategy.

Finally found a tiny reset button under the front cover (which is anything but easy to access). Had to constantly reset the unit to keep it going. Called tech support with Bosch.

Just as I always have, I highly recommend you read Chabon's work.~Scott William Foley, author of The Imagination's Provocation: Volume I: A Collection of Short Stories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters...not too happy","review":"I must say, I'm a huge Michael Chabon fan. His books are always filled with dynamic characters in fascinating situations, and A Model World is no different. But where some of his books have a more airy feel, the stories in this collection are dark. the underlying theme to almost every story in this colelction is family breakdown. the worlds in Chabon's book are certainly not the model that anyone would like to follow.That being said, the writing is as strong as ever and the stories are engaging. From the dark, satirical humour of the first story, to the tense nail-chewing fear in the last, Chabon takes us on a ride.Chabon is a writer who, in a rare case, is actually living up to his hype. Read A Model World; it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"the best book I've ever read\\"","review":"A voracious reader, I came across Ishiguro only when I read that Saul Bellow was reading this book at the time of an interview. Truly, this is the best novel I've ever read, and I've read plenty! As a practitioner of psychotherapy, I see this text as the best reification of self-deception I've ever encountered; truly prescient in its grasp of the vague layers of life which the novelist can show us. Often, we're best observed (at times) by outsiders to the world we've created phenomenologically.

I found the characters unbelievable and their behaviour utterly inconsistent.However, let us give Bronte her due: the book is marvellously structured, with the story told by Nelly Dean contained in the story told by the narrator. Moreover, through the character of down-to-Earth, jolly Nelly Dean, Bronte makes plausible a story that would never be believed otherwise.It's a pity she had to waste her talent as a writer on a such a pointless story, centered on an incoherent, cruel, mean character like Heathcliff.

First of all it was hard to keep up with because the author jumped around to many differnet characters. Secondly, the old English used was hard to understand and having to jump back and forth to the foot notes made you lose your train of thought. It also wasn't the type of story I though it would be. I had heard it was a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine but I didn't feel the love. If you like stories with old English then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring","review":"I had to read this book for a research paper.

The prose is overwrought and the characters . . . for the life of me I am unable to explain other readers' adoration of either Heathcliff or Cathy.

It's far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Soap Opera","review":"If one did not know it was the famed \\"Wuthering Heights\\"- and read this book, I'm sure he would have thought it was a script for morning soap opera. Not only the story is highly unbelievable, it's way to melodramatic and disturbing. It's a good writing on Bronte's part but it is not a good story.

It's told in the first person by different narrators but as I was bored and so unfocused a lot of the time I was sometimes not sure who was narrating.

I didn't like the use of dialect either- It's a lot easier to read English as it should be written and imagine an accent to it rather than see these strange alien words in print.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels.

I was sorely disappointed. True, the violent love between Heathcliff and Catherine is heartwrenching; however, the most difficult part of this novel for me was that there was no character that was lovable, or sympathetic. Just when I started to think that Heathcliff was not so bad after all, he would commit another shocking deed of horrific cruelty. Catherine was just annoying. I also found the plot hard to follow, what with a third person telling the story, and then swinging back to first person narrative.

The overly dramatic love scenes and long drawn out sections provide the periods of ennui. The characters are poorly developed, and the lack of minor characters leaves the reader wandering. The novel seems to start off sluggishly, and then it picks up, only to be followed by the slowness again. If anything, Wuthering Heights shows the destructiveness of love and revenge through the character Heathcliff. The novel seemed to be one long drawn out soap opera, where the characters rarely changed and new characters were rarely added. Overall, this novel does not meet the adoration that it is constantly given."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Out Herods Herod!","review":"And just why would Ms. Bronte write a book with not a single likeable character? In fact, everyone in the novel would be rejected by Jerry Springer as being too degenerate for his show. No doubt the writing is facile enough, but by page 5, the story itself descends into what has to be the most turgid potboiler imagineable. It's all there: lynching a litter of puppies,hanging a springer spaniel,unceasing child abuse, the brutalization of women, and pretty descriptions of the seasons. Highly recommended for the budding mass murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad Bronte died before she could write any more trash!","review":"What a waste of time, precious time in my life that I will never be able to get back.

Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Heavy","review":"I know this is a classic loved by many.

But I remember being let down by this book and the finishing with a sense of apathy towards the characters. Many people relate the theme and character interaciton in this book to the modern day soap opera, daytime talkshows or MTV reality shows and thus deaming the book to have some sort of everlasting social message. The problem is that for the most part all those things stink and always have so what are these comparisons saying about this book. Maybe there is a reason why everyone read's this in high school....becuase it is the only age that can appreciate it.Clearly Im not in the norm as most people disagree with me but if you are looking to get into a \\"classic\\" there are much better books you can turn to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Did I Read This?","review":"I am absolutly stunned. Why do I like this book so much? How did I manage to finish it? I am a 21 year old man living in a modern city and I somehow related to this book. I have nothing in common with the characters or the author or the story or the setting. I had to read this book for college but dropped out before reading it. Several months later I picked it up and gave it a try. I'm not sorry I did. Thinking about it now I start to realize what is so good about the book: it's author's compassion for humanity. All characters in this novel suffer a great deal (partly because of their own stubbornness) but retain their essential humanity: they still need to be loved. And while reading it you can feel the author's longing to be loved herself. So this is what made me read through the book: it speaks directly to your heart in a way you can not ignore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"I read this novel when I was a junior in high school, and I really did not enjoy it. I was an avid Jane Austen fan and usually read the sweet, courtship novels. Now, as a college graduate, I decided to re-read this classic to see if I might enjoy it more now that I am older. I must say that I was really taken by the spectacular writing, and the poignant view of human nature at its worst. Although Heathcliff and Cathy's romance is disfunctional at times, the extreme hold that they have on one another (even after death) is compelling. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to all of you who have a dusty copy sitting on your bookshelf. If you haven't read this novel since high school, my advice is to read it again, and see if it has some new meaning for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For those in high school out there, this book is NOT BAD and NOT BORING.

All of those people who claim it to be bad either are completely ignorant or uneducated (this is verified by their spelling and grammar in their reviews). If you have a choice to read this book or something else, read Wuthering Heights, because it will honestly change your outlook on so many things.

Therefore, I was unsurprised when I read it and discovered that it was THAT twisted. However, it was also gripping and very interesting. You do not expect a woman in the 1800s to write a book with such romantic passion - because that is where the darkness comes from, the passion that two of the characters have for each other.I really enjoyed this book, though I must admit I was feeling a bit down after I read it. This book will definitely have you re-think Romance. Do you really want that all-consuming love? A love that causes anger, hatred, even death?If you are a fun of romance and old-century books, do not hesitate to pick this book up.

So one day I pick this up, and start reading. At first, it's pretty hard, but then you start to get along with the writing style. This took me a LONG time to read, but it was definately WELL-WORTH it! It's hard to explain what it was about, but I'll help you best I can. So there's this guy(Mr. Lockwood) and he is the current tennant of Thrushcross Grange. Through the whole story, a servant named Ellen(Nelly) Dean is telling him the history of the people who lived there, and in Wuthering Heights. I'd say that the story is mostly how Heathcliff ruined the lives of the Earnshaw and Linton families, but that is just my point. The story basically starts off about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Then, to the point after that, it comes down to start about Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine Linton.

Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Most Unpleasant Read","review":"I gave this one star, not because you can go no lower, but because it is well-written and has a coherent story line. Aside from that, however, I found it quite lacking. I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant. I generally have no issue with unpleasant characters or unhappy endings, but aside from the writing style and Bronte's ability to hold the story together in a clear manner I found nothing enjoyable about it, and pleasant or not books are meant to be enjoyed, elsewise you're wasting your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death-defying love and mean people.","review":"Let's admit it, as good a writer Emily Bronte was, she wasn't as good a writer as her sister, Charlotte. Her only major work, WUTHERING HEIGHTS clearly illustrates that. The writing is superior to most fiction that one reads today and the story is rather interesting. Yet, it failed to catch my attention as easily as JANE EYRE did. There are very few likeable characters in the story (the young Catherine Earnshaw, the housekeeper, and the narrator) and the ending seemed rather hasty. Nevertheless, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a classic and for good reason. It examines a love that defies death, how important our relationships with other people are, and the value of words. It takes awhile to get into the book, but once one passes the first few chapters, it's hard to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful printing of an iconic novel","review":"first, allow me to say that i am quite enjoying these puffin classics editions of some of my favorite novels!'wuthering heights' is full of mystery, romance, and winding ghost stories; atmospheric moors and the winds rushing over them. you can practically feel the english countryside and its beauty and harshness (it is a character unto itself). i would love to delve into the plot, but would hate to give away any plot points.a bonus here with the puffin classics is the addition of backstory included at the end of the book. here you can learn more about the author, the story, the characters, and so much more. what a delightful thing to include!i have purchased most of these puffin classics editions, and will certainly look for future additions to add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Available free on Librivox.org","review":"This was recorded by Ruth Golding for librivox.org and is available free, gratis and for nothing at that site - as 80,000 people have already discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING","review":"RIVETING PLOT.

I couldn't even find a character that LIVED that I liked and was rooting for. By the end, I really disliked them all. If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book.

I had a 300 and something page book that I was going to read but of course I put it off because I HATE READING! I decided to read this book because it was shorter and it had been on my bookshelf collecting dust for years. Once I started reading, I read a quarter of the book and the only reason I put it down was because by the time I looked up it was two in the morning! I think everyone needs to read this book. I was also amazed when I found out that it was written 150 years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant, good","review":"My friend complained bitterly to me how horrible this book was, and curious, I decided to pick up a copy. I was impressed by Bronte's work.. I like how she illustrates the passion and love evident between Cathy and Heathcliff... it is one of the most moving storylines I've read. It's a good classic, and although it's tragic, there are glimpses of happiness here and there in the novel, and the novel ends on a peaceful, concluding note.However, the Yorkshire accent nearly killed me... it was hard to read--I skipped the Yorkshire dialogues almost completely. Also I felt like strangling Cathy and Heathcliff... it was all perfect, but then she had to go do her thing... Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier. The novel was very touching and I was left speechless as I quietly closed the book, because Ms. Bronte knows how to describe two people in fervent (though at times.. rampant?) love and how it will endure the tests of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"I have to say it: I did not like the book. I willingly admit that Emily Bronte had heaps of talent and writes beautifully, but I couldn't bring myself to like any character in the book. They all seemed, rude, selfish, and insane to me, and there were very few or no aspects in which I could relate to or sympathize with them. In short, I have nothing against the writer, and her style, but the plot and characters in this story, are in my opinion, overdone and stretched beyond believability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and unengaging","review":"I don't know what people see in this book. I found it irritating from the start -- all the characters are thoroughly unlikeable. After slogging my way through a quarter of the book, I found I still couldn't care less what happened to these people.The writing is also painfully verbose and florid. For a better story, I would have been willing to cope with it, but here it was just another reason to put the book down and never pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolishness","review":"Don't buy this book without reading carefully the description.

Bronte's wonderful tale of Heathcliff, mainly, is an excellent though provoking novel. It contains everything, and a reader who indulges in any genre of novels will no doubt love this story.This novel takes place on the moors in the late 1700's into 1802 England. Heathcliff is taken in by Mr. Earnshaw, owner of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff, becomes beloved by Cathrine Earnshaw, but despised by her brother Hindley. Catherine, however falls in love with Edgar Linton, heir to Thrushcross Grange. She denies Heathcliff's proposal, for she claims it to be too much of anm embarassment to marry him and marries Edgar Linton. The novel tells of tells of the characters and their intense fellings toward one another, as time goes on and their childern grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master piece","review":"Wuthering heights is remarkable. No other book was able to characterize the human behavior in such a way.a love story that shows all sorts of feelings like hatred, revange, friendship...A book that has been well received for so long and in so many places, can make you feel happy, angry and many others along the reading because you can actually see yourself in the character\`s shoes. There is no doubt that Wuthering heights is a master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I read it","review":"The engAging though somewhat dismal story of \\" love\\" unfulfilled between Catherine and HEathcliff.

Great story for a time when women were not considered fit to be writers and had to use pseudonyms to have their work published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful love story","review":"Wuthering Heights was a very good, well written book, though the beginning was very confusing. This book was full of love, passion, and hatred. Not many people get to live the experiece of what Catherine was feeling when she said, \\"I am Heathcliff, he's always, always, in my mind; not as a pleasure any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\\" That was the most powerful quote in the whole book, and it shows how well thought out this book was when it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed Reading Ruins Classic","review":"The story is the same and just as wonderful as it has always been.

Too bad... it was a waste of money, and a long boring car trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tragedy","review":"This is a great novel. It is easy to ready but not easy to get into since it is a little bit slow and dark from the first page.

I cannot tell you how many times I just wanted to kill the main characters and be done with it. I only finished reading the book just to see if it EVER got any better. Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"One of my favorite teachers told me this was her favorite book. She must have gotten something different out of it. I mostly despised the main characters, especially Heathcliff. The best part of the book is the last 20 pages when the daughter finally finds happiness but the rest was almost unbearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gothic masterpiece, but not easy to love","review":"Wuthering Heights is in many ways a remarkable novel, but also a very dark one, which makes it difficult to really love. It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading Wuthering Heights, and I have to admit, it was a slog. It's not that I have anything against novels from that time period; I count Jane Eyre and the works of Jane Austen among my favorite books. But Wuthering Heights did not live up to its reputation. The characters were universally unlikeable and unsympathetic. The story was meandering and ultimately unfulfilling. And the \\"love story\\" - more of a story of unreasonable obsession - did not move me. So count me among the few who did not fall in love with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark love story set in the eightenth century.","review":"Wuthering heights is a book whitch everyone should read. it is a facinating love story between two wild individuals.

I could go on in detail about why I feel this way but basically it was just Pathetic...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Maybe it's just me but this was SOOOOOOOOOO boring. I read the first 50 or so pages and had to put it down. Too many characters were introduced and the story was lost almost immediately. I know it's a classic and I know I'm supposed to revere the writers of old, but this was a waste of time. Nothing against Bronte, just not my cup of tea.

Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads. Wuthering Heights is defiantly not a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but tedious.","review":"Heathcliff is a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man inside and out. His character makes this an interesting story. But, it was a little tedious to read.Margo, a former college professor, enlightened me with some thoughts on the book which I am quoting here. This is from her comment below dated 2/4/09. \\"Younger readers are fans of the story because they see in it the tumultuous passions of lovers obstructed by \\"outsiders.\\" I think they \\"get it.\\" My college students love it because they are mesmerized by the slow, agonizing destruction of one of the lovers as he takes his vengeance.\\" Thank you Margo.Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. (I mention sexual content solely for the purpose of providing information. Some readers may want to know this when recommending to young adults.)

It feels sloppily written at times and sometimes I wonder if she wrote the book just to compete with her sister (hey you never know).

But this book is horrid.If you are a tween girl, this might be a good book for you, though. If your dream fella is one of those dark and broody types, the kind that seems mysterious but turns out to be just a basic kind of jerk. It's a shame that some people find this book romantic. The dark, disturbed guy in this book is called Garfield and he's a lousy person.If you like this time period for fiction, you should try Anne Bronte. She wrote two fantastic books. But avoid Charlotte Bronte. She, too, is a terrible writer.Full disclosure: I do not know Emily Bronte, nor would I care to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am reading Wuthering heights in preparation for and AP English course, and am finding it to be the most tedious book I have ever read. I used to think that Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea dragged, but i was sadly mistaken. This book is a drawn out and dreary affair. I have enjoyed \\"classic\\" literature in the past but this is unworthy of being dubbed \\"classic\\". I would never reccomend this book to another living person, but maybe I'm just and \\"immature\\" reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and confusing","review":"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\". Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance.... Yeah right","review":"I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story. There was hardly any romance. The characters aren't likeable that I just wanted them to just die basically. The whole story was just so boring and had this dark depressing feeling to it, which basically is the main point of the story.This will be the first and last time that I will read Wuthering Heights.

However, I think it's because of the way that she writes this novel that makes it so captivating. It's terrifying and romantic, it's seemingly unbearable and it's light and easy. It's definitely the best of both worlds. A romantic and thrilling tale of love and evil. Who doesn't love that? Not to mention the writing is second to none.But, regardless of how much I love this story, I did have to take a star away just because of how many times I had to stop and go, \\"wait ... wha? erm ... but I thought ...\\" And yes, in the long run, it makes the book that much greater, but it can get frustrating (especially for one not used to that type of reading) and confusing.But, yeah, a true classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic? Why?","review":"I have no memory of Northern England late 1700's. I don't no if characters such as Heathcliff or the younger Linton actually could exist. But this whole story is so unbelievable that it goes way beyond fiction. Not only that but one of the basic requisites of any successful novel, or movie for that matter, is to have at least one character that the audience likes or will root for. There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top.

Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots.

The overblown \\"love\\" between the characters would invariably be followed by an act of viscious cruelty. Many of the good reviews for this book are from high school students. The reason most of them liked it, in my mind, is because they are immature and have idealized images of the emotions described in the book and how people would react to those emotions. We all know what it is like to love, to hate, to lose, but even under the most painful situations no one would act the way these characters did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I know this may sound disrespectful to all of you connoisseurs of fine Brittish literature, but I hated Wuthering Heights.

I have not read any studies on the book, so I don't know even if this is meant to be one of the themes, but that was my impression.I would definitely read this book again one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"wuthering heights","review":"Love the movie.

It was intriguing from the start, and never once boring. I plan to read this novel again at some point in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Literature Heights\\"","review":"Ever since I read this book, every book is easy to read. Thanks to this book, I have come to understand two things better: a bit more of human nature through Heathcliff's, and both Catherines' characters and English language through Emily Bronte's amazing style. The language changed a lot ever since the beginning of 19th century, I had trouble reading at first, it seemed boring and I couldn't really get into the characters. Then suddenly it became easy and interesting to read. Maybe I should thank my reading abilities for the improvement but I'd rather think it's the well developed characters of Ms Bronte helped me to step over that invisible reading barrier. I highly recommend this book, it is a must-read kind because it is about pure love, not passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE USERS BEWARE","review":"This is NOT the study edition referred to in the other review. It is a poorly formatted version of the book which contains nothing but the text. No table of contents or other such fanciness, and certainly no supplemental material. Just the text. Rather than spend even 99 cents on this version, get the Project Gutenberg download of Wuthering Heights for the Kindle. It is better formatted and free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling, Twisted, Beautiful","review":"This novel is amazing and among my favorites. From the loyal and selfless Mrs. Dean, to the narcissistic and vain Catherine (and everyone imaginable in between), the characters are portrayed with a very unique talent. They truly are unforgettable, and the story is well-packed. The literal undying love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff will clutch the very soul of the reader. The insanity that grips and devastates throughout the novel gives Wuthering Heights an almost sick tone. The more dominate plot of Heathcliff bringing a heavy revenge upon his foes which in turn terrorizes the next generation, is told in a brilliant, intriguing, and clever way. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't imagine...","review":"There really much to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said, but I want to say when I read this book, i was so upset when the book ended.

I wish i had written this book, it touches every part of you when you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This was a difficult read for me. For several months I would pick up this book become utterly disgusted with the characters and put it back down again. I'm really not sure why I finished it as the more I think about it the more I truly hated it. I wish I had returned it to the library unfinished.This is the story of Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by the Earnshaw family and Catherine Earnshaw his only childhood friend. Let's just say that as events unfold and as the characters develop we come to know the evil Heathcliff and selfish Catherine will never be together. Since they truly love each other the only alternative seems to be to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them. At this point I was really hoping for a rabid pack of wolves to attack everyone and end their misery. Unfortunately this did not happen.On a more positive note this book was very well written and the character development superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic ..... of course","review":"I read this many years ago. It is a book to be read over and over.I have just finished Jane Eyre also."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Honest Opinion...","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative romance novel mixed with firey passion","review":"This book is a great mix of passion, love, betrayel, and revenge.i would recommend this book to everybody.

It's a classic and always will be an amazing story. The story just grabs your attention and never lets go. One of my absolute favorite quotes is from this book. It's a shame they don't make books like they did back then. \\"If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he was annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"I'm actually 17, not 13, but I don't have a credit card so I can't submit normally...Anyways, this is my review:To be perfectly honest, I found this novel to be very overrated. I didn't enjoy this book at all, and to be honest, I don't really understand why it has been referred to as a \\"classic\\" when it has, at best, a flimsy plot and several of the characters are little more than one-dimensional stereotypes, not unlike characters in a modern-day soap opera.I'll admit, it does have it's strong points at times, such as the profound symbolism used throughout the book and the imaginative descriptions of moments such as Mr. Lockwoods dream about the late Catherine, but personally, I found it to be overly melodramatic, and at times, tedious. I was glad when I finally finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Withering heights - that's no typo","review":"I started reading this book as part of my catch-up-with-the-classics campaign. And it was supposed to be full of smoldering passion, etc., etc. I read on and on and on - nothing. Did I miss something, I don't think so. Up until now, I could have said I've never met a book I didn't like. The best I can say - I didn't find it offensive. Just dull beyond belief.

The story is mainly about Heathcliff and his passion for Catherine and how he tries everything in his power to be with her. Catherine only marries her husband for his money and good looks. Heathcliff being the disturbing person he is will not let go of Catherine and this continues on for the whole book. If you have to read this book pay attention to every word or else you will not understand it.

It is a story of the true love and true hate that is inherent in all human nature that engages its readers deeper and deeper with every word. Almost every character in the novel is both loved and hated by the reader at different times, and I always find myself longing for the reunion of Catherine and Heathcliff no matter how many times I read the story. Emily Bronte was an author well before her time, and I have read nothing so far that even compares to the beauty of this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book ever!","review":"This book is by far the best book I've ever read. The important thing is that you read it slowly so you don't miss any important information. I cried several times throughout the story. My feelings towards the older Catherine and Heathcliff went back and forth throughout the book, but for the most part I liked Catherine and disliked Heathcliff. I like the way history repeated itself with Catherine's daughter and Hindley's son.

For 85% of Wuthering Heights I thought, This is just a book full of miserable people. I can't sympathize with any of them. I almost stopped listening (it was an audiobook) a few times. But...1. It has a lovely ending.2. It has an interesting narrative structure: The whole story is narrated by Mr Lockwood, who observes very little of the action firsthand, instead hearing most of it from Nelly (the story within a story) who hears key parts of it from other minor characters (the story within a story within a story!).3. The best of the characters love to read. How can I not sympathize, at least a little bit?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buyer, great service, great book","review":"Highly recommended!

For anyone who loves the classics and has not experienced the sheer magnificence of this book, pick up a copy and feel all the strong emotions that come with loving until the brink of insanity.For those of you who have read it again and again, pick up this copy and meet Heathcliff and Catherine for the first time.

The novel's main characters--Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff--are ingeniously written, and the melodramatic scenes are not too \\"cheezy\\" for the modern audience. Bronte's superb authorship allows readers of all backgrounds and of all generations to feel the characters, experience the novel's moods and tones, and appreciate the art of literature. If you absolutely despise reading, you will learn to love it after reading this novel. The novel's themes of passion, hate, love, loss, revenge, and individuality are something we can all relate to and evoke powerful emotions from within any reader. Every educated person should read this...It truly deserves its place among the world's greatest literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Awe-Inspiring","review":"I must admit I did the unthinkable. I watched the epic 1939 version of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" before reading the book. The book portrays Heathcliff as a brash, violent man unlike the movie, where he is brash, but his heart is still carrying a torch for Cathy. I never knew that the two main characters had children, and reading about the deep contempt Heathcliff had for Linton, his son, I was appalled. Nevertheless, I loved reading the book. The tragic love borders many other great novels written for the period, and I would suggest anyone who loves two lovers trying to deny the feelings between one another, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family story","review":"This book is really fascinating.

I'm 13 years old and I've read this book in my spare time. I've read it in German but I'm going to read it in English too. One of my faves, everybody who's interested in a little bit confusing family stories should read it.BYE, Flowerpowertati"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Hate Story","review":"I believe Wuthering Heights to be just an average book hardly capable of any noteriety. The book seems to be the same old story of a vengeful man who takes his anger and hate out on other people in a useless effort to please himself. This deep inner hatred results from the untimely death of Heathcliff's lifetime love, Catherine. The reason I gave this book a three was because it was so difficult to follow. Bronte used the same names and the same situations over and over and I could never understand who she was talking about. The theme of Man vs Man was overly developed with the continuing acts of hatred from Heathcliff. I reccomend you read this book if you want to avenge something or you withold a deep hatred for someone. EMILY SMITH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of its place in the canon","review":"How odd that Amazon does not consolidate the comments on the various editions of this book from different publishers.I read this book out of a certain sense of obligation -- I'd been reading other 19th century English literature and, with some trepidation, picked up Wuthering Heights to complete the set. The book was wonderful, with fully developed if sometimes quixotic characters, and rapid and often unexpected plot twists. The prose is denser than, say, Jane Austen, but not as bad as the stereotypical gothic novel. The main character, Heathcliff, is famously attractive to women but, as a male reader, I thought he was a thoroughly bad egg. Worthy of discussion, though, especially with women who have read it and are likely to have a different opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,","review":"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,_ you will probably want to swallow twice and pony up for this facsimile of the original edition of the novel. There's something breath-taking in seeing it as Emily Bronte, with only a year or so to live, saw her own work in 1847. The crudeness of the text--typos abound--somehow corresponds to the roughness of the sensibility that produced it. And since the original publisher wanted to spread it out so as to sell thicker book, it's easy on the eyes.The book is sewn in heavy, orangish cloth and feels substantial; in these days of flashy, cheaply produced volumes, this two volume set is a happy throwback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine rendering of the novel.","review":"This is a well-red audiobook- the pacing is good, the enunciation is clear and the reader varies the vocal color enough to make individuals identifiable during dialogues.

But even in that case its the parents who should be in control of their kids viewing. But it was great made me think about the 80s and revisit how much high school sucked, but it also gave out some good aspects to let teens know that high school maybe your everything then but when you grow up you definitely have to have an alternate plan.

Ned and the high school principal were the stars of an amusing subplot that I kept looking forward to. There were no slow parts in the movie and one scene segued to the next one seamlessly. The entire cast did a good job.I've not seen High School Musical but Zac Efron carried the movie effortlessly on his shoulders and he was pleasant to watch throughout.

If you are looking a recent recording, though, this might be the one to choose. Alagna and Vaduva are commanding and sound pleasant. Keenleyside and Swenson really give this recording the edge: I was swept away by the sheer beauty of her voice in Quando m'en vo.

My taste is heavy rock, and I bought this video years ago for my wife, but I am so glad we kept this video. Talent is talent.

I'm an avid reader and have no indications leading me to believe I have ADD or ADHD but this was simply put the worst text I have ever seen about film. The author's subject matter is not only unappealing but at times also irrelevant.

Therefore, the sovereign nation is losing power.While these are all true, the most important question is; to what extent? She never adresses this, and so, the whole book amounts to not much than some trendy talk of \\"Oh the world is global now and everything's different\\". So, forget this book.

The stories for the most part are well written and interesting. But they hardly seem to match the title's description as being \\"outrageous\\", \\"alternative\\" or \\"underground\\". Most of them wouldn't have been out of place in any mainstream publication.There are some exceptions; Barbara Solow's \\"Academia Under Seige\\" and Dan Savage's \\"Dope\\" both were written with an openly partisan stance and Greg Tate's \\"Hip-Hop Turns 30\\" was too poorly written to have gone mainstream. But the other articles feature subjects like a profile of New York's last executioner, a fraud case in a Texan cemetary, or history of Ultimate Fighting.So if you're looking for some good human interest pieces, I'd recommend this book. However, if you're looking for something \\"edgy\\" you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this CD as it has several duets as well as solos of each artist. The voices of these two singers are unique and timeless, especially when they blend together in their duets which touch the hearts and souls of old and young alike. Their music surpasses the boundary of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this book as a reference","review":"I just started with chickens in my yard. Lots of good advice in this book. Get the physical book not the kindle because you will want to refer back to it.

I don't watch alot samari movies but this one was very very good !!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak rehash","review":"I thought I was going to be all for an attractive girl to step up to refresh the Zatoichi franchise and then I saw this. The lead actress was a super weak representation of the series super bad sword slinger. The action is weak, the direction is weak and the story is boring with a slow pace that did not hold my interest no matter how cute I thought the lead actress was, while watching this I found myself continuing to get up and do other things and I am a huge fan of this genre and have been for years. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all right. Watch \\"Jin\\" if you can.","review":"This movie is just so-so. The actors perform really well but the story is just not that interesting.If you can, please watch a TV drama called Jin. Osawa Takao and Ayase Haruta are the lead actors. Unfortunately, the drama is not released in the US and has no English subtitle."},{"rating":"1","title":"should never being dubbed","review":"I didn't realize that this this is the dubbed version (my mistake). The film is great, but the English dub destroyed the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the ideas in here","review":"Let me start by saying,I like the D&D 3.5 system the best, so I finally got around to adding this book to my game system. I do not know if many or any of the ideas will get into my campaigns, but I appreciate having the book as a reference, access to the ideas of other gamers, and to stimulate my own new ideas for our game play. I would not describe this as a 'must have', but if you have the money, it is definitely a 'nice to have'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste","review":"The only thing that I found interesting in the book is the list of phobias in the end. Otherwise, it is just a set of useless variant rules. The book is also very chaotic, seemingly with no specific purpose. Any GM who would need this book is in a lot of trouble to begin with, if s/he can't use the DMG guidelines to come up with his/her own subtypes and variant classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to say I'm sorry I bought this book. I guess it was nostalgia, I recalled the excitement and value of the Unearthed Arcana back in ver 2 era, and I thought this would have the same impact.Mostly, having gone through it page by page, I'm disappointed. It is MOSTLY a list of modifications of existing races and classes that anyone could do at home without a book. I didn't find anything really NEW, exciting, or inspiring in it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, rambles on.","review":"The first few pages of the book were interesting. I was hoping it would be a more detailed account of life before and after the reunification. Instead the author just rambles on and on, without really saying much of anything. Not worth the $10 (kindle edition)"},{"rating":"1","title":"After The Wall","review":"The book is written as an extended essay. There is very little observation of actual events. The author's account of life in the GDR lacks realism and is really quite shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice read about life in East Germany.","review":"Whereas one of the previous reviewers may not have \\"gotten\\" this book, I did. I visited East Germany right after the fall of the wall, and then five years later. What a change there was. Not only could you tell the difference on the outside, but the people changed too. Hensel writes about these changes and how it affected her. Then she relates how it affected the older generations. Hensel is a little flip, but maybe she has a right to be. There were big changes, and the young adapt to change. Older people do not. This is a story about one young lady changing to the new landscape. East Germany no longer exists physically, but does emotionally in millions of Germans.This is a nice read for those interested in Germany. I found myself laughing at some of Hensel comments. I can relate how she experienced life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Materialism at its worst","review":"After the Wall depicts the real life impact of West German materialism on the people of the GDR. The younger generations adapted but as a consequence they lost their historical identities. The older generations of the GDR were simply overwhelmed. Although the intense focus on 'things' makes the reading a little repetitive and annoying at times, that just reinforces the fact that western/capitalist materialism is such a powerful force. This book offers unique insights into life in the GDR, capitalism, socialism, identity, and history. It's worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"*Carmen* was the first opera I ever saw in person. My mother also has this particular recording (it's part of her father's classical music collection), and I absolutely LOVED it, even from a very young age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my Evo due to this case","review":"First let me say the leather case is excellent quality and exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately the belt clip does not function correctly which caused me to lose a brand new Evo within a week of purchase. The clip has a screw which is supposed to lock in place and be released with finger pressure on a button at the top of the clip. This is the part that was wholly non-functional. Most of the time when I push the button, I could not get the clip to release no matter how hard I pulled on it. Then it appearently just fell out of this same clip (the clip was still attached to my belt) with virtually no pressure while I was walking across a parking lot. If you buy this product make sure your phone is insured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan Electric Chain Saw really cuts it","review":"I am very pleased with this electric chain saw. The power of the 4hp motor is quite impressive. I had labored with an older electric chain saw to cut through a log lying on my property. The Poulan made quick work of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made Saw","review":"The product arrived either broken or immediately broke.The bar adjusting pin, part # 530053068, is as flimsy as could have been produced.It only costs $.40 to replace, but with shipping it's over $6!I would never buy anything in this brand again and recommend that no one else does either."},{"rating":"1","title":"electric chain saw","review":"I ordered this chain saw based on the description that stated it could be used with up to a 100 foot extension cord. 75 feet from my house is a heavily wooded area that I'm trying to clear of downed trees. As a female, the thoughts of electric vs. gas just seemed safer. I unpacked this wonderful piece of equipment anxious to clean up my property. As I read through the owners manual, I came to the page that stated that a cord greater than 50 feet is not recommended. Well, that wasn't going to do me any good! I returned the saw and purchased a gas model in it's place. I received a very prompt refund from Amazon. The reviews on the electric saw were outstanding which is why I had chosen this particular model. As long as you don't need to go beyond 50 feet, I think it would be a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working After One Use","review":"This product stopped working after one use and it was too late to return it to Amazon.

I took down two large trees and cut into firewood in half a day. I was going to rent one from Home Depot for the project, but for the same price I now have my own chain saw. The saw is amazing for the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"head ump","review":"Quick delivery as always from Amazon. Oiled it up and plugged it in and started cutting tree limbs immediately. Cut some 6 inch logs with no problem. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"chain saw","review":"husband loves this, he had one for many years, finally wore it out. says he will never have a gas one again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for the price","review":"I've gone through many saws over the years, and although it may be small, this Poulan is surprisingly efficient. The cord is a bit of a nuisance, but what else do you expect with an electric saw? Good power. Nothing big to complain about. I've only used it for a short time, so we'll see how it performs again this year..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Home Projects","review":"This is a great little chainsaw. Easy to set up and use. Light weight and works as advertised. The only limitation is how long of an extension cord you can provide. It is perfect for around the property and garden. I have used it to cut down small (6\\" diameter) trees, and have pruned multiple trees with branches 3\\" plus thick. Plenty of power to do more too. Definitely pleased with the product and have no hesitation to give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on me and hard on wood","review":"Had A LOT of trimming to do and some pretty good size trunks I needed to cut down around our property and this little fella was just the ticket. Took down several 12\\" trunks quickly and dozens of 2\\" to 8\\" branches with ease. As long as you've got an extension cord to get to the tree this guy will do the job and save you some money. The self oiling is awesome and mess free and the size is perfect for small to medium size logs. Obviously you're not going to go walking through the woods taking down 4' trunks with it so if electric will fit your needs close to home you can't go wrong with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Died After a Few Uses","review":"Purchased December 2009 and started using it Spring 2010. Worked well right out of the box. Good power and features. Used it to take down a small tree and a few other smaller jobs.However, after cleaning and storing for winter, it wouldn't even start for Spring 2011. No idea what's wrong, tried different power source, etc. Based on the number of positive reviews, this may be an anomaly, or it could be hit or miss manufacturing.UPDATE: Spring 2012 - was about to buy another chainsaw and tried to start one last time. Working fine again so I'm updating to four-star (from two). Based on other reviews, it's possible the chain-stop was engaged, but I didn't move it prior to my start attempt so still unknown what issue was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan 18 inch electric chainsaw","review":"The Chainsaw has enough power to do the big jobs but the first one I had, the motor burned out quickly. This is the second, it was replace quickly without a problem. I am the type of person that needs the simplicity of electricity. (When I buy gas chainsaws, they only last 2 years because of lack of maintenance.) this unit has has poped my home circuit breaker several times. The only improvement in the product I would suggest would be to put an internal circuit breaker in the product to protect the motor. When it is out of warranty I will probably do this. It is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work Out of Box","review":"My mistake -- I waited months until I need to use the chainsaw before trying it out and... nothing. It doesn't work out of the box. I guess my situation is rare, so I can't complain about most users' experience with this chainsaw. I'll probably take it apart to see if it's just the switch as I have nothing to lose at this point. If I get it working, well, I'll update this."},{"rating":"2","title":"R. Bazan","review":"I purchased the Pro 400e from AMAZON on Sunday evening, Nov. 5th and received it the following Thursday afternoon after choosing the free shipping option. Opened the box, read the manuel, checked the chain, filled it with oil and that Saturday afternoon began cutting down a 30'foot tall, 20\\" diameter bartlet pear tree in my front yard. My size and weight is a consideration in any saw I use but not an issue with this one. It cuts like a dream. No kick back at all. Cut that tree down like I actually knew what I was doing. Great auto-oil function. Used a 100' extension cord with no power loss. It has my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oil Pump Failed after a few hours use","review":"With all the great reviews, I bought this saw from Amazon. Worked great for a while until the oil pump quit pumping. This saw was never run low on oil and the oil was always fresh and clean. I disassembled the saw, everything was clean from the oil tank to the pump to the chain bar. I removed the oil pump, and it had clearly failed. Inside the housing I was suprised to find that the ring gear, which reduces motor speed, was not metal but a light tan nylon like material. My previous electric saw worked for over 20 years and cut a LOT of wood. I was disappointed at this early failure. I do not recomment taking your saw apart unless you know how to put it back together. Springs easily fly, and re-assembly is a bit of a trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened?","review":"I was pretty excited about the Poulan 18inch electric chain saw which worked fabulous----for about 3 minutes!!!! It then just quit!! I finally managed to get in contact with the primary distributor for my area who informed me that for some unknown reason the motors short out. What?! I was then instructed to cut off the power cord and ship it along with the serial number and model number off the box. I was supposed to receive a new one. That was 2 weeks ago and I have not heard a thing. At the same time my friend bought the Makita 16\\" electric and loves it! I wish I had done the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great - until it doesn't!","review":"I needed to section a 14\\" black cherry log and bought this Poulan 18\\" electric chain saw because of the number of positive reviews. The first one arrived and I made one cut in the log and then failed - pulled the trigger and nothing. Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement and the second one made more progress - I made 8 cuts 2/3 of the way through the log but when I stopped to turn the log and finish the job, saw #2 failed in precisely the same way. Pull the trigger and nothing.Perhaps I got two lemons but, regardless, 0 for 2 with 9 cuts is NOT a good product. I would not purchase this saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nylon Ring Gear Breaks","review":"I used this saw to cut down two live junipers when I got it about eight months ago which work just fine. Then I used it to cut up a dead oak tree, the chain bind in the log, which broke some of the nylon plastic ring gear teeth. Now the motor spins, but if the ring gear does not catch the chain will not. I tried to use the warranty to fix it but so far they say it was due to abuse. This is a powerful saw but if you are thinking for long term use, this saw is not it. This saw is for very light duty work only and will not last for more than a couple of years use, even for light duty cutting, becuase the gear is made of plastic. Even though this saw is inexpensive, I could have taken that money and rented a more heavy duty saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died upon first Use","review":"This Poulan died upon first use. Something happened to the motor, and there was black smoke residue on the motor vents. Pulling the trigger - it would occasionally arc, so I know it had power. Amazon let us return it, but charged a restocking fee, since we were busy and not able to send it back within 30 days. Disappointing experience. Spend the extra money and buy the Makita 16\\". We did. The Makita is much sturdier - no comparison. Makita's direct drive motor provides a very solid feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan Pro 400E 18\\" electric chain saw","review":"I ordered this chain saw because I needed one that I could start myself and was light enough for me to use. I was tired of bothering my husband everytime I needed to start the gas model. The oil/gas mixture it uses was also an issue. This saw is instant start everytime and a breeze to use. It is also powerful enough to cut the trees and limbs we have on our properties. I ordered it thru amazon with free shipping. A great buy for $100.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A - Not impressed so far!","review":"Just went to use my saw for the first time, and it was dead on arrival. Does absolutely nothing.Very disappointing given that I ordered it specifically to do a couple of small projects over the labor day weekend :(We will see how quickly Amazon gets me a replacement and if its any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Electric Chainsaw","review":"Since this is the first chainsaw I have ever purchased, I have nothing to compare it to. However, this chainsaw is perfect...right out of the box. There's no assembly; just put in the oil (which is sold separately) and plug it in. After receiving it, I just had to take down one of the \\"rag\\" trees in my yard. The chainsaw operated perfectly. Had the tree down in a matter of minutes and cut into pieces. I would recommend this saw if you need one for your home. I thought about a gas chainsaw but decided that I didn't want to deal with starting issues and gas/oil issues a few times a year. This saw is perfect for the home owner that just needs a chainsaw to have when needed. The final selling point was the 18\\" saw-blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its pretty cool.....","review":"Nice size, not too heavy, it was pretty cool. The light work that I needed it for it worked like a charm... Its a solid piece of equipment for an electric chainsaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan 18\\" Electric Chainsaw","review":"This chainsaw arrives much faster than expected, free by air. The 18\\" size was just what I needed for cutting slabs of redwood. I would highly recommend this product. The only weakness is that extra chains are not offered by the same supplier, a back-up chain is always desirable to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't go there","review":"I bought this chainsaw a few weeks ago to do some clean up around the yard....made it for about 1/2 hour, and the thing went poof...totally smoked it...unless you like to return things, stay clear of this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for the infrequent user, plenty of juice","review":"I bought this chainsaw to cut down a giant set of junipers in my backyard. It was a tangled mess, branches 30+ feet long, all hooked and twisted among others. I say this because the ability to easily cut, then stop cutting to try and get out what I had cut off was a key reason I bought an electric one. you can cut for a few minutes and just set it down, no restarting BS like with a gas one. The Poulan had the juice I needed, cutting through 10-15 inch stumps no problem. Also, I know I wont use my chainsaw more than once or twice a year, so the maintenance on a gas one didn't make sense to me... this one will be ready to go anytime, as long as the oil is full. the oiler worked great, every time I checked the chain for tension, the bar was well oiled. the chain tensioning system worked well, as with any chainsaw, the chain loosens, but it was easy to adjust and maintain. If you are a homeowner, this would be a great option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oil leak","review":"After waiting about two months for delivery, I liked this saw until after a week or so I noticed that oil was leaking out of the bottom from where the two halves of the plastic casing join. I can use it, but when I store it, all of the oil leaks out. What a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHAIN SAW","review":"I ORDERED THIS CHAIN SAW THROUGH AMAZON AND IT CAME RIGHT AWAY BY UPS.

THE SAW WORKS JUST GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little saw","review":"Have used gas chain saws all my life But this little thing really cuts, I use it to re-cut fire logs that are to long for my outside wood boiler, I sometimes cut them too long in the woods and this thing is really handy, and it was cheaper to buy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"good inexpensive chain saw","review":"This is a good starter saw or one for intermittent use. Easy to handle and will do the job on logs and trees up to 16\\" in diameter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once then died","review":"Very easy to start. Just added bar oil. Cut fairly effortlessly one weekend then didn't start at all the next. Not even a sound. Hopefully.just a dud and not a more common issue.Good return policy by Amazon though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out after 2 small trees","review":"I was cutting through a 12 inch cedar tree, when the chainsaw motor went up in smoke. I had only used it once before on a plum tree that had fallen in high winds. I called Poulan Pro customer service and they were rude and not willing to assist with recommendations for a chainsaw that could cut small trees (it was out of warranty). I also went to their website for help and no one has written back. Very disappointed in their customer service and their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw for the money","review":"This is the 2nd one of these saws that I have owned. The first one was used and abused for 2 years, and when it failed I quickly went out and bought the exact same saw. I've cut trees up to almost the full blade length with this saw and it never balks. Cuts at an angle fine and is pretty light weight. Probably the best electric chain saw out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a hot knife through butter","review":"Nothing to complain about does what it is supposed to and the price is right. Chopped up some large oak logs and it never even hesitated even when I hit some knots. It is almost frightening hot it cuts so smoothly, makes you a bit more relaxed than you probably should be with a chainsaw.We'll see how it works in a year from now...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacement","review":"Chose this saw after reading other reviews. I needed to replace a 25 year old sthil saw. Since my usage of the stihl had drindled to about once a year, I decided that the expense and upkeep of gas units was not worth it. If I'm out of range of the extension cord I will either rent of hook up to a generator.Product received in a timely manner. It would have been nice to have a blade guard with the saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite for the neighbors","review":"Worked great for me. When I needed firewood for my Franklin stove, that I had bought from Ben himself, my friend brought me a dumptruck load of fir logs that were as large as 18 inchs.

BURT"},{"rating":"2","title":"This works really great!","review":"I use it to clear brush, cut limbs, and cut small trees. It is surprisingly powerful, reasonably quiet, and very reliable.

Just what I needed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan Pro 18-Inch 4 HP Electric Chainsaw #400E","review":"Had the saw for about a month now, cut about 3 cords of oak, so far so good. Realy like the light weight & cutting ability with logs in excess of 18\\". No gas & engine oil & not breathing the fumes is also a big +.

I went through 3 sears 18\\" gas saws in the past 12 years if it lasts as longI'll be quite happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't work out of the box","review":"I just opened the box, added oil, plugged it in and absolutely nothing. No indication that it even wanted to try and start moving. I've requested a replacement against my better judgement, but based on the other reviews it only appeared that a small % of them were bad, so I took my chances. We'll see how the replacement works.Well, a little embarrassed. I received my replacement without any hassle from Amazon,which is why I shop with them. However, the replacement had the same problem. I thought, there's no way two could be bad. So I read the instructions again, and again. Then I found the problem, quite a few pages in after the \\"Operation Instructions\\" Poulan describes the brushguard brake function. The brushguard must be pulled toward the handle to start.So, I rated the product 4 stars out of sheer embarrasment, however their instruction manual gets -1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit on me on the second day.","review":"Well.It stopped working after about 6 hours.Also, the customer service of this company is very bad.They don't have enough repair service centers, so I will have to ship it, which will cost me money.Wouldn't recommend Z- (which is the total opposite to A+)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan Pro 18-inch Electric","review":"This unit performed pretty much as expected, cutting through logs up to 18 inches in diameter with relative ease. I even used the saw to cut a hollowed dead Maple tree into sections before carting it away.If one were to express any reservation about the saw it would be with regard to electricity consumption. I suspect --but cannot quantify -- that the unit consumes a good deal more energy in terms of dollar-per-hour-of-use than a comparable gas model, as evidenced by a substantial increase in the subsequent electricity bill. Any references that could confirm or refute this would be welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SAW!!!!","review":"I purchased the Poulan Pro 400E electric chainsaw after reading the reviews. LOTS of positive ones, but a fair amount of 1 star as well. Well, the price was right and I took the gamble... BIG MISTAKE! The unit does not run. Period. Not even a run and stop. I called the 800 number on the machine and was told to send it back, but I can't. You have to put oil in the unit (NOT INCLUDED) and can't ship back with liquid in the unit. Amazon was GREAT to work with and they are going to refund the money. POULAN gets a zero star and AMAZON gets 5 stars for handling the situation quickly and professionally. Wish our Government ran as efficiently!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chain Saw Broken Upon Receipt","review":"I was going to buy an electric chain saw at my local Lowe's. But they increased the price on the one I wanted by $10 [to $100]- so I decided to order one from Amazon. I had it shipped via UPS ground. Well, I guess that UPS dropped or threw it like in the Christmas video [on TV]. When I took it out of the box, the chain was real loose. I thought, well, maybe that's the way that they normally send them. Then, the chain would not tighten. I took off the bar clamp, and the \\"bar adjusting pin\\" fell off into my hand. I called the Poulan help line - and they are going to send me a new pin. But, he didn't apologize. I guess that he thought I was lying. Anyway, the point is that it should work right out of the box [after you add the bar oil of course].I was thinking about buying a 3-D LG TV from Amazon. But after this, I wonder if it would arrive in pieces.As for the chain chaw, I guess it would be a better item to buy from your local store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut well for few hours and then died","review":"I wanted to acquire an affordable saw for a one time only job. I selected Poulan based on the reviews. I should have read the low ratings one more carefully. I was not able to re-start the saw after the first few hours. I observed a smoke coming out of the motor on the last cut. So, I guess the motor probably died. And it was not even a large branch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too safe for a chainsaw","review":"I used this a couple of times in the few months that I had it: the chain needed frequent re-tightening, but I believe this is normal, and it did settle down by the end of the second, mild, log-cutting session. The next time I came to use it, however, the safety handle would not disengage the brake, so the saw would not switch on at all. So it became the safest chainsaw I have ever used. The brake release had been a problem for a couple of minutes when I used it the first and second times, but it had finally relented and allowed me to switch the saw on. Not this time, however! I got someone in customer service who was very helpful, and I am being sent a new one. But why would the same thing not happen again? Why make rubbishy products, using up raw materials, time and labor which could have gone into a good, useful product? This was not made in China, but 'Assembled in America.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"What a piece of junk. It made two cuts and then quick. Dead in the \\"water\\". Won't run. Won't do anything. Owner's manual suggests this could be a problem with the power switch (it does feel like the switch is broken) - so apparently this is a common problem.Had to get out my \\"toy\\" 16 inch Homelite chain saw to get some work done, and the Homelite works just fine, except the cutting bar is too short.Poulan? Junk!Hey Amazon, how do I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"new or reconditioned???","review":"I ordered this saw based on the many positive reviews it had received. Unfortunately when the saw arrived there was no operators manual in the box. I sent the saw back and a replacement saw was promptly sent by Amazon. The second saw had the manual plus blade cover and wrench, but there were numerous scratches on the bottom of the motor housing as well as some other areas on the housing. Also it appeared that the box had been opened and restapled. Upon reading the negative reviews for this saw it seemed that some did not work at all out of the box and others ran only a few minutes before having motor burn out or breakage of a part that runs the chain on the bar.

Nobody services electric chain saws - so Poulan ostensibly replaces the unit. Except that they don't actually send you one of the units they have available for sale to other customers. Your replacement unit goes on back order until such time as the factory makes another run.Poulan did send a replacement unit after about two months, and the replacement works so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought new meant new","review":"Bought this as a present for my husband. Unfortunately, when he opened it we discovered that somebody had already gotten to it first. What was sold to me as a new chainsaw was covered in scratches and scrapes. The previous user hadn't even bothered to clean it off before repackaging it, because it was covered in sawdust!Maybe it was one of the other reviewers' lemon chainsaws resold to me, or maybe it was just somebody who figured they could get \\"free\\" use of a chainsaw by ordering one and quickly returning it. All I know is that somebody should really check these things before sending them out. This one's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"This saw looks good for the price and Consumer Reports rates it highly. Definitely think twice before ordering this one though. I saw all the one star reviews but decided to order one any way. My first saw lasted 3 uses, maybe 20-30 minutes total. After that it was totally dead. Amazon of course sent me a new one. The second lasted about 5 minutes --- one use. Same problem, totally dead. Someone mentioned in another review mentioned the chain brake. Not a chance, just plain broken. In the short period it ran I could actually see the motor housing glowing from sparks inside. What a piece of junk. If you are going to gamble and buy this one make sure you buy it from Amazon so you can get your money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, Easy, Adequate - A Nice Tool!","review":"I grabbed this saw as I was tired of watching a can of pre-mix go bad. I use this saw in conjunction with a 3700 watt portable generator for all kinds of duty (plus it's good exercise for the generator). If used with reasonable prudence, it WILL complete any task that you ask of it. Just be smart about the job, and large trees CAN be worked over with this saw.Oiler works nicely and the saw spins enough rpm's to effectively clear chips from the cut. Just keep that chain sharp!Even though the extension cord sometimes gets in the way, the lightness and responsiveness of this saw makes up for this minor inconvenience.All in all, I'm VERY pleased with this saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I got about a half an hour out of the motor cutting some small pine trees into firewood.

After a while I noticed that the chain was getting very hot and smoking. I tried a few adjustments, no improvement. Then I checked the oil on the chain. There was none and the oil reservoir was still full. I took the chain cover off and ran the saw without the chain. Still no oil coming out.

I don't use it very often, maybe every couple months if a tree falls or a branch or the like, maybe a little mor often in the fall and winter for some random firewood. It is great in this regard because I know if it were a gas saw I would be constantly fighting with the choke, gas/oil mix, pull cord, etc. I love having this saw where you just pull the trigger and it goes. The one down side obviously is it needs to be plugged in so you can't take it somewhere (unless you had a generator, but that runs on gas so get a gas saw?) Anyway, this is the perfect chainsaw for the average homeowner who needs to cut a few times every now and again, not all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never go back to gas power 4 yrs still working","review":"I needed to cut down about 30 trees in my back and front yard. I started out using a friends chain saw. Haven't needed one for about 20 years. Got fed up with the two he loaned me, they were a husqvarna and a mcalich or something. Wouldn't start all the time. So I said, \\"why not, I'll try an electric chainsaw. Glad I did. It is kind of nice using a saw that runs when you need it. There isn't a tree on the property that I can't cut down with this thing. It works better than i ever thought an electric could. NO DOUBT i reccomend this saw. Low maintenance, light, easy to clean and you never have to use a gas/oil mix. Well worth the asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan 20\\"saw","review":"Lightweight but powerful for an electric. Very convenient, and nice and quiet.

I will say this saw is the best in its class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 4HP chainsaw for $90","review":"As long as you can use it within extension cord reach, this is a great tool. the chain oiler is very good - the chain is always nice and wet without spraying oil, which is exactly the way I like it. And, of course with electric, there's no gas mixing and start up problems, and the saw is considerably quieter and lighter than a comparable 2-cycle powered tool. But, keep in mind, this is not a toy -- lighter saws can kickback easier, but on the otherhand they are easier to control as well.Regarding the extension cord, I was worried that 4HP (4HP = 2984W = 27A @ 110V) would draw a lot of current. But I've had no problem using my regular old orange 14ga 100' outdoor extension cord. It seems to work just fine, and doesn't get warm even after an extended duty cycle. The saw only draws full power under extreme motor loading situations -- like if the chain is binding or dull or something...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chainsaw died","review":"We used this chainsaw only 8 to 10 times, to cut down stray limbs, total running time less than two hours. Took it out this spring and it would not start. Verified there was power to the device, but it was totally dead. What a disappointment. We had replaced a gas powered chain saw that always needed spark plug attention and were happy to deal with the cord for the sake of reliability, but we sure didn't get it with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tool","review":"Very nice chain saw. Started working right oout of the box and has helped me cut down a fair amount of trees / logs over the years. I daresay it could probably do bigger trees as well, but I have only ventured upto trees about 6 inches across, more or less. The only drawback is the electric cord, which doesnt have a hook or something to keep it in place during reasonable usage. Other than that, works like a charm. Liked this so much that I ended up buying the same brand snow thrower as well, which is also great. All in all, Poulan Pro seems to make good products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy cutter","review":"Really impressed how easily this went from the box to the tree. Cut easily through 8 inch limbs.

I noticed after 15 minutes or so that the oil level had not changed, and that the chain appeared dry. I removed the bar and checked the oil holes (outlets for the oil pump to discharge oil onto the bar/chain) and no oil was present. Will be returning to Amazon shortly, which is unfortunate because for the cost and size it seemed like a fairly competent little saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw for a Great Price","review":"The Halloween 2011 snow storm took down a bunch of small trees in my yard. I have never used or owned a chainsaw. I didn't want a gas saw where you have to worry about oil/gas mix so I went with an electric saw.This saw is ready to go, right out of the box. Just add oil, check the chain, plug it in, and you are ready to go. I easily took down and cut up 2 birch trees (6-10 inch base) and a dogwood tree (7 inch base) within a few hours. I did not find the chainsaw used much oil and did not have to add any oil during use.Great saw, excellent price, easy to use for both women and men.

I have a Husquvarna gas saw that I was constantly repairing and as usual it wouldn't stay running when I started this project. In frustration I thought I would give an electric a try and the Poulan handled the job without a single problem. Although I have only used it this one time so far, in my opinion, for the active homeowner this saw is a perfect choice. Simple to use,more than adequate power and easy to clean. A real value. The blade cover is laughable but there are several after market choices including a $30.00 case from Poulan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good saw!","review":"Based on some consumer reviews and other experiences I had with Poulan products, I purchased this item.

This is a bit inconvenient since its not use serviceable (the cage for the screw is plastic molded so you can't disassemble it.

So I bought it again on 1/2007 and it was supposed to be delivered on 2/2007. Then Amazon wanted to extend again another month which would make it 3/2007, which I approved via email. When my dad didn't receive it 3/2007, I logged in to my account and Amazon extended it another month without notifying me!

Pay attention to the warning labels.","review":"This chainsaw worked OK at first. I was using it to edge the lawn and it did a pretty good job. Not quite as clean as I would have liked but you can't beat the price. Well, I got to the end of one side of my lawn, and I wanted to turn it off. Not knowing how to do so (I didn't really read the directions), I just tried to grab the blade and stop it with my hands. Boy was that a bad idea! Now I don't have any fingers and I had to buy that $900 dictation software so that I can still use my computer. I really should have paid attention to that label that said \\"do not attempt to stop blade with hands\\", but who really pays attention to that stuff? The worst part about it is that I can't do my job anymore and I can't even sue the company that made it(something about putting a warning label on the product removes their liability). Yeah, I saw that warning label and it wasn't kidding! I will never \\"attempt to stop blade with hands\\" again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great - ONCE!","review":"I'm really frustrated with the product and Amazon (at first).

Nothing! Nada! No worky! The thing doesn't even try. I'm thinking its got to be the cord or the outlet, something like that! But all is good there. Well, its under warranty and the manual says to just return it to the seller. Originally, Amazon would not take the return; I was not happy! But after a nice online chat, Amazon agreed to replace it. For that, I have upgraded my star rating from 1 to 2 in hopes that the next one will work more than once. I'll update after a few runs, and I've got a small tree to take down next.

I thought it would be better to get an electric model and not have to fool with gas and oil. That was a mistake. After the rain stopped, I ended up carting a generator around in a wheelbarrow to use the chainsaw.When it had power, the chainsaw worked great. I could cut through just about anything a gas model would cut. The only problem with the generator was that the saw would trip the overload protection when cutting though large branches (over 10 or so inches).After about 3 or 4 hours of use, the unit just stopped working. I cleaned out the bar, thinking something had jammed it, but no. It was dead. It was a huge bummer to have it die while I was cleaning out the yard. I have returned it and purchased a gas model.

I purchased the Poulan Pro 18-Inch 4 hp to replace one of my husky gas powered saws. I was impressed!! It will save you on gas (money in your pocket), saw maintanence (time), and cost of a gas power saw. You will still need bar oil, and I recommend a heavy duty long power cord...at least a 12 gauge cord to maximize the power of this fantastic electric saw. Note: I have used this saw to cut down to medium size oak trees that were at least 15 inch in diameter and found no lack of power...in fact I compare it to my 21 inch husky saw and I am cutting down on noise and CO2 polution.

I was pleasantly surprised to find such a quality saw for less than $100. You MUST MAINTAIN THIS LIKE A REGULAR SAW! This means clean it, check the bar oil, and adjust the chain before you use it every time.

The resin will come out of the sides and get all over the windshield. It seeps under the adhesive but doesn't go into the crack. There is insufficient resin- and it all winds up everywhere but inside of repair. I followed the instructions to the letter- this kit does not work. You can't get a seal over the repair with the tools provided and the resin does not penetrate into the damaged area, it all comes out the sides because there is no seal. In order for this to work, you would need to have a good seal over the ding or crack, and the materials in this kit do not provide that. You'd probably need to be able to open the crack as well- nothing in the kit allows you to do that.

If your windshield has a small chip or \\"starburst\\" crack, this product is definitely worth a shot before you spend major money to replace the windshield.Pros:- The kit costs only about twelve bucks.- The repair takes only about an hour. Most of that time is really just waiting around ... ten minutes after one step, twenty minutes after another, and fifteen minutes after a third.- It works at least some of the time.- The repair seems to last. (The repair that I did ten years ago is still fine, even though the car isn't garage-kept and has been driven 150,000 miles in all sorts of weather. The jury's still out on the recent repair, but I have high hopes.)Cons:- It doesn't always work -- and even when it does, the repair isn't totally invisible.- The directions could be clearer.With improved directions (including color photos of the various steps) I would have given this five out of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth wasting money on....","review":"This was a waste of money, after reading and re-reading the instructions and thewn having my wife read and re-read the instructions we tried to implement the fix, we had the vehicle in a shaded area, followed the instruction sheet step-by-step, after the appropriate time we put the vehicle in the sunlight for the recommended timeframe and still it did not adequately fill the star in the windshield, I recommend that you just take it to the repair shop and let them repair it professionally...."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I was looking for vampire movies and got this one.

If you want the BEST AND ONLY TOSCA GET THE KARAJAN VERSION WITH PRICE, TADDEI AND DI STAFANO! Price sounds like a proud woman, and Di Stafano sounds incredible. Taddei will sind chills upon you as Scarpia. This is the best version, NOT the Callas one. I don't know why so many people like it. It has nothing. The orchestra you can hardly enjoy.

He's a guilty man who deserves to be killed. There's a reason for the \\"questo e il bacio di Tosca!\\". I'm a big opera fan... this is a good recording of Tosca. Maria Callas does a good job here as Tosca. Tito Gobbi has great abilities of the villain Scarpia. He's good here but even better on the opera d'oro recording.

Don't think of it as a book just for children, it's overwhelmingly entertaining for adults as well. Tad Williams, in his special unique way, made his characters-- CATS! They speak, behave, and accomplish their goals as any cat would, not furry fuzballs with human attributes. Humans don't belong in this action filled quest to solve a mystery of a missing girl kitty that, our hero, a male cat, is desperate to find.

The mythology and the language are beautiful and thoroughly developed; instead of different nations of people we have different species providing contrasting cultures and rich worldbuilding. The book begins lightheartedly, if a bit more lyrical than you'd expect from a book with housecats on its cover. But then the story gradually travels, quest-like, into the heart of darkness. Every detail of creatures both strange and familiar is richly imagined, lending even the familiar ones a strange air.The animal perspective invites comparisons to Watership Down and the Redwall series, but a more apt comparison is Lord of the Rings. Sweeping and poetic, it's an epic which captures the mind as surely as Middle-earth ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than one might expect...","review":"This book was a delight. I was skeptical about reading a quest type story about cats, but I was shocked to find out that you forget about that after about 5 minutes into it and the concern about that aspect never returns. I quite enjoyed this story. It did not have a typical Williams ending, which I found myself a little bothered by, but other than that it was great.Tad Williams is my favorite author and I read all of his other books and avoided this one because of the subject matter. I am not a cat person! Finally, I decided to give it a whirl and you should too.

It's written in a way that makes a cat seem more of a different sort of intellectual being rather than a 4-legged human.

This was before I read Watership Down. But even then, I didn't find this book all that great. There are two parts that REALLY drag this book down. 1) the part where Fritty goes to that cat-mound-hell-underground place whatever. It reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Dante's Inferno. Too dark. Too depressing. Too boring. 2) The ending wa a BIG letdown. Fritty went all that way only to discover THIS! Sure it's a surprise ending, but it's the type of surprise ending that makes you sick. The way I felt after reading the last line in Orwell's 1984. Finally, let me ask you this: Which book sounds more interesting: Tailchaser's Song, where a male cat is trying to find his missing she-cat OR Watership Down, where some rabbits are trying to escape extinction both by man and their own kind. Read WATERSHIP DOWN by Richard Adams. THAT is a good animal-as-main-character book.

This is the adventure story that goes from Africa, to India, to Japan to Mexico and back.As the second in a series of three books, one could expect this to be a bridge between the first and last books. Nothing of the sort, this book is an accellerates and is worth the read on its own.Earlier I reviewed Quicksilver and found it good but a bit ponderous -- not the Confusion.

The book is a piece of baroque in need of major editing. While there are a few imaginative places scattered throughout, it lacks prolonged life overall. If you thought Quicksilver was a wonderful book, then you will enjoy the Confusion, I suppose. If reading Quicksilver was as much fun as walking knee deep through parasite infested muck, you won't find the traveling in The Confusion any easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, ambitious and disappointing","review":"I am intriqued by thick books. That said this is, like the first in the proposed trilogy, terribly overwritten. Half as long and it would have been a much better reading experience. Stephenson digress to the point of becoming annoying. Much of these digressions are completely irrelevant. Part Sci-fi, part mystery, part historical - the author seemed unable to make up his mind and that ruined the experience. Bigger is just not better in this case, in fact it is to the detriment of the work. Better, more thorough editing is needed. Stephenson is trying too hard to impress with his ability to write, and write, and write - but the result is a lot of words, but not nearly enough substance. Plotting is all over the place, the characters are cardboard and pedestrian, and trying to pretend his characters are better prognosticators of future technological developments than Nostradamus is just too much to accept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get back to the good stuff","review":"I genuinely hope Neal Reads this......Look, it's simple, MORE SNOW CRASH.end of comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through it","review":"I'm sorry, I just couldn't stay awake reading this thing.

He 'hits' the HMO debacle right on the head, and his discussion of his mother's experience with and subsequent death due to HMO 'mangled care' will certainly hit a resonant chord with many. Unfortunately, his bias towards 'traditional' medicine and the medical establishment is obvious in his discussion of everything from chiropractic care to therapeutic touch. Chiropractors are little more than cheats and charletans, according to Whitlock and his proof that therapeutic touch is bogus? - a ninth grade science fair project. I doubt that had a science fair project had positive results, it would have been cited as proof that an alternative modality works.

While it does give accounts of horrible sexual crimes and murders by a completely unrepetent monster, the book lacks many elements of Ann Rule's better works: intricate courtroom drama, in-depth analysis of the criminal's background, and detailed chronology of the police/forensic work done in proving the criminal's guilt. I suppose all this is unsurprising since 'The I-5 Killer' is only about half the length of Ann Rule's best works (eg, 'The Stranger Beside Me').Bottom line: certainly very readable and credible, but Ann Rule can and has done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"C","review":"As I recall this book, the author jumps from one situation to another only to pick up the original situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Less is more\\"--or it would be in Rule's books","review":"Rule's expertise; her experience; her knowledge and research about this book (the subject) and any book I've ever read by her seems almost flawless.

But it does not.THE PROBLEM: Rule's problem is flooding the readers with details that get in the way of the narrative; details that mean nothing; that makes her books so long one can become lost. I don't question the factual nature of these mundane, boring facts, for Rule is accurate; as far as I know no author is more factual.The book needs 60 pages edited out. Like all of her books, it is 20% too long because of the boring details.For readers of Rule, it would be wonderful if she decided that sometimes, less (really) is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inner Workings of a serial murderer","review":"As a psychology student (and a campus police officer), I was very intrigued/and numbed at the way Ann went into detail into the mind of Randall Woodfield (the killer).

It has been talked about for decades by sociologists that should a disaster of this magnatude happen, cults of all types would rise up around the world. The Ninth Order is as despicable as Sam Hartline, only more of them. And the surprising discovery that Ben makes concerning Sister Voleta is enough to have your eyes popping out and re-reading it to see if what you thought you read was really that. This is also another great example of how each installment of the Ashes series is a book unto itself, but a part of the whole story. Sit down, strap yourself in, and get ready for a wild ride.

Orchestra and singers ring out every note with clarity and deep, serious meaning. Christa Ludwig is the best Leonore I've heard: luminously sweet, sad and strong. She soars on her high notes with flawless ease. It's really important to me that the voices of Leonore and Marzelline be distinctive from one another, so Ludwig's golden-deep tone and amazing range are the perfect counterpart for the lighter soprano. Vickers is Ludwig's perfect Florestan, with a dark, metallic tenor... capable of expressing such lyrical suffering. The tempo of their reunion duet at first seemed to me a little slow for the ecstatic moment but it ends up being overwhelmingly emotional and powerful; as is the entire opera. All the soloists are sure of their characters and their notes. Berry and Frick are perfect in their roles. And the chorus is brilliant. I can't stop listening to the atmospheric, gripping prison act! A really majestic recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on first launch","review":"I bought this rocket thinking that it would be a high quality Estes rocket, however, I was very disappointed when a few of the fins ripped off on the first launch attempt.

In fact, Mr. George sued the two Fail-Safe authors (Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler) for plagiarism and ultimately received an out-of-court settlement. Red Alert was the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", and Fail-Safe has seen more than one screen adaptation.I like Fail-Safe very much; it's smart, well-written, and engaging. It's definitely worth your time if you're a fan of Cold War stories. However, between the two books, I prefer George's Red Alert. It's more of a thriller and moves at a faster pace. I found the characters to be richer and there's certainly more action in Red Alert.

She takes gasps all the time and does not perfectly finish a sentence (listen to \\"e in cielo\\").And it is a pity if you're going to buy La Boheme (one of my most beloved operas) and not have one of the best recordings (allthough here Di Stefano and Moffo are very good,thus the 2stars). My favourite recording is the one with Renata Tebaldi and Carlo Bergonzi but there are other ones also quite good (though not equally good to the Tebaldi set).Take my advice, don't choose for Callas as Mimi, YOU'LL BE SORRY!If you really want to FEEL PUCCINI (and we know that Puccini is all about feelings) buy the Tebaldi edition or another one!NOT CALLAS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get less than you pay for","review":"Easy enough to assemble..

Other than that, I agree with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not Tantra, It's A Distorted View, Dysfunctional","review":"People like Judy Kuriansky, Margot Anand and all the various fakers who claim some affinity for Tantra have distorted it totally........Why??? Because books and schools that teach SEX make alot of money.They have taken something beautiful and turned it into trash. I know, I studied the same distorted teachings before I found out how off the mark it was. These people manipulate lonely people for money.Tantra is a path to walk, not about sexuality, except about uniting the male-female within, or the yin-yang, dark-light, etc.It's about becoming a whole person and none of these people do anything but distort Tantra to make money off it selling SEX!!Read here if you want more information about healthy Tantra:http://anunda.com/tantra/sacred-tantra.htm"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Work, Big Rip Off","review":"I had to be negative, but I bought this book hoping it would have more information on H & M work than accessible on the net, but I was really disappointed in the quality and most importantly value for money considering it is only a paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"FERRY AND The High Pitch Reverb","review":"Ferry Corsten is one of the best DJ's on the planet. Definately in the top 10 and this album proves why.Look 4 stars is not bad, its just that similar to his creamfields release, he can be a 'tad' inconsistent.Ferry is a very flexibly minded DJ and producer. He likes too much music, and his style reflects that. For Purists looking for 'electronic trance' you may find yourself a little bit fustrated (at first)....but when you appreciate this album for what is it. You'll see love. You'll see Ferry. And above all, you'll see talent.Listen to Galaxia track 6 - this song is like a stream of consciousness. Why many of us fell in love with trance in the first place.-Stef"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not Ferry , this is Not Trance","review":"I dont know what is wrong with all you people. This CD is Nothing like Ferry Corsten, and it is NOT Trance music! I guess i have different values for Trance, and I always looked up to Ferry's unique nice melodic Trance sounds which is not present on this CD. Sweet SOrrow, I love you, Ligaya, now those were the true sounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I love this album, Ferry covers a wide range of different styles within electronic music, moving from downtempo to breakbeats, into progressive trance and bumping near-house. Favorites are \\"L.E.F.\\", \\"Fire\\", and \\"Forever\\" on the uptempo side and \\"Down on Love\\" and \\"Into the Dark\\" for a little more laid back grooves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good? Yes. All new? No.","review":"Ok, I agree, Galaxia is a great song. One of my all time trance favorites. But it's not new... It's been around for SIX YEARS. (Originally made by Ferry under the alias Moonman)I appreciate the fact that now it's more widely available, but I would've rather bought a single with the original version and the rework.Without Galaxia, it would still be an ok album, (but just that) being held by \\"Forever\\", \\"Are You Ready\\", \\"Fire\\", and \\"Junk\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferry!!!","review":"Ferry has some great vocal trance tracks that are reminiscent of 80's beats and somewhat dissonant. For those who are looking for something very trance-y, I wouldn't recommend this because it is geared towards a wider audience and is more like pop trance (similar to Oakenfold's CD \\"A Lively Mind\\"). If you like vocal trance though, this is an absolute must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, rugged, basic phone","review":"I've had this phone for a week. It's extremely sturdy, and I look forward to having a phone that doesn't require white-glove treatment while I'm biking, hiking, or out in the rain. The interface is Verizon's basic cheesy design they force onto all their phones--functional but nothing exciting. The reception is pretty good--roughly as good as the Motorola E815 it replaced. It has other features you'd expect from Casio--a stopwatch, countdown timer, and flashlight. If you want to watch TV on your phone, or want a phone that takes photos as good as a real camera, it's a bad choice. But if you want better than a typical fragile phone that breaks if you drop it or take it skiing or kayaking, this is the perfect choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling 9-1-1 Sounds an Alarm On This Phone","review":"Whenever you call 9-1-1 on this phone, it sounds a really loud alarm. This \\"feature\\" can not be disabled.If you are calling because someone is breaking into your house, the alarm will announce to the thief where in the house you are hiding.Aside from that the phone is great. But the 9-1-1 alarm is a deal breaker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I had this phone for about 3 days and the flash light froze. I had to take the battery off to fix this. Only for it to freeze again after trying the flashlight for yet a second time. It automatically deleted a couple of my contacts. I took it back & let Verizon replace it with the same model only for the second model to not recieve all of my text msges & text pics. When I used blue tooth or a regular headphone my callers were unable to hear me. The camera is aweful. I understand that this is a phone good for durability & the bells & whistles aren't suppose to be great but the basics should at least work. I exchanged it for the chocolate LG 8550. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last !","review":"... It's the Elgar Sea Pictures part I want to talk about here ! I've been looking for this recording for a long time, but it was discontinued I was told. This is just a great masterpiece magnificently interpretated by Janet Baker, who devoted part of her carreer to make English Music better known. And Coupled with Dupré, you have to buy it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Have Listened to the Reviews","review":"This was a christmas gift for my two kids. We've spent more time trying to fix it than they have been playing it. It's a nuisance. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. I read the negative reviews and bought it anyway. HUGE MISTAKE! What a waste of money. We got it working and while the kids are playing it, it stops working again. Fixing this game is not how I want to be spending my time. And the kids do like it and wait impatiently to play while we are trying to get it to work. Just buy the books and spend your time reading to them and asking fun questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"good toy","review":"I gave this toy to my 4 1/2 year old daughter and was able to program the the controller for our family room and rec room dvd players in about 15 minutes, without any difficulty. I played with my daughter, who caught on very quickly. I think its a great tool for comprehension skills. I asked my daughter questions about the story the next day, and she remembered various story details, such as what color the beasts eyes were. I have since bought \\"Miss Spiders Tea Party.\\" Note: I did give same toy to my nephew and his dad has had a hard time programming the controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The system was easy to set up and seemed to be working fine UNTIL my daughter needed to use the Page Forward button. In the Read On My Own option, she is unable to page forward and it stops the DVD which makes this feature useless. In the Read & Play mode, she is unable to advance past the first play section because the page forward button will not advance to the next section which makes this feature useless past the first play section. I did replace the batteries in the controller and the \\"Test Your Controller\\" confirmed that set up had been performed correctly. I called Fisher-Price consumer affairs and they are sending me a replacement controller free of charge. We'll see what the second time around brings. Overall, this has been a very disappointing gift for our daughter. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was.","review":"My four year old loves to read and is getting interested in game systems used on the t.v. I thought this would be an ideal mix but was very disappointed. First I had a lot of trouble getting the system programed to my DVD player. However, I talked with two different people on the Fisher-Price hotline who were very helpful. Also the wait to speak to someone was not very long. My son loved the game but the biggest draw back was the controller HAS to be pointed straight at the DVD for the system to work. For older children this might be ok but it was very hard for my son, I ended up being the one to push the button he wanted pushed. This was not fun. We have now taken the game back and gotten a different system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected quality","review":"Before buying this item I read a customer review such as this. It said don't buy it as it is a piece of junk. I felt this was just a one in a million ''piece of junk'' as the quality was pretty much guaranteed. NOt so. I sent this to my little grandaughter and, ''guess what''. It didn't work!! Her father spent many hours trying to talk to ''a person''. He was assured that a new one would be sent. It has yet to arrive. Don't buy this ''piece of ----''."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karen/Joe","review":"My sister bought this for our twins at our request for Christmas. We took two back that were defective and after waiting in line and trying to set up with two different DVD players in our house, gave up and would not recommend wasting the money on or trips to anyone! Our children were disappointed as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much work to set up","review":"I purchased this product and tried setting it up at least 10 different times using different ways. I received the replacement which looked like it was going to work but never did. Im sure its wonderful if it worked but way too much of a hassle for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooooow going","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that it was a gift for my 3 year old son. The age range on the box says \\"3-7 years old\\". I think an older child might do better with it than my impatient three year old.For starters, my husband, who is a computer programmer, took over 2 hours to get it to work. Maybe this had something to do with our particular DVD player, but it's not that old of a model.Secondly, I find it to be very slow. You can't press a button until the question is COMPLETELY finished. And then it's like, PRESS...wait, wait, wait...then the screen shows your selections...wait, wait...\\"You're right!\\" It takes forever to play the games. My son likes pushing the buttons well enough, but he's used to much more immediate gratification.Once again, this might work out better for an older child, but I wouldn't buy it for a little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get the thing to work!","review":"I never got a chance to see this toy in action as we couldn't even get the thing programmed.. My 4 yr old got it from grandma for xmas and we tried to get it to work for an hour before giving up - tried all 3 methods (including the punch a code method) and still it wouldn't work.. I'm a software engineer so I'm not exactly stupid when it comes to electronics. We finally put it back in the package and took the $10 hit in price reduction (no gift receipt) when we returned it for a Leapster. My son loves his Leapster, as a side note.. It's all the things this Read with me DVD wouldn't have been - easy to use, portable, etc. Save your money or spend a little more and get one of the other educational electronic products on the market that don't require a DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"My son got this gift for Christmas and we were very dissapointed to find out (after opening everything) that it would not work with our DVD system We have a Bose Lifestyle system which uses radio waves for the remote so there was no way to program the read with me system. After trying all three methods, we had to call the company and ship everything back to them to get our money back since the products were opened and the store would not return them. No where does it tell you this will not work with certain DVD players which is very important to the consumer. We were really looking forward to using this product with our son and he was dissapointed when we spent an hour trying to program it only to tell him it did not work and he would have to get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Programming is terrible","review":"This is one of the most frustrating toys to set up I have ever used. After getting the controller out of the box and watching the DVD setup, I tried to program the controller using method #1. Placing the DVD remote and the controller on a flat surface as instructed didn't work, you actually have to make sure both of the remote's eye and the controller eye are EXACTLY in front of each other. I must have cycled though the set up process 12 times before I almost threw the thing out of the window. My dvd player isn't that old (1year) so I know that it's not a matter of my DVD player being too old. I tried method #2 and #3, with no avail. Just the simple fact that there are three different methods you can use to set up the controller should tell you something. I finally decited to take it back. This toy is NOT worth the hasstle of trying to set it up, and could cause some major frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before buying!","review":"I had difficulty setting up the system. The directions for the set up were very easy to follow, but either my remote or the Read with Me DVD remote was not picking up the proper signals, and it took about 6 attempts to finally get it all programmed. Once we finally got it working, the Read with Me DVD remote did not work well (had to push buttons several times to get the desired action) and the CD skipped or repeated questions. Very frustrating! However, my three year old son did enjoy watching the story being told on TV. He just couldn't operate the remote very well...not because he didn't understand but because of the poor quality of the product. I think it is a piece of junk and will not buy more videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you needed to know before you went to college.","review":"I got this book as a gift from my mother. I read it and it was amazing. I have been to Oxford on many occasions for many visits and such, but there was a ton of information that this book had that the average visitor would not know. It was fully of suggestions, bits of history, and unique places to go to while you were at school at Ole Miss. I am grateful for guides like these that will steer other freshman in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm finally organized!","review":"For the most part, this scanner works great. It will occasionally jam on a receipt that is not smooth on the edges, and sometimes does pull in more than one page if scanning multiple pages, but these are minor problems that will happen on any sheetfed machine. I love how QUICKLY it scans everything, and how compact it is when closed. You don't have to wait for it to warm up, you open it up and it is ready to use. I've been using it in combination with ReceiptWallet and DocumentWallet for the Mac, and I am finally rid of all of my paper clutter."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I never looked back...","review":"This product was something that I had wanted to try and that I had really believed in, but was unsure of. It was expensive, and I wasn't convinced I would use it enough, or that it would do all it said. I bought it after installing Devon Think Pro, and the two products work wonderfully well together.Other reviews mention slow OCR, but I have frankly had great luck with the OCR. We recently got married and I took all contracts, pictures, diagrams, napkins, ideas, etc. and scanned them in. When I needed to reference something, I just typed in a quick search term and jumped right to all of the places it occurred in my docs. Now all of my bills, invoices, receipts, ideas, etc. wind up in there. Devon Think allows you to also create your own notes, docs, and link to other files of many different formats, so that you can easily bridge the electronic and printed world.It is easily the best money I have spent on organizing my life; as essential as a hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scansnap S500M","review":"Back in the PC days, there was a product called a Visioneer scanner. It's come back now, but alas, it still does not work with a Mac. That is why I was interested in this product, even though the price is much higher than the original Visioneer.The Scansnap turned out to be worth every penny. It is fast and accurate, and the included Adobe Acrobat works extremely well with it. The ability to scan both sides simultaneously really is an advantage.There is an occasional glitch when it feeds 2 pages at a time, but the software allows easy recovery, either during or after the scan. This product is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing--- And surprisingly a page turner!","review":"I am completely fascinated with the wives of Henry VIII, and I found this book to be especially intriguing. It is definitely a book you have to tackle (when I first started to read it I planned on reading it in 2 weeks.... I read it in a month) but this book actually pulls you in. It has as much of a storyline as a novel, yet it's a non-fiction book! This book included many interesting facts, and sited all the references, which was wonderful. The pictures added a lot to the stories. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in the complicated and fascinating lives of the English monarchy during the reign of Henry VIII, or anyone who wants to be engrossed in story of intrigue, royal formalities and the part women played in a intricate royal court."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the joint biographies of Henry's wives","review":"Excellent biography of the famous six wives of Henry VIII. I liked the Alison Weir book very much as well, but this is the best of the three recent books on the subject (the third, by David Starkey, is a disappointment -- short on detail, long on irritating editorial comments). If you are going to buy one book on the six wives, this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight to 6 unique women","review":"As a beginner to the life of Henry the VIII this book gave me an excellent insight to his 6 extrordinary wives. It was interesting to see how these very different women coped with everyday life in the court of Henry not to mention the trials of being Queen. Ms Frasier does an excellent job of bringing the Queens to life in an easy to read format. A great choice for anyone interested in this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is an excellent source for historians, for Fraser provides a colorful, accurate, entertaining look at the six women who helped make British history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings History Back To Life","review":"For those who say history is boring. Better than reading a novel, with real characters sometimes going beyond the imaginary. An amazing study of the six wives, and the power crazed king they called husband. Used every means imaginable to justify ridding himself of one wife, to marry another. Even to the point of falsely accusing one of commiting incest with her own brother (Anne Boleyn), and having her beheaded. A powerful study of the British monarchy, and one of its most shameful periods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less the 4 uses.","review":"I was very careful when I used this mattress. On the 4 opportunity to use it, It went flat. Where the plastic is welded for the internal baffles, it separated and left a hole, 1/16th of an inch. The leak in the second mattress was undetectable. Research at the Intex site, proved it has a very weak warranty policy. We bought a different brand this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intex 2-in-1 Airbed with Zipper Queen","review":"Good product, easy to use. Excellent. Had it for three years and used it for four times.

Luckily customer service sent another one to me!! But not only it was not double but it also went flat soon after! It could have been a great product if it wasn't going flat all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"World History required reading!","review":"This is a wonderfully detailed accounting of World War I that anyone who has even the most remote interest in the subject should read. You will get a better and more complete knowledge of the causes and leadership of the war than you could have ever desired. It gives a great depiction of the strategy and tactics of the war, which I highly enjoyed. It also gives an objective account of all the decisions made. The only possible downside is the large amount of names thrown at you, which some people may like, however. All in all, a must read for anyone who likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Companions needed","review":"One of the most detailed book about war, it brings vivid image to the readers and brings them to the first historical month of the WWI. With smartly chosen words, Barbara Tuchman succeded in creating a masterpiece. Unfortunately, for the non-English native speakers...this book is too complicated. If there is no other choice than to read this book, be sure to buy its companions: a dictionary and a thesaurus."},{"rating":"2","title":"History can be fun and instructive","review":"Whoa! I loved this book. I like Keegan's books, too. It's hard to say which is best. Tuchman describes a lot of personalites. Keegan has more relevant facts and explore strategies better. I read both auhors will equal fervor. I plan to read her \\"Stillwell and the American Experience in China\\".I've lent this book to several other non-history buffs and they can't get past page 50. Obvioulsy they will not be going to Amazon and entering a 1 star rating!You should love history before opening the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst History Book I've Ever Read","review":"I am an avid history buff and have read many books on World War II, the Civil War, and the Revolutionary War. This is the first book I attempted to read that covered World War I and I was beyond disappointed. Barbara Tuchman actually succeeds in turning a non-fiction into what seems like fiction by making events way too dramatic and focusing on unimportant dialogue. In what was the worst omission of history I've ever seen, she actually only dedicates 3 pages to the murder of Archduke Ferdinand, which was the even that set off the war. She gives no history of the tension between Serbia and Austria. In fact, this book is very lacking in history in general and way too abundant in useless drama. For true history buffs, this book is a waste of time. For people looking for the cheesy Hollywood version of World War I, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Now, I must admit that I'm not a hard-core history buff. I'm usually knee-deep in novels or biographies. So, when I read all the reviews about how this book flowed like a novel...or that readers just couldn't put the book down, I thought it would be perfect. My knowledge of WWI was limited to everything that I hadn't forgotten from High School History classes (which wasn't much), and I was eager fill this gap in my knowledge-base.Well... I have to warn potential readers that this book definitely doesn't flow with excitement. I fear that many of these reviews are from readers that are simply proud of the fact that they have read an \\"intellectual\\" book.If any readers have any other suggestions on a history of WWI, I would be grateful. Perhaps a narrative?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Propaganda","review":"This book is little more than recycled propaganda from about 1915.But it is viciously anti-German and that is enough to make it a \\"classic\\".Truly one of the great hate books of all time.Germanophobia sells,always has and probably always will.Something for you aspiring historians to keep in mind.If you want to know how WWI really started,read Harry Elmer Barnes or Sidney Fay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophisticated Propaganda and Distortion","review":"I agree with the many other reviewers here who cite this biased work as slanted propaganda. While the author clearly has a degree of crafty writing skills - such are certainly applied here in a biased manner -which provides an end product of twisted versions of events during World War I. Apparently done so for the sensationalistic impact of storytelling from the British perspective. I would respectfully request you look elsewhere for a more realistic and truthful account of the war. This book is not only inaccurate but it is insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading everywhere in the world","review":"Sadly, good books covering World War I are terribly hard to come by. You'd think that, by now, there would be scads of them, but the reality is that this book is truly a diamond in the rough. It is nothing short of amazing how Tuchman guides the reader through such an immense amount of detailed information about the war, and in such a relatively short volume. If it is true that we are doomed to repeat the past if we fail to understand it, then this is one book that everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns of August: compelling read","review":"Tuchman is \\"a writer of wit and grace\\" according to the New York Times. \\"She has a sardonic sense of humor and an original mind.\\" I found her book about how WWI evolved, both compelling and repulsive. I gulped it in, as though inhaling halting breaths, engrossed in the horrific sadness of it all, putting the book down with a heavy and ponderous sigh, then picking it up again, needing to learn more. Tuchman's writing flows gracefully and she knows just how much detail to bring into this sweeping tale of a \\"tragedy of errors\\". Newsweek said it best, I think: \\"Tuchman is able to evoke both the enormous pattern of the tragedy and the minutiae which make it human\\" in what must surely be one of history's saddest moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read.","review":"This book is a very in depth book on the lead up to and first month of the first world war, well researched so well you can almost imagine being there. If it wasn't so serious it would be amusing when you read about the incompetence, ego's, petty squabbling, dated tatics, failure to see the obvious the list goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a book full of detail, but never ever boring. My only recommendation besides \\"read it now\\" would be that the reader already have some minimal background about the start of WWI or military philosophy/strategy. Otherwise, it can get overwhelming trying to figure out who some of these people (e.g., Clausewitz) are. Nevertheless, an excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Portrait of WWI","review":"This book is dull & drags. The author creates no dramatic tension or excitement. Its a few hundred pages of mainly dreary inconsequential facts with an occasional page or two of something you actually want to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst summer reading I ever had","review":"I didn't even bother to finish this book because, although i tried to read it and fell asleep on pretty much every other page, the writing was convoluted and stuffy, the \\"action\\" (was there any?) was slow, and I just couldn't bring myself to care about anything this author had to say. A unanimous vote by the AP Euro class I was forced to \\"read\\" this for took the book off the reading list for next year's class...although we would have loved to make the following classes suffer the same way we did, we simply could not bring ourselves to stuff this ridiculous book down any other poor students' throats.Mr. M......You were a cool teacher, but I don't know if I can ever forgive you for letting this haunt my entire summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable as ever","review":"Like she always did Barbara Tuchman again succeeds in bringing history alive. Combined with craftmanship that's all a reader really wants"},{"rating":"2","title":"WW1","review":"Extreamly well written. One of the best books on the orgins of the war. I didn't know that Germany prior to WW1 was already thinging of expanding it borders. This is way before Hitler was trying to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns of August - Kindle Version","review":"The book is fantastic. If you have already read World War I books this is a great supplement. It illuminates many of the reasons and rationale for the inception of the war. She goes into wonderful details about the cast of characters on all sides of the war. Love it.The only bad part about this is that the Kindle version SUCKS! It's difficult to refer to maps or look at pictures, and I think that, until they get it fixed, I'm not going buy any history books for my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - one of the best on WW1","review":"This is one of the best books available on WW1 in terms of readability"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing piece of writing","review":"This book, more than any I have read, captures both the reality and the mentality of the Great War. Not only that, but it so vividly argues for the War's importance to the modern sensibility that it hardly seems an arguement at all. If you are even remotely interested in the War or just in 20th Century studies, this is a must read. It is difficult for me to imagine anyone living today in Western society that could not benefit from the reading of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good pick","review":"I bought this for an elderly friend, who loves military history. It is a very good book with a lot a research behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns of August","review":"This is a fascinating account of how a major event (WW I) moved tragically forward, when, with some careful thought and analysis, it could have been avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"A really great book that is not only a nice read but really explains the events leading up to the Great War. Unlike most modern books on the subject, Ms.Tuchman goes into great detail on the various leaders and politics behind WWI and not the experiences of the common soldier. The descriptions of the individuals and situations are vivid and outstanding- and also tragic. I hope they are making students read this in history class as its a great history of WWI and the way of war/politics in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional portrayal of the events and the conduct of WWI.","review":"Too much detail on the specific actions of each combatants military units in the war. Gets difficult to follow. Would have preferred more emphasis on a macro view of the causes and/or a micro view of the average citizens life at home or in the trenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"For the history buff, this encapsulates the onset of World War One. One of many books written about this slaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara Tuchman is a marvelous writer!","review":"This book is definitive in it's details yet reads like a novel. It's amazing the things we do not know about world shattering events!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History","review":"Isn't it amazing to see how a family feud can take so many lives. That's the run up to WW1, a family feud between royal families, among other things of course. There is a lot to digest in this reading and I'm taking it slow. It's an excellent book and one that should serve a wake-up call to why wars start. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for a Reason","review":"There is absolutely a reason for this book to be regarded as a classic. Actually, there are lots of reasons. Tuchman's writing is informative, yet intimate. She tells you what you need to know to understand the topic at hand then goes on to supply more information that you didn't need but adds to your appreciation. All this without the book ever bogging down, unlike the war. Possibly, a big part of this is the topic she chose to cover from WWI, the first month. That was when armies marched, counter-marched and fought instead of slogging through mud for years.Tuchman covers the cuases for war in ways as good as any I've read. It's a hard topic, but she addresses it very well. Every topic in the book is covered well.This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Great War. It's also a must read to get some understanding of how the folly of man makes war more horrofic, if that's possible. It's just a good read if you're looking for something for the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a Read","review":"The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman gives an excellent overview of the first month of World War I. It is very well organized, as the book starts out with the causes of the war, then moves on to the war plans of each individual country, then explains the actions of each government during the outbreak of war and the finally on to the military campaigns. While the book does go over the Russian invasion of East Prussia, the book mostly talks about the German advance through Belgium and into France, up to the First Battle of the Marne, where the book ends.I personally find the first month of the war to be the most interesting, and I feel as though I learned a lot from this book. Tuchman writes in a style which makes it easy to read, and grabs your attention. I didn't have a hard time moving through this book. I recommend it to anyone with interest in the First World War, an often overlooked, but very important conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly reccommended!","review":"Callas and Puccini!

Here Callas sounds so vulnerable, childlike and sweet... I was totally perplexed... But she developed an entirely different sound for the older Butterfly, thus her reaction to Pinkerton's betrayal makes sense... Just for the words \\"Guardami! Amore addio!\\" I could die! To comprehend what this miracle of a voice could do compare her Medea (Dark, black, brooding, knowing) to this Butterfly. (Innocent, sweet, vulnerable and tender) Gedda is sensational as Pinkerton (Love him as Don José and Werther as well). A must buy for every fan of great singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave of the many I have","review":"This is the deepest, most meaningful and sublime Butterfly on disc. Capturing Callas in her best and most intense years it represents Puccini at his very best without faked verismo tears or dumb \\"drama\\". Callas is, though moving, a thoughtful, meaningful Butterfly, not a stupid kid. Gedda is nice, I would have preferred di Stefano though who sounds amazing on the recording with the equally stunning de los Angeles. A triumph on all accounts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Callas and Gedda SHINE!","review":"I'm so grateful that Callas and Gedda recorded this....

The next time I walked to close the fridge and bumped the fridge, the timer once more tumbled down for its last functional seconds before the screen went permanently blank.

Max is a toddler 2-3 years old, who only says one to two word phrases, he disobeys his 7 year old sister repeatedly, partakes in mischievous behavior and sends the message to the audience that this behavior is appropriate. My 2 year old watched one episode and immediately starting acting defiant and mischievous! This show is mind numbingly repetitive, too! Every single episode consists of Max being mischievous and Ruby REPEATEDLY trying to get him to do the right thing. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!I regret downloading it!

Ruby's the older sibling. She tries to keep the devious Max in check. Most of the episodes highlight their daily interactions with Max's warnings/ideas are ignored until the end when Ruby has an epiphany and finally \\"gets it.\\" Of course, the episode ends zooming in toward Max's face with a smirk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood favorite in cartoon form!","review":"I loved the Morris the Bunny stories as a child. My two boys, ages 5 and 2, started watching this show after I read them \\"Morris and the Disappearing Bag\\" - when they saw the bunnies scroll across our Amazon prime screen, they wanted to watch it. There are three mini-episodes per show, they are perfect for giving me that half hour to clean up or cook. I love that the show incorporates learning in a sneaky way: it always encourages my boys to do something creative like draw a picture or start a leaf book. Great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"Great stories, I wish I had as much patience with my daughter as Ruby has with Max! We have great conversations about the story lines and life lessons contained and I frequently think of how Ruby is so patient when I find myself getting aggrivated, so maybe this is as good for me as my daughter!Just wonder where the parents are, I really don't think a 7 year old is head of the house material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This mug is very stylish and cute!!

It was strictly a revenge/redemption story with no supernatural aspects, but it was quite good. Better than Skin Medicine in my opinion (though honestly, with a little work, the two books could have been merged). Don't worry, though, there are plenty of Curran-style bad guys doing horrible things, and plenty of on-screen violence.

For the outlets that I use a lot, I pushed them in about 3/4 of the way so that she can't get them out, but I can get them out easily.

It could be an outlet issue as well. For the most part they stay in place and do their job.

For me, these plugs are somewhat difficult to get out but i can still do it without the aid of a tool other than my hands/fingernails. For now, while my daughter is still very young, these will work but as she gets older I imagine she will be able to figure out how to pull these out.

They are not very easy to pull out. I give them four stars because I wish that they were a little harder to get out.

I've never read a history book so well-written, that was also intended for a student learner, and doesn't talk down to the reader or pontificate to make the writer sound more intelligent.

This recording is THE STANDARD BY WHICH ALL OTHER TRISTANS FOR ALL TIME WILL BE JUDGED. Furtwangler creates a mystical magical world in which the listener has an experience of tranfiguration. Yes, this is religious language, but it accurately describes the extraordinary powers of this recording. Beyond the vocal maturity of Flagstad and Suthaus at the time of the recording, their singing is nothing less than awe inspiring. Flagstad at the end of her glorious career is nevertheless unmatched, and puts out her most melancholy Isolde. Suthaus' great asset, in contrast to a Windgassen, Vickers or even Melchior is a dark timber to his Heldentenor, which gives his Tristan a particularly tragic tone. His Third Act delirium is unrivalled and gut wrenching. The chemistry between the two, along with the supporting cast, orchestra and chorus is all due to the magic worked by Wilhelm Furtwangler.

Instead, Universal Studios rejected the horror icon in favor of Lon Chaney Jr. - a major blunder that seriously damages a potentially fine film. Except for the Wolf Man, Chaney's limited talents were evident in his ineffectual portrayals of the Mummy and Frankenstein's monster. As Count Alucard/Dracula, Chaney lacks the charismatic evil and strong presence that Lugosi brought to the role. Director Robert Siodmak has created a moody, atmospheric chiller set in the Deep South, yet his admirable efforts are all but ruined by Chaney's miscasting. It's a shame, because \\"Son of Dracula\\" was intended to be a cut above most of Universal's horror programmers. Nevertheless, the film is worth a look for its effective supporting cast and production design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good script, bad acting","review":"The idea of a sequel to \\"Dracula\\" was a good one, and the script which resulted is also quite good. The problem with this film lies in the casting. When Bela Lugosi made the original, he set a very high standard. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional Chaney simply lacks the ability to portray his character. He sounds as if he is reading his dialogue from cue cards, showing his lack of depth at every turn. Universal must have thought so as well, as this was Chaney's only outing as Dracula (John Carradine played the role in succeeding films). In short, a good script is wasted on the untalented Chaney. Stick with the original - Lugosi was the only real Dracula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meatier Siodmak","review":"This is a little more meatier Dracula film that many of the \\"40,\\" Universal films.

Thus setting up the \\"undead\\" scenario for her. Samuel S. Hinds and Frank Craven are in supporting roles.Now, when are these films going to be shown on any cable outlet channel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"The plot (vampire comes to American South), while unusual, does not make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the film. Lon Chaney phones in his performance in a bland, vanilla tone and frankly didn't scare me a bit. I was more interested in Dr. Brewster (Frank Craven) as a character, because at least he seemed to care about what was going on. Robert Paige's \\"am I crazy?\\" histrionics (as Kay's jilted fiancee, Frank) also brought some interest to what was otherwise a ho-hum kind of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Lon Chaney is great as Dracula!

First, you write about startling things or things that other people normally might not notice. Second,you present a somewhat ordinary world but you do so in high-flown prose that---because of the quality of the writing---carries the reader along no matter what. This journalistic travel book seems one that a publisher might have picked up ONLY because the writer is well known. It is neither well written nor particularly acute in what it sees and reports. Too often there is a grim habit of stereotype, and always there is a languid sense of a prose style that suggests little more than some jottings in a loose-leaf along the way.

(Richter, Rubinstein, Pogorelich, Volodos etc)To me Hewitt belongs to the former. The elegance, fluency and subtlety of her playing are admirable enough, but that's all there is.

Michael's got to be spinning in his grave on that one). In that thick crop of talent, Isham's work hadn't yet distinguished itself. It was still top quality performing, but works like Vapor Drawings and Songs my Children Taught me revealed a capable artist still struggling for control, still over-concerned with style and instrumentation rather than the lyrical/emotional content.

You can use other remastering programs such as MAGIX to clean up the audio file and you use your computer's own burning program to create the CD. Sound quality with this product is as good as the original cassette. It does save as a WAV. file, though - separate free software needs to be downloaded to convert to MP3 - and WAV files are rather large. If you get an adapter (@ $8 at Radio Shack) you can import out of the headphone jack of a boom box or stereo so no need to have a tape deck.

If you want to transfer LPs, you need to dig out your receiver or amplifier with phono jack inputs, bring it to your computer work area, and then connect this product to your receiver or amplifier.

I know that there are other great Aidas in the market (Karajan, Solti and so on). I have this recording and I never bothered to listen to another one. I am not one of those huge Domingo fans.

All the others in the cast are in top shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, wonderful!!","review":"This recording is simply perfect. Muti feels Verdi so much. In great mainly in the liric moments.

I love discovering new book series!!!","review":"My brother told me about the 'Sharpe' series and so I read Sharpe's Tiger. AWESOME!!! From the first page, Bernard Cornwell paints the picture of what life was like for enlisted 'grunts' in 1799. You can almost feel the heat of the desert and feel the grime. Cornwell puts you in Sharpe's shoes. It's written so vividly that it's like you're right there. I'm glad that there are 20 books in the series. I'll be reading every one. I LOVE discovering authors that I haven't read that write this well.. READ IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History and Fiction Collide in a Good Read","review":"Sharpe's Tiger is the first opportunity I have had to read one of Bernard Cornwell's books. Right from the start I was captivated by a story from a time in history that was very foreign to me. I really appreciated the historical accuracy of story. Sharpe is a character that has depth and believable double standards, self preservation and national identity, struggling with the British Army but at the same time sensing a belonging. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"sharpes tiger","review":"For the Kindle edition: horrible transfer to electronic media, must be three or four typos per page.

I don't get it -- I read Cornwell's Agincourt right before this book, and they're almost identical books. Pretty much the same characters in the same situtation -- just 300 years apart. The same lead character, the same female companion, the same strong leader, the same completely evil villian.....it really lacks creativity for me. The good are completely good, and the evil are completely evil -- I've seen more balanced characters in a Steven King novel. On top of that, the coincidences in this book are outrageous. How many times can the hero and the villian happen to accidently run into each other all over India?I enjoy learning about the British army and their battles in India, but the writing seems very lazy and schlocky to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Sharpe without Harper","review":"I must admit that I love Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. The characters are always memorable, the story interesting(and based partly on fact), and the battle scenes very exciting. This isn't the first Sharpe book I've read, but it's the first in chronological order, and that made it even more of a pleasure to read. Richard Sharpe is only a private in his early 20's in this one, and his tough but likable personality and incredible bravery are fully intact, so you'll be cheering for Sharpe in no time. Obadiah Hakeswill, Sharpe's nastiest enemy, and one of Cornwell's best characters, plays a significant role in this book which makes it even more interesting. Just like the other Sharpe novels, as soon as you finish it you'll immediately want to read the next one. So be warned: Sharpe becomes an addiction very quickly. But hey, and addiction like this is a good thing, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it!","review":"Having seen the TV movies, I gave this a try. It was really good!

Instead I got simplistic adventures, stock characters and a dopey narrative full of spies and Tigers and prison escapes and implausible derring-do. This reminds me of the old Flashman series of books that I thought was so clever when I was a kid. But those were satire. Unless Sharpe's Tiger is meant to be Young Reader fiction or is a tongue-in-cheek satire I have to assume that the author is an overrated hack who can write decent dialog but is totally clueless when it comes to plot or character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Calling this book \\"A Life Stripped Bare\\" is an insult to the hundreds of thousands of people who lost literally everything to natural disasters in 2005.This is a pop media journalist's narration of his own bland foray into \\"living ethically.\\" There is not a single suggestion in the book that any moderately environmentally-aware person has not heard a dozen times; buy organic, local food; try to get rid of your car; don't eat meat; avoid chemicals.

A critic once sighed \\"Full of notes and empty of sense!\\" (On a soprano leggiero who tackled Elvira in \\"I puritani\\") True, no easy and light \\"beauty\\" here but MORE: an intelligent, brilliant portrait of a \\"stupid\\", \\"naive\\" character.

Then I watched the director's commentary. He took at least 15 minutes away from the movie. Most director's add to their movie when given a chance, not take away from it. The Director's Son created a disjointed, fragmentary movie very unlike the original in mood and plot.After waiting years for the DVD release of Erik the Viking, I was extremely disappointed and a little angry at the way they treated one of my favorite movies. I hope to see the Theatrical Release available some time in the near future, as I don't think I'll be watching this Director's Son's Cut again, and I certainly won't be sharing this version of the movie with friends and family as I had originally planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they do it?","review":"The director's Son is an idiot for messing up one of my all-time favourite movies. The re-arrangement of scenes means the story no longer flows. Changing the visit with Freya gives the impression that it was her words that had the biggest influence on Erik not the death of the failed rape victim. Some of the best scenes (Vikings about to kill each other with swords rather than drown for one) are cut completely and there is even a key scene when they are about to go over the edge of the world and the key characters lips are moving but the sound is cut. Dreadful shame!

At least you'll then have a durable copy that is the complete movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"First off, it's actually the director's son's cut. It is not as good as the original at all. They took out 23 minutes of footage, added bad sound effects, and the video quality was lacking. They sharpened some of the picture but didnt give it a very good transfer to dvd, so can easily see a lot of bluescreen effects. Dont waste your money on this, try to get the original instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it- a beautiful film","review":"I agree with most of what the others have said. In addition, this is a well-made film with a beautiful look to it. There's a real sense of wonder and lust for life conveyed by this movie. I can't believe this isn't on DVD. I read a review by Leonard Maltin which really shot 'Erik the Viking' down. What a clueless @#$&%!I really think that anyone who likes Monty Python skits and Holy Grail would enjoy it. Also, if you like the lush fantasy aesthetic of films like Baron Munchausen, you gotta see it.

Overall the movie is a big joke, but there are some seriously funny scenes in this movie that made it a classic for my friends and me.How deep is the ocean? Really deep usually.

I love Tim Robbins and the Monty Python group, and this flick was great in it's original 101 minute movie release. In this Director's Sons' Cut, it's now 79 minutes and most of the best one liners and running gags are gone. If you've never seen the original then you probably wouldn't mind all the cutting because it's still funny but if you've seen the full length version recently, you would know why so many are complaining.

What a hack job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Son is an Idiot","review":"Ive been waiting for many years for this movie to be re-released! And although Im happy to own it, I got SO mad while watching it! I used to have most the lines memorized, so although I cannot quote the full extent of the missing footage, it BOGGLES and enrages me as to why they removed some lines. Not only that, but the moron editor even muted a scene! I dont know what issues he had with the main female character, but they must have been severe.

This version is terrible. I watched it one time and wanted to take the disc outside, lay it on my driveway, and run over it with my car - repeatedly. Go back to editing school, Bill Jones. Truly insulting to anyone who is a fan of this movie. I'd give it negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"A great adventure in the Monty Python style. Always difficult to find on DVD, it was a pleasant surprise to see it re-released. Unfortunately, this version is designed for television, and a full twenty-five minutes shorter than my original VHS version. In spots, the editing done to shorten the film is amateurish, and the tacked on generic water sounds used to fatten up the original audio for surround sound is more a distraction than an augmentation to the movie. I will be keeping my VHS tape while awaiting a true DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there such thing as Zero stars?!?!","review":"Do yourself a favor and take the money you were going to spend on this movie, give it to a random stranger and have them kick you in the \\"boys\\".

Nothing like the original. Feels like you are watching the movie in fast forwad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie out of reach","review":"This is a well done film that few have seen. Another must for Monty Python fans. Also a great fantasy based on Norse Mythology. So, what's the problem? You can't get a copy of this anywhere to play on American DVD players.

It's extremely superficial. Sills basically takes all human behavior, crams it into one of six rigid categories, and then spends the entire book describing each category, one by one, with a token bit of advice at the end of each description. She does not go into any real detail about any of them, and I found myself thinking that I could be every single one of them. This is sort of the psychologist's version of reading a horoscope. She also reads the book herself, and has obviously gone to the Overly Dramatic School of Reading. Lots of annoying drama and schtick.

The diet has nothing to do with Greek food. The author is Greek, so there is the connection. In a nutshell, he lost his weight by going on a liquid fast. The author is also a doctor, so he should know better than to promote fasting as a way to lose weight. Most physicians will advise you not to fast to lose weight. The author also advises you to drink diet soda. This is bad advice on several points. First being with the proliferation of diet sodas since the 1980s, the obesity rate in the US skyrocketed. Also, as a physician he should be fully aware of the dangers of aspartame. If you want to be inspired to lose weight, then you will enjoy reading this book. But don't fast to lose weight. It is simply dangerous and statistically speaking, not a successful way to lose weight over the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"if there's any reason to buy this book, i'd say it would be for inspiration.i bought this book because i was amazed somebody so so fat could become so thin. i wanted to know his secret. well, i'll tell you his \\"secret\\" right now: he didn't eat!!! that's right, this guy didn't eat for like over 6 months. all he did was drink protein shakes made with water. wow, how simple! why didn't i think of that? all this time i'm suffering, trying to eat right and exercise my butt off, not getting anywhere and the answer's so obvious: JUST DON'T EAT, FAT PERSON. now i can see why people get gastric bypass surgery. how depressing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Big Fat Greek Diet","review":"This book is very inspirational, whether you need to lose weight or not.

The story he tells is one that every obese person has gone through at one time or another. His seven pillars of weight loss is sound advise and a solution for your health and future. The reader needs to keep the message in mind and not the how. Not everyone can take off work for a year and watch baseball games, but everyone can get healthy with the seven pillars. This book is a great reader as well.

But for a physician who writes--more than once--that \\"diets don't work,\\" then why did he undertake a DRASTIC 800-calorie-a-day-nothing-but-liquid-protein-shakes DIET to lose the weight he writes about??????And while he promises early in the book to write more about liquid protein shake diets, his very scanty page about it in the back provides no substantial information.And while bravo for him that he could take a year off work and go motoring around the country to take his mind off his self-induced drastic diet, it's certainly nothing practical the rest of us can follow.And his 7 Pillars? Written after he lost his weight, certainly not what he followed while on his drastic diet.On the plus side, reading his story does make it easy to think that if he did it, so can others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money if you're looking for a diet book","review":"This book is mildly amusing but totally unrealistic for 99.9% of the population.

They claim to have ties to the Baal HaSulum, Rav Yehuda Ashlag. While it's true that Philip Berg spent a brief time studying with a disciple of Ashlag's, even married (briefly) his daughter, this disciple was not the Kabbalist to whom the wisdom of Kabbalah was passed. Rather it was to Rav Baruch Ashlag (Baal HaSulam's eldest son) that the writings (Shamati articles) were passed. Rav Baruch Ashlag passed the wisdom on to Rav Michael Laitman, the Kabbalist teacher of the Bnei Baruch World Academy of Kabbalah in Israel.[...]The Power of Kabbalah and the Berg books in general are watered down Kabbalah promising personal empowerment in this world.

The development of the modern Prussian general staff, started in the wake of Napoleon's crushing victory at Jena, here reaches its culmination both in the person of Moltke and the crowning victory over the Second French Empire. What few mistakes were made against Austria in 1866 had been corrected, and as Howard writes, \\"By 1870, the machine was perfected.\\"The swift and decisive Prussian victory, Howard concludes, actually portended disaster for the unified Germany. It brought the Germans of that era to believe that since their nation had been unified as a result of military action, that it would be through military action that the nation would be preserved. This was to bear significant consequences over the next seventy-five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horsepower can be obtained for cheaper, but you get what you pay for","review":"I installed this item recently, it was pretty straight forward install and took about 45 minutes to an hour.

Ms. Callas actually has very little to do with why I like this particular 'Carmen'. I have never been a Callas fan, nor do I particularly care for her singing. Carmen is no exception. Callas' voice was on the downward spiral when this recording was made and it shows. She seems to strain noticeably at various points throughout. Where this performance DOES excel, is in all other aspects; the orchestration, pacing and choral work is top notch. Maestro Pretre turns in a find reading here and I particularly like Robert Massard. I always thought he was sadly underrated. The remastering of this recording helped it considerably, bringing out highlights unclear in the original issue. This is a fine performance and works very well for an introduction to opera and to 'Carmen'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording","review":"This is a great recording.

Callas is a soprano trying to push her mooning voice and poor frence into a role unsuitable for her. She should leave the mezzo role for far superior divas like Stevens and Horne.Again, tell me, what's the fuss???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing","review":"For years I have avoided this recording, knowing that even much earlier Callas was making some very strange and possibly unpleasant sounds even in studio recordings. How wrong I was! Some unusual sounds there are, but they seem to fit the portrayal, which is unique and electrifying. Callas could be superb in what are often taken to be mezzo roles -- e.g. her Rosina in the Barber of Seville -- and here again she takes what has become a hack role and breathes new life into it. Callas may not be Carmen, but Carmen will never be the same after hearing her. Pretre's conducting is sympathetic and Gedda makes a more than adequate Don Jose, but there are better ones available. However, Carmen really is about Carmen and this portrayal is fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great convenience","review":"I don't know how impenetrable this device is, but it sure makes life easier.

It did, more or less, until OS X 10.6 was released. UPEK said they would release an updated version for that OS, but now (January 28, 2010, long after Snow Leopard's release) they still have only a beta that performs minimal functions.

Either Mr. Kendall wasn't taught it, doesn't know how to carry it out, or doesn't know how to carry it out effectively and Biblically. Some of his suggestions about why we shouldn't confront people are contrary to Jesus' express commands that we are required to confront people in their sins (Matt:18:15-17).

It is truly for first time moms and concentrates on what to have on hand before the baby is even born. Being a second-time mom, I flipped through the first 2/3 of the book before I found anything on AFTER the baby comes. Then, it only really went into proposed sleeping schedules which was redundant and unhelpful. Aside from sleeping, there is no discussion on the \\"first year\\". It is all about schedules.

The literature which came with my set indicates that the Book of the Month Club was distributing it when I got mine, sometime after 1960. There is no need for me to compare this with any other version; cable TV has shown me a few others, so I have some vivid impressions of how this can be staged. In the essay with my set, I find a comment on \\"the Vienna performance in 1788.\\" Imagining this music set in the same decade as the French Revolution approaches the dramatic impact that I would place on this. For those who are not familiar with what happens, I will merely quote a line from the summary. \\"The fearless rake opens the door and admits the colossal statue.\\" Perhaps I have seen the statue coming through a wall, like Samson tearing down a temple at his death.

Without doubt, opera is a total work and therefore we should be careful to judge the value. I have no complaint in sigers' achievements but conductor should have provided more smoothness and power in this work. If I have to pick Don Giovanni, I would choose either Klempeler ( in fact, he was supposed to conduct this CD) or Karajan. Both have quite different tempo so you should choose whichever you like but, regardless of your choice, you'll never regret. Opera is not a ensemble contest (though it is important). It is a total work so you should pick conductors who have firm claims in their work. In most case, Giulini (also Solti) lacks this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the highlights version","review":"Unless you are a diehard total opera fanatic, I recommend the highlights version of this Giulini version. The singers are superb, the sound is great for the period, the orchestra is great - but. Two discs worth of recititavo for less than one discs worth of really beautiful arias and duets, etc. simply isn't worth the price. Calling this the greatest opera is a stretch - must be a Mozart lover. Bellini's Norma and Donizetti's Lucia with either Sutherland (where she has much more extensive parts to display her lovely, incomprehensible voice) or Callas are far better, along with many Verdi works. Don Giovanni is a massive work, but melodious content is a small part of it.

Otherwise, the writing, character development, and everything else is hack writing at its worst (or best, its competently done genre fiction, just not worth buying brand new--look for it in a used-bookstore or your local library).If you want to read a really good story by the same author, look for any of his Lost Regiment series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love this book.

Bsed on Dostoyevsky's personal experiences as a prisoner for some political scheme or other, one can see his genius at human observation. The impersonal style, and the grey feeling you get delivers the truly mundane and painful existence of a prison in the 19th century. Lacking are the heroic escapes, the outlaw with a heart of gold, and other typically American themes (cff the Green Mile). This book is a series of subtle observations, and truly meant for those with a psychological outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring","review":"This book rapidly swerves away from everything that made Buffy an amazing television show. The witty banter...not so witty or bantery, really. I am not one to usually judge the writing style, I tend to overlook \\"bad\\" writing, but I don't think anyone can read this and say that this is \\"good\\" writing. It's absolutely cringe-worthy. There are plenty of missing moments that should have been explained (parents' divorce, burning down the gym) and were not. There's not much connection to the series at all. I haven't seen the movie version of it, but I can pretty much guess that it's a lot better than this novelization (movie novelizations are, after all, usually horrible). It's just weird and...not Buffy. The one thing I do like a lot is that the Potentials are introduced, while in the series, it took 7 seasons to introduce them out of nowhere and it was really...lousy.Rating: 1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"CALLAS WAS LIVING IN A DIFFERENT SPHERE","review":"Being a music student, I am amazed at the fierce controversy generated by Maria Callas. I've studied recordings of great sopranos like Joan Sutherland and Montserrat Caballe, and I am humbled by their vocal abilities. But I find Maria Callas to be awesome. I find her more vocally expressive and colorful than any singer I've ever heard. Her ability to make the operatic text come ALIVE is amazing. I find this \\"Norma\\" to be a vocal document to be treasured. I admit that Callas sings here in a tomorrow-be-damned manner, but it's so thrilling! Let those who like mere singing listen to the more conventional sopranos. I prefer to have opera come alive the only way it can........ when Maria Callas sings! This lady operated in a different dimension than anyone else, and those who don't like her don't even know what she was about. I'm just BEGINNING to learn, and boy, do I love what I'm learning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you all are missing the point","review":"This Norma is not as good as the Caballe/Vickers, Sutherland/Horne, and Deutekom/Troyanos, and even the Sutherland/Caballe one.Simply, Callas does not have the voice to sing Norma, Period!This is all hype. None of you ever heard Callas live. These recordings are made to make her sound as good as possible. I've heard her and she is extremely inconsistant. In one Lucia, she cracked on three high notes.What we have here are a few samples in which Callas got lucky and sang relatively decent performance. While in life, she is good about once in ten, at least.But her stage presence, and the lack of super talents in her period made her memory great.She is ordinary stuff. And that is the truth.Try giving some of today's artists like Renee Fleming, a voice recorded to sound as she really sounds on stage. Not fabricated to cover Callas's hugh scratchy sound and pitched high notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest studio-recording of Norma","review":"This Norma is more than brilliant, it's how Bellini wrote it for Pasta and Grisi, simply mesmerizing. Here the drama and the vocal art are at its peak with Callas in the title role whose voice in 1954 was nothing short of a miracle. Buy this and her other studio-recording for a great Norma BUT also buy one of her live-Normas. Esp. her 1955 Norma from La Scala is DIVINE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"What a Norma!

I don't consider it a yaoi title, it's more like a suspense thriller that just happens to have a few pages of man rape thrown in. It's about a psychopath wrestler who molests a younger wrestler. It's boring, makes you uneasy and the twist at the end is just plain stupid. The characters are really 2 dimensional and you are never able to sympathise with the hero. The rape/sex scenes don't last more than a page and everything is covered up. Don't waste your money on this awful book, go buy \\"Brother\\" by Yuzuha Ougi instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was so crazy...","review":"It revolves around wrestling, like WWE style and the story is a bit silly and twisted and the newbie is really a newbie and seems like a dunce with a partial brain. It is a bit sneaky and shocking, but it's not bad. You can bypass the explanation of the wrestling and get to the action and it makes you wonder if things like this happen often in real life.

It is also important to signal publishers that content matters. Supporting bad yaoi leads publishers to believe we will buy anything with \\"yaoi\\" on the cover.In this case the combination of coerced sex and Hitchcockian plot are painful. (Do I get credit for two double entendres?) There is not enough erotic content to warrant the yaoi label. It is a textbook case of sexual harassment.

After playing once and realizing we did it wrong, we tried again in a different way. After failing again, we gave up and packed it back into the box as best we could. I hope it can be returned, and if not, I'll be pawning this off on someone else (not that I want anyone else to suffer, but I don't want to have wasted my money entirely).Pass on this game completely!.

This game is extremely predictable and is very lacking in stratagy. When I joined that game awile back I saw, however, that there was potential, especially in the excellent board itself. Being the hard-core gamer that I am, I bought the game with the intent of altering the rules and even expanding the game to a degree. I intend to re-write the ring cards and add some features that I have learned from my RPG experience.That said the average gamer who picks up this game will be dissapointed if he never had the intentions I did. However, even if a person were to only swap out a few of the ring cards with some of his own creation every now and than, the replayability of this game would soar. I would recommend this game to any LOTR fan who wants a great party/family game and is willing to get a little creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR Freak","review":"I took some time and read the other reviews for this game. Overall, I tend to agree with the majority of the statements. There is a lack of strategy, often times leaving the players to succomb to the instructions on the card. And when there is an opportunity to deviate from the movie story line, it is decided by a roll of the die. There are attributes given to characters (i.e. speed) that don't do much since the character stops at the next unused ring space, sometimes one or two spaces away.In spite of this, though, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game each time I've played. So, I give this 4 stars for fun. I do agree that there is little to no educational value. And the need to construct and de-construct Caradhras (which is slightly stronger than paper) can cause quick wear.In my opinion, this game is great for anyone who wishes to relive the FOTR movie, without having to spend 3 hours watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haphazard Walkthrough of the Movie","review":"This was an interesting game, maybe the first couple of times.

Mr. Armstrong taught what was given to him from God; if that cannot be accepted now by some, it will be learned later as end-time events occur.The scriptures said that there would be those who would creep in unaware and make changes. This is what Mr Tkach Sr, Mr. Tkach Jr. and Mr. Feazell did. They tried to make us believe the way they wanted to believe.

I was a member of that church for ten years, and finally left when the changing trends and attitudes got to me. I couldn't deal with it any more! The changes were taking place in the late '70s, and you just never knew sometimes which way things were going to go. They'd say or do something, then, boom,all of a sudden it would change again back to what it had been or similar. I left with no hard feelings, no wish to cause problems, and an assurance that if I wanted to come back I would receive help and counselling, but a couple of years later I was told of attacks against me, and I had actually been kicked out, according to the source. I felt I could no longer trust anyone there and ended association with all former friends. That hurt!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read raising the ruins for a more accurate version of what happened!!","review":"This book is an interesting read on a mans opinion.

Better yet read raising the ruins.Raising the Ruins: The Fight to Revive the Legacy of Herbert W. Armstrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blow Struck for Honesty","review":"Feazell is not afraid to refer to the historical Armstrongite Worldwide Church of God as a cult. He is also quite candid in his evaluation of its now deceased leader, Herbert W. Armstrong. Feazell's analysis of Armstrongism and how it departs from Christianity is excellent. As a former member of the WWCG, I found it refreshing that one of the current WWCG leaders is able to publicly confront these issues. This may help the many WWCG ministers and lay members who are not able to do the same.From the theology expressed in this book, it is clear that Feazell has over-reacted to the ungrace of Armstrongism and has swung in the direction of a \\"wider hope\\". He espouses the weak and minority viewpoints of inclusivism and, from other sources, post-mortem evangelization. On the topic of grace, he seems to have let passionate catharsis displace careful exegesis. This is an excellent read for current and former WWCG members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Excellent","review":"Honest, forthright, and a great read.

Bel canto is Italian for beautiful singing! Callas was the greatest Tosca of our time, but Puritani requires the greatest technique and lot's of high notes, an area that Callas lacks. For a recording that shows the true art of bel canto, look to the 1960 recording of Puritani with Joan Sutherland. Recorded in her prime, Sutherland's performance is nothing short of phenomenal"},{"rating":"1","title":"My heart says Sutherland!","review":"Get Sills' or Sutherland's recordings of this opera. Callas is awful. She simplifies the coloratura. Her voice is just not pretty, even though this was recorded in her prime. Sills sang coloratura better than Callas and was just as expressive. Her trill is much better than Callas', whose trill is a carefully controlled wobble. Sutherland has a far more beautiful voice than Callas. The sound of this recording is mono, not very good mono at that. The score is cut to shreds.Callas is overrated. Giussepe di Stefano is awful in Arturo's music. He can't reach the top notes without strain. His excessive emoting is more appropriate for verismo than for bel canto.Both Sills' studio recording and Sutherland's two studio recordings are better buys. Sills' recording and Sutherland's second studio recording are both complete and have excellent sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to know about premature menopause","review":"I read about this book in the paper and immediately ordered it.

On the plus side, it does cover a lot of information. However, sometimes the information was summarized to such an extent that it was inaccurate. As an example, when describing how to use OPK's, the authors say that if you have irregular cycles, you should use an OPK every few days. However, as OPK packages tell you and other books say, you need to do it EVERY DAY or else you could miss the one day of the surge. There are other places where statistics are summarized to the extent that they are not accurate. Finally, there are typos and spelling errors through the book.

I think they are trying to pack as many moves and instructions as they can in to each work out which makes it difficult for the average person to follow.

Should've bought extras back in April when the single unit was less than $30!'nuff said about that - this thing works great; only two minor issues so far:(1) you can't put your PC in standby because it won't reconnect when it wakes up - you have to reboot to get a network connection; and(2) it won't work when connected to an outlet on a GFCI circuit (instructions hint at this - they say to avoid using an outlet strip).If you can live with these two items, and are willing to pay the (now much higher) cost, you'll be happy.

I plugged the master on the wall close to my router, and plugged the second unit in another room. At first I was not getting any signal at all. Tried two separate outlets, nothing. Then moved to a 3rd one and got signal. But it was too slow. Spent more time trying other outlets. I was getting a bit disappointed. Then, I remembered that there was an outlet right next to my breaker box. I plugged one of the transmitters to it, and voila... max speed. I watched online videos perfectly. Then toying around with a third unit, I was able to get two lights, which is close to 30mbps. It'd work faster if the second outlet is left alone. In other words, this unit is the only thing plugged into the entire outlet.Again, these units are great.

Before that afternoon, I hadn't realized Elgar ever wrote a violin sonata. The brilliance of that piece, and the brilliance of Nigel's performance that day (he also played his heart out in the Bartók solo sonata) are captured unfailingly in all this disc, for all its being a different occasion and different music.Had never heard the Vaughan Williams before; marvelous, gossamer, magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Harvest!","review":"this is the much-needed follow-up to Noah's Garden. where that book was a statement of a philosophy of garden-tending, this one is a planting manual. making use of what i could on 3/8ths of an acre, i harvested a bumper crop of birds and butterflies, hawks and owls and toads. to make a retreat from the world in a very small space, this is your design manual.Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Verdian fest!","review":"This is one of my favourite Callas-recordings.

Proof that Freemasonry is NOT an International Conspiracy","review":"A well written, thoughtful and researched history book with a wealth of data about Freemasonry and Freemasons in many countries.

Instead of a history of the secret society, I got a history of the American Revolutuion, the French Revolution, and several other revolutionary movements worldwide. Being told that some revolutionaries, politicans, artists, and intellectuals were Freemasons and that some were not, just as some were corrupt and some were not, gave me no insight into the organization itself. I felt as though the author was playing a game of \\"maybe so, maybe not...guess if you can\\". What little information I derived from this book was contradictary, such as the requirements of 'believing in one God' and 'not discussing politics', yet athiests were admitted and both right-wing and left-wing groups with strong political views controlled the lodges. I would recommend reading a book that discusses the society itself more so than one that discusses the people involved, or in this case-- 'not involved'."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I found this book to be quite disappointing.

He provides plenty of footnotes in favor of Freemasonry and the claims they make; but nothing when he dispels \\"rumors\\" and \\"heresay\\". There are better books.

Unfortunately, most of the literature I found was written by enthusiasts - how wonderful freemasonry is, how important its accomplishements, etc. A few other authors wanted to show how dangerous it is.This author provides a many sided picture of a complex group or process that has evolved over centuries. I agree with the blurb from The Economist, shown on the cover of this book: \\" a meticulous, sane, and lucid book.\\"As a general reader I rate this book four stars for the valuable service it provides, and for its readibility. Were I to step into my academic/intellectual shoes, it would be three stars, for its fast-paced gallop over so much time and so many places, dealt with somewhat superficially.In sum, the book gave me exactly what I wanted, an interesting introduction to the history and belief system of this movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last, a Sensible Book About the Masons","review":"There's a lot of published work dealing with the Freemasons, either as a specific subject, or touching on them when writing about some esoteric, \\"New Age\\" issue, or conspiracy theory. Many of them depict the Masons as bad, dangerous or just plain nutty. Ridley's study effectively stands alone, being objective and unbiased---the more so, because he admits he's not a mason himself, and demonstrates why he's not convinced by the questionable scholarship of some contemporary books that depict them as evil and corrupt.Anyone interested in a balanced overview of the masonic movement ought to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa! Author is mixing apples with oranges","review":"It is strange for this book to compare the career of Jeb Stuart, Lee's chief-of-cavalry until 1864, with George Custer. Phil Sheridan was Grant's cavalry chief and Custer's commander. Therefore, comparing Stuart to Sheridan is more correct. It then follows that, although Sheridan did favor Custer among his lieutenants, it is monstrously wrong to state 1 man (Custer), and not his commander (Sheridan), drove the Confederates out of the Shenandoah Valley and stopped Lee at Appommatox. (In fact, it is almost legend how Sheridan, by personally leading a counter-charge at the last Valley battle at Cedar Creek, was himself most responsible for ending the Valley campaign.)

For novices, it's a great introduction. For experts, you'll probably learn something and it is a good catalog of things to keep in mind while writing.

I was really looking forward to this CD, it even included one of my favorite songs, CRAZY, and was an album I was not familiar with. I regret to say that this album does not even come close to working. The combination of her voice, interpretation, orchestration, arrangements, and mostly songs that are not very good, simply don't work together.Now that she has passed away, I hear that RPM Records is finally going to issue her albums on CD.

Plus of how she felt about the rest of Canada and their relatioship with the province of Quebec as well.She even was bold enough to mention the fantasies and dreams she would have about the love of her life, Rene Angelil. (Bold REALLY is the word to describe what she was imaging when it came to him.)She also is VERY frank about her naivety in politics and of show busisness.Than she goes back to her fantasies and dreams she had regarding when she would become famous or if she didn't.Every single things that Celine has experience before and after becoming famous is ALL told straight from her heart... and that's why this autobiography is worth buying for all the other Celine Dion fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Book!!!!","review":"I loved this book.

Her fantasies of seducing and being with him when she was only 14 years old were disturbing, as is her almost total dependence on him.

The earpiece type headphones that are included are some of the best I've ever heard of that type of headphone. The USB transfer speed is very fast, and the program is easy to use. Hands down this is the best player I've seen or used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running","review":"I never found a CD player that didn't skip.

PERFECT!!!","review":"I looked at all the flash memory mp3 players offered by Amazon. Every review for the iaudio had 5 stars.I thought that was worth looking into. Went to the JetAudio website and was convinced that the iaudio was the one for me. i was right.i am extremely happy. Tiny, tiny, tiny. easy to hold in one hand and operate the controls. Very light.It doesn't have expandable memory but i don't know of any flash memory player that provides more than 256 mb.the jet shell program makes converting cds and downloading music to the iaudio a breeze. also no problems with organizing the files. the iaudio memory is divided into 5 albums (4 for mp3, 1 for voice recording. very easy to switch albumsi am impressed and will continue to buy their products in the future. i hope they come out with another one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Gloves!","review":"I ordered the black gloves for a military ball that I was attending the day after Christmas, and I can honestly say that they were perfect. The material was incredibly soft, not too difficult to wash, and stretchy, which helped keep them in place through lots of movement.

In all, they are elegant and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy the money and unsatisfied customer service","review":"Assuming I received a correct item, it is actually a pair of 22'' long gloves with no maker label and mainly made of nylon.

The gloves are small which was fine with me, as I have small hands, but the tips of the fingers have clumsy stitching aross them. I suppose it could be for reinforcement purposes, but it actually highlights the lower quality of these gloves. They are ok for a costume, but not to wear anywhere else.

But when his accent compounded with poor enunciation of English-language words is the voice-over for an entire movie and the speech pattern of the main character, it becomes almost like sitting through the scraping of hand nails on a blackboard. (The DVD comes with English subtitles -- need I say more?) There are films that come close to imitating \\"film noir\\", but this less-than-B movie is not one of them.

I saw the other reviews here and didn't even want to take it for an estimate being afraid of what I might hear. But, I purchased it with my Visa card and they double manufacturer's warranties. So, I had to take it in.... $1093 for a new LCD panel! What???? I only paid $1200 for it. I would suggest steering clear of this model. I'll personally be steering clear of Sony from now on.

The faulty LCD panel is a known issue: there was even a recall on the 46 inch model. I called Sony, but they wouldn't do anything for me except offer me another TV - a 40 inch, which I didn't want - at a bit of a discount.

However neat the pages appear, it just ain't worth it. And since when did anyone care about neat-looking pages?

I kept yearning for Schmidt to get these people out of his life, or at the very least, tell them off--but no, he never seemed able to rise to the occassion.

Their music, and Christian message is just plain awesome! However, before their newest CD \\"Reborn\\", they weren't quite as good. While the instrumental part of this CD is just awesome, the vocals are a candidate for the worst I've ever heard. I think they fired the lead singer after this album, because they have a different one on Reborn.

This opera is SO demanding: I believe it was Caruso who said, tongue in cheek, \\"All it requires is the four best voices in the world.\\" She is joined by Di Stefano, singing the demanding role of Manrico with brio and conviction. Rolando Panerai's Conte di Luna is rich, resonant and compelling. As for Fedora Barbieri as Azucena, she will put chills right down your spine: hers is a lacerating and powerful star turn.

I come to that conclusion from watching interviews with DD during his Press Junket for the movie.The feeling through out this movie was it was a higgldly piggldy mess, and no-one was quite sure how to reach the end. So it kind of waded through scenes that you were wondering where the rest of it went and how you reached this point in the first place.If there was a no star rating, I would have chosen that.

I suspose he takes what's offered nowadays. Duchovny gets by on easy charm. His approach to acting may even be original, it's just hard to tell in the drive by shooting that is Hollywood film making. Actually, the bizarre humour of the second half rather won me over, but why America should want to habitually portray itself to the world as venal and indifferent to human suffering is one for 'The X-Files'."},{"rating":"2","title":"'PG' better than most realize","review":"I disagree with the negative reviews by Maltin and the other 'customer' reviewers.

But after the two bond they begin to fight over the same girl(Angelina Jolie). There is a lot of pointless dialogue and action sequences. The whole movie is just a big blur basically.

I don't know what happened, but I am surprised because usually the plot is so great in these books. I usually adore Nina, but for some reason found myself being very irked by her. The mystery was idiotic and I found myself not caring about the outcome. The only redeeming part was the chapter about the \\"party\\" because it was so crazy. Keeping all the families straight in my mind was hard though because I did not care enough to put any real effort into it.

By Christmas Eve, it had completely stopped working. Now I have to drive 80 miles (in my truck) to have it repaired (hopefully) at the nearest service center. This will entail taking off from work, spending money on gas (dropping it off and picking it up), and hoping they fix it. The other option is to ship it to the service center for about $30 to $60 (round trip). Sharp will fix it as it only worked for about 7 weeks, but I am responsible for transporting it. I just bought another microwave from Sears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp Microwave","review":"Looks OK, but made cheaply. Noisy while running and makes a loud noise when closing the door. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turntable did not work.","review":"The microwave was defective. Fortunately, Amazon agreed to take it back with full refund. I am definitely switching brands on my next purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor power level selection","review":"The microwave worked well, but who designs a microwave where you have to press the power level button SEVEN times in order to get a power setting of 30%????? I just wanted to defrost a chicken breast. Since that wasn't one of the pre-programmed foods for defrosting, I tried to set the microwave to defrost for a few minutes. But who has the patience to punch that power level button all those times to reduce the power level to 30% for defrosting????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Sharp Microwaves","review":"The digital display failed in our first R-410CK.Our second R-410CK sometimes started up by itself. Eventually it started blowing circuit breakers in the house.The digital display also failed in our R-430EW, which we only used a couple of times.All of this happened out of warranty, and the parts/repair cost more than buying a new oven. Also, the city charges $15 just to haul one of these away.Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Easy!","review":"This microwave is the easiest to operate of all that I've encountered! The sensor cooking feature is a great time saver!It's the easiest and most dependable way to cook rice.What a fantastic bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall, couple of concerns","review":"This microwave is great overall, but I have found that the beverage feature does not really heat adequately and the sensor for frozen vegetables still leaves them a bit underdone (and I like them crisp!). I really enjoy the reheat sensor and it works very well. Great for the price at Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If size matters...","review":"The posting says 1.2 cu.ft. The box says 1.2 cu.ft.* (*Internal capacity is calculated by measuring the maximum width, depth and height. Actual capacity for holding food is less.). I would call this a 1.0 cu.ft. From my measurements, the internal size is 14\\"w x14 1/2\\"d x8 1/2\\"h, do the math. The turntable is 12 5/8\\" (which agrees with the box), still more then enough for a normal sized dinner plate.Only had for a few days so far, but the 1200w power is great. We were replacing another Sharp that we had for 15+ years. Hope this one holds up as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"850 watts, not 1200","review":"This microwave was purchased to replace a similar 1200 watt Sharp microwave that I had had so many years that I don't remember when I got it. The display no longer worked so we purchased this one as it had most of the same features and was the same wattage. I noticed immediately that it takes nearly twice as long to cook or reheat as the older one. Checked the watts used and found it was only drawing 850 watts. Did not get any satisfaction from repair services. They put me through the test described in the manual (heating water) and since the water heated in the given amount of time, they said it was working ok. It's not. It works but slowly. I did not get what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp R-320HK 1200-Watt 1.2-Cubic-Foot Microwave, Black","review":"Works very well. The 1200 watts makes this microwave oven fast in practically all functions. Sort of hard to program few applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetition is the key to learning","review":"Our whole family enjoys reading this book. With its repetition of the \\"horrible, terrible...\\" day, we now can all read those parts together. And when the kids have a bad day, we can refer to the book (and talk about going to Australia). It helps to make light of a bad day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unengaging","review":"Despite its great title and some good lines, this book remains a bit unengaging. Potential buyers should be aware that it is an extremely thin and relatively flimsy paperback with no color illustrations, only workman-like black and white sketches. Also, while the protagonist's complaints against the day are humorous and sometimes resonate, there is no real theme, much less moral. The book is adequate for light reading, but its unappealing appearance means that it is not for everyone. We were disappointed by this book, whose actual appearance we were not able correctly to envision online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative, thrilling, nostalgic","review":"This book was recommended by an acquaintance who knew I came from Friesland. In fact I lived the first six years of my life, during the war, on the North Sea coast opposite the Frisian Islands (the Shallows lying between).So the story had particular resonance and I could see the actual land/seascape in my memory. Quit apart from that it was a great story with all the necessary elements of a good read: great and believable plot, well-developed characters, and lots and varied action and suspense. The descriptions of the land and sea rang very true. One of my favourite books. Hope I can get hold of the Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Tradition of...","review":"In the tradition of Patrick O'Briens characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin; and Forester's Hornblower; plus the beginnings of \\"Riley Ace of Spies\\", based on \\"British Agent\\" by R.H. Bruce Lockhart. Childers book was recommended to me by Mick Mallon, who I hope would not mind me describing him as a linguist, sailor, reader and reviewer of books. When, in 1975 at home in the Canadian Arctic, I said I enjoyed spy novels he passed on Childers book. The softback has stayed with me since then, the hardcover goes to my grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very slow","review":"I was interested in this book because I do have an interest in a good spy story and sail boats and sailing but little knowledge of the latter.Having already professed my lack of knowledge of boats and sailing,this book was way over my head in that regard.I just was'nt able to appreciate the involved describtions of that part of the book which was the overwhelming majority of the book.The spy story made up a very small part and in my opinion was only included to justify writing basically a book about the perils of sailing a small boat along a coastline.Reilly:Ace of Spies this book isn't.I gave it two stars for the simple reason of the effort it must have taken to write it.I can't say I hated it,but I surely did'nt like it either.This fellow should have read some of Henty's books before writing this one.It took alot of willpower to plod through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea, Spies and Excellent Writing, What More Could You Want?","review":"This has been on my wish-to-read list for a long time and at last I have fulfilled the wish.The book has rightly been listed among the 100 greatest novels of all time. Claims have also been made for it as the first spy novel, although this is challenged by fans of Rudyard Kipling, who of course wrote Kim two years earlier than Riddle.It has also been credited with being so influential that it woke up the Admiralty to the possibility of invasion of Britain by Germany across the North Sea, with consequent opening of several naval bases on the East coast.I enjoyed it very much, especially as it encompassed two of my reading interests - sailing and espionage. I was sad when it finished, not because of the ending, but because there was no more. The writing is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for the sailor & spy fiction afficianado.","review":"Widely considered the first modern spy novel, and the still the best book about sailing. Perhaps a bit tedious due to the 100 year old prose, but well worth it. It is very appearant that the author, Childers, knows his subject matter. Not only was he an avid yachtsman, and a foreign office employee, but he knew a bit about spying, too - he was executed for running guns to the IRA in the 1916 rebellion. This book is somewhere between Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Treasure Island. Truly a classic...and the movie's great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A powerful flop!","review":"The title (Riddle of the Sands) is exotic but beyond that - it is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw one"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the story?","review":"I am not a sailor, nor am i interested in the details of sailing. Also the description of the east frisian coast (i was born there) didn't fascinate me. But the worst part is the lack of a plot, i mean it can be summarized in less than a sentence, very disappointing but not surprising if one knows why the book was written. To me, reading this book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble gum reading with that is hard to chew.","review":"I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat. The ending left me empty and unsatisfied. If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area. Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This story moves at a very slow pace. The first hundred pages are just the two main characters out on a yachting trip. To call this story a \\"thriller\\" or \\"spy\\" novel is a stretch I'd call a lie by today's standards. It's about 280-300 pages of building not very tense tension and then finally at the end of the book you get a none thrilling conclusion. The only redeeming factor of this book, the reason why I gave it two stars and not one, is the dynamic between the two main characters. The characters are engaging but the plot is so dull I must recommend readers to stay away. DON'T READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"A beautiful looking cookbook, certainly.
