The animation is superb, the story is wonderful, and some of the characters(Cubbi and Sunni) are cute!I'm not happy because all they had on the DVD were episiodes of the TV series only no bonus features whatsoever, not even interviews with the original voice actors, I know bill Scott is dead but June Foary is still around along with corey burton.Disney this is still your property please treat it with respect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gummi bears DVD set","review":"I loved it!!!

And who cares if they're not re-mastered or enhanced in any way. These were brought to DVD just as how they were supposed to be enjoyed, just like they were when they aired.

There is no doubting that Harrison loves to indulge himself with great food, great wine and great company. And he can tell a tale. Harrison is at his best when rhapsodizing about memorable meals and contemplating his existence in the universe. Harrison is at his worst when trying to impress the reader that despite living much of the year in the sticks of Upper Peninsula Michigan or borderlands Arizona--he is indeed a jet-set world traveler, who knows everyone (Hollywood, Paris, the Big Apple, Key West) and is quite a witty dinner companion (he kept Winona Ryder in stiches one evening).

I purchased them when they first were released so I paid premium price, I think $29.99.It is such a shame however that Disney has not included any special features on this DVD.

It's great for those nostalgic moments. Although, I like Volume 2 better, because it includes the original movie which is also referred to as the pilot episodes.

Plus try contacting the company to see if there are patches for the error, it's hair raising. Flash cards are a better choice than this. I give this program (-)stars if it was an option.

It requires installation of each of the 11 CDs! That kind of set the tone for the software. From the package, it claims it supports 600*800 or higher resolution. When we start up the software, it 'friendly' changes the resolution and then errored out complaining it requires running in small font. When we attempt to go to their support website, the link is not good! Finally after changing the computer configuration, we manage to get it to run. I tried the first 2 CDs. Maybe it's good at drilling but there is no way that that it attempts to teach the kids of the letter sound of the alphabets. In one session, it let us pick the alphabets and there are pictures associated with them. Someone in the right mind would sound out the pictures and the letters but not this software. I think I just wasted my money on this software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt-free Entertainment for toddlers","review":"I love this video for my 2 year old son.

It felt like it was made from a cut of really cheap pine or other cheap wood. The neck joint is very flimsy and the guitar easily gets out of tune because of this flimsy cheap joint. The pickup selector switch would cause bursts of static when switching while playing - cheap pickups and very little tone control - even though this is meant to resemble a Fender Strat - that's the extent of any comparison. This package would be okay for a beginner - better than the cheapo package guitars you see in the big box discount stores, but not a very good guitar.

It is VERY difficult to find a book about labor and delivery that is focused on natural, holistic philosophies. Of the few that are out there, this is by far the best! I started out with other, more well known approaches and appreciated the general nature of the techniques, but found them lacking in spiritual depth and feeling somewhat superficial. If you just want techniques, they may be good approaches for you. However, I was looking for something that had a deep, philsophical foundation in addition to great techniques.

It's \\"beyond the trials of Job\\" story line is not only depressing but detrimental to the rest of the series. Some characters and story lines are poorly developed and created only for subsequent shock value. New characters are introduced, in the epilogue no less. Major series threads are left unaddressed or disappear completely with only superficial explanation. All that which has defined Dion, made her strong and admirable, and the world she lives in is either ripped away or arbitrarily abandons her. Apparently this is done so that she can pursue some nebulous goal which remains just that - nebulous. It could have been the jewel of the series, instead, Wolf's Bane tarnishes all that has gone before. I can only hope that the author plans to remedy this with a sequel or the series will be irreparably harmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara, how could you.....?","review":"If you have read the first three novels in the Wolfwalker series (and if you haven't, I suggest that you do) do not, I repeat, DO NOT read Grayheart or Wolf's Bane. Ember Dione maMarin was my favorite character, and Harper destroyed her life. I don't ask for sugar plum fairies and sprites dancing under the pale moon light, but I do expect to be able to read a story without feeling sick to my stomach over the non-stop agony my character is experiencing. Wolfwalker, Shadow Leader, and Storm Runner had plenty of pain and fear, but those emotions were at least balanced by excitement and joy. I don't know what Tara Harper was thinking...maybe she was having a bad year, or maybe she has every intention of making up for it in future novels, but unless she redeems herself, my advice is to stay away from these novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent naration","review":"The book was very well written and it kept you in supence most of the way through.

Pay attention no one goes into combat in a desert environment with a close quarters weapon. With the occasional building to enter is what your pistol or M-4 is designed for.

Check the other reviews for a more complete discussion of the series, but I just wanted to note that this DVD set is in 16:9/widescreen format, unlike the episodes on Hulu that are in 4:3 format. You get more picture, as well as better picture quality, so if you've already seen the series on Hulu and are looking for an excuse to get this, there you have it.

I had been throughly shocked, scared, and entertained by Off Season, So I picked up The Lost. Ketchum shocked me again! This book goes in a completely different direction from Off Season. Don't get me wrong, the violence is there from page one but this book is really more of a whodunit than horror. Mind you, I'm not complaining! I could not put this book down. All the characters seem so real and you really cheer for the goodguys and boo the badguys. Ketchum hasn't let me down yet. This is another keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"..and that's it?","review":"Ketchum has an engaging writing style and a vivid sense of description. The books opens with a gruesome double homicide and then we leap forward five years. At that point we learn more about the characters, and we learn more, and we learn more- actually your stop learning more and keep learning the same things over and over. There are all kinds of \\"mysterious\\" things set up in this tale (an erstwhile cat that gets chapters to itself, a new girl suddenly in town from Fresno with some bad habits) but the shoe never drops on them- the cat BTW serves no function. It isn't as if any of these things cause any real tension mostly idle curiosity. The book isn't frightening and the main villan turns out ot be such a small time punk he's really almost pitable. Worse, when the climax finally does come it is suitably gruesome but mostly pointless (one actually will spend some time think, what brought this one) and pretty much devoid of any feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Let-down","review":"I've heard so much about Ketchum over the years, and even met him at a l999 Horror Convention. His classic book OFF SEASON is hard to get, and I've been dying to read (and find)it for under the crazy prices that are charged for it. Leisure has finally put this much acclaimed author's work (THE LOST) on their roster, so I snatched it up the day it was released. Let's see: The prologue was intense, and then there was close to 300 pages of NOTHING. Yes. I said NOTHING but character development and graphic details of oral sex. For the amazing blurb written all over this book's cover (by the likes of Stephen King and Fangoria magazine), I expected much more. Hopefully this was just one of Ketchum's slow moments, because I know that he is highly respected in the genre. I wish Leisure would re-release OFF SEASON and THE GIRL NEXT DOOR so us poor people can see what all the fuss is about.....because THE LOST certainly is nothing to brag about."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last","review":"This is the first Jack Ketchum book that I have read...and the last. This book goes from 0 to 60 before Chapter 1. I found the violent and gory details unnecessary and the characters shallow. Chapters 1 through 37 are filled with mundane details, poor attempt at character development, and predictability. This section of the book creeps along until the last few chapters which are filled with more needless details of nonsensical murders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a dull crime novel...","review":"I know Ketchum has a strong fan following... and a reputation for reaching certain extremes that a lot of mainstream writers shy away from... but really, there wasn't anything 'extreme' about this book. It's not that the writing was bad... just that the story wasn't very interesting. The characters weren't anything you wouldn't see on the average TV cop show. No surprises... no shocks... no one I really cared about.Ray Pye is just a garden variety sociopath... you wait the whole book for him to explode, and when he does, it's just kind of 'meh'.My understanding is that the book is based on some actual events... but it's missing that quirkiness that true-crime stories usually have, the 'truth is stranger than fiction' element that usually makes the story worth telling.I'll happily read something else by Ketchum, but I wouldn't recommend this one unless you're bored and there's nothing much else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!!!","review":"One of his longest novels and one of his best.

Ketchum never lets up, never tries to sate the reader's desire for a happy ending, never lets you look away. This book is at once a horror tale and a true reflection of the kinds of senseless violence that stems from a contaminated human condition. It's in your face from start to finish. Ketchum is a powerful story teller.-- Mark LaFlamme, author of \\"The Pink Room.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring","review":"After the energy of Off Season, anything is bound to be a dissapointment, but this is just boring. I didn't care about the characters, except maybe the cat, the writing is typically conventional, the plot was weak, I wouldn't say there's a whole lot of developmet going on--i certainly didn't buy that the \\"bad guy\\" would kill people because he got turned down for a date and isn't as tall as he'd like to be--and i really had to struggle to finish it. It starts well, and ends well, but if you're like me, and want to read this because you like ketchum and/or horror stories just read the beginnign and then skip to the end because a whole bunch of nothing happens inbetween. If you're interested in character development and loss of inocence, read The Bottoms by Joe Lansdale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lock the doors and keep the lights on at night","review":"I've read Jack Ketchum before and looked forward to this new book, THE LOST. When I started it I couldn't put it down until it was finished. It's a tense and edgy ride with Ray and those attracted to and repulsed by his relentless hunger. Years after the opening Bad incident we travel through the town Ray lives in, drawn by his non-PC life, waiting for the next Bad thing to happen. Ketchum doesn't disappoint in THE LOST, there was always another layer of Bad things waiting to make me turn the page. In the end, the random everyday-ness of Ray's evil made me want to put extra locks on my door and windows and sleep with the lights on.

We didn't have cable the summer between my 9th and 10th grades, so I read R. L Stine or Christoper Pike books every day up to three books a day. I am finally finishing up buying the sagas that go with this book! Can't wait to get them, wished I had kept a better eye on my books throughout the years. I use to go to the mall with my hard earned cash to simply buy books and the occasional pair of shoes, I did have to buy all of my own clothing but all my extra money went towards Waldens book store.

They get rid of bad reviews for their products by bribing the reviewers. To make matters worse, they don't even follow through with their bribes! It happened to me when I bought this product earlier in 2012. I was very dissatisfied with the shipping time and the fact that they sent me the wrong product, so I wrote a bad review. I later received a call from someone at Airsplat saying that if I took down my review they would send me a bag of free BB's. Since it was only a five dollar purchase, I obliged. I never received the BB's, and I have come to realize that they probably have done this to hundreds of other people as well. That to me is very shady, so I'm never going to order from them again, and I encourage anyone that is thinking about it to take a look at some of their competitors, like AirsoftGI and Evike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Western Feng Shui tips for nonsense","review":"While visiting my local Feng Shui supplier, I had told them I just purchased Feug Shui tips for a better life foreworded by professor Lin Yun.

It offers comprehensive, yet easy to understand instructions, expert advice, and all the forms you'd ever need. I'd say most honest, legitimate bankruptcy filers who have few or no assets could probably file on their own using this book. Unfortunately it didn't provide answers to some specific questions unique to my situation so I ended up hiring an attorney anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro to chapter 7!","review":"You don't have to be in a financial bind to read and keep this book.

I definitely could have used a book like this to help me navigate through my filing. My lawyer helped a little but you are pretty much on your own unless you have a very supportive partner or family. This book details the process of Bankruptcy, the steps you need to take to make the process simpler and easier to deal with.

This book is definitely destined for the big screen. EJD writes with such skill and the imagery he creates is so vivid. I enjoy reading EJD because of his talent, attention to detail, his ability to draw symmetry between the past and present, his artistic blend of fiction and fantasy...All of it just jumps off the pages! TP is definitely different than his other works, but the quality of his writing just gets better...I love the way he brings cameos of characters from his other works! Two thumbs up, Eric!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK","review":"EJD ALWAYS GIVE HIS AUDIENCE A GOOD READ. BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT FROM HIS OTHER NOVELS, THE AVERAGE EJD FAN WILL BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD. INSTEAD OF RUNNING GAME FOR SEX, THESE CHARACTERS ARE RUNNING GAME FOR MONEY. THE CHARACTERS ARE DEVELOPED WELL, BUT THE THEME ISN'T REALISTICALLY RELATED TO LOS ANGELES STREET LIFE. IT WOULD BE MORE BELIEVABLE IF THE SETTING WAS KANSAS CITY OR SOMETHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book...terrible reader!!!","review":"I enjoyed Thieves' Paradise. It was a nice change of pace from the author's usual theme. However, I must complain about the reader. Bill Andrew Quinn's voice was all wrong for this book. His voice was annoying and took something away from an otherwise enjoyable book. Thieves' Paradise was worthy of three stars, but because of Mr. Quinn's terrible reading, I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your normal read by EJD","review":"I have read all of EJD novels.

This man definitely has talent and is a foece to be reckoned with. Keep 'em coming,Eric."},{"rating":"2","title":"He does it again","review":"Thieves' Paradise goes along with every day life and you can relate to it.

This wasn't his best and I was a bit bored with it to say the least I wouldn't recommend it at all espically to the EJD readers. It wasn't that entertaining to me.Dante was a low life, Pam needed to get a new career change, Jackson needed to get his life in order, and Scamz was just as bad as a person including his business that he runs. If I had to choice a likeable/interesting character I would of choosen Big Slim if you choose to read it.

Keep it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adding to book collection","review":"EDJ is an amazing modern author who had me hooked from the first book I read of his. I was in sort of a let down reading TP. My disappointment mainly came from the female characters in the book. The only positive female book was Big Slim's slain girlfriend. Sabrina, Pam, Sierra, and all the other females characters were immature. They relied on a man way too much. EJD is still an awesome author, but this book was not that great. Not everyone can hit a homerun everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other world within our world....","review":"Once again, Eric Jerome Dickey has pulled me into a world I was not prepared nor was some of the characters he brings to life in this tale of life amongst thieves were prepared for. We learn that even in their world, trust is the most important factor and once that is broken, the price you pay is a costly one. This story follows a young man name Dante for 72 hours and we watch as his world goes through so many changes from trust to betrayal, but he still tried to save everyone that he cares about before saving himself. Somehow I felt like I was right there along side Dante, trying to understand why people do the things they do just to get ahead in the world, but going about it in the most dangerous way. Although I would have loved to have more action, more drama, more suspense, it is still a great read and I enjoyed it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesson Learned","review":"I like EJD however, this particular book started off slow to me. The book didn't get good until the middle when all the action started but once it got going I couldn't put down. Dante was determined to make it without turning to the illegal side of things, however, he is a real example of someone doing what they have to do to get by. Scamz to me was a joke. He thought he was God but found out he was not. He said he feared no man well he forgot about woman.I recommend the book just be prepared for a slow start and keep i mind that the ending is worth the slow start."},{"rating":"1","title":"He actually let me down!!!","review":"I love EJD but this one left me hanging.

I am an avid fan of EJD and I am totally disappointed in this work. It is to discriptive in some areas and personally, for me it was like waiting on paint to dry. EJD's writings are usually very exciting and passionate but I really don't know what he was trying to do with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Dickey was the Thief","review":"My Washington D.C book club agreed that this was Dickey at his absolute worse. We were very disappointed with this book. In fact, after we struggled through the book we decided to cancel our book club meeting. We later decided to have a book bashing meeting instead. In a nutshell, Mr. Dickey used his loyal readers as guinea pigs for his personal experiment into mystery writing. His characters were not well developed and his story lines were incomplete. This was more of a comedy than a mystery. Mr. Dickey was the thief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Variety, ESmooth","review":"I really enjoyed this book. EJD has once again captivated his reading audience. Previous books have addressed a plethora of topics and situations, and in Paridise were brought into the grift world by Cool Hand Dante. EJD shows his versitilty in writing a suspensful, scam, and crime ridden novel,without the loss of the romance. Well Done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EJD STRIKES GOLD !","review":"ERIC JEROME DICKEY IS ONE OF THE MOST PROVACATIVE AND INNOVATIVE WRITERS OF OUR TIME.

I WAS HOOKED FROM THE FIRST PAGE, AND PULLED INTO THE LIVES OF DANTE, PAM, AND SCAMZ..PEOPLE NOTHING LIKE ME AND AT THE SAME TIME SO MUCH LIKE US ALL. DICKEY'S WRITING SHOWS THE PROFUNDIDITY OF THE HUMAN CONNECTION. HE IS ABLE TO MAKE UNLIKABLE CHARACTERS LIKABLE AND MAKES THE READER CONTINUE TO FIND COMPASSION IN PLACES UNKNOWN TO US ALL. AS A LOYAL FAN, I HAVE SEEN THE GROWTH IN HIS WORK OVER THE PAST THREE BOOKS ESPECIALLY AND I AM HAPPY THAT HE IS VENTURING OUT INTO UNKNOWN AREAS AND PUSHING HIMSELF AS A WRITER TO GIVE US SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

It just starts a little too slow for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's definitely written better","review":"I've read all of EJD's books and I find this one to be my least favorite. It took me longer than usual to get into it. I got to a point where I asked myself did I even want to finish it! But as I read I found myself liking it more and more. It was different than his other books and I tried to be open minded, but I don't like this kind of writing from him. Maybe if he'd gone into more detail with the characters? Whatever. I will still buy his books and read them. I'm a loyal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"His WORST Work!","review":"I have been reading this book for over a month and have yet to get the just of it. He throws in way too many characters at one time and then the 'relationship' or lack there of between Dante and the older woman is taking WAYYYY too long to get moving.I have read ALL of E. J.

This gives aninsight of the lifes of those German auxiliary soldiers who were hired by the British King George III to fight the American rebels. This man went through battles until the end at Yorktown,became a prisoner, and noted down every days happenings. You'llfind the names of many deserting comrades who later served withthe Americans, and settled after the war in the new United States. This Diary in my opinion follows closely in quality the Diary written by the famous Baroness Friederike von Riedesel. In any event, anybody interested in the American Revolution historywill find this book most interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Regency","review":"Ann Elizabeth Cree won a Golden Heart award for A Bargain with Fate and I am not surprised.

Michael wants Rosalyn to pose as his fiance to keep his matchmaking family quiet.

He captures the expressions and emotions behind the character like noone else could.

Tragic, yet facinating, this movie is sure to hold your interest time after time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spit In The Audience's Face","review":"I can't even construct a bad explanation as to why they'd do this. A lot of people were looking forward to this DVD release. The uncut, original version is (was), no, is perhaps the greatest miniseries/made-for-TV-movie ever made. No, naturally, Lawrence Schiller's (or whoever's responsible) first instinct was to butcher it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Executioners Song","review":"This is a very good movie. Tommy Lee played Gary Gilmore, a real killer in the 70's. I was the Location Manager and we filmed it in Provo/Salt Lake City, Utah...where it all actually happened. Based on the book by Norman Mailer, it stays pretty much to the actual happenings. We used most all of the real locations, especially the jail where Gary was kept in Provo. It had been closed a long time but I made a deal with the city and we fixed it up and filmed Tommy Lee in the actual cell that Gary was kept in. We filmed two versions...one a two-parter for NBC and the other for Europe. The European version was far better since if was more real. This version is a mixture of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Executioner's Song - DVD Director's Cut","review":"I saw the original on TV, have rented the VHS numerous times and have read the book numerous times. The Director's Cut is a hatchet job on the film. The relationship between Gary and Nicole is crucial to the story, yet here we see very little of it. It has been cut so severely that one gets the impression that it was not much of a relationship at all. If Lawrence Shiller cut this film, then shame on him! I, like many, have been waiting for this to come on DVD. They could have put the original four hours on DVD, yet have reduced this to a 2 1/2 hour abomination. I want my $18.00 plus shipping back!

When she's having Sex with Gary they cut out most of the nudity if not all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"The major reason that I bought this release is because it said \\"Director's Cut.\\" Everyone knows that the \\"Director's Cut\\" is supposed to contain the maximum footage of the film (complete). Though Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor, this movie does not really make a lot of sense (as to his motive for murder). This version should be rated PG. The real \\"Director's Cut\\" (or the European Version)would be rated R (nudity, violence, and language) and can be found on VHS only (at this time). This DVD is not worth the money. Wait for the Euro release on DVD. I bought this \\"Director's Cut\\" thinking it was the Euro release. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They edited the entire point out!","review":"You know that something is lost in edited translation when the entire point is missed! SO much was cut out. Just absurd. By the time they finished with it, if you knew nothing of the story, you would have NO idea what was at all unusual or of special interest about Gilmore's case, or why a brilliant mind like Norman Mailer would have chosen to write the book!

I made the mistake of thinking \\"Director's Cut\\" meant it was the original film. Boy was I wrong!The only reason to purchase this chopped to pieces version is to use it as an example of our purtain, censorious moral beliefs in a society that rates violent movies as G or PG and lovemaking or nudity as R or X.What a perfect example of our upside-down beliefs.You are missing a great movie here, but not this gutted version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Cut? More like Butcher's Cut!","review":"This once great movie has been severely edited, leaving out many scenes. I've been anticipating the release of this movie for a long time, so this is a disappointment. There is none of the chemistry between the main actors. The movie jumps around and seems disconnected and hard to follow. I would not recommend this. Try to find a copy of the original VHS release and buy that, preferably digital. This movie needs to be released with all the original scenes, in the expanded version, otherwise it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"mis-representation","review":"This is a good movie but labled as directors cut you would exspect more in the movie not less. movie companys are re-relising movies under director cut and unrated just for sales. i remember seeing this on the movie networks years ago and it was shocking and controversial. this edition is substansialy shorter than the vhs version. if you have never seen this movie i do recomend it but if you can get the vhs edition.also it would be nice too have reveiws that are specifically for the product in question and not for every edition they produce it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why cut it ?

I don't buy or wear clinique make up, but in the lighting of the store that shows everything, she made a comment that I had a lot of black heads. I told her they actually weren't black heads, but very large pores. I also have very oily skin. It was so strange that as we were having this conversation, I looked up and saw this product!! I guess our talk made me think about it. Anyways right there I put it on in front of the mirror and the results were instant. My friend and I couldn't believe it.

This has been my best beauty find to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"The first week or two, it seems to work great. It didn't minimize the appearance of pores or actually reduce them, but it did seem to diminish the oil in the T-zone for a good portion of the day.I've been using this product religiously for probably two months now and have been really disappointed. After two weeks, my face seemed to produce more oil which this product couldn't even begin to control.

His did not fall off. I have a 29er. I think that the engineering is flawed for a 29er. My bike is totaled. After it fell off the first time he put it back on to get it home. He noticed that the arm was slipping back again on the bike wheel and that the wheel was trying to work its way over the back little bar that is supposed to hold it in.

I had previously been holding the new-frame style bike in the old-style Thule rack, complete with a jury rigged system of straps and the whole arrangement was pretty nerve-wracking. Could not believe how well the rack held the bike, so unbelievably steady even at speed. Less tire vibration and movement than the old style racks, even compared with bike frame-styles which they were meant to hold.All in all a very, very good product.Protip: Be sure to pull down the retention arm as tight as possible and get that extra notch click or two.

It's just lift on the roof, ratchet, and strap and away I go. It doesn't look too bad. the carrier is sturdy, my bike is not fly off the roof.

Come on Thule get it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete crap","review":"I have the other Thule car rack that grabs onto the bike frame. It seems easier to use and of higher quality. Comparing this to my other roof rack, this one is unnecessarily difficult to attach to the roof. It also seems to have many components of cheap plastic. I don't get a warm feeling that the ratchet arm will stay locked. Given another chance, I wouldn't get this.After using this for 2 years, I now consider it complete crap. The cheap plastic parts don't work. After only using it 3 times the cheap plastic switch the locks the ratchet arm refused to disengage. This left my bike stuck on top of the car overnight, and I ended up spending an hour getting the bike off. Due to poor quality Thule is dead to me.

Nevertheless, Rudgley builds a solid case for considering whether ancient civilisations were quite a bit more advanced than we think.I was particularly taken with the idea that writing was invented by accountants. Apparently, clay tokens were made in the thousands to help people count how many cattle were being sold or transported. Later, they encased them in clay containers. Later still, they marked the outside before the container was fired, to show how many containers were inside it. This meant that they didn't need to break the container to count them.And hey presto, you have representational markings that later developed into written language.The book also covers things like knives, surgery, fire, mining, art, musical instruments, all existing in the Upper Paleolithic Period, way before the generally accepted periods for these developments."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 years of innovation???","review":"I have repeatedly been disappointed in our Rubbermaid laundry baskets.

Fat chance! Half of the baskets we bought just a couple of years ago have already lost their handles. (Strangely, some of them have stayed completely intact...I don't know the difference, since we abuse all of our laundry baskets equally.)

At first it took a long time to get anything and was a bit painful because of sore nipples, but after a couple pumping sessions it worked great. I also own the Lansinoh Affinity Double Electric Breast Pump, I used it for awhile because the manual one took too long and I needed to pump a lot. I now prefer the manual one. I have larger breasts and the electric pump does not get a good enough suction for me personally. With the manual pump I can take between 10 and 15 minutes and get between 3 and 6 oz out of both breast depending on when my son last nursed.

I actually like it better than my electric pump of the same brand (see above link) as it's quicker to set up and also more convenient to tote around.

By far the best part however is how you can beat the crap out of it and it will keep on going. I've had this pump for nearly a year, use it almost daily, have taken it everywhere with me, I've dropped it, beat it in a diaper bag, washed it in the dishwasher hundreds of times now, all of this and this beast still works like a champ!

In desperation, I tried this manual pump. Wow! For me, it's much more efficient than the Purely Yours Ultra. With this, I can get about 3 ounces in 20 minutes (that's really good for me). With the Purely Yours, I was lucky to get half that in 20 minutes, and that was pumping both breasts at once. I also like the fact that with the Lansinoh, I don't have to worry about things like tubing and batteries and AC power. Mine does squeak from time to time, as some other reviewers have noted.

I tried it with and without the silicone insert, and there is little suction. A few times, I pumped nothing.

It does not compare to the $1800 hospital pumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!!","review":"i was searching and searching for a breast pump that would work great and not cost me an arm and a leg......when i recieved my pump it was easy to get started....no problems....except my hand gets a lil tired...but thats not the pumps fault...it works great...easy to use..easy to clean up....no problems so far...i love this product..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pump","review":"For my wife, very easy to use and put together. Good suction, much better than the Medela manual pump. Takes 15 min to pump for 4 oz (she doesn't have that much milk supply), but half as long as the Medela pump and no pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste ur money","review":"this worked for a few weeks...now its not working at all. I do not know if it is possible for a manual pump not to work but its not working...even when my breast is full"},{"rating":"2","title":"gets the job done","review":"This was the first and only breastpump that I have used for my 5 month old. I nurse him for the most part, but pump when I need to have a backup, like when we go out somewhere that I dont feel comfortable nursing.It is very gentle and does a good job of getting milk out fast. I like that it comes with a base to keep the bottle from toppling over and wasting precious milk. Also, it comes with a lot of extras like a replacement rubber valve, 2 bottles with screw tops that you can screw most standard nipples right on, also a few milk storage bags and directions for storing milk.The only negative thing I have to say is that the clear rubbery section at the top is so difficult to clean and get completely dry. I always feel like Im going to break something, si I end up just rinsing it best I can, but never feel like it is completely clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little suction, even with replacement.","review":"I have owned this pump for two weeks. The first 2 days, it worked okay - It got a little bit out at a time. Then, it worked even less. I can extract more milk by squeezing my breasts. I had all the parts replaced that had to do with suction and it still doesn't work well. I used another pump so I know it's not my milk supply. I wish I'd gotten the Avent pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Simple Pump!","review":"I purchased this manual pump to replace an inconvenient, expensive electric pump.It is so Much easier and quicker to pump both sides with this than setting up and breaking down my electric.I own 2 of these so I always have one clean and ready to go. I have been able to save so much milk using this because of how easy it is to use & clean. I will be buying these as gifts for all of my nursing friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epresses Milk well...but squeeks WAY too much!","review":"Okay...let me first say that for the price this is a great pump for expressing milk. I get the same amount of milk generally with this that I can get with my double electric avent pump. However, I rated this product with a 2 star because it squeeks so badly. It started squeeking within 2 weeks! Now, I did read reviews before purchasing and remember others stating that it would squeek as well. BUT...I had no clue how loud...it IS LOUD! The only way that I can get it to stop squeeking once it starts is to pull the pump handle to the side while pumping...annoying. Also, despite that it comes with two membranes it is already losing suction. I think it might have to do with the handle though.Overall this is an okay pump to get you buy until you can get a better one but I wouldn't plan on it lasting very long. In this case you get what you pay for.The nipple cream made by this company is amazing though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those with low supply","review":"I have had serious supply issues since my baby was born and have been a pumper/supplementer since my (now 3-month old) baby was 2 weeks using the Medela Freestyle (which has been great). Recently went on vacation and forgot my charger. I couldn't find a universal charger at the store, so I bought this pump instead based on the good reviews. The Lansinoh manual pump didn't work for me at all. I got about 5 ccs from each side, and my hand practically fell off while pumping (did about 15 minutes each side). I had to go back to the store and keep searching for a charger so I could use the Freestyle again and not ruin my already limited supply.As a point of reference, I typically pump 15-20 minutes each session with my double pump, and I also pump at the the second highest and highest settings. So, if you are a person with supply issues and someone that requires a great deal of suction, this is NOT the pump for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Medela manual, is the better pump","review":"I purchased both the Medela and Lansinoh manual pumps, and found the Medela to be the better pump for a number of reasons:- Lansinoh squeaks when you pump- More parts to dissamble and clean- entirely loses suction if there is even a tiny amount of moisture anywhere in the plastic components- handle does not pivot, less comfortable- plastic looks cheapIn comparison, the Medela is easy to clean, dry and reuse. Will retain suction with a little moisture present. Handle pivots so more comfortable to pump. I found it easier to pump one-handed. It is MUCH quieter. Any basic bottle will screw in. It looks higher quality.The only thing I like better about the Lansinoh is the flange is angled downward and it isn't on the Medela, so milk will spill if you don't lean forward.I wish I didn't buy the Lansinoh. I threw away 30$."},{"rating":"2","title":"unusual","review":"I wanted on unusual pendant, something not everyone else had. I like this one. This is the first piece of pewter jewelry I've owned.

Unfortunately, being a Delphi developer there is just too little reference material out there. Don't get suckered into buying any book with misleading titles. I happen to own the previous versions Developer's handbook and the Mastering Delphi book. I barely use them. This book like the others are geared more for beginners. Too many examples that don't apply to anything. My first purchase was a mistake, my second purchase was just plain stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners...","review":"OK - a very simple review. We have this book at the office both in the 4 and 5 versions. We also have the Teixeira book (\\"Developers guide\\"). Cantu actuallly does a good job for beginners and the text quality is ok. There could easily be some more depth and better (intelligent) examples.We actually have a joke that you *never* find anything in this book. For language reference/tutorial: this is *not* it. For the components: This is definitely *not* it. I really don't know what this is for, except as an introductory overview... in... 1250 pages ! Pretty strange really.So I dunno - nice book but still not very helpful. Does *not* go beyond Delphi's own documentation. Doesn't even cover that much. Your still gonna be looking through source and wondering what's going on here and there.Sidenote: Still haven't found any good book on Delphi components. For language, real-world programming - Teixeira is much better. We ordered the O'reilly book, hope it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Sybex book!","review":"I respect and admire Marco Cantu for his contribution to the Delphi community.

From my point of view you don't have to already Know Object Pascal and old version of Delphi to read a book that is selfrated as All Levels. So if you are looking for something to start with THIS IS DEFINETELY NOT THE BOOK YOU NEED. Do i have any recommendations for alternatives? Well i don't but i am working on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Unstructured","review":"The content is spewed all over the place. The book is not well structured. Cantu knows Delphi extremely well but writing a book is a different ball game than development. Had the book had an excellent editor it would certainly come out better than what it is today. I doubt if the next version covering Delphi 6 is going to be any better.If you are new to delphi or coming from VB than try tom swans book \\"delpihi bible\\". It is more coherent and structured. For an advanced Delphi book, I have yet to find one that really shines. Most of them are so, so.Overall - yes you will benefit a little if you hang on it long enough and that is where the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner Luck....

I believe that as soon as i have that experience under my belt that this book by MARCO CANTU will be very greatly appreciated. It is definately NOT a book for BEGINNERS! INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED users I reccommend this book but BEGINNERS NO!I think i'll get a copy of Delphi 3 for Dummies because hopefully that will teach me what i need to know.

THANX BYE"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read other reviews before buying this book :(","review":"It is VERY badly structured, not at all comprehensive (despite the number of pages), and definitely not for the beginner who actually wants to do something rather than just marvel at the brilliance of Delphi 5.For example, all I wanted to do (initially at least) was read some data (from an ascii text file) into an array and after processing it chuck the results out into another text file. Not until page 8 hundred and something was file I/O mentioned and then it was promptly ignored.Reading this book made me think that I had to build a database in order to do this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, almost excellent","review":"This is a great book. My complain is that sometimes it leaves you wanting for more and he says a lot of times to check the source code from the web site. Also while reading you get incomplete code (printed) and you keep wondering how the code should work, due that you have to read the code that must be downloaded from the web site. This book is not for the beginner starting to learn Delphi and neither for advanced developers. If you are in a line between these levels, then this book is for you.Marco gives great tips to make your apps look like commercial apps and good HOW-TO'S. The chapter about component development is fair and the webbroker is good.Anyway when I finished reading the book (from cover to cover) I was satisfied, but I wanted more.Another book to check is the Developer's Guide for Delphi 5 from Texeira and Pacheco."},{"rating":"2","title":"christmas visual","review":"this vidio should have been longer than 30 minutes with its beautiful visual of snow covered fir trees and glorious settings.The author of such serene splendor would only be God Himself ...which is no doubt the reason the songs selected are traditional religious instrumental songs to create an effect that is simply glorious , so glad I decided to order this one.

Brian Pendreigh's biographies are interesting and incisive, his history of Scottish film brief but informative. What would make it a five star book is a conclusion. He discusses the interconnections between today's Scottish actors but comes to no conclusions about how this influences their work and Scottish film in general.

That's the explanation.We men will never understand it because\\"men are not as motivated by love as women are,\\" according to the author. Men are focused on hobbies, careers, and mechanical things, more than love.I can see why any woman needing a ego lift would love this book and rate it 5 stars.The other problem with this book is it assumes men can't communicate as well as women, when the reverse is true. Most women hint around at what they want from a man, indirectly, thinking, \\"If he really loved me, he would know that this is so important to me without my telling him,\\" nonsense.A woman complains that a man is a poor communicator when she finds out that he can't read her mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guys opinion is that it was written for women","review":"I can sum up the book like this:Women want men to know that they should 1) stop doing the things that annoy women and 2) stop complaining about and learn to love the things women do that annoy us men (after all, she only does them because she loves you and you wouldn't really want her any other way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"My girl friend sent me this book - I dumped her.","review":"If a woman in my life is going to dangle sex in front of me to get what she wants, she can go stand on the street corner to get other guys to get what she wants.Why do women think men should \\"communicate\\" like them all the time!

The waist on this jacket was about 12 inches too big. The arms were 6+ inches too long. Does Turfer think us 3X guys really have62 inch waists and 42 inch long arms?

The sleeves are plenty long, but the X-Large jacket itself falls just a little below the waist.The material is quality grade and not too light. However, the stitching on one of the velcros was unraveling and I had to sew it back in to place.I made the mistake of using \\"expedited\\" shipping since I needed it for a trip. Paying $17.49 was a complete waste of money. Turns out, standard shipping at $7.98 would have arrived only one day later.

The jacket itself appears to be good quality. However, Turfer refuses to refund my shipping charges (I paid for expedited delivery.)

Until I saw the CD that is included, I was worried that it may not cover all of the areas I am used to referring to in this series. But then I found the CD, including more advanced topics such as editing the Registry, advanced networking, using the Windows Scripting Host, setting up web sites, and a huge section on gaming, including network gaming. It looks like about 800 additional 'pages' are on the CD. The CD format makes searching for subjects easy, and the information is right there on the computer - where I need it.

The good news is that the films look simply amazing; they have been restored with tremendous care and loaded down with extras. The bad news is that it's such a random collection of Bond movies that don't really belong together. All you do is frustrate fans.

This one is mostly talk and car chases, with a group of humans searching for uncontaminated water in the post-nuke future, dealing with biker gangs, and as the video box proclaims, \\"horribly scarred nuclear mutants!\\" You only see one mutant, for a split second, and it just looks like a guy with Silly Putty stuck to his face. The same biker gang pops up again and again, and the leader refers to everyone as \\"mothergrabbers.\\" It's pretty boring for the most part, and the extremely weak ending renders the entire movie pointless, literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stunts are good!","review":"Mad Max is the inspiration for this film as the characters drive around in souped up cars with extra bits stuck on them.

I thought it would be fun. I kept watching it in hopes of finding something to justify my time. It kept getting more and more stupid and pointless. I watched it to see how stupid stupid could be. It was exceptionally bad. I maintain that all coppies of this movie should be gathered together, put in a pile in a vacant field and burned. The ashes should then be salted so that nothing could ever grow there again. Perhaps that would be too extreme but I rather disliked the movie. I also talked to the video store manager for several minutes about how bad it was. There is an hour or two of my life I wish I had back. If you like this type of movie perhaps you would like it.

It was like a motivational speaker with a 6th grade education. LIFT HARD, LIFT HARD, LIFT HARD! What does that mean? No technique explanation. No routines. No examples. No anatomy or bio-physics explained. The only redeeming value is he introduces odd-object lifting i.e atlas stones, kegs, huge rocks which is actually helpful and functional, but he doesn't explain why it works or how to make your own. This book is like MEIN KAMPF for weightlifters. I would suggest 'Power to the People' if you want to get strong.

Believe it or not, tansy, which kills livestock if consumed in very small amounts, was not listed in the book. Things like apples (the seed), castor bean, foxglove, etc. were listed... but these were items that most experienced horse people know about already. I found the information to be too simplistic for my needs, and I would suggest that anyone who keeps horses on their property needs to purchase a more comprehensive book such as \\"A Guide to Plant Poisoning of Animals in North America\\".

I used it to dress some steaks, chop some ginger, and other miscellany around the kitchen. I have another one of these with my camping gear but have not used it outdoors yet.I gave it four stars because it was not sharpened properly out of the box. There was a section of the blade along the curve that was almost dull. The rest of the blade was razor sharp so it made it quite obvious. It does sharpen well after running it through a fixed-angle sharpener, but because the steel is so hard, be prepared to exert some pressure initially. The sheath is adequate. It has a belt clip that pops off too easily.

If Ms. Adams wishes to be a vegetarian feminist, that's her business.

Never once in her book does she consider the obvious fact that meat has always been a normal part of the human diet in the vast majority of cultures, and that maybe, just maybe, people (including women) eat meat simply because it tastes good.

It's a predictable diatribe against high consumption that dwells too much on SUV-driving residents of McMansions and overemphasizes a romanticized 1950s-style family/neighborhood life as the alternative vision. Can we really end the consumerist era by turning back the hands of time and restoring puritanical values? Would we even want to? To imagine a post-consumerist future, we need ideas more original and forward-looking than are found in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"I knew there was something wrong with society, but it took this book to help me identify what intensified this mad race for the almighty thing. I appreciated that she was able to include scientific data without interrupting the follow of the book. I also liked the voice in this book better then some of the down shifting memoirs I was looking at at the time. It was a great combo of readability and scientific backing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a boring psychology book.","review":"I am disappointed that Juliet Schor insulted many of her readers by using the out of date reference to women as housewives throughout her book.

I was looking for a new perspective on money and Schor delivered. In fact, I found the content so inspiring that I'm making dramatic life changes to bring my consumption in line with my values rather than the media/culture induced ones I've blindly been following. There are excellent references in the bibliography/notes section that I've gone on to read as well. Not only is this book a good read, so are the texts the author quotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need to re-write the American dream.","review":"This was an excellent sequel to Schor's book, \\"The Overworked American\\". Her original and referred research made it clear that her thesis was valid (bolstering the missions of groups such as the Center for the New American Dream and the New Road Map Foundation). I wish she had continued more lengthily, however, with some non-acedemic suggestions on how to prepare your own plan of change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed..thank goodness for the library","review":"Let's be frank: what this book describes is a real problem in America--rampant consumerism. However, after this point is beaten like the dead horse it is, the author degrades into slamming \\"polluting, congestion-oriented, etc.\\" sport-utility vehicles and encouraging us to join some \\"downshifting\\" clubs. These clubs sound suspiciously like hippie communes. I should have expected more from a professor. But the rants go on and on, so my interest dwindled. Also, don't be fooled about the page count; almost 1/3 of the pages are references.If you want a good book about consumer habits, read \\"The millionare next door.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacked the whole truth","review":"Lacked the truth on the basis this exist any way.We as a nation have given them the right to do it.We want to over analize all aspects of human nature, which in part is brought out in this book.But the real truth is we need to get in a real world about our own finances.The real truth how we prey on one another for are social acceptance,in material hording we dispose of are freedom.We also become a nation of cut throats to attain the top of heap mentality which is so rampant today.As a member of a labor union i have seen first hand this type of reasoning .From all for one to me me me is never more apparant than now .So maybe a good follow up would be ,The cut throat american."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, many people could use this reality check!","review":"A real wake up call to how many of us live everyday! Lots of interesting statistics, and very matter of fact. Many real-life stories, but not enough advice on step-by-step ways to get out of this destructive pattern of living. Also, I found it really funny that several times the author mentions \\"Car with Air Conditioner\\" as a luxury! To many people, this is obviously NOT a luxury..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick and interesting perusal of our dire straits","review":"This book is certainly worth reading, particularly if you are just embarking on a voyage sparked by a little nagging feeling that perhaps we don't need all those shoes, shirts, suitcases, toys, etc. crowding up our houses, which maybe feel a little too sprawling, in an neighborhood that is a little too over-developed...This book is a great introduction to the rampant consumerism dominating American culture -- to our wealth and the waste it has spawned -- and gives you some great solutions to avoiding the downslide yourself, and mending those areas that may need mending, both personally and socially. The author could have taken out most of the middle of the book, in which she details the lives of some \\"downsizers\\" -- it is not terribly helpful unless your situation is nearly identical to one of those downsizers, and so I skipped it. Otherwise, this book is a quick read and well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book! A. Bates keeps the suspension going!","review":"The suspension is great! You'll never guess who did it!!

Its dimensions were larger than a piece of glitter; I pulled on other bristles to find out exactly how this toothbrush is made, but to no avail.

Excellent reading and an interesting look at an outstanding police approach to street crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missleading Title","review":"I respectfully disagree with the other evaluations of the book, it is a long rant; yes, a tirade. The book is the author's personal reflections on society, that anyone who is schooled in the christian faith can figure out themselves. The title suggests that the reader will find the book to be a resource a place of suggestions to practice christian life, however, that is not what the book is. Each chapter is basically a critical essay, and leaves the reader more dispondent about the direction of the universal christian church and how christian life fits into the larger society. The last chapters refer to eastern religions and yet on the cover it says, \\"genuine christianity for the m iddle class\\".

Her knowledge of human dynamics, motivations and the etiology or their pathologies is beyond other authors I have read. I have spent the last 50 years working in child abuse and children's protective services so I have lived in a world of the kind of pathologies she writes about. I can safely say that her villains are so authentic that I know she has walked among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot","review":"FBI Special Agent Pierce Quincy suspects his daughter's death was not the result of drinking and driving, but foul play. He hires novice investigator Rainie Conner to look into the matter for him, which seems to open up a hornet's nest. After Pierce's ex-wife is murdered, Rainie believes that the women close to Pierce are being targeted by a psychopath intent on seeking revenge against Pierce.This is the first book I've read by Lisa Gardner, and I am so pleased to have found a new mystery author to read.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll keep you reading","review":"The story of the book is great because albeit Quincy is a renown shrink he didn't resolve the case just because he knew how thugs think, you'll understand each step on the book. The problem is that it has some boring parts and some parts that you wouldn't understand if you didn't read first \\"The Third Victim\\". The best thing about writing continuous books is that you can read any one of the series without reading the first ones and understand it.Maybe what I've should done was make one book of these two and make one big story, but I've to accept that the first book was pretty better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"When insanity rules","review":"I know that books can't be all logical and orderly but since when do they have to be mostly about the psychotic always being one step ahead of the supposed hero resulting in heart wrenching losses of love, innocence and immediate family? I kept thinking the plot would change and there would be some discernment, some redeeming value in this twisted, truncated book where insanity and evil rules until even a tortuous retribution wouldn't provide a remedy. I get upset when authors lead me on and to be fair, I let myself be lead into frustration and loss of my time thinking that I've read good books by this author so the book will get better. They don't. I'm going to stop reading a book if there isn't something positive going on by the thirtieth page. To do anything else is setting myself up to waste my time reading about the lunatics running the asylum.

The novel has everything a reader needs: Romance, suspense, surprise and gripping drama that makes you want to keep turning the page.

Luckily, there are some great, obscure tracks in this series (vols. 1-3) which rightfully rescue them from the bargain bin. \\"Savage Lover\\" and \\"Fear\\" are particularly good, but most of this stuff is GAY GAY GAY from back in the day - if you were around in the clubs late 70s/early 80s this will definitely tickle your ears, but if you like melodic (euro)disco with traditional song structures you could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine and musical effort","review":"I don't know if the strict early music folks would approve of these interpretations--the women's voices, the significantly slower tempos, the overall \\"prettier\\" effect than that of some of the purist renditions--but the recording itself, including at times the sounds of rain captured outside the building, is admirable. It lacks some of the fat sound associated with ECM recordings (I am convinced ECM uses significant compression in their issues.) but neither is it thin as many of the Naxos efforts.

When you put the pencil in, it won't stop when the pencil is sharpened. It'll keep sharpening and breaking the lead. I never know when to pull the pencil out when sharpening. The pencil is either not sharpened yet or the lead has been broken and stuck inside. I'll have to open the tray and empty it before I can remove the broken lead that's stuck inside.

I thought the blade was dull and that it really was a waste until my dad and I decided to tinker with it. It seems that if you place the batteries wrong it will rotate reverse like and wont sharpen.

Sometimes the painted shavings would come off in a spiral and wind around the sharpening mechanism. Just removing the plastic cover doesn't turn off the motor. Take out the batteries!

After reading the reviews, and deciding to purchase it, I anticipated receiving a great working sharpener for little money!NOT THE CASE. After \\"teaching\\" my students how to work the sharpener - hold the pencil firmly, press VERY gently, take it out quickly - over and over again, it broke. It constantly would break the lead off the pencil and get stuck in the sharpener. And finally it just completely quit working. So after only four weeks of school, it is getting no use whatsoever but collecting dust in my desk, while my students are back using 99cent plastic sharpeners. It worked great for me personally, but for a classroom of young adults/teenagers, it is not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"just about every time i've ever use this thing it pulls the lead out of the pencil and clogs the sharpening device with said lead. you have to take it apart and dig out the lead and then grind away another inch of pencil to compensate for the lead that fell out. if you are very lucky you only need to waste about 3-4 inches of pencil to get one point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Chucked It.","review":"This thing was a disaster, and I gave it a chance. Really, I did. A few years.... It simply chews up pencils. Just when you think it's almost sharp, snap! Broken lead, and somehow, it breaks the lead way down the shaft so you have to chew off another inch or two before you finally get something resembling a sharp pencil. So frustrating!Oh, and don't even get me started on what happens to those broken leads! You have to take off the shaving-catcher/cover thing and get something like a toothpick to dislodge it while the darn blade keeps moving..... Arrrggghh! Then, when you try to put the cover back on, it feels as though it's going to break, (though in all fairness, it never did).In. The. Trash. Can.

A 10 cent sharpener attached to a motor.","review":"Being an artist, I know pencil sharpeners and this one is a poor sharpener.Not only does it not work on arrival, it's also basically a 10 cent craft sharpener attached to a motor, no different from the hand held single bladed sharpeners you see in the kids craft section. The best sharpeners use the dual rotating spiral cutters.Edit: I finally figured out what was wrong, but it's not worth the effort to use. Basically, when the lid covering the shavings area is closed, it doesn't put enough pressure on the safety switch that prevents the sharpener from turning on while the shavings cover is open. To get it to turn on, you must put extra pressure on the switch to get it working."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best sharpener","review":"Even though the sharpener is compact and battery operated (which is a plus, no plugs) it doesn't sharpen art pencils very well.

Everytime I use this sharpener, it breaks the tip off the end of my pencil, and then the tip is lodged in a place that prevents the pencil from being sharpened until I take the thing apart and clear it out. I usually have to go through this process several times before I'm able to sharpen my pencil.

This is a great piece of 80's nostalgic animation, with decent voice acting, a pretty good story, and the music really helps to give the film a dramatic boost.

I don't know if Amazon.com has anything against refering to other possible sites but there are a bunch of people selling Flight of Dragons on DVD on Ebay! I came here thinking this is the only place to find it, because me and my friend saw it with The Last Unicorn in a two pack on VHS a couple years back. Then I found Last Unicorn on DVD at a nearby video store and have been looking ALL OVER TOWN for a copy of Flight of Dragons. I knew it was sold here but all I found was VHS. My little 12 year old sister is the one that made the recommendation to go to Ebay and look and I nearly fell over in disbelief when I FINALLY saw it on DVD! I haven't seen it in 15 years, and I'm hoping it will be as great of an experiance for my sister as it was for me when I was her age. I hope all of you that are seeking it on DVD can find it, Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Not Play At All","review":"I adore this movie and have since my teens, and had been waiting for at least 10 years for it to come out on DVDBut now I have a copy it will not play.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I don't like it. The illustrations and colors were decent. The storyline was dumb.

I hadn't seen it for years, but it came up today in conversation, and I found that I could accurately remember many of the minute details of the very memorable characters. Along with making \\"Antiquity\\" my favorite word, this movie has lovable wizards and elves, and an intriguing plot with fantastic ideas. It made me want to be a dragon when I grow up. Still hasn't happened.

Thank my lucky stars that it has come out again on tape. Huhzaah! This is such a good movie, with fantasy,suspense and fun. It can get a little hairy twards the end but the art and detail that is done threw out the show is such a treat. I recomend this to anyone who liked the hobbit, or even the last unicorn. Cheers! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"I had rented this at request of my 6 year old, and I thought I would read something while he watched another mind numbing tape... But it turned out to be a well made adventure yarn involving dragons, wizards, science, time travel, and such. Very enjoyable with good voice work, good music, and art design. I agree with another reviewer who said the art on the box is not near as good as the animated art in the film. I enjoyed the rental enough to start looking for our own copy of the film, and luckily Amazon.com had it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pits","review":"If you've never heard of this movie, it's for good reason. ... The animation and music are poor, the dialogue is definitely not kid level, and the storytelling is insipid.In the first 10 minutes of the movie, we see cartoon atom bombs going off and cartoon bulldozers knocking down trees. In the same 10 minutes, a swan fails to look where it's going and runs into the water wheel of a mill along the river. This incident prompts the main wizard to launch a magical attack on the mill for attacking the harmony of nature. Fun this is not.We turned this movie off, much to the approval of our 6 year old daughter, and tried \\"The Secret Garden\\" (1987 version). The latter movie was excellent for both adults and kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my long time favorite movie.","review":"Flight of Dragons is by far my most favorite movie. I saw it for the first time some 10 years ago or so and I still watch it every now and then when ever I have the time. I am, as the shop keeper would put it, \\"a dragon fanatic.\\" I love the way dragon flight and fire are explained and how, theoretically, they would work. I do however wish the dragons wouldn't have been portrayed as being so clumsy and awkward. If you have read much of dragons you would know that, for the most part, they are graceful and intelligent. The mix of fantasy and logic is captivating and the plot to save magic before it is utterly destroyed is awesome. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if the cover art looks like a childs coloring book illustration. The actual animation is great, especially the dragons."},{"rating":"2","title":"they just don't make enough movies like this...","review":"Don't let the cover photo fool you. This film is a wonderfully animated work in the tradition of the hobbit and other fantasy animated classics. And where other films rely on their visuals to pull the eye along, this film has an entertaining, and well conceived plot, pitting the forces of magic and science against one another, interdependent, yet symbiotic in nature. i can't say enough about this in-depth look at the world of dragons, mystics, scientists and mortals."},{"rating":"2","title":"(No Title)","review":"I first saw this movie when I was very young and have loved it ever since.

This was one of my kids (now 28 and 30 years old) favorite movies. I was so happy to find it on DVD. Great mix of D&D and the story of Merlin.

Lammle's ACRC book has little to offer and I don't recommend it, especially when my copy has an ENTIRE chapter missing! But the publisher made up for it by giving me TWO chapter 3's. LAME is how I rate the Exam Notes book. Download the objectives off the Cisco site, buy Chappell's book and you will pass the ACRC.

How can I tell if a book is really good or bad by reading reviews written by the competition of another book? I read the ACRC Notes book and found it a very good book.

I have tried turning on the second setting with the lowest temp and it just got me all of 120 seconds of warmth.Tried resetting it several times.

I was really disappointed by this heater because they have added an incredibly loud fan to the unit, one which you can't disable. When the thermostat turns on it is really loud, to the point that it distracts me if I'm reading. I can imagine it would also be a problem if you were trying to sleep in the same room with it. I returned it and bought a ceramic heater, it's less noisy than this one.

Well, it's certainly done that! My latest electric bill was about $100 less than the previous one, despite keeping this little heater going 24/7 on most days. I was worried that keeping it on too much would be problematic, but over a month of daily use has not caused any issues at all. It heats up any enclosed room easily, but can also keep you warm in any open area (as long as it is pointing at you). The only thing keeping me from giving this heater a perfect score is the handle. The handle area that you're supposed to grab it from, in order to carry it around, is overly slippery. It's very smooth and there is no indentation for your fingers to get a good grip on it, so don't try picking it up with anything but very dry hands, because you will drop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference manual","review":"I have been a Quicken user since 1995, and I believe that the best way to learn the software is to start using it to manage your money.

The installation description is no help whatsoever; I eventually stumbled across Usenet where I found instant solutions for the problems I was having. This book takes a \\"cross your fingers and pray that the installation works properly, and if it doesn't, you're stuck on your own\\". This book covers too many topics and not in enough depth. I recommend buying \\"Running Linux\\" by O'Reilly & Associates for beginners, or \\"Essential System Administration\\" by the same company for people who want a little more in depth coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is of no value for Linux users","review":"Hello, I'm the reader from Edmotnon Canada and I would like to make a second comment if I may.\\"Mastering Linux\\" is a book that was a waste of time to write and it is a waste of time to the reader. If anyone is filing charges against the author, I would love to participate.The book states on the back cover: Whatever you want to achieve with Linux, MAstering Linux Premium Edition makes it easy, providing the clear instruction and unique insights of a Linux expert who understands the needs of the non-Unix world.That does sound good, doesn't it? It was the reason why I bought the book.Mr. Arman Danesh, you suck and so does your book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"i found this book to be very well written and i think the author did a great job of evoking a creepy, sad and dysfunctional mood. usually that works for me, but i couldn't wait for the book to end. i think the only reason i finished it was to find out what horrible thing befell the family, b/c it was clear something did. there was such buildup, i suppose the ending couldn't help but be a disappointment. also, i found the style to be mostly introspective, and that became wearying after awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is season 2?","review":"Hey, come on you makers of dvds! Where is season two? If you start something you have to finish it in good time. You took our money for season one, you owe us the rest. If it's the money you're worried about, everybody knows that the first season of any show is usually not the best season, just keep 'em coming, we'll buy. Please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knots Landing-A blast from the past!","review":"If you are a dedicated Knots Landing fan, you will enjoy this. Considering the fact that it has literally been some 20 years since I last watched the early shows in the series I was taken back a bit. Things are certainly done differently now a days! The episodes are borderline cheesy, but what fun if you're a true fan!With this being series one you get to see how it all started and who was there in the beginning. There are 13 episodes plus a special feature on which Gary and Val reminisce a bit. Enjoy it for what it is. I sure do and can't wait to buy all the rest of the seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How exciting","review":"I am a huge fan from the UK and I know we wont get this for a while so I am over the moon I have able to pre-order from the USA.

This 5-disc DVD box set contains all the thirteen episodes of the first season. I like these episodes and the crossover episodes in which J.R. and Lucy appear. Excellent. I would have liked to see more extras though."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favourite Drama","review":"I first started watching knots in 1991 when i was 11 years old and it was shown on BBC1 during the school summer holidays (It was season 10 -abby's fake japenese company murikame & jill trying to kill val -excellent stuff!). I have since seen and taped almost all the episodes from satellite tv.To anyone new to the show, I would stress that the show gets a lot better than this first season. Like real people, the characters really grow throughout the 14 years. The stories may get far-fetched at times, but the emotions of the characters never do - they always seem real. There are some good episodes in this first season, my personal favourite being \\"The Lie\\" featuring the excellent Constance McCashin.In summary, an excellent series with great acting from the whole cast. As far as this season goes: good...but the best is yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adult Show","review":"Soap operas today are ridiculous. They're so out of touch with reality that I find it senseless to even turn them on. Where have all the good soap operas gone? If only a new generation of Knots Landing kids could emerge adults and take over the television screen.Seriously though, Knots Landing is a marvelous show with complicated plots and lots of twists and turns. In each episode, you will either grow to love or grow to hate the characters, but you won't want to stop watching. So if you need an escape from your day-to-day life, put the kids to bed and plop in a copy of Knots Landing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knots Landing First Season.","review":"A must for all fans of the 14 year show. Very good quality and packaging. We are waiting for the other 13 seasons!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"It's an awesome first season. Just can't wait for the next one to come out!!!!!!!Trust me it gets better every year. Wait till abby and paige hits town!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Continue Releasing This GREAT Series!","review":"I watched Dallas and Falcon Crest in the 80's, but missed Knots Landing because I was moonlighting. I figured I would give it a try, and I AM HOOKED! I am absoulutely blown away by Michelle Lee's acting. Did she win Emmys? She deserved 14--one for each year! And Ted Shackelford is just perfect as the sexy and vulnerable Gary Ewing. I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of Joan Van Ark's Val; so much so, that I love the character! How can Warner Bros. deny us this long-running SERIAL?? Do they not realize that, like me, once hooked on the first season, people will continue? Additionally, it is my understanding that with the addition of the Abby character in the second season, the show really took off. C'mon guys, give us our Knots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Very excited when I got these. I loved knots landing so much and was very sad when it went off the air. Hope you get the other episodes. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful old memories!","review":"I grew up in Mauritius watching Knots dubbed in French back in the 80s and early 90s before moving to Britain where I saw the last season of it in English in 1994. I have to say that I am pretty content with this DVD set, as almost every bit of it is a joy to watch. Unfortunately, no announcements about forthcoming releases of subsequent seasons have been made. I cannot understand why this is so - a soap as popular as Knots Landing was (and is) should naturally follow in the footsteps of the other biggies of its time (Dallas etc). In the meantime, I'll hang on to my first season buy, and shall keep my fingers crossed in anticipation of the second and other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knots Landing","review":"I love this show I was very happy to see it out on DVD.

I can't wait until subsequent seasons are released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt","review":"I read the whole series about 10 years. Its a great read did not have Matt in my to keep books. So I ordered and had a good night of reading. Matt is one of the orphans in this cowboy series from Leigh Greenwood. Each story told is after the book Jake. It was great to read how these men went on with their lives. I like the series and have reread them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Since I ordered this book through Focus on the Family, I was really expecting something with some substance & in keeping with my moral & spiritual values. So I was very surprised with the light, fluffy, over-simplified approach to this very difficult topic. It might be helpful for military spouses or others faced with temporary separation, if they already have a good relationship with their children. But it fell short of offering any real insights on rebuilding and sustaining a relationship in more difficult circumstances such as divorce, etc. I was especially disappointed with the emphasis on pop culture \\"things\\" like movies, music, sports (encouraging betting on teams, etc.) instead of heritage & values that parents can impart to their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get another book.","review":"I'd pick Ben Forta's \\"The ColdFusion web application construction kit\\" over this horribly written excuse for a cold fusion guide any day.Beginners will find this book's layout tedious and confusing as it mixes beginning concepts with those far more advanced.Even the tag and function references are poorly organized and give no examples on their proper usage.The only use I can possibly fathom for this book is for advanced developers to give this book to beginning developers at their firm as a means to help insure their own job security."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for bigenner","review":"This book is very good to begin learning CF, but if you need more advanced topic you have to search for another book. in general it is a useful book ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money....","review":"If you already know the basic CF structure, please don't purchase this book. If you have any question, I suggest you to check the Cold Fusion Reference Guide. This book is not the answer. So don't waste your time and money, here you couldn't find anything new...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Despite the typos that seem to plague all ColdFusion books, this is a great book. It follows a natural progression, building on concepts learned in previous sections so it is easy to follow. It is also not as dry as some technical books I have read, making it easy to stay interested. I have been programming ColdFusion for 3 years, and with this book I was able to strengthen my basic understanding, and add advanced concepts to my repertoire of skills. There is even a section on advanced concepts of SQL. And while this is not as extensive as many books devoted to the subject, it offers good insight in to SQL with out having to purchase yet another tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get to the point","review":"I don't have the time to recreate the little scenarios in this book when I need a question answered. The examples all build on the previous and *BEWARE*, in the book they like to give examples to you, then have you run them to get an error. Sometimes those errors and their verbage about why you wouldn't want to do that are on the next page. Useless as a reference and too vague in the examples given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Linux Armenn....Leave CF to Forta","review":"After breezing through Ben Forta's book, I was excited to read the reviews for this book. I learned nothing more than how to debug and do creative editing to understand what points were trying to be presented. English Grammar classes recommended to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex but ultimately exciting","review":"Do not read this book unless you have read its predecessors in the series, else you will be submerged in a confusing avalanche of subplots and information. The story moves apace and pays homage to the mystique of Sir Francis Richard Burton, the English explorer of the last century. One is left with the sensation that our history has been much involved with warring alien factions, and that, perhaps, more historic anomalies shall be explained, the Knights Templar having been mentioned. The story is, however, compelling and one is carried along with the mystery. The great antiquity of the Sphinx is confirmed and the Arch of the Covenant found. The horrors of nanotechnology released on Easter Island. The sequel is going to have to deal with a lot of problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still incredibly stupid spelling errors!","review":"Yeah, that's what's most memorable about this cheesy book: nothing!The story stretched out too long -- and all to culminate in an enigmatic ending. This is what is known in old Vaudville as cranking it out. Ninety-five perecent of the book was total filler, and at least thirteen percent was back-fill (updating what we already learned from previous novels). The action sequences were few and far away, and not too exciting.But the worst was the spelling. Hey Bob! Get yourself a seeing eye dog! Preferably one who can spell, okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Momentum building","review":"I've been reading this series since the first book, AREA 51, and this one has upped the ante. Each book had its own climax but also left something for the series to continue, but this was the best of the bunch. It had a climax, simply the world being saved which doesn't seem to have been enough for some of the reviewers, but the cliffhanger for the series makes me anticipate the next quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since the original","review":"Just when I was about to give up reading the series (after a very disappointing book 3 -- The Mission), Doherty picks up the pace, raises the stakes, and tightens up the story in this very exciting sequel. I can't wait to start The Grail (book 5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Area 51: The Sphinx","review":"This book was disappointing. The characters were farfetched. The jumps in the story were scattered and in cohesive. The links were too broad and dysfunctional as a storyline. This story was manufactured for retail and lacked SF plausibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series! Plan to get them all!","review":"Highly original, great blend of historical fiction with all out hard SF. Was telling my sister about it and realized the book was so well written that after five books and 3 weeks I was starting to confuse actual history with the book. To me this series was highly plausible. Wish I had thought of the idea myself. Current with the speculation surfing the internet these days about history and the control of events and government from behind the scenes. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of a great story","review":"This is the 4th book of the \\"Area 51\\" series and is another page turner. As with the other books, it is very well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen to the heros next."},{"rating":"2","title":"the start of something big","review":"So this one is really good. it starts to pick up and you get some hints on what is to come. I love the whole idea of these books and there are so many ways that the author can take the story lines. I look forward to reading the rest.I like the story line between Toulette (?) and Duncan. It is interesting as well to see the involvement of our own governments and what they do and do not know.Definitely a fun interesting read that makes you think about what could be out there and behind some of our mysteries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read but start with the first book.","review":"This was the first book I have read by Robert Doherty. What attracted me to the book was the combination of science fiction and ancient Egypt, and I wasn't disappointed. After starting the book I wish I had realized it was a serial and started witht the first book. But overall I found it enjoyable and plan to read the entire series. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt, like the old Serial movies. I guess I will have to wait for the next book to find out what happens. Bravo for Dr. Duncan, a strong female Character.Reminded me a bit of a Dirk Pitt novel with aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Area 51 The Sphinx","review":"I found the book very engaging. I have not read the previous book series but, still found that I understood and loved this book. The combination of military and sci-fi is excellent. I hope the rest are as intresting as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many things wrong","review":"Domestic Violence is a PEOPLE problem. Not a gender issue. The Duluth Model only seeks to embarrass and blame men as if it were exclusively a male characteristic, rather than giving real help to stop abusive behavior. Nevermind that women are just as likely to initiate violence against a man. Programs that use the Duluth Model are only creating an adversarial dynamic between men & women. It clearly reflects the feminist IDEOLOGY of male oppression towards women. So there is obviously a heavy bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall is fine but ...","review":"This book is great for VB COM/COM+ developer but not VC++ developer. The bright side of this book is that is explains from COM/DCOM to COM+ in both VB and VC++. It provides examples for some hard chewing stuff and it explains the COM+ services such as CRM, Roles Based Security, Queue Component and etc...But the dark side is that those tips provided in this book is not accurate, which decrease a star from perfect. For example, the author recommended to use CreateInstance for object creation. This is fine with MTS but not COM+. In COM+, there are no separate runtime as in COM/MTS environment. Instead of the CreateInstance (which is MTS way of implementation) we should use the New operator to create object (which is the COM+ way of implementation).But overall, this is a great book to grab the COM+ in action with VB and VC++.TQ:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the topic","review":"After buying a couple of books on COM+ (or at least had COM+ in the title), I either returned them or did not learn anything. This book offered me an excellent hands on explanation of COM+ features. I really enjoyed it and recommend it. I also got the chance to learn some VB along the way and understanding how implementation is different between VB and VC++. I still won't use VB however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless","review":"The author should not be writing any books but some spend time learning something themselves. I use his earlier book as a foot rest. It is one thing to glean ideas from other books and re-writing the sentences and another thing to copy ideas that one does not understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Machine - 3-in-One!","review":"I was looking for an electric whisk, and also a strong blender to crush ice for smoothies. This machine has both of these features and more! I had also wanted to purchase a food processor, but didn't want too many kitchen accessories for a small kitchen!The Bosch Compact Kitchen Machine with Blender (Item model number: MUM4620UC) is perfect!It has a large mixing bowl (4 quarts) with a splash proof cover, and comes with a dough hook, beating and stirring hook. The six-cup blender crushes ice easily! The food processor slices and shreds vegetables well! All the attachments are easy to attach and take off. The accessories store in a little holder for the discs and hooks.For a compact maching, this is a mighty powerful machine which has multiple uses! I simply love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible -- overpriced, flimsy, hard to clean","review":"Simply an insult to the once-meaningful name of Bosch. This is NOT your mother's Bosch. It's a cheaply made, expensively priced finicky machine that takes 10 minutes to put together and 20 minutes to clean. I have no idea why it received so many favorable reviews. Perhaps some folks are very gadgety, engineering-type people. I'm not. But I know a serious downgrade in quality when I see one and this is it. I can shred meat faster by hand or in a $20 food processor from the local Wal-mart. It sort of kneads dough, but not nearly as well as my bread machine. It shimmies like a dollar-store space shuttle with bread dough. As for the other functions, I'm not bothering to find out. It's going back ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is incorrect","review":"Description is incorrectWe received the part number BOMUM4420UC but it is only 400 watt and not stainless steal as seen in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"mis spellings throughout and very poor grammar","review":"When reading the first 100 pages of this book, I spent most of the time trying to correct the poor grammar of the authors. I find that when I am trying to understand the concepts that incorrect grammar, poor sentence construction, and continued run on sentences are a major distraction. Not to mention endless spelling errors made this book a torture to read. I have therefore abandoned this book as a result of this terrible writing. I am disappointed, Mr. Groth wrote the book to my CCNA course, and that was very impressive. Obviously, not one of his best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book covers everything you need to pass the exam","review":"I took the exam July 13,2000 and passed without any problems.Everything i saw on the exam was covered in this book.The book has over 200 questions.I would have givin it 5 stars if the questions would have giving explinations on way the answer is correct or wrong.Besides that great book.Highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this book. It's good, but it has some errors.","review":"Overall, this book is very well organized and easy to understand. It provides many good examples for the topics discussed and should prep readers very well for the test.However, it appears that this book was rushed to press as there are many spelling and gramatical errors throughout the book. Also, there are some concepts and terms that aren't properly defined or are just plain wrong. Alas, the only one that comes to mind just now is the statement that Linux is a flavor of Unix. Linux is in fact it's own OS that was developed to be as compatible as possible with the UNIX world. Because the kernel was developed from scratch and not modified from an existing kernel, Linux is, therefore, it's own OS.Overall, the book is worth the money for the newbies that are learning new things and the seasoned veteran that wants a broad review of the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but i wish it had been better","review":"This book was good, but unless you are really really advanced you need to get another book to supplement what this one misses in order to be fully prepared. I prefer, with exams like this, to buy one book and just have to learn that. I was disappointed to have to buy another because of topics which I thought this book did not cover well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference Material","review":"I just passed the Network+ test and this book was an outstanding good source of information. It is getting a little dated though and CompTIA is changing the test format in the latter part of 2001, so I don't know how much longer it will be totally useful. I also used \\"Upgrading and Repairing Networks\\" by QUE (2nd Edition) but it wasn't really needed.

However, This book is enough for the Network+ certification. Good Luck !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy and not enough time on test subjects.","review":"I've read through this book 3 times and it was hard to get through each time. The book is an overall good general study book; but, I believe the author spent too much time going over nonimportant subjects. The author could have spent more time on Unix. The test that I took asked a lot of questions about Unix. I did pass the test but I was completely surprised and caught unprepared. I did pass the test but not with a good score. If you do get this book, I would suggest buying another study guide as well just to be able to compare notes and see things from a different angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Explanation of basic terms in networking !","review":"Easy to follow, great examples, and all in plain english.

I was hooked on the Sybex series because of Todd Lammle, what a great author he is. This book was not clear, even inacurate. Level two datagrams are called frames, not packets. Packets exist at layer 3 of the OSI model. This error kept popping up, if I didn't know the real answer I would have missed the question on the test that related to this. The book did not discuss token ring well enough for me, as I have never used it. I would suggest finding another book or going through a Cisco Networking Acadamy, you can get both your CCNA and your Network + certification that way. I felt like I wasted money on this book even though I passed the test the first time.

I read through the book the spent over 50 hours on the pactice tests. i scored 826/900 on the actual exam. that correspnts to roughly 91%. the bad news is that i will need a better book to keep in my office as a reference. if its not on the test, its not in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good study guide.","review":"I used this book, in conjunction with Network + for Dummies. I did very well on the exam. I think this book alone would have been enough. Hard to say for sure. If you're serious, and can afford it, you should always have another book to compliment your studies. The CD contained a great engine for targeting questions by topic. Besides having the typical practice test, it also had every chapter quiz question (from the book) on it. The entire book is also contained on the cd. VERY nice features. The CD did have a few minor glitches though. Drag and drop questions that scored wrong when they were correct, and not being able to use the \\"previous\\" feature in a practice test.

You should have no problem passing."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO ERRORS! I JUST READ THE WHOLE THING! PERFECT!","review":"I just read this cover to cover, and found NO ERRORS.

This book breaks down the test exactly how the test is broken down. This book is an excellent compliment to a class or another more in-depth book. The overriding value of this study guide is the questions at the end of each section and the confidence you will have after using this book as study tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prep book for CCNA exam!","review":"I just passed CCNA on 11/5. This book provides a great guide to study from. If you know your basic OSI stuff and basic router configuration already this book will help you review material that you must know to pass the exam. I would also recommend the practice exam CD from Test Out!. The Test Out! exams are much more difficult than the real exam, so you can test with confidence if you have scored at least 85% on Test Out!. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats Exam Cram hands down!","review":"First of all, yes, the CCNA exam format has changed. There are now a total of 78 questions. Scores are graded 300-1000, with a passing score of 755. You CANNOT mark questions and go back! Time limit is 90 minutes.Now to the book. There are a couple of minor mistakes, but NOTHING like the errors throughout the ExamCram book. If you have to choose between the two, then this is the book for you. Well written, and concise. I think the ExamCram book is structured better, and includes slightly more detail, but the accuracy of the content means you should read it after you've read this book.Good luck studying...Justin Dyson, MCSE, CCNA"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Definitely a good book","review":"It is a good revision book. I would treat it as revision book. I spend about two hours on re-reading this book before going to take the exam. It can refresh me all the key point, all the important notes in CCNA exam. If you just use this book for your exam, I think it is not 100% to ensure you can pass, so I use it with another study guide also by Todd Lammle. I would also like the part of \\"Exam Essentials\\" that can let you know what are the CCNA exam emphasize on, so that you can pay more attention on them. All parts of the content are good enough to let you pass, eg. IOS, LAN switch etc. But the materials about WAN is not good enough actually, even I have read the study guide(not this exam notes), I still cannot 100% handle all the questions about WAN, eg. sth about ISDN, Frame Relay etc. You may need other materials for supplement(I get 75% on WAN protocols).Anyway, it is a good book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy, Read, Learn and succeed!","review":"I was enrolled in the official Cisco course here at Cal State Univ. Monterey Bay. Guess who's book was the textbook? Todd's! Pick up the exam notes to smooth out rough spots after studying with the big Lammle book.

Good job Todd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"Although the exam has changed, this book + some \\"hands on\\" experience is enough to pass. I was preparing for the old exam objectives, only to find out (too late) that the test had indeed changed. None the less, this book was still strong enough to get me a decent passing score.

It served as a great confidence builder, and a great way to brush up on the major points covered on the exam. The author of this book has taken painstaking care to ensure the accuracy of the material covered, and presents it in a very easy to read format. The author admits and cautions the reader that there is no replacement for hands on experience with Cisco Routers and Switches to be able to acquire the understanding necessary to do well on the CCNA exam. This book is absolutely essential. Five Stars ++ !"},{"rating":"2","title":"CCNA EXAM CHANGE","review":"This book was excellent to review and study from! However the exam for the CCNA has changed.

This study guide should be considered just that - a study guide with Q&A. To pass the Cisco CCNA test you will HAVE to study in-depth access-lists, the OSI layers, ISDN, Frame-relay, Novell frame types, default admin distances, routing updates times, switches and types. In my test I was expecting and was prepared for a lot of sub-netting and but only had a few questions. The book I used as my primary study book was \\"Cisco Certified Network Associate\\" by Syngress Media. I also used the Boson Tests as recommended by Todd Lammle. These proved very, very helpful. One more thing, it is also very helpful to practice on a router (at least one). There are 78 questions in 90 minutes and no going back. I passed with a 822. Now I am studying for the ACRC test. Good luck everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subway","review":"Although this book is outdated (2002) it still has a lot of basic inforyou can use.

Even if it's an older book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best review for the $$","review":"This book has the best information for the CCNA exam out there. I found that the information review and some of the techniques (ip addressing within subnets) are outstanding.The one assumption that this book makes, is that you have either done alot of router-sim or have hands-on experience. But it is an excellent review nonetheless.Highly recommended to study right before the exam, work the problems and go through the review points, and you'll feel comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great treats","review":"I got a bunch of these for $1 each at Big Lots(which I later learned was a steal!

Hits like \\"Everytime You Go Away\\", \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\\", \\"What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted\\" and \\"Oh Girl\\" will have you reminiscing about better days. This particular album has all of Young's best hits on one CD, making it easier to get them all without buying several albums.

It was not very clearly stated that this timer only works if you have it in DIRECT sunlight. Didn't work at all because of this. It was in sunlight but not DIRECT sunlight.

I could have purchased a unit from Lowe's or another big box store for 2/3 of the price, however I thought I was receiving a quality product with a lifetime warranty, as stated 3 times in the product page. I received my unit today, opened the box and after carefully reading everything have determined there is not a lifetime warranty. The product its self does not even mention a warranty at all! So if you're like me and skeptical at some reviews, take my advice.

All the other vendors title the sour squeeze pops \\"sour squeeze pops\\", but these guys didn't even have the decency to put the word \\"sour\\" anywhere in the description.

LEGENDS OF THE FERENGI tells how the infamous Ferengi Rules of Acquisition originated. There's lots of humor and good sense to learn. I loved it from beginning to end.

It is read by Quark himself, Armin Shimerman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, pun filled, audio adaption is a winner!","review":"The Ferengi have become the humor sidebar in the Star Trek Universe, and this audio adaption really shines the light upon them. Told by Quark himself, the anecdotes are interwoven amidst a plethora of puns and seqments of wacky music. Tongue is firmly planted in cheek for these tales, but I never found them trite or boring. The Ferengi perspective is a clever idea, and the many chuckles this tape produced made it well worth the money.

I am a real lover of urban fantasy and was interested to read this book. I have enjoyed Jim Butcher and Ilona Andrews and Patricia Briggs and even some of Laurel Hamilton's work (the early ones), but this book was just terrible. Its plot was paper thin and the characters were completely cookie cutter with no depth. The bad guys were pure evil and the good guys pure good. The romance was predictable and boring. It was as if someone took the best of the urban fantasy books and said, \\"I am going to write one too and do it one week\\". I have no interest in trying this author again and recommend that anyone who reads this review head to the other authors that I have mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic twist to vampire lore!","review":"But if one wishes to hold true to the old myths, then they should stick with Bram Stoker. Golden filled me and thrilled me with this one, and there's not been one to compete with it, besides maybe Christy Golden's \\"Vampire of the Mists\\".All around great, with fantastic plot twists and vampires out in the sun. Completely flips the traditional roles of the undead and the church. Although I found it to have quite a weak ending, the rest was bold and imaginative. Truly original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Started off interesting. Halfway through I lost interest. Is it a love story? Romance novel? Action? Adventure?

I'm a huge fan of Lilly Taylor who gives a great performance, along with the other actresses. This has to be the most realistic portrayal of date rape during adolescence I have ever seen. Unlike a lot of movies that sensationalize rape to the point of bordering on soft porn, this movie skips the graphic details and gets straight to the business of empowering its female characters. Warning: this movie is dangerous to the dominate power structure, which is probably why you can't rent it at Blockbuster..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest adventure story I have ever read!","review":"The way in which the author ties all the great events and treasures of earth togather is absolutely fantastic. He paints such a beautiful fascinating tale, you can't quit. The characters are great and so believable. The alian intrusion and influence is extremely entertaining. Turely this took some time and thought to put togather. I am enjoying this and will go on through the series. It is magnificent science fiction.Even though I love the story it will do nothing to my belief in Almighty God, his precious son and Saviour Jesus Christ, and the wonderful Indwelling Holy Spirit. He is the Creator and the giver of life and eternal life. This I know from His fellowship and guidance thought my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pace picks up","review":"I really enjoyed this book, particularly the parts where Burton's manuscript is translated. The Jack the Ripper angle was intriguing-- this author seems to be tying together just about everything from Jack to vampires, to aliens. I also like his Atlantis series under the Donegan name. I do wonder, though, about how this will all shake out, particularly the whole immortality angle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down. . .","review":". . . because I couldn't believe this book had actually been published. Choppy, unimaginative prose, one dimensional characters and a silly plot. At times information is just poured on the pages without organization or narrative flow.

In a world with some great science fiction, don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book is horrible. It is a rehash of worn out ancient astronaut ideas. Worse it takes over 100 pages before you feel remotely comfortable with the book. If you read the other books first it might not be so bad, but the book assumes that you have read the other books. The author just all of a sudden mentions things like a \\"nuclear explosion in China\\" leaving the reader thinking \\"what nuclear explosion.\\" To add insult to injury the end of the book is predictable and it doesn't really end. It just stops. If you want to know what happens you have to wait for the author to write a sequel and then hope that one ends. Stay away from this book.

It lists all of our favorite chain restaurants. We had no idea there was anything low-carb at one of our favorite mexican restuarants, but sure enough, they offer up fajitas in lettuce wraps.

How can they even ship such a mess?And, more vexing, the checkers do NOT fit each other for crowning - the makers do not even pretend to make them fit together. This is such an OBVIOUS thing that is desirable for a checkers set, how on earth can they miss this?The \\"stars\\" that you use to rate this product do not really apply well to the product itself, so its \\"1 through 5 star rating\\" is not really accurate.

I was looking for a durable alternative to the folding cardboard games as I knew that we would be playing this game for years.Unfortunately, this item is NOT as well-made as it appears to be. The paint is sloppily applied, there is a ding on the board, and the checkers are small and do not stack. Although they say that they are grooved, which led me to think they *would* stack, they are only grooved on one side, which causes them to slide. They also vary in size. It is not a good game for little fingers.My options are to either touch up the paint and order different checkers or return it. I sense a return in our future."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well presented","review":"Sturdy, nice product with onboard storage. Disappointed in the actual checker size though. Very small playing pieces. I understand the checkers are designed to store in the pockets at either end of the board but my belief is that the checkers could be made larger with only minor modification of the set.

Having taken the exam, I can say that your success will depend on your preparation and EXPERIENCE. I STRONGLY advise that you purchase the CORE study set before taking even one exam. This is the whole objective behind Microsoft's plan for the MCSE 2000 certification. To this end, this manual is very good - and Sybex's Core study guides.

Your descriptions of the panic attacks you experienced are riveting, as I experienced them, too.

She made me feel as though I was right there with her during her harshest experiences.It is so scary to see how easily we can fall into the trap of addiction and Lynn makes mention of this quite frequently in her memoir.What sets this one apart though is that Lynn apparently still had quite lucid moments during her trips. She frequently mentions, during her heaviest uses, how unhappy she was even during the middle of her E trips.I loved this book. I don't know you Lynn, but thank you for sharing your story.

I too went through a time in my life, lasting much longer than her, where I couldn't get enough ecstasy. We called them \\"dumpers\\" for some reason. Yes, the high times were great, and when it wore off you felt empty and miserable. Blah, blah, blah. So what? It's not like it was the worst time I've ever had in my life. If anything, I had a good time having fun and then I grew up and decided what was truly important in life. Sobriety fits more with what I want to do with the rest of my life. So I quit ecstasy and cocaine. Big deal. It's not like ecstasy is even physically addictive, unlike cigarettes and blow. In fact, I found smoking to be much harder to quit. In summary, I personally found this book to be whiny and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"you have to be a sports fan for this","review":"I'm not a sports fan, but I figured it would still be funny. Michael Strahan does deserve a break in comedy. He should at least be invited to film an episode of \\"SNL.\\" However, this was not Chris Tucker or Margaret Cho-caliber work. It shows football players and coaches being a bit funny. Only if you are used to these men being so serious and professional would you find the contents here entertaining. Then again, there were some funny moment regarding flatulence. Outside of comedy, I learned what a K-ball is and how the rule on it was eaten by its exception.

Joe Tasker made it clear from the beginning that she was not that important to him and that she had to fit into his life on his terms. Their relationship was almost non-existant since he was always either away climbing a mountain or preoccupied with planning his next expedition.Coffey comes across as a rather immature girl, in love with the idea of the daring mountaineer, rather than the man himself.

OK? I liked the book's approach and is very suitable for begginers. I did not like the fact that the author printed all of the source code in the book itself, even though everything is on CD-Rom, wasting many pages. What is valuable is the author's approach to E-Commerce Solutions and the algorithm for solving numerous programming problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to disaster","review":"This development method doesn't take advantage of the 3/n-tier method of development.

I was hoping to see visual basic used more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nursing top for those with big breasts!","review":"I haven't found another nursing top that is better and I've looked everywhere! Most on the market are are either too small for my 36 G's and I'm spilling out of the top/sides or way too big in the body of the tank and doesn't give good support to the \\"girls\\". For reference, I was a 34DD pre pregnancy and size 8 and now at 8 weeks post baby, a 36G and size 10. The tank in a 36F/G is perfect for me. Yes, they are a bit expensive, especially for this girl who haunted Old Navy clearance for all my maternity wear, but I've found nothing that fits better. Worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nursing tank","review":"It is really an essential. Good support, strong material and construction, expandable for your tummy, can be used even after you have given birth. I bought 1 to try, liked it and bought more. I see myself using this even long after I stop nursing my baby, its that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ideal","review":"I really like the ruching detail and the reviews seemed so great I bought this in white despite the price. I'm dissapointed in the thickness of the fabric. I wouldn't be able to wear this alone because either my nipples or the nursing pads would be plainly visible, at least their shape. I imagine the same would be true for other colors. Also, there was a strange fit with extra fabric around the nipple area so that it pooched out a little there even when wearing the nursing pads which should've negated any impact of my still relatively small nursing size (34C). I ended up returning it because there are other camis that are half the price but definitely more wearable, like the undercover mama camis."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS TANK","review":"I bought this when I was 8 1/2 months pregnant. It was super comfortable and covered my belly!I've nursed for over a year and my Bravado tanks are my favorites! I can snap the closure with one hand, and don't have to even look to see what I'm doing. Very comfortable feeding in public since I don't feel that I'm drawing attention to myself. Also, the bra top gives my excellent support (unless I'm running after one of my older kids!) so I don't feel the need to wear a bra and this tank at the same time - -I'm petite and rather chesty so it's nice to find something comfortable and supportive!These are also great in the summer since the snap closures are the same size as the fabric so no one would expect a nursing tank!Also, these are terrific to sleep in as a nursing bra etc. Not too restricting and easy to work when your \\"super sleepy.\\" I reccomend these tanks to all my nursing friends and family! The best out there by far!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!","review":"I was expected to buy a new nursing bra but got a bra with dirty fat spots on it...very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"comfy and supportive!","review":"This is one of the best nursing tanks I've found. Well-made and supportive ~ worth the extra money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better quality, worse coverage than Glamourmom","review":"I read all the reviews comparing this top with the glamourmom, and ended up ordering one of each so I could compare them myself. I agree with those who thought the fabric of the bravado was better quality. But I ended up sending it back and keeping the glamourmom, because it provides some coverage when you open the bra to breastfeed. My cleavage was a little too exposed with this one. Still, a wonderful product, very comfortable and useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible shape in the bust and very short straps","review":"I'm 34DD or larger now that I'm nursing, and bought this tank because the cheap Target ones weren't supportive enough. This tank is very tight but bulges strangely in the nipple area. It's also very low cut and the straps seem really short. Luckily I'm only 5'4\\". I don't think this would fit a taller person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - LOTS OF CLEAVAGE!","review":"I bought this tank on a friend's recommendation. The fabric and general fit was good, but it revealed considerable cleavage. Way too low cut for me. If you're comfortable with that, would probably be a good tank. If you don't want to show lots of cleavage, look elsewear. I ended up buying a Gilligan & O'Malley side-sling nursing tank from Target and am very pleased with it (for 1/3 of the price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have a few of the Gilligan and O'Malley nursing tank tops from Target, but was trying to find one that I could wear alone and provided more support. This top is not worth the money. I like it just as much as the Target ones, but they are around $15. I thought the built in bra would be thicker and I would be able to wear it alone, but I can't. It is an okay tank top, but I just don't think it is worth $50. Also, I haven't washed it yet, but it doesn't really look like it is going to hold up too well in the wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something that fits!","review":"It's so difficult to find a tank bra that fits a large chest if you are small everywhere else. Other products are big everywhere thinking a large chested person is big everywhere, but that wasn't the case for me. Thank you for finally making a product to fit a 34 F/G. The product was very comfortable and fit perfect. I even have sensitive skin and I had no issues with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome nursing/maternity tank!","review":"The Bravado! essential nursing tank has great support! I plan to buy another one I love it so much. I am a size double \\"D\\" normally and to find something without an underwire that fits and supports incredibly well I am very pleased. I also like the tank because its long and covers my entire prego belly, also when I nurse I will still be covered up if I have to lift my outer shirt. The fabric is thick and strong. I only docked one star because of price and sizing. This tank fits me well now, but when my milk comes in I'm afraid it might be too snug. I wish I bought one size up. I also wish the price was between $30 - $40. Buying something I will only wear for half a year is hard enough and then having to spend close to $50 on one undergarment seems extreme to me. Overall super product, i'd buy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy","review":"I like this tank a lot. I wear it tighter then the picture represents so I actually get the bra effect, otherwise it seems to hang a bit.

Convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like","review":"I am not big chested. I got this in a 34B/C, which is my size, and it was sooo tight! Love their bras, not a fan of this tank.

I have purple, brown and black. I am normally size D and ordered the DD / E size and they are great. The black seems a bit more snug then the other 2 colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful prepregnancy and post pregnancy","review":"This is Wonderbra holds the girls up high works as a great as prepregnancy walking around house shirt. One thing I will note is that it is tight so it tends to run a little small in the bra size so I will go ahead and order one or two sizes higher than you think you would wear and also when you're Milk comes in and you might Want it to be even a little bit bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot clip/unclip with one hand","review":"This is a durable tank and provides a lot of support, but I dislike two things about it:1. Unlike my other nursing tanks, I cannot clasp/unclasp it with one hand. This is VERY inconvenient, as anyone who's ever nursed a baby in public knows.2. It's rather low-cut. If I wanted a bra, I would have purchased a bra. What I wanted was a shirt-bra combo, which is what I have with my other nursing tops. I could never wear this top by itself (without a shirt or sweater covering it.So, even though this top is pretty high quality in terms of the materials and construction, it doesn't function as needed. On top of this, it costs about twice what my other nursing tops cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wayyy to short","review":"This was like a crop top on me. Width was ok but length was way short so no use in going up a size. I am not particularly tall, 5'8 so I was surprised by how short it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these tops","review":"Easy to use, supportive, long, nice supportive straps and good sizes. Cotton so you don't sweat in hot weather. Love the Bravado products."},{"rating":"1","title":"comfy but not practical for use as a bra","review":"This tank is stretchy, comforatble and serves its purpose as a nursing top but I was hoping for much more out of the built in bra. I believe it would have provided enough support as a bra but it had no lining or padding so you could see nipples right through it! If you add nursing pads, you could see the lining of those right through it so I didnt not find it practical for that reason. I wish they would line the bra or add some padding like their Bravado Body Silk bra to this tank, and it would have been amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for large busts","review":"I bought the F/G cup size. For three times the price of the Gillian O'Malley tanks the Bravado offers only a fraction more support which may be enough for around the house but definitely never for wearing out, the hooks are much harder to use (cannot use one handed), the shelf bra offers an old school pointed shape that is unattractive, the material is thicker, hotter and harder to get on and the lower part of the shirt is not flowy it is tight and shows all your post partum tummy bulges. I am returning this tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good for women with very full bust","review":"This is the only nursing tank that I have found that comes in bra sizes and keeps everything well contained and modestly covered. You still have cleavage in this tank, but it is not inappropriate. I wear a 38 H and the 38F/G size fits really well. This tank really is essential to every nursing mom. I wear one every night to bed, and I also wear them almost daily when I am not working. I also use these for yoga tanks because they are so comfortable and provide excellent coverage and support. My only complaint with this tank is the runched front at the bust. The runching makes for an unflattering fit when you want to wear it layered underneath anything other than a shrug."},{"rating":"2","title":"please read this book","review":"i found this book hiding in the back of the library when i was in high school and instantly fell in love. it's the most intelligent and yet funny story of its kind. please read this book, give it some love, and pass it on like the favorite friend that it deserves to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUGE","review":"this thing is soooo massive. the picture is totally wrong, it is huge! like annoying huge. but the bubbles are great and it's my own fault for not realizing what 64 oz means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes lots of bubbles!","review":"This is a great toy for outdoors.

Gazillion Bubbles is the perfect bubble solution-durable enough to create long lasting, high flying bubbles and not so heavy they fall immediately to the ground and pop.

The characters occasionally seemed a little mature for their ages, but likeable none-the-less. I don't know why the mother always has to die in boys' coming of age stories, but it does seem to be an over-riding theme including this book. Ah well. A custody battle, although not bad, between (Tobin's) the main character's father and grandmother is a central theme as well as raising chickens and whether or not chickens have souls and friendship and identity. Oddly it all ties together and works.

Doesn't fit all oster blenders as described","review":"I have a brand new # 6812 Oster blender. The description of this jar said it should fit all oster blenders other than the in2itive(6700) series. It said the jar would fit any oster blender with a round bottom. I got this accessory for $2.30+ 7$ shipping charge only to see that it didn't fit my blender.

One cracked in the bottom very soon after purchase. Other is hanging in but I can see stress cracks. I tried a Ball canning jar on my Oster (2.5 or 2 5/8 mouth) and it fits. Canning jars come in at least 2 sizes that I know of. Don't see a reason to buy the brittle plastic jars any more--not to mention who wants to store in plastic anymore and glass is better in the dishwasher. Oh, I got the idea to check the fit while culling old appliance booklets--I had a Cuisinart booklet specifically with Ball jar recipes--baby food, bread/cookie crumbs, spice/blends, vegies, sauces, dressing, \\"blendered\\" hard cheese, salsa, coctails, tapenade. Worth checking your blender if you have a canning jar on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar crack in two uses","review":"after my second use of the jar, i had filled water in it to clean and later noted that the water had seeped outside.

Later, I discovered that the pint sized Mason Jar will screw in to the base of the blender and can be used in the same way as the plastic jar (which over time seems to crack a bit and gets cloudy from abrasion). The advantage is that you can buy a case of 12 mason jars for only a couple of dollars more than what you pay for 1 plastic jar.It's worth a try and the mason jars can be used for other things if you don't need that many for grinding,blending or chopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size...","review":"Use this to grind my flax seeds.

Only problem was that they would rarely last even a year before the glue failed and the bottom would just fall off. And NO, I didn't put it in a dishwasher or microwave. I got tired of forking out the money for these things and discovered through a friend that you can just use a mouth mason jar instead. Check it out. Take your blender base and blade and try them on any mason jars you have until you find one that fits. They work fantastic, you don't need to use plastic anymore, and finding a lid that fits is no problem. So save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does not fit all Oster blenders!","review":"Bought it to grind or blend in small quantities, thinking that it fits all Oster blenders.

Out of laziness to return it, it is now a regular container in my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad product - DO NOT BUY","review":"Oster once used to make good products - probably they were made in USA before. I purchased this mini jar recently and within a week of purchase and with very careful handling, it broke. The plastic used was of very cheap quality - probably it was made in China. Will never buy anything in future which is made by Oster. Another product is Corelle cookware - their dishes now have started breaking quite often - this was not the case earlier. Seems like consumers have to pay a big price since companies like Oster and Corelle have shifted bases to China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth a look","review":"I came across this book in a middle school library. I was particularly impressed on the section on how to get along with stepparents. It was laid out in a very reader friendly manner- organized into \\"types\\" of stepmoms and stepdads and how to best handle the situation. As a stepmom myself, I appreciated the way it balanced a child's need for self-determination and control with the adult's need for respect and peace in the home, no matter what the emotional relationship between them.

I have been extremely happy with it, the sound quality is great, the software is easy to use once you get used to it, and it has a lot of handy features such as the radio and sleep timer and other little goodies I continue to discover. I have run into a few minor problems, such as dust getting under the screen, and it froze once. The battery life is also not what I expected, I would estimate that I get about 8 to 10 hours of play time with the backlight off, but I also didn't give it a 100% charge the first time around,(what can I say, I was anxious)so that may have compromised the battery in some way. Other than that, it has been great, it's small, easy to use, and has amazing sound quality at a great price at $200 or less. I would definitely reccomend this to just about anyone wh0o is looking for a high capacity player."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid all around","review":"I recently purchased the Zen Sleek and find it to be everything I expected.

It is very simple, every time you plug the player into your computer and open Media Player, it automatically updates any new songs or changes you have made. This feature is by far the biggest plus for this player. The software however is not as user friendly as I had hoped. This is the reason I am giving the Zen Sleek only 4 stars.

Over the internet I was obsessing over the Zen Sleek for roughly 2 weeks. Finally I went to BestBuy, and got a first-hand look at the Zen Sleek. It was a huge disappointment; the backlight is too blue and makes it hard to see under light, the verticle touch pad is far to sensitive, and the overall player is too thick. Going from start-menu to options to now playing is difficult, and controlling the volume is no-where near as easy as the iPod. I would never reccomend this to anyone and strongly hope you do not either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Away from the states...but its ok...","review":"We watched the video tapes and they have helped us very much. This is our first baby and we are stationed in Tokyo. Childbirth classes are not easily available especially in english. The tape was very lively and enjoyable, interesting and fun to watch. We feel very prepared even though we are not home."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a last resort only....","review":"We bought this tape instead of attending classes and were very disappointed with it. Not only was the picture and sound quality poor, but the instructor was very annoying. The only good point about this video was that it explained basic info if you knew absolutely nothing about how the birth process progresses, as well as pain management. It did not, however, explain in any type of detail the breathing exercises and when to do them, which is why we bought the video! There was only a brief discussion about massage and the very quick instruction on basic breathing techniques. I was not able to use them at all during the birth of my daughter for simple lack of not knowing them! We were not happy with this video and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth it","review":"I bought this tape in lieu of attending a childbirth class. I felt that it did educate me regarding what to expect during labor and birth. However, the tape was extremely poor quality (both video and audio)and the instructor was irritating at best! They kept referring to a \\"workbook\\" which was not included in my mailing, and often there were charts and pictures shown to the class that were not visible to me. The instructor's style was very bossy and arrogant, and it was tiring to watch due to the poor camera work. I can't say I regret buying the tape because it provided me with necessary information and ideas; however, I think it should be a better quality tape for the amount they charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank You . . .","review":"I endured this woman for 20 minutes and could not take another moment of her \\"Janet\\" (from friends) loud, high, squeaking, irritating voice or her drama about all the normal/natural things a woman feels in pregnancy.I expect childbirth education class to be calm and informative, not dramatic. The couples in her class looked like deer in headlights. It did not look or feel enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birthing for Dummies","review":"While there is a lot of information in this video, the presentation is awful. The production and organization are shoddy and there are no useful demonstrations or clips of real-world situations. Spending the same amount of time with any book on the subject would provide several times more information. (The tape refers frequently to a workbook which is not included with the tape, making it even more useless.) The presenter is annoying, preachy, and poorly spoken. The video appears to be aimed at people who have never been near bodily fluids, much less a maternity ward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Nothing, But......","review":"If you can deal with the instructor's tendency to be a little loud and her generally corny approach to addressing \\"sensitive\\" subjects like leaking bodily fluids, then this video is a fair and convenient substitute for a live class. The tapes cover a lot of ground in four hours and give first-times a decent idea of what awaits them. I bought the video especially to practice breathing methods whenever I wanted, so I was especially surprised and annoyed that the video teaches really outdated techniques (like \\"feather breathing\\" without engaging the diaphragm, and chin-to-chest three-push breathing with knees pulled up). Fifty bucks is a lot to pay for substandard advice. Unfortunately, the other two videos I've seen out there aren't any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"This is what I didn't like:1. The sound was all messed up on my copy. 2. The instructor speaks so poorly that her grammar and sentence organization become distractions. Errors along the lines of, \\"Don't drink orange juice in labor because its too acidityic.\\" 3. The instructor is just plain unappealing - I really didn't need to see her sitting on a chair aping having a bowel movement. 4. There's nothing in this video that you can't get from reading a more thorough, less expensive book. 5. The instructor references a workbook that is not included. 6. The instructor uses posters as visual aids, but you can't really see the posters in the video.If you really, really hate to read you wil probably get something out of this video, but if you have done any reading on childbirth you can safely skip this video. There's nothing about the visual presentation in this video that will add to your knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"After examining all the information currently available on Lamaze, this video is very outdated and inaccurate!

If you are looking for a lively and entertaining farce, this film is probably worthy of five stars, but it loses one star because of a crucial mistranslation in the subtitles, which made numerous references to a 'drowsy.' I would have enjoyed the film more if I hadn't been so distracted by trying to figure out what a 'drowsy' was (near the end I finally realized that the intended word probably was 'dowry').

Other favorites were \\"Jumanji\\" and \\"The Polar Express\\". We thought Van Allsburg's books lost some imaginative steam when he turned to \\"messages\\" about things like pollution in the late 1980s. And then, of course, my son grew up so I've not read more recent books. These three books should be part of every child's life. Being able to imagine and dream do more than enrich our experiences; they are also the stuff of which medical breakthroughs, inventions, new business ideas and future wonderful books are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This is Chris Van Allsburg best book yet!\\"","review":"I like this book because it was written by Chris Van Allsburg.

I've suffered with all of those throughout my adult life. This product goes on nice and smooth and it isn't foamy or thick, which is fine with me. It seems to form a nice barrier between the razor and skin, but in actuality it does not. I still end up with several cuts and many ingrown hairs. I gave this a good, thourough test by using 3 tubes over several months and trying it with different brands of razors. I saw zero improvement in my complexion. Also, as one reviewer already wrote, this cream does clog the razor very much and that is frustrating.I was really hopeful this product would help me more, but after 3 tubes I can say I won't be buying anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been trying to like Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream. Really, I've tried as hard as I could. It's just that it doesn't really back up its claims. It hasn't helped to clear my skin at all. Furthermore, the fact that it's a non-foaming cream makes it excruciatingly difficult to spread completely across my face without having to use a ton. The directions say that using about a quarter-size amount is \\"all you need.\\" Yet it provides little coverage -- and does not spread evenly enough to provide a comfortable shave.

They have the gel version for that. I used to use Gillette, Edge even Aveeno shave gels before this. My issue was that I always developed ingrown hairs around the neck area below my chin, sometimes so bad that I developed huge pimples. It was painful and unattractive nonetheless. I bought this at walmart on an impulsive buy. I read the label that said minimizes ingrown hairs and decided to give it a shot. Well I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I am 100% satisfied. I no longer get ingrown hairs along my neck area and I have a clean smooth have. It definitely works, more than I expected it to and very fast. I am speaking of the shave cream version. Its about 5 bucks at Walmart. Give it a shot next time you buy some shave cream and compare. You have nothing to lose.

Power Biggs recording of these two concertos on Columbia, with its stately majesty and glorious acoustics, I was intrigued to run across this budget-label release of the same two rarely-performed pieces. Curiosity impelled me to purchase it.It's really quite good. The pace is taken a little slower, which does not diminish the grandeur of the music, and the organ and orchestra sound really terrific with lots of thundering low end and powerful dynamics. Certainly nothing in the performance falls short of the requirements of the music.I was a little surprised to hear some coughing in the quieter moments and polite applause at the conclusion. It doesn't markedly detract from enjoyment of the performance -- in fact it emphasizes how terrific the performers are, to be this good without editing -- but nowhere on the cover is it mentioned that this is a live recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speech therapy","review":"These are great pictures for my work as a speech therapist.

This can hold about 10 hours of music on one CD, and CD's are interchangable, so you could carry around a case of them! Think about it: 700 MB for $40, or 40 GB for $400 plus accecories. With blank CD's at such cheap costs this is the best deal. I gave it four stars becuase it wont play my iTunes store music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, bad design.","review":"The player has LOTS of good features. I liked the firmware upgradability. Took less then 10 seconds from a CD-RW. Good file browser.... and a host of other features I wouldn't care about after a few months.The design of the player is worst. The CD's go in from the bottom. So if the CD retaining mechanism ( the ball bearing that hold the CD in place) get broken (which is very common), the CD wont stay in the player anymore! The hinges for the lid is made of cheap plastic. I bet they would break very soon leaving with no choice but to use it upside down.For those who want to run it on batteries, the player drains batteries like water. Don't buy it unless you want to run it with an AC adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought this player for use mainly in my car, so I was not overly concerned about the short battery time. What I did NOT expect, however, was what I got: a player that mysteriously stops playing in the middle of songs, sometimes to resume seconds later, and sometimes not resuming at all. This seems to happen with 2 or 3 songs on every CD, although it's not consistent (my CD player and PC play them fine). Also, it skips when playing in my car unless laid flat. I greatly regret returning the Phillips CD/MP3 player in exchange for this one; the car cassette adapter in that squeaked a bit, and the player didn't support WMA files, but at least the thing played everything as it was supposed to. (By the way, I used the player on a plane recently, and discovered that all the comments about the dismal battery life are true)."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE !","review":"Stopped playing MP3's right in the middle....just like a PC crashes this thing crashed.

It also came with an adapter to play my MP3 collection over my car stero. I never knew that was possible ? For $50 its very sweet!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GREAT","review":"Hi all!!Its an okay player.Many times it takes so much time to start playing that it gets really frustrating.Also it doesnt recognize disks which have been used for some time.It just stops sometimesas it gets stuck.Its got some cool features.But after this experience with CD players i definitely would go for Memory players in future(like Ipod).Its so irritating to wait as this machine Whirrs for 3/4 mins before it starts playing the CD ,that one of the days i am just going to throw it out.ThanksRKS"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product at the reasonable price","review":"If you consider the mp3cd player at the reasonable price, it will be right for you. When I purchased it, I realized that it was not a high-performance one with expensive price, but after the second thought with functions-price, it will be proper to me.These are what I like it:- long-lasting battery (with high-tech for energy energy applied)- a variety of music format provided- anti-skip function- reasonable price (is it worth to buy at $30?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read reviews before buying","review":"See the reviews below. my 2500mAh NiMHs play for about 75 minutes per charge. Won't read multi-session CDs, and tech support doesn't know why. A/C adapter only works if the player is kept perfectly still, otherwise power is lost.

Awful customer service.","review":"Things the product description doesn't tell you:The disc loads through the BOTTOM of the player. Then you have to flip the player over to access the navigatorial buttons.Does not come with a car lighter adapter. I purchased one separately, only to find that the port is highly sensitive, and shuts off with the slightest jostle dislodging the connection. I obtained another adapter, and the same thing happened.Finally, this player sucks the life out of batteries at an unacceptably fast rate. You'll maybe be able to listen to a 70 minute CD twice before it's time to change the batteries.I contacted customer service to return it, only to be told that I had to return it with its original packaging - which I had disposed of.I will never again purchase a product from \\"iRiver\\".

I was hoping for good things with the \\"iRiver IMP 50,\\" but this isn't the case now.It wouldn't initialize when I turned it on. The player read neither regular audio cds or mp3s. It did, however, make a disturbing knocking sound when it tried to read new media and powered off when it couldn't.\\"iRiver\\" is suppose to be top of the line w/ it's players, but this particular model leaves a lot to be desired. I dunno, maybe I got a lemon. For 10 dollars more, I may consider the \\"IMP 150\\" and hope I have better luck w/ that.

But one must wonder how far from \\"Home Sweet Tokyo\\" TQ's collective travels has taken it to arrive at such twaddle. Tokyo is a big city, and as such has an abundance of quirkiness. But so too have Chicago, Copenhagen and Lima, to name but a few. Dig deeper, and the reader will quickly discover Rickety's sun has long set: The mindset of his ilk has never fully been able to ford the eighties, a decade that irrevocably changed the course of Tokyo. Rickety's is a world of jazz, and quaint coffee shops, and bath houses, and factory workers benignly breaking the antiquated codes of their parents' generation. Although perhaps fascinating to the social historian, these facets have little to do with the Tokyo of 2001.

Info is also nicely arranged and presented concisely. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't become a master with this book","review":"Don't let the title fool you - it should have been: \\"Beginning GoLive\\", not \\"Mastering GoLive\\". The book covers a lot of basic subjects that only adresses users on an absolute beginners level - all the intermediate and advanced stuff is left out. A lot of pages are wasted on basic descriptions of other Adobe products (E.g. Photoshop, Illustrator), but if I wanted to read about those programs, I would have bought a book covering that, right! The space could have been used for describing powerful GoLive features like CSS, DHTML, floating boxes and stuff like that, which are all left out.In short: read the GoLive manual and buy a more sophisticated book (Like \\"Real World GoLive\\") instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"I have to agree with some of the 'critical' reviews here.There was too much info about 'good design' and what you need to think about but that wasn't the point I bought this book. It wasn't until much later that they actually got into the details of starting the program.Even then they weren't that useful. I found I knew most of what they taught me even before I started the book because I had fooled around a bit first.There was nothing knew and supposedly there's some 'hot' features in Golive which makes it comparable to Dreamweaver. I have to say after reading this book: what features?Plus talking so much about 'other' programs.. such a waste since you may as well get a book on those. What you teach here is not going to be substantial enough to even consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Being new to web publishing and familiar to Adobe products, I thought that GoLive would be a good program to try. I downloaded the trial version and ordered this book to help in figuring out how it worked. What a shock to find out that the book woud lead you down a direction and never fully explain how to accompolish a task. There is only visual (master) references to important items that help in finalizing a web page. It may be useful for doing single pages or very plain pages. I found myself spending most of my time in the online help from adobe. What a waste of good money! The book would have been better titled \\"Go Live for Dummies\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Air - Not Enough Substance","review":"As a professional designer, I need to get up to speed with the latest applications in a hurry. This book seemed like so much empty space without a substantial dedication to the basic elements of GoLive. For example, the book began with a section on Web design. This chapter would do well at the end of the book, or as an appendix. As another example, it's not until page 175 that the book even begins to get to the meat of the program and then bogs down in bad organization and author diatribes on what makes for good Web design. Interspersed is the actual getting-into-GoLive-and-working-with it stuff. Wading through the fluff to get to the meat is tedious.This book could have been written in 100 pages. Save your money. The original manual is more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the WORST!","review":"I was looking forward to learn a lot about Adobe Golive. Whata disappointment!

The manual tells you not to put it near computers, etc, so I put it in a huge room with barely nothing in it, and the hum persisted. I called the free tech support line(nice feature), and, after about a 3 days of trying to get a real person, they proceeded to tell me the exact same thing: \\"Do not use this product near computers, in the kitchen, or furthermore, near ANYTHING moderately electrical in nature.

The sound, range, and general operation of the phone were fine -- BUT -- you'd better own a battery company, or keep a car battery with jumper cables handy, if you're going to buy it. My conversations aren't that long, but the battey life was absolutely dismal. I bought a new battery and had the same result. (Yes, I charged each of them overnight without interruption before the first use.)I replaced the Uniden POS with a Panasonic and have had no trouble since. I've even pushed the limit on talk time and off-charger time and have not been able to get the Panasonic to fail.

Most enjoyable, though, was Tony recalling the days when he first started out professionally and how he fought to make records that were important to him, not what the pop charts dictated. The mutual admiration between Tony & Frank(no last name needed)is also mentioned quite a few times, making it clear there was great affection between these two superstars.

At least it serves the overall purpose of the movie. Predictability. All girls who show their breasts on screen get killed, and noone who doesn't. In other words, appearing topless is what the philosophers call \\"the necessary and sufficient condition\\" to be killed.While one may think that conscious predicibility is fun, and that stupidness for a purpuse is art, we may have to remind ourselves that fun doesn't necessarily mean good.

The book is easy to understand provided one has mastered relativity and quantum mechanics. It would be an excellent complement for anyone who has read Bjorken/Drell or Peskin/Schroeder. In my opinion, a true understanding of quantum field theory can only be gained if one reads Bjorken/Drell, then Peskin/Schroeder and then finally Weinberg. In his book Weinberg is sort of recombining the best of Bjorken/Drell and Peskin/Schroeder and brings understanding to a new level. It is in a sense like with having read quantum mechanics by say Messiah and then reading Landau. Reading Landau first is not a good idea, but doing it after Messiah is. The same thing applies for Weinberg but for a different reason. His insight is more sparking that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely thorough","review":"In this book and the others in the series, Weinberg bends over backwards to make sure every line is justified so the reader does not have to stop and puzzle over logical gaps, caveats left unmentioned, etc. Also, typically Weinberg will prove the general case of a result, instead of sticking with a simple example, or referring to the literature.

At times it can be overly dense and cumbersome with notion. Nonetheless, this is one of the best references out there. In particular, the treatment of bound states in QFT is the best I've seen. Weinberg also provides extraordinary insight into the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but hard to follow for graduate student","review":"Quite often incomprehensible(I'm a graduate student).

When it is effectively communicated, physics can be wonderful. This book represents the former. It is dense. The author is obviously a brilliant person; but, he is not a brilliant communicator. I've got a Master's in Physics and I was lost by the end of the second chapter. I have no doubt that the mathematics as presented are accurate; however, alone they fail to effectively communicate the substance of the topic to a mere mortal. Weinberg does not spend adequate time discussing the context, reality, or historical evolution of his ideas. I purchased all three volumes and, apparently, waisted my money.I later purchased Roger Penrose's \\"The Road to Reality\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was not an easy read either, but Penrose spent a significant amount of time recounting historical context, impact, and the 'reality' of his ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This DVD","review":"The series was great, the Return is okay, but the DVD is terrible.

I can understand teeny boppers who still lust after aging RV and DMC still think they make their juices flow, but this is ludicrous.The appearance of a former 007 actor (a one-film man) in the flick makes this a mediocre rag of a film ever the more!

This concise, informative and well outlined book gives the student, young or old, a real sense of what we have lost in our time - a civil perspective.

Carter is a distinguished professor of Law at Yale University. He makes it clear that he is a Christian and writes from that perspective. He spends much time pointing out what everybody already knows, viz. that we live in a highly uncivil, angry, and impolite society. This book will most likely be read by those who are already concerned about that fact. But the tone of Carter's pronouncements will not make you feel compassionate concern for those who WON'T be reading this book. And so it is, at bottom, a sermon to the converted, with all the self-righteous overtones one expects from a dignified member of U.S. society.

I can think of many other uses for them -- i.e a table in a foyer when the kids haven't come home from a date or on a desk in my living room.

It's not a terrible book, but is most beneficial for someone who is into homeo/naturopathy/holistic medicine and wants to apply it to their pets.

The question the book poses is good, but I think the answer is somewhat obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good songs here...","review":"CD will sound dated to many since it has an 80s flavor to it butif you like Starship, Foreigner or Survivor, you will like this CD. Kevin Chalfant's work with the STORM and TWO FIRES is betterbut this CD still warrants a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled Visual Basic for Applications Handbook","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I expected to receive a book on Visual Basic not VBA. While the information is useful for VBA programmers this IS NOT a VB Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reader-friendly/kid friendly","review":"I was disappointed by this book and its sequel, \\"More Baby's First Signs\\". The illustrations were dark and dull and would not engage a baby's attention. There were also very few words actually shown in each book. For an intro to baby sign language, I'd recommend My First Signs by Annie Kubler. It's fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Much To Be Desired","review":"At a glance, these looked like cute board books to use when teaching a baby to sign but I must say, the illustrations are just plain awful! I think my toddler could draw better pictures! Other than that, the book covers a fairly good number of signs but is definitely NOT a book I'd recommend or spend any money purchasing. It also seems all the titles by this particular author employ the same illustrator so be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to upgrade","review":"Unfortunately, this book does me no good because it just covers version 1.0, and 1.5 has been released with many changes.

Only two songs omitted that were required-\\"Shame\\" and \\"Long slide for an out\\". Love the Fuegos, just wish the five years I lived in Boston were when they were in their prime. Now we need a live album from about the time I saw them-1985."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LONGEST DAY on CD!","review":"Worth getting for the entire first Del Fuegos' album. Almost all of Boston, Mass. is included and a sample of Stand Up. Great quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best indy rock bands of the 80's","review":"I saw the Del Fuegos in Manchester, NH during their tour with the Georgia Satellites and Tom Petty, for their second or third album. They were hands down one of the best indy rock bands of the 1980's. They toured with Petty when he was hitting the big time, kind of like when the Meat Puppets toured with Nirvana. They put on a smokin' good show, true blue rockers. This is American music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superfluous Stuff","review":"IMHO, the tracks from their album, \\"Boston, Mass\\" are the only ones worth listening to.

Also, they are warm when it's cold and cool when it's hot. Even better, for people like me with hgih archs and generally odd shaped feet, they are comfotable, but for others (with normal feet) have said they are comfortable for them as well. They are great for climbing, running, and other activity seeing as they stay on your foot, add traction, and the like. They are also non-constraining on the feet.and legs at all.My single problem was first figuring out how they secure, seeing as I was unfamiliar of the 12 clasp system, I figured it out quickly and since then have not encountered another problem with them.A great value in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was not impressed. The earbuds hurt my ears, pinched to tight without anyway to adjust. I could hear well for a second and then it would pinch so tight into my ears that it would cut off all sound. I also ended up with a bad earache by the end of my shift."},{"rating":"2","title":"not top of the line","review":"This Prestige is a decent stethoscope with very good acoustics, but lacks one key feature compared to my old Tycos- the ear pieces do not rotate where they insert into the black tubing, therefore you cannot make minute adjustments for optimal ear comfort. Otherwise it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months","review":"Can hear lung and heart sounds very well but bell always loose and then after just 3 months use the metal frame broke!

Had to go to university bookstore and by Litmann earpeices. Drum is also defective- tympanic membrane falls off. All and all this is a very poor scope. I would not recommend it.On the positive side- I have had several good scopes stolen- if this gets stolen- who cares. i feel sorry for the thief.ER doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"from MD with daily use","review":"Better acoustics and finish quality than the hyped Littmann series.No reason to overpay for Littmann.Comparable to Littman Cardiology II series in acoustics but without the high price.

I can hear very well with this product. I've had 3 Littman in the past that I was very disappointed in. I knew the Littman Cardiology Stethoscope was good but to pricey so I decided to try this one based on the good reviews. I'm very pleased and would purchase this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scope for Price","review":"Compare prices for this scope at other site. No complants - greatest lil scope for heart sounds, Now if I could only keep everyone from trying to steal it at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I recently bought this stethascope as a less expensive alternative to the Litman cardiology I had that finally broke after a good 4 years of use. Although it had the look and lumen thickness similar to the Litman, with fairly good diaphram, the bell side had terrible quality. Also it would try to twist on you while in the ears make it very uncomfortable. The last straw was when the eartip split after just 2 weeks of use. I have returned it to Amazon and ordered a duplicate of my original Litman Cardiology that I know is a great product. It'll be 150% more money, but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Bug Book","review":"I have finally found a book that gives great information on \\"Bugs\\". My grandson found it interesting as well, for some reason the pictures and the write up were simple enough that he could understand. He is 8 years old. This book was bought because I am going to Horicultral classes and we have a speaker on Insects, and I found it very useful, and will be taking it to class to show my teacher. If she likes it she will recommend it to her students, in each class she teaches. I have some of these nasty critters, and some nice critters in my garden and it was great to have a book handy to check on whether or not they were the good guys or the bad guys. As my teacher has said Pesticide is Homocide, don't you agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids & adults","review":"A teacher friend got this book for my 5 year old. We wanted something that we could find good info on the bugs that she discovers around our house. This book was perfect. The pictures are good so she can find what she's looking for, then I can read about the bug to make sure it's not harmful! When ever my daughter has the book out with friends, she always has a swarm of kids around her looking at it. So I bought 2 more to give away as birthday gifts for all the upcoming parties this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantly using this reference","review":"I encouter bugs on a fairly regular basis. I have learned alot in the short while I've had it. I purchased it in conjunction with the Texas Organic Gardening book by the same author. The other book goes fairly quickly over the main bugs, but this one has better pictures from which to identify the critters, and has much more information about the benefits and damages the bugs can do. The only things I feel are missing are the average lifespan, if the critter survives freezing conditions, and a section specific to the critters that are poisonous or dangerous to humans. Money well spent in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about bugs...","review":"This book has some nice pictures and interesting stories, but it's not a bug book, it's an organic gardening book.

Was that too much to ask?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Bug Book","review":"This book was exactly what I needed in order to differentiate the \\"good\\" bugs from the \\"bad\\". Beautifully illustrated and written, it will take it's place on my garden bookshelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for veggie gardeners in Central Texas!","review":"I first saw this book at my local nursery; it is what the master gardener there used to identify the Harlequin bugs that I'd brought in that were destroying my lettuce. I later checked it out from the library several times. Whenever I returned it, I found I needed it again!This book is well written, extremely informative, and best of all - it offers only organic and biological solutions to your problem bugs: NO PESTICIDES! Did you know that many fire ant mounds can be detroyed simply by pouring a large pot of boiling water over them? The full color photographs allowed me to easily identify nearly every notable bug in my garden, and it includes both \\"bad\\" bugs and beneficial ones.My two-year-old daughter also loves identifying the bugs she finds with this book. Buy this book - your Central Texas garden will be better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kids and Our Bugs","review":"When my two and four year olds starting bringing me bugs from outside, I decided it was time to determine if they were harmful. This book had excellent photographs that helped me identify the bugs. I used it as an educational tool for my two little bug hunters. I am happy to report we have had no dangerous bugs gathered."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book for Texas Gardeners","review":"This is a must for fans of Howard Garrett. He and Malcolm share their experiences with bugs in Texas. They show great respect for nature. This book has given me a new appreciation for the world of insects. Many fascinating details and stories are included. Of course, for the bad and the ugly, they tell us how to rid ourselves of them in a way that is safe for our environment. A great accomplishment from 2 wonderful organic experts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor organization of information.","review":"One of those books that you have to know the name of the bug before you can look it up! Its organization should be by photos within groups and then reference to write-up. (Find the photo of the bug you see and then refer to write-up.)The write-up should refer back to photo if you know the bug's name and want to know what it looks like.A very elemental book. Writing is good and parts entertaining. Not a serious book for people truly interested in insects as a hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"tbas","review":"This lamp is so beautiful.

I'm almost done with the first novel (also Hoban's first). If you are already a Hoban fan, you can't go wrong with this, as it collects several of his novels into one package. If you're looking to get introduced to him, you also can't go wrong with this, although I would add that I think Mouse and His Child, Riddley Walker, and Kleinzeit are must-haves. For my money, there's very few writers who capture these themes as well as Hoban does. He is a master who deserves a lot more credit/publicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected but very good.","review":"I thought this story would be about an interracial couple, but it wasn't.

Apparently the other users of this product haven't experienced this, but it definitely can be an issue. It happened both yesterday & today, so I am convinced that the product does not work with my skin.Nivea for Men Aftershave Balm, Gillette (any brand line) aftershave balm/gel, and L'Oreal Men's Expert aftershave lotion all have worked quite well for me (without the redness & burning).

Anticipating needing a little skin care through the learning process I bought a tube of this at a local drug store.This product does what it's supposed very well to and doesn't try to compete with my cologne. It has an immediate soothing effect on my freshly shaved skin and doesn't leave an oily finish, but simply dries gradually and protects my face for the rest of the day.At first I thought it was a little pricey for a 2.5oz tube, but it only takes a little dime-sized bit to cover my cheeks and under-chin area.

I THOUGHT this was the absolute ELITE chess computer that I was buying (being \\"sensory\\" etc), as other chess computers that I've owned have lights on each square that blink to signal when and where the computer wants to move. This grandmaster doesn't have lights on each square; rather, you must read the coordinates from the lcd screen, then find the coordinates on the board in order to move the piece (for the computer's move). This was truly a big disappointment for me, (...)

There are actually only 5 levels - the other 95 \\"level\\" settings merely change the time control. If you change the computer strength, it's only at unlimited time. Very disappointing. I called their tech support and the guy told me, \\"Well, you can just handicap the computer by limiting its alloted time.\\" Pardon me amigo, but time isn't an issue for a computer. A 2200 level computer can move many times in one second while maintaining master level strength. What good is that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Computer:","review":"Awesome computer. I have owned a number of computers, and this one is great because of it's tournament size and useability.

It has really helped me alot, and it's make the game more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"features","review":"I bought my husband, an avid chess player, Excaliber for Christmas. Overall it has been more than challenging for him on even the lowest settings. There are a few glitches off and on probably because of the sensitivity of the machine, and he has had to restart it more than once. It sometimes reads error although the space it is called on has not been in play or has no chess piece for awhile. My husband does not have good eyesight and we find the digital display quite small for older folks. There are several ways according to the enclosed pamphlet to reset, takeback moves, etc but once it says error it usually pretty much sticks to it until you restart the game. We would much prefer lit LED squares to show the moves rather than the grid method, but he still enjoys his Excaliber because of the challenge and regulation size."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price","review":"I bought this same watch in Jamaica last week duty-free for $85.00 at a jewelry store.

It briefly reviews the lives of six famous American gangsters, and includes a general, sanitized history of gangs in America. For example, the mafia's cooperation with the FBI during World War II is described, but no detail is given regarding what price the American government paid in trade for that assistance and cooperation. Vocabulary is relatively sophisticated for young adult readers, and there is no glossary in the back of the book. The author does cite sources, many of which come from another title, called BLOODLETTERS AND BAD MEN, a much more graphic book with a lot more information that would actually appeal more to the same readers. However, GANGSTERS will pass the public school review boards and BLOODLETTERS probably would not.

The statement of this is the young Malaipet is just a lie, this is the old Malaipet after he had retired in Thailand and came to america. Raw, yeah its raw as in recorded with a $200 camcorder by a guy who seems to not know how to film something.

The devil, they say, is in the details. Deighton isn't really careful about these, excelling only when he plays revisionist historian with the broad issues surrounding the \\"good\\" war.For example, he takes unwarranted swipes at the Pope whenever he can, possibly revealing more about his prejudices than his research. He occasionally seems confused about geography, as when he says \\"the Germans used bases in Czechoslovakia to attack Poland from north and south, as well as from the west.\\" (p. 167 hardcover) I was unaware of the annexation of East Prussia to Prague.At any rate, skip this one in favor of one by a professional historian, such as Leckie's Delivered from Evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best First Book on WWII","review":"I wish I had read this book first before I launched into reading about WWII history.

Also the last few pieces have anomolies such as half of a pair with no second half. This appears to be a 'used' puzzle - the box was heavily creased and had worn edges. Some puzzle pieces are showing wear and a few are even coming apart. The 'educational' value might be referring to the lack of positive feedback in putting together the puzzle. There is a lot of inter-changeable pieces and there are large areas where it is very difficult to know if you have put it together correctly.

This is probably why the product induces redness of the skin rather than preventing it. The similar product I bought in Singapore contained no menthol, had a more solid consistency, did not irritate the skin, and worked excellently."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst don't waste your money","review":"Not worth the 1 star rating! The audio and visual were nothing short of a very bad home movie. It failed to correlate the predictions of Nostradamus through time nor did it look to anticipated future event. The 3 points it was trying to make was repeated at nauseum. In a word this DVD was pure \\"garbage\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!!","review":"Dont waste your money and time buying this garbage,the sound and images are the worst I ever seen in a movie. If you want to see tornados, war and violence you can have it for free at TV every day and you can have a better idea of Nostradamus predictions on internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader","review":"I don't have much time to read so when I do I want the book to be good. I have always counted on Constance O'banyon for that and she has never let me down. I found THE AGREEMENT to be a wonderful story. Garret Lassitor loved Lauren since she was young and he had the grace and goodness to wait until she grew up to tell her. That's my idea of a hero. If you want a good love story, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an excellent book!!!","review":"To give a little background, I'm a 34 year-old male who has never read a romance novel. It wasn't until I was in a car accident and had an extended hospital stay that I began reading O'Banyon's books. It was after hours, and the gift shop was closed, all my wife had for me to read was The Agreement. I was reluctant at first but decided may options were limited and read it anyway. After the first page, I was hooked. I couldn't put it down! I left the hospital a week later and immediately went to the bookstore to buy every Constance O'Banyon book I could get my hands on. She writes historical based stories with the perfect mixture of action and romance. I feel that I am speaking for my gender when saying that any man could pick up this book and fully enjoy it. She is the only romance novelist I have read and the only one I will ever read. I highly recommend this book to anyone, male or female who is looking for a classic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent will tell every time!!!!","review":"I give THE AGREEMENT a 5 because it deserved it! I read all four books in the series and was impressed with the way the authors kept true to the story. I am from Texas and I recognized my state through this author's telling. I loved Lauren's and Garret's story. What can I say--I am a romantic and it was so very, very romantic and SEXY!! I have read most of this author's books and have never, never been disappointed. Saddle up, and ride through Texas with Lauren and Garret, I promise you that you will enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am hooked on the Secret Fires Series!","review":"I found this author by accident because I was reading Elaine Barbairi's book, The Wild One, and discovered it was a series. Can Mrs. O'Banyon ever tell a great story! By the time I got to the Agreement, I was three books into the series and she brought a fresh meaning to the over all series--hers is the tender love story that will touch your heart, and if you aren't in love, you'll wish you were. Lauren and Garret's story will make you warm all over and wish you had someone to love you the way he loves her. Althouth Mrs. Barbieri is my favorite author, I'm moving Mrs. O'Banyon into second place favorite author. You simply must read the Secret Fire Series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We passed this book around, and all loved it","review":"I'm a nurse and we always pass our books around to each other. I was third in line to read THE AGREEMENT. I agree with my fellow nurses--I want a man like Garret Lasiter!!! The story kept me turning the pages. It was a well plotted book. If I ever became an author, I want to come back as Constance O'banyon--her talent is awsome. Since reading THE AGREEMENT, I ordered as many of her books as I can find. You can bet they will be passed around the nurse's station. I am not reading Texas Proud and I'm hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren and Garret walk right off the pages of the book","review":"I am amazed and impressed with THE AGREEMENT. I have read many O'Banyon books and like them all. Although ONCE UPON A TIME is my all time favorite, Ms. O'Banyon brought Lauren and Garret alive on the pages of her book. The McBride series is more than a series. I read all four authors and loved them all. In order they are, Elaine Barbieri's THE WILD ONE--Bobbi Smith's, THE HALF-BREED--THE AGREEMENT by Constance O'Banyon--THE LONER, by Evelyn Rogers. I loved all four books, THE AGREEMENG, of course, being my favorite. Good job ladies. Wish you would do another series together. Any chance you might do the children?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I JUST DISCOVERED THIS SERIES","review":"A friend of mine told me to read THE AGREEMENT, and I did with reservations. Thank you, thank you, Mary for introducing me to Ms. O'Banyon's book. I liked the story and the love between Lauren and Garret. The book is deep in plot and Ms. O'Banyon took me to Texas in the early days. Since this is a series book, I have bought the other three. I just finished The Wild One, and I loved it. I am ready to read The Half-Breed and I know it will be good too. So far, I have not been disappointed. I will definately buy all of Ms. O'Banyon's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Say I Love You","review":"I read this book in one day. I simply couldn't put it down-which makes it almost deserving of a five star rating. There is no mystery to the plot, but the love story can not be faulted. The reader can feel Garret's torment in loving Lauren. He has to hold back his feelings of love until Lauren grows up and he can act upon them, yet remains devoted in his love for her. It was the first time I read a Constance O'Banyon romance and would gladly purchase another based on the quality of this hearthrob romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one I will put up for my daughter to read.","review":"I have been a fan of O'banyon for years. The Agreement is just another example of her wonderful writing style, and her abality to make me see what she is saying. My daughter is twelve, and I am saving my o'banyon books for her to read when she is 18. I want her to enjoy and treasure the o'banyon books as I have. As for The Agreement, Garret is patent and waits for Lauren to grow up before he tells her he loves her. The book is written with sensitivity and a real knowledge of love between a man and a woman. I have a feeling Ms. o'banyon must have a deep love in her own life to be able to write about it with such a stunning impact!!! I am never disappointed when I read an O'banyon book, and I have them all. My very favorite is Once Upon A Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fishies stay on quick feet!","review":"I am now little Emily's favortie great aunt and her mother's favorite aunt because not only are these little fishies like the ones at the aquarium they stay on quick feet in the cold winter!

It's the coolest thing to see her enjoying the same show that was so special to me when I was her age. But I have to admit, I hated Bubba the caveduck as a kid, and I'm not very fond of him as an adult either. Bubba is a silly over the top, cheap joke character. I want more adventures with Scrooge, the nephews, Launchpad, and Gyro. I even love Fenton Crackshell and Gizmoduck. Something about Bubba just irks me, but I'd rather watch a Bubba Ducktales episode than any of the junk on tv today, so I shouldn't complain much. It's a great show, a great DVD set, and you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"You're never too old for Duck Tales. The next generation will love it as much as the first, and second. It's fun to see that grandkids love this as much as their parent's did at their age. And the music is AWESOME.

Unfortunately, it is mostly just blank paper (with fancy squiggles at the tops of the pages) for you to write in.

In other cases, the sequence of steps was very unclear and poorly stated.The multi-colored blankets give very little direction for finishing and thought for how the back of a blanket might look and hold together under fairly strenuous use.For the most part, it's probably a good idea to choose the single colored patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book unless you want a lot of frustration","review":"I am an experienced knitter and picked what I thought would be a relatively easy pattern - never have I been so frustrated. The instructions were not explicit enough and I have spent hours trying out my own methods to accomplish what the designer wanted me to do. At this point I really have no desire to even try any more or ever try another Vogue pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced Knitters only","review":"Its been my experience with Vogue that the patterns always tend to be a bit difficult. I had no clue just how difficult this book would be!I thought trying a blanket would be a good starting point but the directions are very confusing. I was so frustrated I had to call a friend who is an expert at knitting and she suggested writing out the instructions. Even she had trouble on the \\"Little Lambs, counting sheep\\" blanketIn the instructions they take for granted that you will just assume a lot and if you dont I guess you are just out of luck.Be warned this book is very small 7x5 with very small print and the charts even smaller.All in all the pictures or the blankets draw you in but once you start so does the headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn pages","review":"I would not have purchased this book if I have known that their were three torn pages from the book and the cover was dirty.

We received this today and although the unit heats correctly, I find the fit and finish to be low quality. The black plastic side handles are cheap looking and the sides were scuffed up making the item look worn. This model is all black yet the screws in the front are bright stainless. Overall my impression is that this is not well thought out and it just like a cheap appliance. I expected better from a company whose customer base is mostly commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This is supposed to be a DVD where girls strip in public places and hope that they don't get caught. That would be exciting.Instead, in some scenes the girl isn't even outside. Stripping in a closed bar doesn't count as \\"nude in public\\". In other scenes, they are indeed outside, but usually in a secluded area, and they will even converse with the few people who are there. There's no effort to hide the fact that the girl is naked from the other people. So really, nobody \\"Risks it All\\", as the DVD promises. The whole thrill of being naked where others can see the girl is therefore lacking.Also, if the girl is nude and facing the camera, the camera doesn't go below her waist. This DVD is supposed to market nudity... so why hide her lower half if she's just standing there? That's awfully tame for someone who's supposed to be doing something risky, don't you think?Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This DVD is like a G-rated version.

He is quite funny, & gets a lot of very good, insightful information across to couples, primarily,while they're laughing their heads off! He explains some things that many couples just don't understand are very real dynamics in most marriages, & he is magnificent in sharing the differences between men & women, in \\"most everything\\". I believe it would be a useful tool for groups, or if a couple wanted to get it for themselves.Usually, should you lend it to someone, you won't get it back right away. That's a good sign.

Buy Burdick's CE book instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good premise and plot, acting and script need work","review":"The major flaws of \\"Cube\\" are the acting and the script. Most of the actors are, at points, overacting the melodramatic script. Some of the lines are rather trite as well (e.g., \\"He's endangering the pack!\\"). However, the plot to the movie is quite interesting, and the tense atmosphere holds the viewer's interest well. The concept is intriguing with an air of paranoia. If you can overlook the problems, \\"Cube\\" is a pretty cool movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait til your hammered.","review":"The first time we watched this movie was several years ago when my wife and I were dating. We were really hammered the night we watched it, and thought it was great. We decided to buy the movie, and watched it for the second time (in years) sober. What a difference a high blood alcohol content can make. The acting is mediocre at best. And while the story is original, it seems a bit contrived and paranoid at times. The special effects are well thought out, but a bit cheaply done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool premise but-Junk.","review":"Cube was dissapointing. Great idea, poor execution. It started out intriguing but fizzled swiftly due to bad acting, bad direction, and horrible pacing. Too bad, the trailer was pretty spiffy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My God, I loved this movie.","review":"Maybe it was the brilliant nature of the screenplay. Maybe it was the moving portrayals and sheer emotion expressed by the actors and actresses. Maybe it was the complexity of the movie itself. All I know is that I'm still unable to move past the feeling of shock this movie left me with. While some of the story remains a mystery to the audience even after the climax, the overall film lends a wonderfully intricate story resolving in a truly unexpected final sequence. Additionally, Nicole de Boer was magnificent in the performance that will no doubt launch her American film career. Anyone who watches Cube will find her portrayal as Leaven, a sheltered math student, extraordinarily unforgettable. I don't care if you've never heard of it. I don't care if you're not interested in seeing it. I'm telling you that you do not want to miss this film. Buy it. Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"Hard to believe this movie has a 4 of 5 star rating here.If you like seeing people killed in interesting ways, then this might be for you. Beyond that, there really isn't much of a reason to sit through this film.It's a common story rehashed in a new setting with poor acting.I consider watching this movie a waste of time. Instead, if you like watching people die in horrific ways, try Ichi the Killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I tried to watch and enjoy this movie. Really I did. But really people, can a movie get any more boring?I'll give the writers credit. It's a good concept for a movie. That is until you realize that filming a movie inside a giant rubix cube-like structure means every set is practically identical. I know they had a low budget, but come on. Throw in a side story where people on the outside are trying to figure out the cube. At least then we could have seen them sitting at a picnic bench or something.But for those who are not bored by the set, I give you the acting. Some of them can't even swear believably! Hey directors, I'll give you some help. Most people don't wait two seconds before dropping an F bomb. Pick up an Eminem album. He'll prove it.I will say that this would be a good movie for a high school philosophy class.

My home is not a trap and the rooms around it do not contain potential death devices. If you like that sort of thing along with feeling frusterated, bored, and annoyed then this movie could be good for you. I recommend it if you like sci fi, and if you like to feel like you're trapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind numbing experiance","review":"If your looking for a straight forward sci-fi movie then skip this movie.However if you enjoy thought provoking movies your in for a treat.The movie pits people who have never met before nor seem to have anything in common together, Or do they ?Each person in the movie awakens to find theirselves in a square shaped room not knowing how they got there.The room has doors on all sides but all but one lead to death, The trick is to pick the right door.It is here that people from different walks of life meet and try to figure a way out of the cube that holds them hostage.This movie is a study of human nature and how it respondes to adversity. The roles played by the actors are well written and directed. This movie is a fine example of what can be done on a limited budget. I gave this movie four out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all what it seems.","review":"If you are looking for a suspense movie, this would be great for you. But, if you stop to think about Cube, this one has a great message. Horror and suspense on top, but a lot of feeling, emotions, and a good message towards the end. It has bad language and some amount of gore in it, so don't let the younger kids see it (wait until they get older)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study in human nature","review":"All the reviews up to now are correct, no logical beginning or end. There are no answers to the question Why. What this is, is an interesting study in humanity. Let's just assume it's a strange science experiment; Someone drops a good cross section of civilized people into a seemingly hopeless situation, with no help or resources, other than each other, and see how they react.True, the acting isn't exactly top notch. And there aren't any of the usual trappings of a great hollywood hit. But I do think it's worth watching with the expectation of a decent \\"B\\" sci-fi movie that will make you think.I owned this movie years ago but lost my copy to my kids. I am here now, replacing the hole left in my personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent mind game","review":"In cube, a strange movie concerning 6 strangers who wake up trapped in a huge strange cube with is lined with traps. They each must rely on the skills of the other to get through. Although the movie was probably made cheaply, you can't really tell form the well rounded camera work, to the smooth producing. The actors, all unknowns, do an excellent job portraying six normal people(Except for one autistic math master)who slowly go off the edge while trying to save their own lives. Worth, the man who designed the mysterious cube is one of the most well acted and most interesting characters in the movie. The cube is a masterful movie made out of some cheap sets an some good character acting. In the cube, you are your worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films I've ever seen.","review":"A truly incredible work.Great concept. Director Vincenzo Natali is difinitely one of the most brilliant directors out there. The film is intelligent, allegorical, and boasts an unbelievable perfect ending (i.e. the final shot of the lone survivor departing the cube, aided by a beautiful piece of music). Incredibly atmospheric and intense, and unlike most movies these days, it leaves many questions unanswered. My knees felt like jelly when the film was over, and I was left staring at the screen long after the credits finished rolling. The film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, from a composer I know nothing of (Mark Korven). There should be a CD soundtrack!A brilliant, intense film. Certainly not for everybody, but one thing is certain: No matter your disposition on the film, there's no denying you will never forget it once you've seen it.One of the best films ever made in my opinion, and deserves so much more than it recieves."},{"rating":"1","title":"like Pirandello . . . but with blades","review":"I think it's worth watching once.While I did appreciate the spectacle of people trying to work their way out of a deadly trap using mathematics, I would say that the film fell apart when the director tried to ramrod some allegorical meanings into it. The writing wasn't well-wrought enough for me to buy any of them.The idea that the Cube was originally a mammoth public works project that got out of control was serviceable enough, and hey isn't that like life? The problem with these metaphorical approaches is that certain events in the movie disallow them. Then how do you explain how everybody got in the cube? How do you explain how they don't remember? How do you explain how they left off questioning Worth when there were many other things he could have answered?If the director wanted this to be an allegory, he should have insisted on a script without so many leaks in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You do the work, since the writers haven't bothered.","review":"You're in a deadly maze and you have a limited amount of time to get out - compelling enough. To make things worse you're trapped with a group of incompetent actors asked to play inconsistent and unmotivated characters, and you are forced to listen to dialogue that makes little sense and has dreadful philosophical pretensions. Just beyond the confines of the set lurk young and goofy directors and writers who are just overjoyed to be making a film (any film) that looks 'cool', that has a 'cool' idea at its core, and who believe in 'very little direction' and 'just getting it in the can' (quotes from their commentary). What do you do in a situation like this? Well, either watch something else, or enjoy the look of the sets, or get excited by the suggestiveness of the situation - come to this movie with low expectations and you won't be too disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blessed are the meek, cause they shall inherit","review":"The Cube is a movie about a group of people trapped in a cube which has many boobytraps. They all have to work together to get out. There a math-wizz, a doctor and an escape artist for example. As always in a movie like this they work together and fight each other, especially a bad cop is on their tails.The special effects are limited, which is better for the story.The moral of the film is more difficult. Are we all trapped in our lives, full of violence not knowing what we are doing but helping the world to a quick end. Someone is called a nazi, another has felt guilty ever since she was 7 and one does not even want to get out because he does not see what he can do there.It is fitting that in the end the only one who gets out is an autistic guy. Is this what's in store for us...?The outcome is bleak and pessimistic. A nice ending that way. Apparently there is a part 2 as well, can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cube","review":"The movie was a waste of time. I watch a lot of movies. By far, Cube could easily be one of the worse!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"A really horrible effort. Wooden acting, bare effects and a plot that goes nowhere.

The plot might have been interesting, but once again, a sci-fi movie devolves into a \\"horror\\" movie, where it's all about who's gonna meet what grisly end. The plot had an interesting concept and, apparently, that was it's only original idea. Obviously, it had no budget, but if you are going to trap a bunch of people in a room and make an audience listen to them fight and whine, you should give them something interesting to say. The Cube is definately USA channel, B-movie, sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film moved me to write a review","review":"This movie had a long list of qualities that ultimately led to its suckiness.1 Bad plot- the plot was underdeveloped, aiming at the philosophical but asking questions that did not transcend beyond the crappy cube. The only enjoyable part about the plot was the mathematical relationships, but most people dont understand math that well, i'm not sure the writers knew what they were saying (although it was all correct.)2. Bad acting- theres a reason why i never saw these people before and will never see them again. If acting is any of their full time jobs, you tax dollars are currently paying for their public assistance checks3 bad direction- although comedy and tragedy are film basics, this director must have failed both. His horrible failure at tragedy wasn't even comical, just painful.so to continue with the movie's math theme point 1 + point 2 + point 3 = cinema garbageThis film was lucky it got the obligatory star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless movie","review":"I tell everyone I know not to waste their time with this movie. The acting is terrible, the characters boring stereotypes, and the plot trite and insipid. Supposedly there is a deeper meaning to it all, a laughable (and feeble) attempt to find meaninglessness in our actions and existence. People are pulled from their beds and into a box, where one wrong move will kill and staying where you are is the best way to stay alive. The characters each have something to offer in puzzling their way out, math skills, strength, etc. but it all blows up when they get sick of being around each other and start developing silly personality tics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Cube was a good movie, alot of action.

Oh, and our life usually makes just as little sense as being in the cube with all those strangers. Love that kind of movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewed and Cubed","review":"I felt like I was in the cube. you did not know anything until the characters knew it. That alone keeps you on the edge of your seat. The fact that you don't quite get to know what exactly the cube was made for is troubling, but it was an amazing film with an original idea... although it at first reminded me of \\"Saw\\" the movie.

I didn't expect much and was drawn into this unique sci-fi thriller. So much so that I have the trilogy (of which, this is the first). I enjoy riddles and there were a number of riddles to figure out... how did these people get there, why are they there, what is \\"there\\", is there a trick to get out, etc. The acting is not stellar, it's pretty violent, there's virtually no CGI, probably low budget, but I was drawn into the unique story and still loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cube is now one of my favorite movies","review":"I love Cube it is definitely a different type of film where you watch the entire movie with very limited information.

While it's not always successful, they deserve credit for A) trying and B) focusing on more than just \\"We're being so DEEP, man\\" in the script. This is NOT the standard thriller that it could have been, with a director who thought tossing some common intellectual concepts in redeemed a weak script and shoddy filmmaking >COUGH< David Fincher >COUGH<.Basically, if you need a high concept version, this is the Twilight Zone episode \\"Six Characters in Search of an Exit\\" with more style, more inventiveness...and the ending has the same effect, and if you've seen that episode (admittedly it's hard to forget) you know what THAT means. You see this movie for the ride, not the finale.It's worth at least one viewing; certainly as a demonstration of creativity with no budget, it's an inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect any kind of explanation!","review":"It is as if the producers started with a truly excellent concept, but were too lazy to develop it any further and just threw together some hackneyed script and rushed off to the set. \\"It's just a movie\\" is no excuse for the unbelievable effect this unfortunate and inexplicable predicament has on the characters. A reaction of wild panic I could believe, but how the characters behave in this film is simply not plausible. The ending is not in the least bit satisfying. The fact that nothing is explained doesn't lend the film \\"mystique\\" as I am sure was the filmmaker's intent, it's just very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie without a point to it...","review":"The movie is about people who find themselves inside a giant structure without any clue to why they are in there, how they got there or who built the damn thing. Well, after seeing the entire thing I still can't answer any of those questions! The movie gives a whole new meaning to the term 'open ending' - it can't be called an ending at all. The director leads us by the nose for 90 minutes, and when we get to the conclusion we find out there isn't any - the movie just ends. Avoid, unless you have a lot of spare time on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"Cube is the tale of a group of people who awake to find themselves in a square room (a cube!) and with no idea how they got there. The rest of the film is spent trying to figure out how they got there and how to get out, as they make their way from one cube room to another.Sounds boring, right? It is. Cube is an okay film at best, but that is only if you try to derive deeper meaning from it. I tried, I found a nugget, but I still really wasn't all that entertained.The main failing of the film is that we really don't like any of the characters. I know, sometimes this is done to make an artistic statement, well, it had better be done really well then, because any slip up with unlikable characters produces an unlikable movie.I have to give Cube credit, it is a low-budget film, and the actors do for the most part turn in nice performances. My big problem, however, was that I just didn't care by the time it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cube roxer joo boxxors","review":"If you enjoyed braveheart then I have no idea if you will enjoy this.A question about today's society, this movie is a brilliant.

The plot was weird but the makers executed it very well. The story goes something like this; Six people are trapped inside a maze filled with ingenious yet sick minded traps. To make things more difficult for the prisoners, all the rooms shift aroung the outer Shell.Although there was a relatively low budget and some of the visual effects were really cheesy most of the movie's suspense was left to imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in a cube","review":"First off, I loved this movie! It opens up with a group of people in a cube meeting each other for the first time. From there they must figure out why they are in this cube, what is the cube, how they got there, and how to get out. Throughout the movie, answers along with new questions arise almost simultaneously. Along their journey one can't help but compare the characters and the setting to the real world. Nicole de Boer has done an excellent job of relaying her comments on society to the audience. Note: only watch this if you like thinking during a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! It is AWESOME!","review":"This is one of the best films I have seen in awhile. I was quite impressed with the acting and the story, it kept me glued right to my seat.

That I need to view it at least 3 times to get along with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I'd heard...","review":"'Cube', although interesting in some aspects, was more of a disappointment than anything. After hearing of such rave reviews and critical acclaims I was left only to wonder why the movie got such a positive response. As a few reviewers had claimed, 'Cube' was \\"one of the most intensely complex movies of the year\\". This I found hard to grasp. The set was hardly complex and even less than appealing, the cast was a group of little-known actors where one could see why they were still unknown, and the plot, although intriguing at times, fell short of a \\"good story\\". Not to mention, after the first half-hour's worth of the movie, the plot became far too predictable, incorporating aspects of cinematography that have been done to death over the past twenty years. Although 'Cube' did come through with its short quips once and a while, it was, in my opinion, a waste of a good $$$..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little film","review":"This is quite a film for such a low budget -- yeah, I know everyone says that, but...well, it is. I could have done without Holloway's character due to SEVERE over-acting, and yes, Quentin had the same problem (not to the same degree IMO). Still, it's better than the FX driven drivel that is coming out of Hollow-wood. I was very upset that the girl didn't make it (wasn't it she that got them where they were?), but I liked the fact that the movie brought out these emotions in me. For kicks, let your Grandma watch the opening scene. (ummm...I sure won't)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, then falls flat...","review":"This movie didn't know what it wanted to do. It starts as a sci-fi/horror and ends up a jumble of lame characters and stupid dialogue. The plot is weak and the vague description of the cubes purpose is laughable. All of the characters undergo a complete personality change in the short time span the movie takes place, and the ending seemed like the writers had stopped caring about what they were doing and just put in the easiest cop-out they could think of. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and Original!","review":"A Freaky-Intense and quite interesting look and life and death...a little sick and very clever...does not have non-stop action but it really doesn't need it...check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting & Mesmerizing!","review":"Cube... the first thing that comes to mind is, naturally, a cube. But this movie takes the \\"Cube\\" concept a little further. A handfull of strangers wake up in a cube that connects to other cubes. They must choose the right path, or the right cubes, and if they don't, they suffer a horrible death. The acting is great along with superb dialouge. The movie is downright spooky and made me think. There is a lot of math terms, which only scholars might understand. The fact that the makers of this movie thought outside the box, or cube, is excellent. I loved the idea and how different it was compared to other movies. I definately reccomend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to High-Concept Hell","review":"Seemingly-random people are trapped in a giant, deadly Rubik's cube!There, you have the entire movie, sadly. This is one of those films where all the interesting parts are right up-front, and the actual film is filled with stock characters, predictable plot points, cliched interactions and juvenile conspiracy theories. We're lead to believe that the people were chosen deliberately, yet some characters seem utterly useless, added only to create artificial drama. The interactions are not believable, the climax an insulting cop-out, and while the lack of explanation seems to work for awhile, soon it fails as suspense and you just stop caring.It's not terrible, and you can admire how they were able to stretch out a minuscule budget. The acting is tolerable, though not good enough to transcend the shallow stereotypes they had to work with. Ultimately, no matter how compelling the concept, you spend the entire time waiting for an actual movie to show up, and it never does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"I saw part of this fascinating film quite a while ago and was quite intrigued by what I saw. I've seen the whole thing now, and I'm glad I have as its been worth the wait.Some strangers, who don't know how they got there, wake up inside the cube and try to escape from it - essentially thats it. However each of the occupants has a particular skill that will assist the group as a whole from escaping. The Cube is in fact a series of interlocking cubes - sort of like a giant rubics cube. Some of the inner cubes are booby- trapped making life a little more difficult for the people stuck inside.The movie was probably made on a pretty low budget, but the special effects are still pretty good. When you see the end of the film it doesn't feel like a Hollywood ending, so I wasn't that surprised to find that it is a Canadian film.Watch with an open mind, and don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy a clever little film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea...bad movie","review":"Some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. I'm astounded by how many people give this high ratings. I hesitated even giving it 2 stars. Yes, it's an interesting premise for a movie, and an interesting set, but that's about it. The characters were weak, the acting was worse than weak, the plot was weak, nothing is resolved or explained in the end (a weak attempt by the writer and director to appear purposely ambiguous is my guess). This could have been a good movie if it had been developed properly. Don't waste your time buying this one. Instead wait for it to show up on the Sci-Fi channel. If you want a good movie get Pi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much acting.","review":"This movie is OK; just OK. It has an interesting premise and a certain level of suspense, but way too much acting and a little too much writing.

Film school stuff, by sophomores for sophomores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I saw this film because it was recommended by a couple of my friends. I was not disappointed. I thought the premise was great. The only problem I have was that the acting in a couple scenes wasn't so great. In my opinion, I believe they are actually in something along the lines of purgatory. They don't remember how they got there. I think they are dead. The only reason the retard was the only one to survive is because he was the only \\"pure\\" one. He did no wrong in the movie, whereas the others did and were \\"punished\\" for it. At the end, the retard steps into the bright light, or heaven. You probably don't agree with me, but its just an idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best kind of humor..unintentional.","review":"There was nothing humorous in Cube's premise, in fact, my impression was that the movie would be a great suspense/horror flick. The five characters find themselves stripped of everything but their names trapped in a maze, where each room they entered could potentially hold a new way to die. Here's the problem, the characters talked through would be suspenseful moments. If the film been better written and better directed, true the humor would have been lost, but the film might have actually been good. The only redeeming quality this movie posessed was the level of melodrama on the part of the actors. Three months after seeing this film, I am still able to quote some of the particularly choice moments. See this film because it is entertaining. Expect it to live up to the standards of it's premise, and you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmmm.","review":"brilliant premise, it sustains the movie almost until the end, but....yes, but, twas a bit predicatable and cheesy, the idiot savante being the only one to escape, and other characters a bit 2-dimensional, however one of the most best IDEAS I've seen in a movie for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"better luck next time !!!!!","review":"i would have been more inpressed if it was just called I HAVE NO MOUTH BUT I MUST SCREAM if we just keep ripping off or based on the story, the work of Harlin Ellison and other great writers will be truly beaten into the ground people will stop reading books \\"cause ta movie waz easyer to do know whats i means \\" then when we as a race of a so-called intelegent life form reach our next phase of de-evolution we can title it I HAVE NO BRAIN BUT I MUST SPEAK!!!

The movie was interesting for about 10 minutes. I kept hoping something different would evolve. It left me a bit panicky that people would actually sacrifice their lives rather than cooperate and that tempers would really flare to that degree, but I'm skeptical mankind is in reality this idiotic.

The acting was horrible. A fifth grade drama class could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story, no plot","review":"This movie has no story and no plot at all. Nice if you like some gruesome scenes, but that's just about it. I would recommend Cube Zero much more (see my review there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, terrible result","review":"The movie is an interesting premise and could have been very intriguing. This is not the case, though, and the reality is fairly unfortunate. The movie is trite, the characters flat and one-dimensional. For a movie that could have contained such interesting characterizations, the actors (or director, or script) fail to give any depth to the characters. It is miserable. There is tension in the film, but it is annoying, not appreciated. The movie is manipulative, and has nothing particularly remarkable to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-intellectual pap","review":"Dreadful acting, dreadful writing, dreadful characters, dreadful attempt at philosophy.

I bought this new release expecting to love it all, with one or two epics like Euphoria, Sister Nightfall, or Lithium and a Lover. What did I get instead?--46 minutes of pop radio. Gone is the violin, and rare is Morten's voice. We get a bunch of Monika (who has a solid voice, but every song sounded the same). Please, Morten, tell us this is an early April fool's joke and that the real release is coming out April 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"another failure in gothic metal","review":"Don't get me wrong -- I loved all the Sirenia albums. I loved Morten in Tristania (another band that went the same direction as Sirenia on their last release)... but this is POP. It is not metal, it is not even gothic, it's POP. No violins, no Morten doing any vocals at all (and he has a great singing voice, not just his growls). This is reminding me an awful lot of another band that went down this road -- a band called Theatre of Tragedy.If you like the old albums, don't bother buying this one. You can listen to 30 seconds of one song on this album and understand why. That's really all you need, because every song sounds exactly the same.That's all we needed, another failure in gothic metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic...","review":"Epic vocals from one of the best lead singers to be with Sirenia.

The lead singer's voice is not as rich as I expected, and I read somewhere that this band considered themselves to be \\"symphonic\\" metal, and even went so far as to invite comparisons with Dimmu Borgir. Yet I heard very few strings or winds, and I heard none of the bombast associated with Dimmu's latest offerings (Death Cult Armageddon & In Sorte Diaboli).The songs are amateurish with bland, predictable melodies that lack energy and lyrical content that sounds like it came directly out of my buddy's goth sister's diary.In short, mopey 14-year-old self-mutilators who just lost their \\"one true love\\" will eat this up.

When I tried to carefully remove the tape, gum residue remained on the chamois. I just returned the first one for replacement (thank you Amazon), but the replacement was even worse. Since the Chamois is so small, I didn't have the luxury of cutting off the gummed part. I ended up using a de-gumming product and then cleaning the chamois...all a waste of my time.

He is a wonderful writer and his characters are great and very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting mystery","review":"Malone's \\"Handling Sin\\" is one of my all-time favorites, so I was delighted to see \\"First Lady.\\" It was fascinating--very complex plot--although I sometimes got restless with Justin's insistence at wallowing in misery. Cuddy was great, though, and the deductive processes were excellent. I had my suspicions, but wasn't sure about the killer's identity until the very end. Great job! I'm going back to read the other two in the series now, and have already recommended \\"First Lady\\" to two other readers. And if you haven't read \\"Handling Sin,\\" try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The south rises again","review":"Michael Malone is a gifted, poetic writer who knows his turf & can immerse the reader into the southern environment and its characters. For these talents alone, his novels are enjoyable and worth reading.The mystery is presented intricately, but is too transparent [as did another reviewer, I knew the murderer at least 100 pages before the end of the novel]. But that did not distract from my interest in the characters.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt at times the language and sexual descriptions were a little too graphic for my taste. However, they were not inappropriate in context, and I admit to being on the old-fashioned side in those matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you want to laugh out loud?","review":"I adore this book. I just finished it and am going to buy all the other Michael Malone books that I can get my hands on. Not only is it a literate mystery but it offers up some of the most endearing yet humanly flawed characters that I've run into in a long time. I know I'll pick it up again and again for the wonderfully Southern descriptions uttered by thecharacters.I haven't laughed so much reading a book since I originally read THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.Well done Mr. Malone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just So-So","review":"When Mama brought home a potty for Annie, Annie said, \\"No.\\" When I offered to read this book again to my daughter, she said, \\"No more.\\" Judith Caseley wrote this book based on her experience with her own daughter. Thus Annie's initial resistance to the new potty rings true. Caseley also includes trained playmate Samantha who tries to show Annie the ropes, a tactic some parents attempt (hopefully with more success than Annie's parents). But the story is less entertaining than others on the same topic. I suggest Potty! by Mylo Freeman, Sara's Potty by Harriet Ziefert, or The New Potty by Mayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind","review":"Although it is true that this movie is not blessed with great acting.

All in all this movie was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karch said it best!","review":"This movie was a joke! Sinjin and Randy let themselves appear to get beaten by two guys who are 5'10\\" or maybe less. Karch said how unrealistic it would be for a kid from Milwaukee to beat two beach pros in their prime. Karch had the dignity to turn down the movie money and just say \\"no.\\" Sinjin and Randy however, they showed us what whores they are. Karch said, \\"How can any self-respecting volleyball player let themselves get beat by a guy who had been playing the game for one summer.\\" Movie or no movie, Karch just didn't see it happening. The movie is pure fantasy, much like the \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" A good ending for the movie would have been for C.

An AVP Pro Beach Volleyball fans dream movie! Without sounding crazy, I've watched this movie over 600 times, and yes I can recite it line for line. This is every beach volleyball player's dream to move out to California and become an AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Player. It also doesn't hurt to fall in love with a blonde beauty like Courtney Thorne-Smith in the process. Lots of great scenery and lot's of great appearances by beach volleyball pro's for instance; Sinjin Smith, Randy Stoklos, Steve O'Bradovich, Tim Hovland, Mike Dodd, Ricci Luyties, Steve Timmons, Kent Steffes, Craig Moothart and many more!

If you have a hangover on a Sunday afternoon, this movie may fit the bill. The dialogue will make you squirm, and then crack up. The movie isn't mean-spirited, just painfully cheesy. Nothing happens in the flick that you wouldn't expect. The best part of the movie is the dialogue. It's priceless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughable, yet, enticing","review":"OK, for so many different reasons I could easily pan this. The volleyball action by a certain duo, namely horton / howell, really stinks! The acting is out and out crap, Stoklos and Smiths final film for a reason.HOWEVER, I love this movie, if for no other reason that you get to see some of the classic players; Timmons, Stoklos, Smith, Mootheart, and of course OB. It is a fun romp through a sillier time, when anyone without a sponsorship deal could dream. Just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS WHY NO ONE KNOWS WHERE C THOMAS HOWELL IS","review":"Upon viewing this movie I now know that actually being able to write a script, let alone being able to write at all, has absolutly nothing to do in wheteher or not a movie gets made. Sure it has everything anyone looks for in a movie, sand, poor acting, more sand, C. Thomas Howell, sand, that guy from 'thirtysomething',sand,and an obvious repeated Mossimo product placement. What is wrong with the Academy in not noticing this as one of the best films ever? You nay sayers can have your 'Schindler's List' but for me, true drama and struggle displayed through one man's journey to play volleyball is more life affirming than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks","review":"Obvious editing of any swearing, terrible v'ball choreography, and the awful last scene makes this movie a detriment to the sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side out, now there's a concept.","review":"This is one of the worst films you are ever likely to see. The acting stinks, the action is awful, however, this is strangely compulsive viewing. You know exactly what is going to happen but for some reason you have to watch. This is a must for all useless movie fans. The other big problem is that somebody must have believed that beach volleyball was going to be huge, that never happened.

It is like he is doing a bad Jimmy Buffett impersonation. I have a poster from a concert of Sammys that I attended a couple of years ago and below his picture it reads \\" The voice of real rock\\" Well this album is REAL bad and not any kind of rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh man Sammy, dont know where you are or where you're going??","review":"Well you can probably tell by the title of my review I am dissapointed again. Sammy, if you read this or if his fans do, don't get me wrong. I just sense some change in the Red Rocker. It is almost as if he is stretching and reaching and grasping at straws or swatting at flies!! The genuine music of his past with the feelings coming through in his powerful voice are not here in Living It Up. He sounds raspy, hungover and desperate.Sammy dear, if you need money, I suggest not making any more of these far fetched CD's and hooking up with VH again, doing voice overs that will allow the punch and push you lack, and/or hanging up the michrophone and coming to the resolve that the only place you will be singing when you reach 55 or so is in Mexico....Sorry sweetie, words are meant for growth only-What would you do with out a critique?DLP"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Rocker Does it again!","review":"upon first listening to this I was a little shocked at the mellow direction of this CD. I'm not saying it sucked, in anyway, but I guess I expected more rockers that what's on here. Sammy Hagar meets Jimmy Buffett HOWEVER...I'll tell you what, after going back to work and not hearing it, i found myself humming some of these tracks in my mind. \\"Sam I Am\\" and his version of Toby Keith's \\"I love this Bar\\" are my 2 favorites, but they're all good. The songs may not rock as one would expect, but I'll be danged if these songs ain't catchy! Sammy always has a way of writing songs that catch my attention. He may suprise, but NEVER dissapoints!!!I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I knew bad music - then I heard this album.....","review":"I've been a VH fan for years and years. I've loved Hagar's work with them as well as his solo work. As a matter of fact, I still listen to his self-titled album (aka I Never Said Goodbye) and think it stands the test of time. Let's face it, Sammy was never known as a lyrical giant - but he has hit an all-time low. This album is just plain pathetic! Every tune on it is a blatant advertisement for his resort and/or his tequila. Give me a break! Can't you find something else to sing about??? This album reminds me of Hollywood's take at a Buffet album - and not an early Buffet album but one of his more recent releases. If you're looking for bad lyrics that advertise Sammy Hagar's club and product lines - then this is the album for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAY IT AIN'T SO SAMMY!!!!!","review":"Sorry....The Red Rocker's gone all softy on us.And country too boot!This albumn is...well...YUCK!I've been a Sammy fan since the days of Montrose, and he's always brought the goods.

I enjoy them both for their differences and what each lead singer brought to the mix. Solo career wise, you have to just love Hagar. He just knows how to put on a show and evolve. Dave still seem stuck in 1984. Hagar has evolved into a hard rock Jimmy Buffett type. His music and attitude is very similar to Mr. Parrothead: we're here to party and have a good time. There isn't any underlining message to the music, no preaching. Its just fun rock music with a guy who seems to be having fun. The album is just like that and in this day and age its just plain fun to listen to an album, while you're having a couple of Waboritas and not have to worry if the next song is gonna be any good. Its all good. Will it convert people to Hagar. Probably not. Will it appease his fans. Most definately. Will I buy the next album. You can bet your...well you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to buy it to believe it....","review":"...but it's true. Sammy's gone country. There are 2 MAYBE 3 tracks on this whole album that are any good. My taste in music is very broad with one exception - country. If I had to name one rock icon of mine, it would be Sammy and...Sammy...you really let me down with this album. It pains me to say so, but I can't recommend this album to the classic Hagar rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad I didn't buy it !","review":"After listening to the songs on the album, and then hearing a song from \\"The Pointer Sisters\\" -- Let me take you there -- I decided not to buy it. I could not listen to Sammy sing the song, the same one I heard the Pointer Sisters sing in Vegas, years ago. Man, what happen to the old Sammy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out, or fading away?","review":"This is a review I never would have thought I'd have to give to a Sammy release - Livin' It Up is a disaster!! This music is flat out WIMPY!Comparing this to just about any other release in Sammy's catalogue is like ordering Cabo Wabo tequila and being handed a Corona Light...they just ain't the same thing! Sammy's original compositions here are like Jimmy Buffet rejects and Sammy adds absolutely nothing to the covers. OK, so we're all getting older, but I still think its a mighty sad day when Toby Keith's version of a song rocks harder than Sammy's version...You have to wonder what Sammy was thinking with this release - I'm taking my copy and trading it in at the used store before they get flooded with more used copies.Love ya', Sammy, but this is a huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is really a great book.

He writes about the same issue many times wasting reader's time. The issue that he covered before in few sentences is dragged for 2 pages. He does not give in depth information. He just describes idea and writes to consult CPA. The book has little to do with taxes for traders, it describes more the avoidance of estate taxation. I do not recommend this book.

The production is less overdriven then their other albums, and the guitar and bass are less distorted, but the energy still comes out loud and clear. Oddly enough, there's a relatively slower song featuring chimes (\\"Light Baby\\" on the Japanese version)--don't let that freak you though--it still rocks. It's got more of a 70s, \\"classic punk\\" feel to it than \\"Planet Of The Wolves\\" or \\"Jet Generation,\\" which are just nuts. You could see this album sitting next to the Dead Boys in your stash. Defintely one for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral Irrigator","review":"Excellent product.

I am comparing it with the Water Pik Cordless. First, I am disappointed that it seems to have a very small tank. It says it is the same size as Water Pik, but only lasts about 30 seconds and has to be refilled several times. With the Water Pik I would have to refill it maybe once. Also, it comes with only one tip, but I don't know how durable it is. One thing I am not happy about is that instructions state you can't use anything but plain tap water. My dentist said to mix it up with part hydrogen peroxide or Crest mouthwash (I have gum issues) but apparently you can't with this one. I can't comment on battery life or durability yet, but don't rate it highly because of these other issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Not the best.

It's quiet, and you can really direct the spray exactly where you want it because the body and nozzle are so compact, it's like using an electric toothbrush! It's nice not having any twisting-turning tubing attached to the nozzle to deal with, like the full size models use.And it doesn't take up much room when not in use like a full-sized table top water pik device does. And did I mention it's very quiet?!I haven't had to change the batteries so far, in the month I've had it..and it's still going strong, with a very good spray that's neither too strong where it hurt your gums, nor too weak where it's ineffective. And once you turn it on, it stays on, and it's easy to turn off and empty.I'd buy it all over again if I had to. Very pleased with it.

In many instances you can see small openings in the fiber.Fiber has some oil that helps to collect dirt from air, but sometimes that can also mess up ignition things. Filter build solidly, but the main working function clearly not as good as a regular ( original) filter. I went on other web sites to read reviews about it. Many people impressed by it's solid build, but informed ones all point to potential problems from using it. Bottom line it will allow more air, but at expense of allowing more dirt in to an engine. Following common sense, in industrial settings nobody uses type of filters as K&N; does, in semiconductors manufacturing, in clean rooms all filters are HEPA, and fiber type similar to regular (original) filters. Using K&N; filters might void warranty on your car.Will be returning these today, and will get original ones at third of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce is the Man!","review":"Although it doesn't have every Bruce song I would like there is no other compilation that can beat this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right CD","review":"Received this CD with Bruce Springsteen packaging and in a Bruce Springsteen box however the music on the disk is not Bruce, discovered this error too late to return.

Mr. Silber has written a book that's full of useful financial info, and being one who makes a living as an artist, I found myself nodding in agreement on many of the pages.

It is a slasher film, with blood, guts, and a head roll. Hispanic cast made for a nice change. The music sound track was by Cinder Road which sounds similar to NIN. The film attempted to add some humor, but it didn't come off too well. The lines were not that well written. Pretty much everything you expect in a slasher film plus Guitar Hero.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Vivi Pineda, Christine Curran, porn star Michelle McLaren)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"The 5 star ratings are baffling. Example of the numerous ridiculous moments in the dialogue. The police officer mentions he was able to get a hard core criminal to crack and give information by spending a lot of time with the criminal. He states he held his hand frequently and even kissed the hard core criminal. Then it shows the police officer in the hospital holding the hand of the guy that murdered his daughter. He has the hand pressed against his check with affection. He is trying to build up an emotional connection with the man that murdered his daughter so the murderer will reveal the name af his accomplice. At this point i removed the dvd from the machine and tossed it in the garbage. The makers of this ridiculous junk must take the viewers for complete fools and idiots. Obviously, some of them are.

That is a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"I found the title in an early 2010 review by Joe Morgenstern of the WSJ. Like many of the commenters here, he gave it a rave review. By mistake I originally started the new Mel Gibson version. After I gave up on Mel, on the strength of the reviews, I started the BBC disks. I persevered through the first 3 of the 6 episodes. I won't watch the rest, especially after reading comments that the 2nd 3 episodes are less compelling that the first 3.With some exceptions, its boring, like watching paint dry. I do like Brit productions, generally across the spectrum, but this one is a slow mess. It's not worth the 3+ hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"I saw this originally on BBCtv in the eighties and was mesmerised.

I still treasure my (worn out) VHS dub from all those years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Dated But Very Good Thriller","review":"I saw this within the last year and enjoyed it. However, I don't agree with all the other reviewers' five stars. In its day of 1985, I think it was a five star series. Since then we've had a lot more series, especially from the BBC, and I personally think they have gone beyond this series. For one, the device, where the father keeps seeing the ghost or semi-ghost of the daughter (we're not quite sure how much is his grief or imagination) has been used a tremendous amount since then. The basic story of how the father tries to get to the bottom of his daughter's death, is pretty interesting. She is murdered when she is returning home with him and it doesn't take long to find out she was an activist against some governmental activities. This is quite good and I think if you enjoy mysteries and thrillers, you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Region 1 DVD Be Available Soon?","review":"Does anyone know if or when this series will be available in Region 1 format?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Moody, Excellent Characters, and a Plot to Die For!","review":"This 2-video set will have you wondering where your weekend went!

To appreciate it better, one must admit that if Aliens were very humanlike then they would act humanlike. Only two real SF gadgets super space radio and Dynocars. The radio has NO explantion, but the Dynocars run off of broadcast power. Probably a juvenile read in today's world.

An entertaining and enjoyable combination of spy and sci fi.Our hero is given the task of being a small but annoying nuisance on a planet behind enemy lines.

It is a fascinating story of how one man can befuddle an entire civilization. The overtones are a bit ominous in the post-9/11 world, of course, although Russell's clever hero James Mowry is hardly a terrorist. It is also interesting to read the book in light of the reality Russell based it on--the Japanese secret police in WW2. From that perspective, his description of the aliens becomes xenophobic and somewhat disturbing--but the book's story telling verve and hilarious sense of humor overcomes any difficulties. Just read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great step by step book","review":"This is a great step by step book, it has a variety of people, animals and furniture and landscape.

I knew it wasn't the kernels of popcorn since I made a batch in a glass bowl yesterday and they came nice and fluffy. When the 3.5 minutes were up on my microwave, I went to take the bowl of what was supposed to be popcorn out of the microwave, and I couldn't lift the bowl. The popper had melted onto the glass rotating dish in my microwave! Now I have to see if I can find a new glass rotating plate for my microwave or see if I can somehow scrape off the plastic from the glass. Unbelievable!

I was very excited to try cooking popcorn that was healthy without the oil and the clean-up. I read the directions through and followed them exactly. On the first try it burned half of the popcorn and left many kernels uncooked. So, I tried again. Same thing happened. It is supposed to take 1-3 minutes to cook the popcorn. At about the 2 minutes popcorn starts to smell burnt even though half of the popcorn has not popped yet. A few kernels got trapped under the plastic disk and melted some of the bowl. Also, after cooking the popcorn, the disk in the bottom is extremely hot and could burn user. Extremely disappointed in this item. Do not waste your money.

However, I will probably wait until Sony's DVD recorder can edit in DVD+RW format. I will never buy another Philips product again. Their engineers are incompetent, and their tech support staff in Jamaica is a joke.

At this stage I know more than customer service about their machine. The interface is difficult and cumbersome I recommend avoiding the system.

Do not buy this movie unless you think the only passable Slyvester Stallone movie was Copland. Do not buy this movie if your entire reason for watching a movie is so you can spot a movie star to keep you attention from otherwise talking to your cheetos. Do not buy this movie if you do not like black and white films. Do not buy this movie if you only like black and white films with a happy ending and drugs. Do not buy this movie if the stock market, spiral staircases, hallucinations, annoying but sweet neighbors, ultra religious Jews, greedy Wall Street insiders, or good, mind numbing noir in general.Do buy this film if you are a film lover.

I think some people (reviewers perhaps) have a need to see indy films in an unnaturally good light just because they are indies, and out of the elitist disdain for mainstream hollywood fare. Liking \\"Pi\\" makes them feel suave and sophisticated. I agree about most mainstream hollywood fare being worthless (anyone else just see Hellboy? hell is sitting and watching that for 2 hours) but that doesnt make awful indie films better.

The idea is simple enough: a mathematician trying to find the formula to explain the pattern of life. Certain groups are after him but that's all of the story that makes sense.

He figures that since patterns can be found everywhere else in the world, there must be a pettern to the stock market as well. That's all I'm gonna tell you about the plot, since I don't want to spoil the movie for you.Shot in b/w, the bleakness of it reminds me of \\"Eraserhead\\", but where \\"Eraserhead\\" got really boring after twenty or so minutes, this movie never gets boring.

What is so astonishing is that these ideas which the movie barely scratches the surface of, the depth of GO, the Fibonnaci series, are so rich as to be wide open to he possiblity of a really great story.

It a one of a kind scifi thriller that leaves you wondering and guessing to the spectacular ending that you would not of guessed. The movie shows the paranoia of middle aged mathematician that is possesed by his inscrupulous doubt that everyone and everything are out to get him. His only outlet is a friendly companion that soon leads him on to believe that chaos cannot have a pattern and his attempts are futile, as the old man relives his past experience with the workings of Pi. Throughtout the movie the man is hunted by Wall Street, Hasanic Jews, and a crippling disease that requires constant attention and medication. The ending is suberb as the young man learns the truth about nature through his weaknesses. Its a must see but certainly not a tv movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can't go wrong with such enticing premises.","review":"You should definitely agree that it's one of those great movies at a very low price. And it's not all that featureless. There's a small 'behind-the-scenes' type segment, where you get to meet most of the crew behind the movie, production notes, and notes on pi itself (to give you a better perspective on concept). There's also two commentary tracks (Darren and Sean), which are namely what stand out most of the features. You can't go wrong with commentary tracks on low-budget movies. They're just so entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pi and it's 'mathematical' jargon","review":"I saw Pi for the first time about a month or so ago. It is turly one of the most brilliant and original movies of all time. It is like nothing else I have heard of or seen. Though I'm not a math thinker and my skills lie more in the aesthetic quality of movies and art, I didn't find the math jargon too distracting or too confusing. Though I didn't understand every little thing that was going on, the mystery was beautifully depicted and easy to follow. I suggest it to all who read this or hear of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What existed pre-Big Bang","review":"This is a question serious philosophers snort at when they hear. Any of the most profound questions we come up with as kids are ignored by the know-it-alls who know nothing. Such is a question asked in Pi, a film that works on many levels among them: avant garde filmmaking, asking if there is an intelligence behind all that exists, and finding the pattern of that intelligence, implementation of electronic music effectively, theoretical physics, and chaos theory. Max Cohen finds the secret to the whole universe; both an Einstein and Christ of his generation who can't handle this ultimate knowledge. This film enters a realm we will spend the whole next millenium trying to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the science??","review":"I just saw the movie and was frustrated because I knew it got very favourable reviews. But I just don't see the plot of this story getting away with anything \\"mind-blowing\\". Seriously, if it's just about a man - who clearly has a mental disorder - trying to correlate pi with god, then ok, i'll try to watch the movie with that mindset. But all the reviews from credible critics had me convinced it was a movie about a man getting as close as possible to identifying pi with god. There's no math here, just pattern finding biases.Treat it as fantasy or a drama about mental disorders, not about some pseudo-plausible god code. Because then the math is more important than the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible premise","review":"This movie triggered my flight instinct within the first five minutes and I regret not leaving. I am a mathematician. This movie deifies mathematics. I should be happy right? What I hate about this film is the underlying premise, which is prototypical of the way too many people view mathematics. Despite the striking audio-visual appearance of this movie as an artsy, independent film, it fails to deliver the story, message, or question that makes a stimulating film.What's 216? It's 6 cubed and has less to do with being a human than even this pathetically misguided, pretentious movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"I gotta say that I've had 5 false starts with this film. Each time i tried to watch it, i'd get a headache and turn it off.

It is. No actually it's freaking great! It's a classic in my book.The end of the film makes it all worthwhile...believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aronofsky at his edgy best","review":"A real film noir cult classic in black and white. Not for the squeamish, this sci-fi thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as you follow Maximiliam Cohen on the quest for the most important discovery of his life. He's trying to decode the numerical pattern beneath the ultimate system of ordered chaos -- the stock market. He teeters on the edge of insanity, and he uncovers a secret for which everyone is willing to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough Independent Film","review":"Pi is the kind of independent film that both encourages aspiring filmmakers and discourages them. It encourages them, because they can see that it is possible to make an incredible movie and break into the film industry with 60 grand.(It costs even less to shoot in color) However, it discourages them, because the intuition and creative genius that Darren Aronofsky makes you feel like you're trying to take 1+1 while Albert Einstein is doing the Relativity Theory. Most people will not like this movie, because they don't understand film, yet. Watch it once or twice. Read about the background info online, then watch it with the commentary. Then, watch it again.

Gritty, high contrast b/w images, rundown locales, excellent, frenetic score sweeps you along in a dizzying madness.The core of the movie is about Max, who looked into the sun too long as a child, causing him to have intense migraines for the rest of his life. As an implied side-effect, Max has immense capabilities to notice, process and understand numbers - from performing long multiplication for his neighbour, to patterns in leaves, and, just out of reach, the stockmarket...Just out of reach, but close enough for others to get interested.The irony is, for someone who can handle so much compexity, Max is struggling to cope with the simple realities of day to day life, love and co-existence, with dramatic results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close for comfort.","review":"The movie is amazing.

Darren Aronofsky is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and mysterious.; must experience it at least once","review":"\\"Pi\\" was this mysterious movie that played for a short time at a local movie theater. I had absolutely no clue about it, but I was fascinated by the movie poster, a huge pi symbol with the caption: \\"Faith in Chaos\\".That explanation is perfectly suited for this film. Entering the mind of a schizophrenic madman/mathematic genius was exhilarating. I have to admit, this film is not for everyone.The cinematography is very dizzying (to the point of nausea), and the plot is quite abstract. However, if you watch this at least once, and take the time to think about the messages conveyed about religion and the power of finding universal truth, you will be mystified (although slightly sick to your stomach)See it once....it may not be your favorite, but you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"I saw this movie, and I just loved it.

To all those people who gave it one star, if you can't take the heat, step out of the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tortuous but Beautiful","review":"Pi was a cinematic masterpiece that left me stunned. Much like Darren Aronofsky's other masterpiece, Requiem, Pi left me speechless. Personally I found Pi much more entertaining than the harsh Requiem for a Dream.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, excellent","review":"Low budget. Grainy black and white as you may already know from other reviews, so hardly a \\"movie\\" in the common sense of the word. Quaint sound effects. Oddball character in the lead. But boring? Not quite.To begin with, there's a narrative which (almost) makes sense. This makes Pi an altogether more intriguing and absorbing film than David Lynch's forerunner, which was rather up its own alimentary canal anyway.Pi is what a Prodigy video would be like if directed by someone from the Smithsonian Institute. The thumping soundtrack is extremely effective in that it is totally incongruous to the subject matter (a mathematician has a breakdown). It's rather like having The Carpenters doing a soundtrack for Rambo.Neatly edited, thoughtful, and brave (you try making the pitch sound exciting). Stick with it for 10 minutes and you'll sit through the whole of it.And even if you don't like it, it's only 85 minutes long.

It dragged in the story. It didn't make much sense at any point. I barely found the characters interesting.

Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well. There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such.Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B&W; with annoying MTV-style jump cuts.

Nevertheless, I found the mathematics to be accurate and compelling. The film beautifully intertwines the revitilization of spirituality and science.

I have more than 4000 movies in my collection. By far, this was one of the most terrible, unwatchable movies I have ever seen and typically, I am very forgiving about quality and content on most films and rarely ever rate a movie so poorly.As a 30 year career engineer, I had no trouble with the concept; it is the awful production, direction and script of this movie... as if it was filmed, written and performed by a teenager in their garage. This movie is not worth using as a beverage coaster. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you joking?","review":"This indeed is a low budget film and one of the worst sci-fi movies I've seen. It's totally in black and white, which is not disclosed in description of the film as far as I can see. The acting is very lame, with little dialog. I found myself clinking the fast forward button to skip large portions of the film consisting of no dialog and just animated screams from the main character. He continually takes drugs of some sort for no clear reason other than headaches. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to make out the short dialog when it does occur.How anyone can rate this as anything other than 1 or zero stars is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the geek movie that I expected.","review":"This movie was not as good as I had expected. I had figured that there would be more interesting math involved. This seemed like more of a weird religous film than a interesting movie based on math.The plot was not that interesting. It is entirely in black and white, and the cameraman appears to be an amatuer, or at least going for that bumpy Blair Witch style. I would bet that this was produced by film students that have not yet figured out how to make good movies.Don't waste your money on this movie, there are so many other good movies at Amazon.com that you could buy instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"The name \\"Pi\\" really sold, so I bought the movie. I consider myself having a little-bit-above-average math knowledge, so perhaps that is the reason I bought it.BUT, I should say I found it a very stupid movie, and I am very surprised for all the positive comments I have found here.Anyway, if you want to see this movie because of math, don't do it, but if you like extremely bizarre movies, then this is a movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the pseudo-intelectual losers","review":"Another movie that tries to appeal to the growing mainstream of pseudo-intelectuals who are just a bunch of losers. The photography is grainy and in many scenes the camera moves around too much. The story itself is very decadent. The movie ridicularizes the attempt of humankind to understand the world. It is suggested that only the simpleminded can find happiness. So, if you think you are smarter than other people, and think that that superiority is the cause for your problems and your sad life you will probably like this movie. If you are not one of those people don't waste your time and money watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fun doing Math Equations","review":"Ok this movie was pure garbage.

I think that I would not need to say much more.However, I must confess something about me: I hate cyberpunk and I hate hip-hop even more! I don't think that the ideas are so original in this film and I believe it is somewhat overrated. By for me, that is beside the point. I find this film very aestehtically dipleasing and I could barely force myself to watch it.I do understand that certain people may have a completely different opinion thatn mine, but that is a matter of personal taste. As another viewer said, \\"you'll either love or hate\\" this film. Apparently, this film was reviewed by people who loved it (who knows, other angry reviews might have been removed and people didn't bother again! ;-).So, that is my warning to anyone pondering to buy this film, especially after having read the raving reviews here... :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Parties","review":"I saw this movie with about 6 friends who came over for a DVD party.

I actually felt sorry for the story. It deserved better, but it was abused and molested by an amateur filmmaker pretending he had SKILLS by making it grainy and black & white and cheap and...well, super shaky. All of the \\"look at me, I'm trying to be a genius here\\" silliness made me shake my head in embarrassment for the director of this mess. Not that I can entirely blame him for trying. There truly is a sucker born every minute, and many of those suckers actually fell into this guy's sticky pretentious web. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hit the right marks.","review":"This is a short story dragged out for 81 mins. Thats right 81 mins and this movie was too long. The black and white picture didn't work at all for me. I dont understand why in this particular movie that they would use black and white instead of just regular color. The black and white picture made it hard to see what was going on in the very few action moments of the film. The movie for the most part was boring. The acting for the most part was pretty good which is probably the biggest upside of them film. This is not a movie you should buy but one you should rent if you must watch it at all.Pros: acting and premise, which in the long run didn't pay off.Everything else hits the con margin making this a two star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shallow Depths","review":"The first half of this film is suggestive and intriguing. The second half becomes concrete and, while not exactly dull, let's say that the tremendous possibilities of the opening collapse to a single and rather prosaic storyline. By doing some, albeit limited, research into mathematics, Aronofsky succeeds in evoking the mystery in maths' connection with the ordinary world - however, a little more research or imaginative effort might have powered the film to still greater heights. This adds up to a shallow take on a profound subject, and it trades on the subject's genuine profundity in order to gives itself airs. Still many of the techniques rehearsed here see fruition in 'Requiem for a Dream', the latter being a much more satisfying piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"You need to see this. Period.Pi is a gritty film with perfect pacing and an inventive story line. Enough folks here have discussed their interpretation and relevance of the film. See for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Faith Is Restored","review":"The many reviews here give ample evidence for the excellence of this film. While the film is very enjoyable in and of itself, the Director's Commentary track on the DVD must not be missed for aspiring film makers and artists. Aronofsky gives insight not only to his inspirations but to production problems and solutions that were encountered within his meagre $60,000 budget.That a great film can be executed by such a talented director and cast within such restraints renews my faith in the movie arts. Excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly ambitious, but interesting","review":"Pi reminded me of Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, minus Eco's seven years of research and spellbinding detective-story style. Overall, the film's pretty good if you're interested in numerological mysticism, but is at times self-important and overreaching. Gives you interesting stuff to think about, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Incredible!","review":"I saw Pi in the Angelica Theatres in New York while I was on vacation. From the first scene it blew my mind away. It's Intensely made. In brief words, a masterpiece. I just can't love it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Work of Photography, Acting, and Story","review":"Pi is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. It challenges the viewer, and although the movie does revolve around math, it does not require the viewer to understand mathematics at all. This movie makes brilliant use of black and white film which, although it sounds simple, is difficult to do in a film setting. Every actor creates a convincing and deep character who (for once) seems to be a (unusual) person taken out of the real world. This movie is not for everyone mainly because of disturbing images. Although disturbing, they do contribute to the overall genius of the film. I would whole-heartedly recommend this movie to anybody who has ever looked for truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and disturbing","review":"Pi offers what few films do today, the opportunity to think long after the closing credits. For me, it rekindled my interest in higher mathematics and the Einsteinian theory that God was the first engineer (and you can bet your bottom dollar He doesn't play dice against the universe). Be prepared to be moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, Self-Congratulatory, Sophomoric","review":"God-awful. A silly pretentious bore. Apparently made by and for alienated computer geeks with severe persecution complexes. Exactly the kind of movie that stoned college kids will consider 'really deep.'To be fair, there is a wonderful idea lurking somewhere. Unfortunately, the sophomoric pomposity of the film keeps it from developing into anything other than a vague idea of what this project might have been had mature, intelligent adults had anything to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the ultimate bad movie","review":"in all my experience as a long-time movie watcher, it never ceases to amaze me how bad some movies can be. however, in the vast empire of bad movies, pi is unquestionably the emperor. the directors of the movie seem to go out of their way to make the experience unbearable. the movie contains every undesirable element possible - everything from pseudo intellectualism to wacky imagery to meaningless symbolism to an indescernable plot. i would recommend this film to any cinema major who would like an excellent example of what not to do. save your 17 bucks - get a psychic reading or something. at least then, you'd have a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it","review":"This movie was explained to me before I watched it.

It has the optimal mix of drugs, weirdo-psychotic behavior, and pop mathematics to take the hippy psuedointellectuals on a fanatastic voyage into a world where they matter. The truth is, this movie is more focused on the drugs and the weirdo-psychotic behavior than the math, and so the name \\"Pi\\" is misleading. This is not a movie about mathematics nor a mathematician. If is was trying to be, it did a really bad job. Number theory unlocking the secret to the stock market? The number 216? This is not serious mathematics. Hence the movies' plot is meaningless to people who really know what applied mathematics is about--all that is left is the drugs and the weirdo-psychotic nonesense. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"best movie ever no......NO","review":"I found this movie how shall I say it Lame! I am a very, very open minded guy but I didnt get into it.

I'm outraged and insulted by the nonsense that numerology would be considered mathematics! Pi is a number like any other number. There are an infinite number of numbers with the same properties as pi. So what would make pi any different?

What is this ABOUT?","review":"I am always trying to support independant filmakers, but... This film is confusing. Unnecessarliy confusing. It is not nearly as clever as I feel it is intended to be. This film is perfect for phony intellectuals who like to stand out by claiming to love films that are too obscure and confusing for \\"average\\" filmgoers to comprehend. I must admit, however, that Aronofsky DID do an excellent job with direction. Yet,I feel that he just tried too hard with this film. The viewer leaves \\"Pi\\" with a sense that something is truly missing. The film also tends to bring out emotions of anxiety and rage in the viewer.

It's easy to over-analyse it (as some have done here), but it essentially boils down to a glorified 'Twilight Zone' episode - one of the good ones. There's a groovy soundtrack featuring some Warp-esque techno acts, lots of quotable lines, and although the central story is basically Arthur C. Clarke's 'The Nine Billion Names of God', it's sufficiently intriguing to keep you watching for an hour and a half. It's not really high art, as such, but it's extremely well-made and very watchable.

The dialog spoken by the coach (Sorvino) is as vitriolic as the Edward Norton character in American History X, (and would most certainly be embraced by neo-Nazi groups).

Her other books are just incredible.What a disappointment this was. I couldn't even finish it and I hate doing that. But I couldn't waste any more time on squeaky clean, unrealistically perfect, dumb Julie and I don't feel any nicer towards Zach. I am just sad, this is the first time McNaught has every disappointed me and I have read almost all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect is the book, the characters and the feeling you get","review":"I still think about Julie and Zach almost as if they were real people that I met somewhere.Julie and Zach are, on the surface, as different as night and day. She is an orphan adopted and raised by a loving family and Zach is a Hollywood star wrongly convicted of killing his wife. The fact that these two meet at all is based on the coincidence of his escaping from jail and her taking a road trip.What follows is one of the best, most touching and sweet love stories I've ever read. Zach kidnaps her and forces her to drive him to a remote cabin (belonging to the characters from the book Paradise). There, Julie begins to believe in Zach's innocence. And Zach begins to see an innocence in Julie that he thought didn't exist.As usual, McNaught's characters are real, flawed, loveable and easy to relate to. Most of all, you genuinely feel for them. One of the best contemporary romance novels I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"WENT FROM OKAY TO WASTE-OF-TIME","review":"The more I read this book, the more I REALLY did not like it. The \\"heroine\\" was beyond annoying, being two parts shrew to two parts idiot. The \\"hero\\" fluctuated between brutally heartless to embarrassingly sappy. The story was far too wordy with WAY too much repetition. The constant name-dropping of celebrities in this story got very, very old and although I'm not an overly religious person, the heroine's inappropriate use of God for her own convenience and purpose just didn't sit well with me. I don't believe thinking it was God's will that she comfort and have sex with the hero was exactly what was being taught by the Good Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"basic","review":"Overwritten; period. McNaught seems to be trying to impress us with yawning details on almost everything; especially Hollywood and it's lists of actors. Enough! This book could've been written much better; covered the same plot, and done in 1/2 the ink/paper. I found myself skimming constantly, just to keep from dying of boredom before we moved on in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"all-time favorite book!!!!!","review":"A wonderfully written novel with lots of heart. A book that can be read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own three copies of this book for a reason!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I truely love this book. I currently own three copies of it. Each copy is a little more battered. If I can't find a copy I borrow one from the library or buy a new one. This is a must read. I have been reading Romance novels since I was ten and none have ever touched me the way this one did. Maybe it was because it was more realistic. The guy didn't come sweeping in and save the girl from the bad guys. He was the bad guy and she saved him from the worse guys not too mention she saved him from an existence in which he connected with no one. I think that every little girl dreams of being someone like Julie. We all want to save the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Perfect!","review":"I've read this book about gazillion times and still not sick of it. This book has made me cry and laugh.

It's perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one great book","review":"I couldn't stop thinking about this book after I finished it. What a beautiful love story. Zach is one cool and very sexy dude. I loved the parts of the story that took place in Colorado, because I live in Colorado. This is a lovely story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Each Other","review":"This book grabbed me when I came to the part where Zach was thrown out of his rich grandmother's house with only the cloths on his back. Only a strong person could reach the heights that he did only to be dropped to the bottom again and survive. Julie was made just for Zach. Without her, he would have been lost. Judith McNaught is the perfect matchmaker when she puts two characters together in her stories. Her characters fit like a hand in a glove. I guess that why everything she writes seems so real and her characters are so alive. You couldn't change \\"Elizabeth\\" in Almost Heaven with \\"Meredith\\" in Paradise. The couples she puts together are inseparable, the way true love should really be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best...","review":"I am so enamored with Judith McNaught's works. I started with Whitney, My Love, then Until You. Moved on to Paradise and then Perfect. I didn't think the latter would come close to Paradise but I was so wrong. This one was by far my favorite (and I truly loved them all). Ah... the part in the gym...\\"She made me cry, too.\\" Give. Me. More. LOVE THIS BOOK! I just hated for it to end.

What impressed me most was the author's ability to write a great story while incorporating an important social problem,Woman's Literacy. Do yourself a favor and read the book. Then after you've enjoyed a wonderful love story read the author's notes at the end. I think you'll be glad you did. And thrill to the fact that you can..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely premise becomes a wonderful read.","review":"Ms. McNaught takes the well worn premise of an unexperienced women being placed in danger by a rugged, down-on-his luck man, and creates a story full of depth and character. As much as I enjoy the romance genre, it is rare for a romance author to create a love story that is as believable as Julie and Zach's story. She creates two characters that actually seem to belong together. Julie is someone I'd would want as one of my best friends, and Zach...well, I'd give him a ride anywhere! Their romance is beautiful, exciting and fun. I'm looking forward to reading more of Ms. McNaught's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I really loved this book and although i've read it twice I still haven't figured out the title but it is the best book of hers I have ever read.I especially liked the end. I think he was a conflicting character he was supposed to be really nice but pulling a gun on her was not the nicest thing a person can do. I loved the fact there was all these stars it really made an interesting plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"For fans of romantic stories, this is a must read! The characters are realistic, distinct people who ring true. You grow to love Julie & Zack, and feel for them through all their obstacles and triumphs. The descriptions and dialogue are not the typical cliches, but simple and sweet. The entire story feels real and is fast-paced, engrossing. Definately one of McNaught's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKED IT!","review":"Perfect is alright but i think \\"Paradise\\" is better...I loved the part in the cabin we Zack took Julie too it was so romantic..and i thought it was so cute when he got jealous when she pick out movies that starred anybody but him...But all in all this book should be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Perfect as Almost Heaven","review":"I first read McNaught's work in Almost Heaven, a book that made me laugh out loud several times. This book fell far short in my eyes. I agree with other reviewers who felt Zack was too controlling and needed therapy. At the end of the novel I wanted her to refuse to take him back, because he had been such a Class A Jerk to her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prefect-ly thrilling reading","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The storyline moved quickly and the reader was kept on their toes from cover-to-cover.

However, all that celebrity namedropping got old real quick. I know Zack was a big movie star, but was it really necessary to invite them all to their wedding and make them out to be nice, jolly individuals? To me it just seemed too fake. I mean, I can appreciate Barbra Streisand as much as the next person, but all the references to her and other famous people got annoying. Otherwise, I thought the book was good and consider it an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare for a lonnng night","review":"This is the kind of book that you should read when you dont have to go to work the next day.

I finished reading Perfect in one night and i loved it!!!!She is such an amazing author who knows how to make the characters look real, that for a moment you start thinking that there is actually a real actor/director called Zachary Benedict! I personally loved Zack and thought he had a great personality, and great strength to endure everything he's been through! It was also REALLY REALLY ROMANTIC and sweet the way he treated Julie. It is such an amazing story, and it is the PERFECT sequel for Paradise, which i also loved! I recommend this story to all of those who are fans of Judith McNaught and havent read it yet, and to those who have never read for her should start reading for her immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a pretty good read and one of my favorite of Judith's novel. I do agree with the other reviewer in terms of Sandini. How come he just went missing from the pages. It seems like when the character was first introduced, it was very strong and has high impact but then just went to zero.Also it bothers me a lot that most of Judith McNaught's female leads have no sexual experience or if they do, they are portrayed as these uptight, rigid, low-self-worth women in bed. Understanding if it is a 18th century setting but the 19th or 20th century ones? C'mon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is what is PERFECT!","review":"From beginning to the end this book caught my interest completely. others of Mcnuaght works i have found a little boring in the beginning but this one has hooked me since the beginning to the end. this is what a romance should be... passion, tenderness and tearjerking emotion. the fact that Julie was human enough to doubt Zack's innocence when everything around her wanted her to believe that makes this romance really....REAL! afterall how long has she known him. He could really be a good man but a emotionally disturbed one. how the hell could she be sure?A real winner from Mcnaught! you have become my favourite writer after this one! this would always remain in my collection of good romance books. Thanks for such a entertaning read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I don't want to spend $20 on a brand new book when it might be total garbage. So when I finally purchased this book years later it seemed extremely dated. I don't want to hear about actors from the past who are no longer popular and I don't want to hear about bad fashion that I'd rather forget about. I cringed a lot throughout this book. This is the exact reason that I read historical fiction.Even if I could get past all of the cheesiness of this book it still would not be my cup of tea. The hero was the biggest jerk I've seen in a romance in a long, long time. Women do make seriously bad choices sometimes but I'd rather not read about it in my romances. Not recommended for any reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adored it, but skipped over a lot","review":"Zack is one hell of a character. I think I fell in love with him! Julie is sweet and I can believe she could fall in love that easily. I don't think the FBI agent could have with her, but that's just me. The chemistry between Zack and Julie is perfect. For the first half of the book, I could not put it down (the week in the cabin), but the second half I pretty much skimmed over, unless I saw Julie or Zach's name. To be honest, I flipped through the pages, not reading anything that didn't have their names, then to the point where only their names were together. I really like Judith's books, but there is just a bunch of extra stuff going on that is a waste of paper. Other then that, truly, this is on the top of my favorite romances ever! And I have read hundreds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently Perfect","review":"Do yourself a favor and pick up this book... Absolute page turner...

I'm one of those people but I bought a copy cause he said he'd sign it and I thought it might be worth something someday besides I never met anyone who wrote a book before. I kept it around the house a few days and one rainy day when I couldn't go to work and didn't have enough money to go to the bar I picked it up and had a blast. Billy told me I would laugh and cry and he was right. If books had been like this in school I might not have quit. I think Billy has written a book everyone will like. Oh yea, I know the guy that did the cover art too, Mickey Sizemore.I showed it to my wife and she loved it.

No one, and I mean no one, could sing a lyric like Ella.Nelson Riddle arranged and conducted the studio orchestra for this album, and the orchestra features some of the great musicians of the time, including Paul Smith (Ella's long-time pianist), Frank Flynn and Dick Nash.And oh! The songs! How about such classics as \\"A Fine Romance\\" or \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\"?

If you get a chance to hear that, you will be amazed at how Armin can take some really hard-hitting tracks and still manage to keep the energy building.This CD is still very, very good; and the reviewer who only gave this the one star is way out of order.

CD1 is a bit more upbeat than CD2 and features great tracks like \\"Under The Sun\\", which sports great spanish type strings employed by Solarstone. \\"Search for Freedom\\" works well on the dance floor. CD2 is more chilled and has some great rolling beats for your listening pleasure. All in all a great CD set to have in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Worth it.","review":"This was kind of my first introduction to AVB, heard him on DI a while back and bough his cd. Good Trance is hard to find these days especially if you dont like fast, drummy beats. I prefer the mellow mood this whols CD sets. You can just throw it on and listen to the whole thing without skipping tracks.Tracks blend well. If you like Tiesto you will probably enjoy his stuff, not too mainstream and not too much vocals. \\"Sahara\\" and \\"Burned with desire\\" are very hot so I will probably buy his new cd too. I rate this and Tiesto's Just Be one of the best for the year.As of now I havent really gone too much into cd #2. I agree with most listeners that this cd should be short and sweet no need for 2 cd's.

Love to listen to these CDs when I go jogging or driving in my car, especially long distance. I realize most people expect trance to do more for them but I'm perfectly happy whenever I put these 2 CDs in my CD player. They calm me and keep me going.

That is, starting out with progressive tunes then moving into more driving trance. Both CDs are constructed this way and the tunes are relatively new still. I recommend this to those who want to become acquainted with the genre as it gives you a wide array of styles that are popular today: progressive being Mark Otten - Mushroom Therapy (massive progressive tune of 2003), Valentino - Flying (Sultan & The Greek Remix), and Peter Martin presents Anthanasia - Perfect Wave to name a few. Then melodic trance, Envio - Time To Say Goodbye (Passiva Mix) (an excellent tune from the 18 year old Norwegian producer), Robert Nickson - Spiral (banging tune from 2003). And uplifting tunes from the king of all record labels, Anjunabeats: Oceanlab - Satellite (Original Above & Beyond Remix), Super 8 - Alba, Mono - Rise.

We already own a Fischer stereo system but it resides in the home office because it is difficult to find the right place for the speakers, which are about three feet tall. Well, being tucked away in the home office, the stereo doesn't get used much.She asked me to buy her the Bose Wave radio. I knew Bose's reputation to be solid so I shelled out the $500 for the radio. It is pricey but you get what you pay for. Rich sound that gives you every detail and nuance in a song. The radio is powerful, too, and can really fill up a room. It is very portable so we can set it up easily in any room of the house or in the screen porch on a pleasant evening.It is also much nicer to wake up in the morning to Luther Vandross or piano music than the man-made sounds of chirping birds or the ocean waves that don't quite sound like ocean waves that our old alarm clock produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about useful features","review":"The Bose Wave II I just bought sounds just as good as the Wave I already had, but is more annoying to use. The lack of buttons might be a great cost saver for Bose, but it's a pain in the ass for anybody who owns one, and is maybe the stupidest design idea in any product I've seen lately. My old unit has both buttons and a remote. OK, so it still costs $500, which I guess is a benefit, but it really doesn't do anything that my old unit didn't.If Bose really wants to add consumer value, instead of offering a kit that allows me to use my $500 radio as a remote wireless speaker for my computer or television, how about adding a wireless connection for remote speakers so I can hear it anywhere in the house.Grrrrrrr."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love this system, the sound is amazing.

When ever I listen to a song, the quality of this music system makes me feel the mood of the song. If you listen to a love song, it makes you realize how loved you are.

The sound quality was excellent, so much so that when I moved I got rid of my decades-old cd player, receiver, and speakers. Being partially deaf, I especially appreciated the option of playing the TV through the machine. Shortly after the move, that feature stopped working, so I bought a new system with a 4-cd changer and put the older one in my bedroom. Soon, that cd player began acting erratically (skipping, stopping too soon), and not long after this, the cd changer in the one in the living room stopped ejecitng. Then the same thing happened to the cd slot in the machine proper. All of this, of course, conveniently happened AFTER the warranties had expired on both machbines.

Now about 1 year later the New unit is just a digital clock. It will not work with any of the now three remotes and without an on/off switch this second unit is use less.I'm not sure if I'll send it in for repair( is this going to be a yearly repair) or cut my losses and buy something else.I suggest before buying these Bose Wave units you look very hard for something else, besides the sound is really NOT that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb item for my bedroom","review":"I am extremely happy with my Bose, ideal for my bedroom.

It is all plastic which looks crappy after a while. My BOSE was white in colour and turned a pleasing tone of old ivory. If you want a great sounding small system try the TIVOLI Mk 2 with the CD player. Nicely built with wood and a warm pleasant sound. You cannot get great sound with a mini set of speakers. Thats fact.

The sound does not live up to the hype. There is no way to adjust bass and treble--you get what you get, period. I like to choose specific songs on CDs to play and after doing this several times, the unit just decides it won't play that song anymore. This has happened on at least 5 CDs. Luckily, the CDs weren't damaged but for some reason the unit just skips these songs now or plays them with distortions. Bose said to send it back and for $99 they'd take a look at it---didn't say anything about actually fixing it, though.

I didn't expect much and was hoping to see an OK or mediocre film. I came away shocked at the quality of the writing, the direction and the atmosphere of the film. This is one of the best movies I've seen in 2001. It is classic noir with nail munching suspense and great acting. It was an extra bonus to see all the Milwaukee scenery and pick out things that I recognized, but that all took a backseat to the engrossing storyline. I really hope this film is released on DVD and/or video, because it deserves recognition on a national level. It's still at a handful of Milwaukee theaters, but who knows for how long. If you've thought about seeing it, don't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't really complain...","review":"I bought this sight for my AK-47, mounted on a UTG side-rail optics mount.

That being said, I happen to like this product a lot since it does seem to do me a lot of good. I even tried generic spirulina from the store, and although it does good, it just doesn't seem to have the \\"kick\\" that this product has.So basically some (and I do mean SOME) of their products are very good (I even checked the ingredients, and if they really put what they put in there, then they really do respect their customers).

This product is perfect for cleaning and polishing brass, stainless steel, copper and more. I usually apply a small amount, let it sit for a minute then clean with a soft toothbrush (if the surface is embossed), then reapply and polish.

There is a strong homoerotic theme if you're into that sort of thing, as the relationship between Balki and Larry is similar to the male friendships in the early movies of Greg Araki and Todd Haynes, but nothing much happens in this movie except for Balki's lessons to Larry. Halfway through the movie the two cousins try hitting on a couple of stewardesses that live across the hall from them, but in the end Balki and Larry only want each other. What a tacky movie!

There are at least 30 minutes of Sinbad's performance that are edited out. I knew something was wrong when the screen would fade to black for a second and then cut back to the show. I don't know why they do this, but it really ruins the DVD. I will never put this DVD in my player again because they cut out some of my favorite parts.

Why Brain Damaged hasn't made it to DVD, I don't know. It's the best. Afros and Bellbottoms is a close second. I bought that DVD and it's heavily edited, too. By that, I mean that a lot of the original content is missing. Why do they do this? Maybe it's so they can sell the full version later on. I hope so. I'd bite at that marketing ploy.

It's basically about a kind of Star Trek holodeck simulation in a natural environment. The other technical theme is a massive 'Big Brother Is Watching You' computer system, which they named ScanNet (does SkyNet ring a bell?).Niven and Barnes can do, and have done, much better.

Next I apply a lipstain, and finally apply the top coat, which does tend to wear away fairly quickly, but also makes your lips feel moist as well as plump.Perhaps those who said it did nothing for them already had some volume to their lips, but mine have thinned greatly over the past decade.

She analyzes the effects that those perceptions have had in shaping the underlying reality. This is rather an advanced work and will sometimes prove difficult reading for the nonspecialist. The author points to a certain hypocrisy in how Western Europe-just five decades after its own ethnic cleansing-views ethnic homogenization processes in the Balkans. At the same time, Todorova would not allow Balkan political leaders and intellectuals to shift blame and responsibility for their own actions to history, to foreign intervention or to five centuries of Ottoman occupation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense in literary analysis of past Balkan writers.","review":"Todorova's book changed the way I viewed the Balkans. By analysing the way in which Balkan and Western Europeans wrote about the Balkans, \\"Imagining the Balkans\\" shows how this peninsula became the recipient of totally negative and pejoritve notions about Europe. Todorova deals well with some writers sentimentality, and over romanticization which unfortunetly persists today and leads not to understanding but to confusion of the issues. Old metaphores such as \\"the Balkan Pouder Keg\\" are shown to be only a way of dismissing a whole group of people as \\"irrational peasants.\\" Although quit heavy in theory, a worth while read for any serious history student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Tell The Story","review":"I thought this book read like it was translated form a foreign language several times before it got to english.

I did not finish it. I did not even get through the first chapter I left it on an airplane. There is no way you can Imagine the Balkins with this book it is an absolute chore to read. I would like to tell the author to put up your thesaurus (we know you can use big words) use foot notes do not start every sentence with with some credit to someone.

The author treats Confederate soldiers as whites who fought and died to perserve slavery, but he does not treat Union soldiers as whites who fought and died to end slavery. The author ignores the long line of whites who took great risks to advance the cause of racial equality: the northerners who went south to register black voters, many of whom were murdered, Lyndon Johnson's effort and success in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, passed by a predominately white Congress, Bobby Kennedy, Harry Truman and others...."},{"rating":"1","title":"RACISM at its' best","review":"This book is totally ridiculous.

Whites were not the only ones that owned slaves. The blacks would buy slaves as soon as they could, its is estimated that there were more than 5000 black slave owners.Blacks owe this country. They constitute 20% of the population, yet contribute to the majority of the crime and welfare. This has been true for over 100 years. Other groups have assimilated and thrived despite bigotry and discrimination. Yet blacks refuse to seek education or to advance.We have paid any debt and certainly do not owe anything to the current individuals that have never even met a slave and most have never experienced discrimination, unless they were the ones doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Antidote to our Shared Denial","review":"I have benefitted materially and personally from slavery. My alma mater, Brown University, is built on an original endowment from the Brown family of Rhode Island-- money earned in the transatlantic slave trade. So Robinson's argument is no big stretch for me.That Robinson's small, personal book should garner the sort of bile and violence visible here in other reviews is telling. Many white people feel personally attacked by even the idea of slavery reparations. Why is this? It's in the interest of all Americans to openly admit to the crime of slavery and move on as one country.Robinson's book sometimes wanders, and is sometimes too personally focused. But his basic point-- that America needs to own up to its shameful, long-term dependency on slave labor-- is powerful and should be obvious. The fact that it isn't obvious to mainstream America (there isn't even a national slavery museum or monument) is a painful symptom of our shared denial."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"With eloquence and power, Randall Robinson lays out the case for reparations to black Americans. Along with Klinkner and Smith's, The Unsteady March: The Rise and Decline of Racial Equality, this book shows how much blacks have given to America, and yet how little they have received in return. After reading this book, I am convinced that the argument should not be whether to give reparations, but how much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book!","review":"This is a fabulous book! Randall Robinson has written some searing truths that white America will have a hard time accepting, but Robinson courageously lays all the cards on the table nonetheless. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for putting so eloquently on paper ideas that most black people know in their \\"viscera\\" to be true. It's time for white America to face the music.I recommend this reading to every African American I know, and I'm ready to join Mr. Randall's crusade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paternalism revisited","review":"This is the sort of book only an american could write. Robinson's politically correct ideas do nothing to help the progress of balck or african people: to pretend that America or the world owe us a sort of social reparation for our history is nothing but an elaborate form of paternalism. In fact, our progress should flow only from our merit and work at present days, not from a debt inherited from the past. I believe we can rise to the job and stop blaming others for our problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm black...","review":"...there are many african-americans out there who are proud to be american, and not 'hyphenated'. we will always have our own special togetherness, but [stuff] like this is no excuse. \\"united we stand, divided we fall.\\" - a motto for all of america. there's not enough wealth in the world to pay off all the debts for things that peoples have done to each other. remember slave comes from 'slav', like in the slavic peoples who coincidentally are not black but were in chains too. slavery was a terrible part of american history, but hundreds of thousands of ... white boys died to free the slaves so if that didn't pay the debt then no amount of money ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on specifics","review":"I've long been interested in the question of restitution/reparations, and consider it a serious failing of our nation that this issue hasn't been considered or debated. So it was with great expectation that I read Robinson's book. I was hoping it would do two things: show that restitution is necessary, and show that it's possible. Unfortunately, it only did the former (and not as effectively as other books I've read). It lacked a serious and thorough analysis of legal and political precedent, the policy choices that would be necessary, and what political forces would need to align to make this happen. As a result, the argument sounded more argumentative than authoritative. If I hadn't already been in support of restitution, this book wouldn't have convinced me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible!","review":"Irresponsible is how to classify this book. Perhaps the author has forgotten that after the Civil War, President Lincoln said the 350,000 lives lost in the War were in payment for our country's past sins of slavery. There certainly isn't enough money in the world to pay reparations for every act of discrimination or prejudice suffered, but complaining and demanding money is not the answer, to do so is a disservice to African Americans. A better approach is to encourage the model for success that has been most effective for immigrants and citizens past and present: education, hard work, self-reliance, and responsibility. There are many good books to read -- this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"what america owes to blacks: nadda","review":"Those who subscribe to Mr. Robinson's views on this country and its supposed debt to blacks should ask themselves some hard questions. A. While Europeans transported slaves across the Atlantic, who went into the interior and captured them? In Roots, Kunta Kente is captured by 3 individuals, of whom at least 2 appear to be of African origin. Slave-dealing was a 2-way operation. B. What countries still practice slavery today? Sudan. C. Who designed the system of government that eventually freed black America from its enslavement? White guys, a large number of whom were slave-owners. D. Why, for every Rodney King, is there an O.J. Simpson? If America is so psychologically damaging to blacks, why was Marcus Garvey's Back to Africa movement such a flop, especially considering it occured in the 20's, a far harsher time for black Americans than today? I can't answer that one.

The instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side. Left alone, the structure would tip over because of the imbalance. Much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections. I don't mean the quality of the Legos; those things are impossible to break. I mean the way in which various bars, hinges, etc were put together.In the end my wife and I probably spent 40 hours building something that would not hold together.

For the age of the film it looks quite presentable however given the likely audience and sales projections they weren't going to make this a reference quality release. Part of the reason I upgraded was just to get rid of the old flipper disc and snapper case. The audio is just a plain jane mono track which serves the dialogue adequately however we are used to a more immersive experience these days. For the bargain prices of this release it is worth an upgrade. If you've never seen this movie you are missing a classic. This launched the careers of Bo Derek and Dudley Moore into the a-list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mono audio: No 5.1, not even stereo","review":"A great movie. As for the DVD, the video quality is excellent. The audio quality is excellent, but it is mono. No 5.1, no surround, not even stereo.

This is unfortunate, given the DVD's otherwise excellent audio quality and music (Mancini, Revel, Julie Andrew's vocals, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare thing indeed","review":"I bought this film after years and was rewarded yet again. There are very few films that are sexy and funny; Austin Powers are two that I can remember. 'Ten' had Dudley Moore and a supporting cast of players that you will find comfortable and amusing, especially the Mexican hotel staff. Bo Derek appears in the role that was perfect for her: an astonishingly gorgeous actress with no discernible reason to speak. Bo Derek aspired to be the ultimate vision of 'wow' and she achieved it here or, much more so, in 'Tarzan'.The film is funny, sexy, and just about perfectly cut by a skilled director: Blake Edwards. He used his wife, Julie Andrews, as the perfect dowdy wife for whom Bo would be the perfect counterpoint. Best of all, the plot follows a logical line and ends in a way that we want it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought back memory","review":"I first watched this movie when I was 13 back in the late 80s on TV.

George is a talky guy, so much so that he manages not only to bed 3 different girls, but to leave those beds as well without doing ANYTHING - but talk, that is. He spends half the movie chasing Bo Derek and her husband on their honeymoon, only to realize once she lets him in her bed that \\"this can't be right\\" and \\"what am I to you?\\". Sheesh, HE sounds like the woman. It just doesn't make any sense - the movie defies its own logic and expects us to buy it. Julie Andrews, almost sexy, still comes off rather sternly prim, in spite the occasional swear word - give me the Sound of Music any day.. to sit through this schlock in the name of comedy.. where's the comedy! What's funny about this? The whole thing is an exercise in sexual frustration - Dudley's and finally, we the audience's.

It reads in the third person, and the central character isn't the name of the author, so confusion sets in right away. Is it a biography? Is it a failed novel? Nautical terms are dropped without explanation, and anecdotes don't make sense because there's no framing concept in which to understand them. Pilots are almost universally portrayed as dysfunctional, raging alcoholics with blustery egos. Everybody drinks and drinks. There's so much alcohol fueling this book you'll wake up with a hangover. The dialogue is wooden and forced. While the story appears to be deeply personal, it is to such a point that the reader learns a lot more about the author than about Panama, its history, the Panama Canal, and first-hand relations between the U.S. and the Panamanians. A lack of maps and photos make references to geographical points almost useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good history but poorly written","review":"I had hoped that this would be a great book written by a Panama Pilot, but the poor writing could have used an editor.

I have recently checked a book out of my university library that is the best book I have seen yet (the author's name escapes me now). It has about 10 demonstration paintings where the author goes through the various steps of creating a pastel painting.

Beth Ann Fennelly is different. There is geniune experience underlying the pages of TENDER HOOKS, and experience-bred passion, and wit, and bravery, and evident love. The best of Fennelly is on par with the best of Wilbur and Larkin and Bishop and Frost, and I'm thinking especially of her baby poems, especially the first two. They leave me breathless on every read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Book","review":"This is one of the smartest, most accomplished books I've read in a long time. Formally interesting and emotionally mature, the poems have stuck with me every since I read them the first time a few weeks back, and reread them this week--wonderfully compelling in their musicality and range."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened","review":"What happened here? Fennelly's debut collection of poetry was one of the best collections I have read. It was really phenomenal, so when I heard that her new collection came out, I got very excited and ran out and bought it. Then I read it. This is really a bad book. The language is flat. It is syrupy. And I know children are a joy, but for crying out loud, find a new topic. It's not that they were pretty much all (with one or two exceptions) motherhood poems, it's that they were bad motherhood poems. No, avoid this book and go grab Open Houses if you don't already have it. This collection is really a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering","review":"I really was wondering what the hub-bub was all about concerning this book. I had heard friends talking about it and found all the very different reviews here to be intriguing.I bought the book.My thoughts?Well, I have to say that the unfavorable reviews, unfortunately, are closest to the mark when you get down to it. I guess I should have known. All the best reviews made her sound a little too good, in the end. And many of the harsher reviews were pretty honest in their tone (with the exception of a few).Honestly, I wanted to like this book, but the stuff just isn't inspiring. In fact, my wife liked it even less than I did (I was worried about all the male-bashing that has been on the reviews, so I got her feedback to see if I was really off base).I wish all of you the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I'll be...","review":"I don't know when I have heard so much heated talk about poetry! Wonderful! I do have to say that I thought Ms. Fennelly's little book of poems was a bit on the trite side, but bless her heart for putting these quaint little poems out there. Every one needs a hobby, after all.That Mr. Ward needs to write a little more clearly if he wants people to take his views to heart and that sarcastic man from Atlanta might better stick to talking about the poems instead of attacking other people. But that's just the opinion of one woman.Keep up the good talk; we all need to bring poetry to light and life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Well, listen to those people who rave about this book if you want to, but I read the poems with a poetry reading group and most of us just didn't like her stuff. I can see how some people might connect with it, but it's pretty boring if you ask me. I'd like to unload my copy---pretty cheap, in fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just went to a reading of her poetry","review":"First, Fennelly is NOT a Southerner. Second, and maybe more importantly, her work is typical of the MFA poetry mill verse which plagues the current literary landscape. Her themes are risky, yes, if she was writing about them forty years ago when introducing the idea of women's bodies and being frank about sexuality and reproduction -- in the way she does it -- had not become hackneyed. Certainly there is much serious work to be done in exploring these issues, yet Fennelly simply cannot rise beyond cliche. In fact, much of her work might easily be considered reactionary to the important causes of women. This collection is shockingly absent of thoughtful responses to serious contemporary concerns, and I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I've spent a life of hard work and living so I can retire and enjoy the fine things in life. But so much of what I thought was out there to reward me with the arts is so far from the real world I know that I am let down time and again. This book came with a lot of mixed reviews so I thought something controversial might be between the covers. Sadly I found more of the same---poetry from someone who has spent too much time in the world of the academy to know the real trials of the heart.

It also lays the foundation for a belief about how learning occurs.Some of the basic theories of the subject of memory might be broken down as follows:1) memory stores, short-long term memory.2) working memory3) memory processes4) and theories of forgetting.These basic theories can be explored in more depth after reading Kandel's work.

We use it for two courses (Discrete Mathematics and Mathematical Structures), however, the professors are abandoning it in favour of another text. The book is absolutely atrocious. Not only is the text as viscous as frozen molasses, but the examples usually have nothing to do with the explanations, and having answers in the back is worthless if you don't know how they were derived. Avoid this book like the plague, and if it's required reading, complain to your professor and the chairperson of the department and tell them to adopt a REAL book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The examples and detail in this book are not great when compared to other discrete/finite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"straightforward","review":"I found this book to be boring but useful.

Every person I've ever met who used this book has absolutely hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE","review":"This is the worst textbook I've ever used in any class - high school or university. You basically need to already know Discrete Math in order to understand the material in the book. The examples aren't relevant to the exercises in the least way possible. Definitions are hard to find within the text, so if you're looking for a definition of a new term in the section, it's quicker to search online than rummage through useless pages of garbage (searching online would give better examples than the book, as well). At least in a typical text book, definitions are bolded and easy to find - in this book, they don't do this, let alone anything else, to help the reader easily find key words.The only reason I even open the book is to do the assigned exercises. Don't try to read the material from the book - you'll only confuse yourself. I rely on class notes and the internet to get the work done. Otherwise, this book is completely USELESS. I advise you to avoid it at all costs, if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Bad... Really Bad!","review":"I used this book last semester in my Discrete Mathematics class in Minnesota. This is by far the worst mathematics textbook I have ever seen. I was in the hospital for appendicitis and missed an entire week's worth of class. Usually this isn't a big deal, I would just read the text on my own. I think it is very telling that I could NOT understand what I was reading when I tried to catch up with what I missed in this class.

Examples are somewhat irrelevant to the text material, text is misleading and worded awkwardly, hints and answers to the problems are few and far between, and the ones provided give little more than a one-number answer. The introduction to this book states that at the time, this was one of the only books available; it definitely shows, because the author did a horrendous job of providing adequate guidance and instruction. For instance, the author will include an amazingly difficult problem, but will neither go through an example problem in the text or provide an answer, leaving the student to scratch his/her head. This is NOT the way to write a textbook.

This book is anything but elegant. It currently resides in my dorm for the sole purpose of a clip-board so that I may lie on the carpet and work out problems from other texts. I had the unfortunate pleasure of suffering through two semesters of this book. The first semester (the first half of the book) was not bad given that we never referenced the text. The second semester was much worse given that most of the information in the course came directly from the text and its examples.

That book was actually tollerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"This book is horrible. He doesnt define the words that a bolded either.

It is impossible to understand this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Distastefull\\" Mathematics","review":"This is one of the worse math book I ever bought. As a computer science major, I usually keep all my major related text books but this one has got to go in the shredder. The author fails to fully explain the examples which forces me to reference other math books for guidance. There are solutions to selected exercises in the back but those are all easy problems. However, the challenging questions does not even have a guided example in its respective chapter. The author's explaination are often too difficult and too shallow to follow and you would have to read it two or three times just to get an idea.

Johnsonbaugh presents ideas simply enough, then jumps into ridiculously difficult proofs with little or no explanation for some of his logical leaps. The end result is a baffling and often frustrating text that, in its effort to teach fairly difficult subject matter, completely and utterly fails. It confounds and confuses more often than it explains and educates. About the only thing I've learned from this book is the proof that it presupposes......Johnsonbaugh's book = junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this book for your class then get one you can use.","review":"Was a required book for a graduate level CS course.

It was very clear and concise, such that it wasn't intimidating to just flip through. Plus, there are plenty of practice problems. Each topic has its own fully detailed section followed by problems and useful paragraphs geared toward preventing common mistakes and misconceptions. Concepts were often explained in layman's terms in addition to formal definitions, and real-world connections were sometimes included (I remember one particular section about Google and a few about computer science that related to the section).The only complaint I can think to include is that some may dislike the lack of pictures and visual aids, but this was something that I personally liked. The amount of white space in the text made it very non-intimidating, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"This book is used by the University I attend to teach students beginning Discrete Mathematics.

All examples start extremely simplistically, almost disregarding the application of the concept altogether and immediately turns to extreme scenarios. The Crawl-Walk-Run method is definitely not implemented. The self tests in most chapters do not adhere well to the instruction taken from within the corresponding chapters.

It's books like this that cause Americans to drop out of school and end up ignorantly voting for and electing the wrong people, such as Jimmy Carter, into high offices. If it is possible to protest this book do so. Furthermore, if it possible to burn this book do so.

Consequently, I chose to go ahead and watch the movie and it was very dramatic but a good plot. It really does depict (even for a 1930's movie) that war is serious business and can change the spirit of even the most emotionally strong person. It is set from the perspective of young German soldiers post World War 1 but before World War 2 (some as young as 16). The actors did such a good job in this movie that they are very convincing as soldiers on the German side. Admittedly this movie is more to watch if you are open to understanding the dynamics of World War 1. Although this movie left me wanting to watch something more cheerful by tomorrow, I can honestly say that this movie is very good and has a strong plot with very convincing actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every bit as good as you've heard.","review":"This Oscar winning movie has aged beautifully. I originally bought it only to fill out my collection of Best Picture winning movies. I was not paying it the respect it deserves.Ayres is magnificent as the young infantry soldier off to fight gloriously for his country in WWI.

The ending is probably one of the greatest in film history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WWI Classic","review":"This is the classic WWI anti-war film from the German perspective. It is a very powerful film, yet somewhat preachy in its' anti-war message- which style fell right into line with the standards of the day, melodrama and all. Even though it is a period piece, it is still captivating, and draws the viewer into it's story and message, even 70 years on- which is a triumph by any definition. If you see only one movie about WWI, you should probably see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"War...What is it good for?","review":"I am going through a phase where I want to see every movie that the so-called Academy granted \\"Best Picture\\". This film won in 1929 and I think was the third such feauture to receive this honor. The quality of the DVD is good when you think of how old the film is. The poor quality that arrives at times adds to the history of the film and film making in general. I wouldn't watch it without it.This is a war film that makes no claims to be anything else. It brings to life the realistc brutality, comradeship and emotional strains involved with living on the battlefield. The film makers did a tremendous job on recreating war in France while filming just outside Hollywood. The explosives are real. Turn up the volume.

That was our first mistake, these were to be gifts and now we have no gifts because the wrong movie was sent and Amazon is still showing the wrong version on this ad.

It follows his trip through basic training up to the front lines of battle. I liked this movie a lot because it shows a graphic description of the war from the German point-of-view. One of the best scences of the film is when Paul is in a hole with a Frenchmen, and he takes care of him after he mortally wounds the soldier. Paul tries to understand why the war is being fought and why he has killed this man who has a family and friends just like him. This concept is hard for Paul to grasp. Paul survived the whole war until the end. The armistice hasn't come into effect yet and Paul is hit by a sniper while trying to reach for a butterfly. This last scene was very unexpected, and that is why it made this movie so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anti-War in 1930 - Strangely attractive...","review":"I would give it a (hotly contested) 4.5 (rounded to 5). Before I explain the hotly contested part, let me explain that I am a sucker for a good black and white movie. And since this film was released in 1930, it's about as black and white as you can get. In fact, it still had a few elements of silent pictures which I enjoyed (short scenes fading to black). For 1930, the story was good but it was the acting that I thought was superior. The whole movie had an anti-war theme through the eyes of the Germans in WW1 which I thought was done rather well with an end cemetery scene to make all WW1 veterans cry. All this done in 1930, whew.Now, for the hotly contested part. I am not sure what drew me to this picture and made me love it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I bet some of you will walk away saying: \\"What? This thing sucked toilet water!\\" So, I can recommend it but watch it at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Classic","review":"I probably saw \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" for the first time in the mid 50's. I was a young boy at the time and saw it as an adventure film. I later saw it several times and, of course, its powerful anti-war atmosphere really struck home during the Vietnam era. I am now in the process of re-reading books and re-watching films from my younger days. The idea is to see the effect they have on me now. Both the book and the movie of \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" have more than held up. Set aside any prejudices you have against black and white movies. Set aside any prejudices you have against a slightly old-fashioned theatrical style of acting. This is a very powerful film about human beings trapped in the horror of war. What is going on Iraq now is exactly what these young men experienced in WWI."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","review":"Still potent and poignant seventy-five years after its release, All Quiet portrays the genuine bewilderment of enlisted soldiers at the front-- the soldiers who often fought and died never understanding why.

It's a time capsule film and nothing more: it's important for the time it was made and the effect it had then, but it doesn't hold up. \\"Grand Illusion\\" is a classic war film and should be seen as the quintisential WWI film.

Trite, sappy, and unbelievable story. The protagonist did not evoke any of my sympathy. The woman was interesting.Aside from the terrible writing, I had another problem with this book. Absolute appalling view of a patient/psychiatrist relationship. Even if the patient does want a relationship with a psychiatrist, in NO WAY is it acceptable for the psychiatrist to act on it.

True enough, here and there crop up like mushrooms after the rain a few cavils about some features; but, on the whole, reader reaction has been overwhelming enthusiastic--enough, clearly, to produce a minor constellation of gold stars (gongxi, gongxi to the writer!) and encourage the publication of further ventures in what has become a Bund-and-beyond series.Perhaps the mystery within the mystery might be revealed, as in a sudden enlightenment of the Kill Bill variety, if someone with the inclination to detail the particulars of both reviews and reviewers makes a complete diaocha of the Sinologic knowledge of all parties concerned.Still, while the social coordinates and the basic interactions of the characters are plausible on an East or West grid, the plot is still plodding; the personalities predictable; and the poetry, as translated, irritatingly insipid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery?

Unfortunately this book, which, as Judson states early on, could not find a publisher, would have been better left unpublished. This desultory history of scientific fraud simply rehearses what has been better said elswhere. The standard fraud cases - from Newton to Pasteur to Freud to Darsee to Baltimore - are given a superficial treatment. Especially egregious is the hatchet job on Baltimore and Imanashi-Kari. Anyone wanting to find out how shoddy and partisan his treatment of the later affair is ought to read the thoughtful and well researched \\"The Baltimore Case\\" by Daniel Kevles. Since Judson seems to regard himself as a purveyor of scientific ethics in a time of lapsing moral values in the scientific enterprise, one can only hope that the scientific community can protect themselves from such scrutiny. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judson would be a demagogue, if he could get your attention.","review":"I would have given this no stars if it were an option.The first 20 pages of this book bored and insulted me. Judson drones on about every fraud known to mankind, but only occasionally scientific fraud. He seems to hope that if we hear enough examples of fraud in the world, we will get fired up and join him in a lynching.His tone is condescending and assumes that you already agree with him. This is not the type of academician that you could hope to have a meaningful conversation with. He laces his information with references to \\"the epidemic\\" of fraud and nobody being \\"immune\\" to it, as if by the weight of these descriptive terms you will be swept into his inevitably correct conclusions. I suspect that Judson would have presented a more objective book if he had more worthwhile information to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Boredom","review":"Judging by the title, I was expecting a very interesting book. However, after only a few pages, my eyes began to glaze over. With all the possible material to choose from, the author chose to focus on the \\"Baltimore Affair.\\" I had never heard of this \\"affair\\" before, but now know that I didn't miss much. The entire book is written more in the dry style of a academic paper than one for the general reader. While it may appeal to some insiders in the research community, to capture any wider audience the author needed to inject some spirit, graphic images, personalities, atmosphere, humor, drama, or anything into his account to spark some reader interest.

The Gilmour looked promising, so I bought two units. I have to say, I'm sorry I did. One of the two did not shut off initially, and then suddenly started working. The unit is rather difficult to direct. That is, keeping the spray pattern where you want it (& reduce water waste).The timer as well seems to be a bit 'off' and tends to water more that the dial indicates (ie. the 1 hour setting runs much more than one hour).I would suggest looking at the Nelson Triple Spray Occillating Sprinkler, instead of this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonhoeffer, highlighted","review":"The book is a collection of gems conscientiously selected and arranged from Bonhoeffer's work, useful for devotional reading, a rich witness stimulating to heart and mind. The brilliant mind and steadfast, loving spirit of Bonhoeffer shine through.And yet...for this reader, The Martyred Christian is a sampler that challenges, a strong nudge to read Bonhoeffer's works straight through. Something is gained, perhaps, and something is lost, certainly, in the selection and juxtaposition of sparkling passages clipped out from their contexts, like a compilation of proof-texts or an ultra-canonic selection from the Bible.

On both an older Compaq running 98SE and a later Dell running XP, the one I bought caused the systems to lock up, sometimes during the boot process, and sometimes during the automatic driver installation. It didn't work in either case. The reason for buying it was to get around the problem of a physically damaged USB jack on the Compaq's motherboard; when it failed to work with the Compaq, I tried the same card in my Dell just to see if it was the card or the computer that was at fault. When the Dell also failed to accept it, I concluded that this one was no good.

The linux drivers are a pain but I've made it work a few times...just long enought for it to crash my linux box...so beware. However, it feels like nice construction and the image quality seems decent. If you can get it to work for you, it'd be a nice camera. Unfortunately for me, it's just not that reliable.

One story that comes to mind is about a woman who ignored her fear instinct to her regret, but there are so many interesting tales that it is worth reading for them alone.

Conrad is describing the capsule's fly-over of Houston while the frogmen are extracting the astronauts and then the spacecraft from the ocean.Also, in another mission segment, the spacecraft ingress chapter repeats on it's own unless the PLAY ALL option is selected.

I have not upgraded a thing on this laptop and it keeps going strong. It is almost 6 years later and I am so impressed with it! Sony makes one heck of a laptop and it is small and light. The only thing I have had to replace is the power cord 3 times, but it has been 6 years, and that is a good deal. If you want a good laptop, get a SONY and ignore those cheap ones.

The 180mm has proven to be excellent optically as well as ergonomically well designed. The light weight, for its size, coupled with the very intuitive af-mf push-pull design are great in the field. I work at Fairchild Tropical Botanical Garden. For images taken with the above lens, please visit [...].Regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an overall great lens.","review":"Bought this lens with high expectations and it has gone well above what I thought. This is by far the best purchase for my canon that I have made as of yet. The pictures have turned out great in both macro and normal settings. I would buy from Tamron again without question."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trackball that doesn't.","review":"I have tried two of the model 64227 Trackballs and each of them became erratic tracking in the vertical axis within a week of putting them in service. I like the layout of the device and it's programming features but trying to work in a graphics application is very frustrating to say the least. I can't recommend this item to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The question is - do you like trackballs?","review":"My husband hates this trackball and is hooking up a mouse in addition to it for his own use. I swear by it and won't use the mouse if I can put hand to a trackball. This has a very comfortable hand feel, the buttons are with one exception well placed, and overall I'd say it's excellent. I took away a star because the scroll button is in a wierd spot (but with a trackball, who needs a scroll button?) and because the optical sensor gets dirty rather quickly (fortunately, the sensor is very simple to reach and cleans much more easily than a mouse). This was a fantastic value - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant cleaning ...","review":"That's the only way to keep this trackball working. It does work smoothly when it's clean ... but it's very hard to keep it this way. I am amazed at how fast the rollers inside gum up - and the only way I have found to clean them is to gently and carefully scrape the crud off them with a sharp blade. There are also three tiny beads that hold the ball in place - these get covered in crud too. The only way to clean these is pop them out of their holders - very tricky.In general a nightmare cleaning effort. I have been on my hands and knees looking for these little beads many times when I have dropped them. I finally lost one and now the trackball is headed into the trash. My last duty is to give this review to warn you off it unless you have a good obsessive streak for cleaning (I don't).I also agree with the bland ambi-dextrous shaping. Doesn't really rest your wrist because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice trackball","review":"I've had this trackball for about 7 years and used it with my Mac. It has been great, not having to chase the mouse around the desk, lift it up and bring it back, then chase it around again. It's need for cleaning is the biggest drawback and why I gave it 4 stars. I usually use and exact-o-knife to clean the build-up on the rollers and then some kind of cleaning solution on a cotton swab, like 409). It is also starting to just get old (in my opinion) with optical-wireless ones out there. If it were wireless (Bluetooth preferred) and optical, I'd buy a new one without hesitation. I love the placement of the ball and the buttons and being able to program the buttons the way I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get use to another thing...","review":"I have this thing for many years (more than five for sure), and it's time for a replacement due the 3-4 week cleaning (that's why I gave it 4 stars). The gums started to brake andobviously the performance wasn't what it use to be. So I tried with my original 1 click Apple mouse and I immediately ordered a new trackball from here... can't go back to an ordinary mouse again. For me this has been a very reliable, well build product for all this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Here it is 6 months later and it is cutting out on me already. This is a HUGE object. It takes up a lot of room. The ball is huge. It is a sad follow up to an Optical trackball. The buttons are LOUD when clicked. The scroll button is about the only thing I like on it. I would not buy another and wish I could give this one back.I know how to clean my equipment so that is not the issue.I think it is just inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long forgotten silent masterpiece comes to life","review":"A master painter and his protege live in splendor, face relational conflicts, separation, etc., yet there doesn't seem to be a melodramtic note in the entire film. The acting is magnificent, and superior to many silent films. I was thoroughly suprised by the level of quality and sophistication of this movie. If you enjoy great silent movies, this one is a must see. The commentary by the Danish scholar is insightful. Thoroughly enjoyable. A truly excellent film and a genuine masterpiece of Weimar cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Punk Rock","review":"\\"Me And Jesus\\" is the best track on the album, with great lyrics, and the passion behind the song. Bad thing is the rest of the album falls into it's own formula, and one that you tire of VERY fast. Stop after five tracks, you've heard the basic sound. Creatively is badly needed on this album, change up the formula. The next album should be a complete departure from their first two albums, do hard rock, or no rock. Do something different.

Is smells like freshly cut boiled eggs on your face. I am not exaggerating AT ALL. Go ahead and buy it if you don't believe me. I would not advise you to do so because it also does not work. It claims 6-9 minutes but when I rubbed it off after 8-9 minutes I got maybe 3-4 little individual hairs on my towel. I have dry skin/eczema and also curly hair. I'm not sure about anyone else but besides not working and leaving the odor of boiled eggs rubbed on your face it also burns or stings just as much as if I had used a regular razor. If you're having issues I would suggest the poorman's method, shave with Dove soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad customer service","review":"Drolet High-Efficiency Pellet Stove, Model# DP00045.This product has a very bad manufacturer response with customer service.I used this stove for about 2 weeks when a problem with a control panel error occurred.I called left message with problem on 1-7-08, have yet to have a call back.I purchased this product from Northern Tools.

I have always had problems losing my voice maybe once a year, but last spring it had become every couple of months. I thought of retiring early or even asking about getting disability. But at the beginning of this school year I bought the HS125. I now talk all day in a soft voice, and let the rechargable batteries boost my voice to a shout. I have not lost my voice since buying this gadget, and I don't even get raspy. It has saved my career.The only reason I didn't rate it five-star is that the headset gets uncomfortable (pinches my ears) after a few hours. Small price to pay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great! Then it shorts out!","review":"I thought this was the best thing since sliced bread to keep me from straining my voice during my Pure Romance parties. I speak for about an hour in groups from 4-35 people and when there is an air conditioner and 2 fans running in the same room, I usually end up with a sore throat from straining above the noise.I purchased this amplifier and received it in just a few days. Tried it out at a party and it was wonderful. I used it at a 2-3 more parties and was thrilled! I always stored it in my laptop case put away in its own bag securly. The next time I went to use it, I could get no sound out of it. Brought it home and gave it a full charge. Tried it again and still nothing. Realised that the main unit had shorted out and I could only get sound when I held the cord to the headphones in a certain position against the unit.I promptly returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"more than disappointed","review":"I received this voice amplifier and it did not function at all so I sent it back.

The sleeve was just a black cuff, that I was willing to live with. Then I turned it on and it made a clicking noise but the hand did not move. Changed batteries and still no go. Quickly emailed seller via Amazon. They replied they would replace if after checking out a new one if I wanted. I sent a message of Yes..then I never heard from them, how to send the old one back or any advise as to what the next step was. I waited about 10 days, then it would be too late to receive it in time for Halloween. I sent an angry email and they responded telling me to call. After being put on hold for 10 minutes some one came on, I explained the situation and they asked me to hold, they came back and said I could keep the non-working hand and they would credit my account, they did not have any more. I found this service deplorable!! I will not order from them again no matter what they are selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The plot is far fetched & the ending weak.

As a Cary Grant fan, was disappointed, specially since it was done with the lady he did marry in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARY PSYCHO CHICK STALKS CARY GRANT","review":"Oh, YUCK! If you have any compassion for poor Cary Grant, you'll show him the respect of NEVER viewing this movie! The way this girl goes after him is just plain creepy, I'll probably have bad dreams! Today we call it stalking, and she'd be in jail. I adore Cary Grant, and he deserved a better woman (Deborah Kerr, who wouldn't have humiliated herself this way) and a better movie. He's in some really good pictures, do yourself a favor and skip this one. I tried to submit this with no stars, but they wouldn't let me. And \\"TURKEY\\" wasn't one of the choices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Defense Of This Great Movie","review":"All right! I watched this charmingly entertaining movie back on (01-18-01) and was refreshed by the experiance. Too many people complaining about stalking, etc. I thought it was some what \\"nice\\" to watch Betsy Drake's character size up to Cary Grant. She was most adorable in that role and it sort of made me long for a nice girl like that to go head-over-heals, crazy in love over me; then reality set in, but anyway, that's why we like movies sometimes -- to get away in the romance of it all! I had always thought that Cary Grant worked best only with Katherine Hepburn (Holiday 1938; Bringing Up Baby 1939; A Philadelphia Story 1940) but then, I watched \\"Every Girl Should Be Married\\" and saw what a close contender Betsy Drake was. The cast is great and the cameo by Eddy Albert as old Joe -- fantastic! And, the very fact that I enjoyed the movie is why I am here, so that I can purchase it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Charisma","review":"Cary Grant is his expected charming self in this funny comedy about the lengths that a young girl will go to to win her man. In an on-screen appearance with his real-life wife Betsy Drake, Grant shines as a doctor who has no interest in tying the knot. Drake's character is out on the prowl, engaging in crazy antics and schemes to win her man. Despite how crazy she can be, you can't help but like her. Everything about this film has the sparkle, humor and innocence that you can expect from a Cary Grant romantic comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it","review":"I thought this movie was hilarious!

Peter Skellen, played by Lewis Collins, is fantastically ruthless and calculating. Happily, British filmakers don't feel a need to portray all \\"good\\" guys as angelic heroes. The movie has a couple dated (early 80s) scenes, but its plot is almost too relevant for today. After having watched this movie annually for 20 years, I can assure you that it is neither overacted nor poorly contrived. The movie is simply unaffected and professional, just like the SAS."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!!!

It is sinewy, chocolately, dramatic, as winning and hearfelt an interpretation as any of the great performances on the modern cello by Cassals, Fournier, Rostropovich et al.Bylsma uses an actual period cello, not a reproduction, but manages to bring it alive and to coax out of it the sweetest sounds. Bylsma's tempi are faster than those familiar with modern interpretations might be prepared for, but his musicianship is so keen that the most precise phrasing remains intact and Bach's music never ends up sounding forced or rushed.I urge you to take a risk with this set (vols I and II), especially since the above Sony \\"Essential Classics\\" price is about half its original price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JED1","review":"Uncanny sound!

Hoped it would be good quality given the high price tag compared to standard garden hoses. I bought one of these at a local hardware store about a year ago. It's about the same amount of trouble to setup as a normal hose. You must uncoil and remove completely from reel to use. Worked well enough the first few uses. But when I brought it out to use the next summer it leaked so badly that no water even made it to the end of the hose. I always handled the hose carefully, it just doesn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Great idea, but a cheap made porduct. Save your money and buy a real hose.

I got this to use when we visit marinas on our boat. Connecting and dragging around 50' hoses to the marina hose bibs is a real pain. The hoses take up a lot of room in the lazzarette and always seem to catch on something when you take them out. I thought this compact hose with a reel would answer my concerns. Wrong! Although the hose looks like a fire hose it doesn't have the strength or durability of one. It must be completely removed from the reel and the hose must be straight before applying any water pressure. It can't have any kinks or bends. After using just a few times, it started to develop leaks and cracks. It just isn't up to robust use. The reel is more durable than the hose. I dumped the reel and now use the hose as an extension behind some bushes in the yard where the leaking doesn't matter. My search for a great hose for the boat will continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Great concept but the hose material simply does not survive in a marine environment.

I almost got my nose broke, but my parents didn't take me out of school. Seriously, I think homeschoolers will find this book putting down alternative education which is so untrue.I love diary-style books but this one just didn't take me there like most young adult books do.

Most of the events in the book are so immature they aren't even funny, just sad. Very, very sad.

I think reading MISS SMITHERS (the sequel) helps (I read both books within a short time period), because you can get a better sense of this writer's style and intention. MISS SMITHERS also has more of a traditional plot, which makes it easier to get into.

It's not just the homeschoolers who are socially retarded, it appears that Juby thinks EVERYONE is retarded. Reading this book is a painful experiance not only because of the slander, but simply because of the poor writing.The only thing this book has caused me to do, is waste time and wonder if perhaps Mrs. Juby is suffering from some kind of mental illness herself.

The collection of stories in this book are decades old and now classic. Of all the fantasy and science fiction that Saberhagen wrote, he is best associated with the Berserker stories. If you haven't had the chance, read these. They are timeless tales.But one thing has happened in the years since their first publications. If you compare the stories here, especially those of space naval actions, with what David Weber has written, then you can see that Weber would have been able to write some superb Berserker stories. With better verisimilitude than Saberhagen. Who knows? Maybe one day Weber can get permission from Saberhagen's estate to continue the Berserker saga, not unlike how Keith Laumer's Bolos kept rolling on. And, by the way, Weber did write an entire Bolo book.

What use is there in writing a thought-out review if you will simply erase it, or more likely, do something else with it?In the off chance that this is included, I will say that the Sportswriter is worth your time.

The author also uses it to spout little helpings of his personal philosophy, most of which was not particularly deep.

When I told people I was reading this, many unfamiliar to the author said that they didn't like sports books. This is not a sports book. It's a book based on human emotion, isolation, and need. The main character, written in the first person narrative just so happens to hold down that job. The book is heavy on the narrative end with very sparse dialog. By doing this the author creates a psychological work where a broken marriage, deceased son, writer's issues are all examined.

Seeing it on here makes me want to take off a day, go by the beach and reread to end up the way Mr. Bascomb does. There is something in the modest respect for the real details of life and its limitations and an eye for the realities of life in this and all of Ford's work.Of course, this is necessary reading because Ford's sequel with the same character, married and a decade or so later was his Independence Day that won the Pulitzer and the National Book Award, a larger more ambitious work, but with the same accuracy, modesty, and wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in the middle lane","review":"Recommended by the elderly Danish woman who runs my local bookshop, I had no choice but to read this - she had put me on to some great writers before (eg Peter Hoeg).

Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book.

Most of the story, to me, appears to be a window into the personal philosophies of the author, without much plot to speak of.

It synched easily with my Blackberry and PC (Windows 7).+ lightweight+ simple, easy to use controls+ some people complain about size/fit on ear, but for me it fits very well and I easily forget I have it on+ volume and clarity seem good- the only thing I don't like about it is the way the ear support bracket flips away from the rest of the earpiece. The movement is quite tight and I read in another review that this piece can tend to break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the adjustable earpiece!!","review":"I love this ear piece. While it doesn't have a huge range, the charge seems to last forever (reality 4-6hrs of talk time). I have small ears and can never seem to find ear buds, or ear pieces that fit, even some where the head set offers interchangeable sizes for that not so perfect fit. This one allows you to bend the ear piece so it fits your ear, big or small. It is also interchangeable to use on either ear. If you're like me and can't ever seem to find a blue tooth ear piece that fits comfortably, you will love this one!! A must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset","review":"I got this earpiece for my wife to use.

Jabra knows that the BT125 earhook isn't durable.i've since gone thru the 2 they sent and am now waiting for Jabra to send me another 2 earhooks.all in all, this is a great bluetooth for the price. maybe if you're not rough with it, the earhook will last you a long time.my recommendation is, if you buy the BT125, go ahead & call Jabra and tell them that your earhook broke and that you need them to send you some replacement earhooks for free.o_O"},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you paid for","review":"Considering you only pay about [...] bucks for this headset, don't expect much. I'm gonna keep it quick and simple. Sound quality was normal, nothing great, nothing bad. It's easy to pair and not complicated at all. The microphone, similar to most bluetooth headsets, picks up a lot of background noise, so I wouldn't recommend this headset if you talk in the car often and etc. The ear hook is fine, I admire that you can bend it to your liking for the perfect fit. The earpiece must be the worst thing about this headset. It doesn't go in your ear, but sits on the outside of it. The edges arent very smooth so after an hour or so, your ear may hurt or feel a bit sore, which commonly happens to me. If only they had some cloth surrounding it or smoothed out the edges. Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 because you only pay [...] bucks for it so don't expect much. I would recommend this headset for those who use bluetooth headsets occasionally, not for prolonged use."},{"rating":"2","title":"I should write this en francais","review":"One of Zack's best, but not for the Non-french speakers, unless you're learning the language.

Now we have some outstanding musicians making period instrument recordings with experience playing Baroque instruments. So for a good period instrument recording, I would recommend Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert Orchestra or other good period ensembles. Don't settle for Gustav Leonhardt. He was a pioneer, but he wasn't a good conductor. And the same for the orchestra in this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but Difficult to read","review":"The story in this book is clever and humorous but the author's attempt to write in a sort of Elizabethan English akin to Shakespeare is a clumsily annoying contrivance that makes it unnecessarily hard to decipher. This forced archaic manner of speech the author used for the characters severely detracts from the enjoyment of what is a good plot. One gets the sense that the author is torn between making the characters speak as though they were from a Grimm fairy tale one minute and then like they are a bad stereotype of a hillbilly the next.

Continuity is nonexistent. IGI and IGI 2 are far better than MS3 when it comes to physics and realism.For some reason, it takes two, sometimes three shots to kill (even in the head) and even after two shots the target sometimes doesn't figure out that he has indeed been shot. Delta Force: Black Hawk Down's AI is light years ahead of MS3.The game runs out of fun quickly. I can clearly see why it was in the $4.99 bin. I'd recommend about a dozen older games ahead of this one - the development team really fell disappointingly short with this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even bother with this one","review":"I work with ATM networks frequently.

There are too many references to standard specifications and not enough \\"down to earth\\" explainations.

After the first few chapters of the ATM \\"meat\\" part of the book I soon found myself in acronynm hell. Again bloated with useless standard desigations. I would recommend this book to anyone who is already well versed in ATM as a good reference book.

It is the definitive reference on ATM. If you just want an overview, the book is not for you. If you want to understand ATM in depth, this is it. It is valuable not only for network engineers, but also for product engineers designing new equipment or software. However, McDysan has also come out with a new book titled ATM & MPLS Theory and Application. Unless you are certain you will never need to know about MPLS, I would suggest getting the newer book.

Though she is only a few months old, our baby responds well to the contrasting colors (mostly orangey-reds and greens). Because they are portrayed as sleeping huddled together, the bunnies and sheep are hard to discern, though.

Instead she finds fault with everyone else and completely misses the fact that the problem is with HERSELF. She is more interested in her son returning to his childhood role as her little baby, than assuming the independent stature that he has naturally grown into.

Let me say this: whenever PC games move over to consoles, they fail 99% of the time, and this is no exception.The graphics are horrendous for a PS2 game, unlike the PC version, these graphics seem muddy and unclear. The other falling points of this game are the lack of levels and characters, and no on-line play is the final nail in the coffin. Buy Timesplitters or the PC Unreal, save yourself from this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST FPS! Quake is now OUT!","review":"See title! PROS: Everything!

Lots of it. Especially in multiplayer. Do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown. It's not so bad that you CANNOT play it, but it is very frustrating considering how powerful PS2 is! You shouldn't have to put up with slowdown with this kind of machine. If you've played Perfect Dark, the slowdown is comparable to that game in 4 player mode.Horrendous controls. The game gives me a migraine every time I play it because for some reason the controls aren't fully customizable...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for children!","review":"I would highly recommend this game for children between the ages of 5-12.

Also recommended for younger audiences : Grand Theft Auto III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!!!!!!!","review":"I played this on the computer first.

Very good maps allow you to follow the complex course of this running fight between the Missouri State Guard and the outnumbered, but well-trained German Federals (Savas is a small publisher that \\"gets it\\" where maps and military history are concerned). Sigel marched his outnumbered troops way out on a proverbial limb into southwest Missouri - his escape was due to luck, Rebel errors, and to the excellent fighting qualities of his soldiers, especially his artillerymen. Good also on the complicated pro-Union and pro-secession politics of Missouri. Some useful photos of the battlefield today.

The book is geared toward a specialized and highly informed reader, however, and the map book should be left open while reading unless you are familiar with German names for Hungarian locations as they existed in 1944/45. I also enjoyed Maier's personal interludes that provide insights into the behind-the-scenes fighting between various generals and the German High Command. Beware of the axe he has to grind over General Hermann Balck, however--I would read Balck's memoirs as well to get a more balanced view of his dealings with various SS commanders/units. Maier might be right--but check all of the sources on this point. Otherwise, an excellent reference and an engrossing read for the advanced WWII history buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Blank Book!","review":"Don't expect to read about the automat in this book, it's just blank pages of lined paper.

It greatly exceeded my expectations. The arrangements are creative and imaginative; the playing, superb. Lively tangos are mixed with light classics and operetta. I have subsequently bought other discs with \\"salon\\" music that are quite enjoyable, but they do not seem to show the inventiveness of Viveza. Regrettably this disc and its equally enjoyable sequel, Viveza Encore, are out of print. I am waiting for a new disc by the same group, which is expected to appear this year.

Buyers beware!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF NO MP3 ENCODER INCLUDED BUYER BEWARE","review":"I can't believe in this day & age that a company such as Magix would stoop so low as to misrepresent a product such as this. On the box & in the manual they state there is an 'included MP3 encoder'. They even take the trouble to list a few 'demo items', on the gatefold of the box.When you go to actually install & then use this software- a popup informs you that the MP3 included is only good for 20 Mp3 conversions. For an additional fee (19.95) in the manual, maybe higher as it's not even listed on the Magix website, you can have 'unlimited use', of the MP3 encoder.What a joke !!I think that Amazon shouldn't even sell this product, as it's so badly misrepresented by the manufactuer.I will NEVER BUY MAGIX !!Make the argument to place of purchase , TAKE IT BACK !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated New User","review":"I purchased the latest version of this from the Magix web site.

The manual it comes with is one of the worst I've ever seen - virtually useless. So I contacted the company. They offered to send me some documents. What I got was not only too basic to be helpful (I'd already figured it out on my own), but it had not been updated from the last Audio Cleaning Lab version. I made a couple of more attempts to contact them, but never got a response. So everything I've learned has been trial and error. I highly recommend that you hook your computer up to decent stereo speakers when doing the cleaning, etc. Computer speakers will not give you an accurate idea of how the CD will sound on your stereo system. I also recommend that you keep in mind that a little tweak goes a long way. So more is not always better! Otherwise you get a lot of annoying distortion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Customer Support","review":"I have also experienced extremely poor customer support from MAGIX. My retail boxed copy comes up as an e copy. The program requests that I enter a code number to make it a full copy. After 10 phone calls to support [usually there is no one in the office] I have given up on obtaining a registration code. I also attempted to obtain the free upgrade for the mp3 conversion option in the program. Again, no success in getting an activation number. The program itself has some nice features, however, I feel cheated in not being able to get all of the features that I paid for. MAGIX support is the poorest I have ever experienced. Beware of this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when working, but Crashes Too Much","review":"I bought this after seeing mostly good reviews and because I wanted to convert to WAV format, rather than a proprietary format like WMA. It was fairly easy to figure out the basics, and sometimes I can convert a few albums in a row without it crashing. But it crashes way too often - at least 5 times today trying to convert one album; a full reboot after each crash. After ripping about 10 albums (out of 150 or so), I have decided to give up on this program and look for something else. Too bad . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Let's clear a few things up right here.You do NOT have to pay for an MP3 converter. You can register for a FREE key on the Magix website after your initial 20 exports are used up. They do not flood your inbox with Spam, either.This program is good for beginners AND pros alike. The wizards in the program will allow novices to get excellent results. If you can't figure out the wizards, you should not be near a computer.If you are running XP on a mid-level machine, you will not crash. I only experienced a crash when I ran this on my kids' 6-year old PC running Windows 2000 with very little memory.The English in the manual and in the program is FINE.I have digitized hundreds of LPs and cassettes with great results.

The games themselves appear through a select screen when you put the module in, and the launcher and the other programs appear. When you are done, it only saves your settings and last games played, (and in the case of Lode Runner, extra level sets.) So at most, it leaves 10k on your Visor. If you were to buy any one of the programs seperately (except for 2, which are free) it would cost $15. Installing all of these programs instead of buying the Springboard would take at least 750k.

In addition, the spontaneous character voices don't work well with the new games, and the mouths are out of sync with the words when they (and you) are forced to speak.
