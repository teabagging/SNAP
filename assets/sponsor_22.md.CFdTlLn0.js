Possibilities are knocking each day, the thing that makes the difference is how we react and what we make out of them. Richard gives this knowledge and show examples how to change everyday situations / ideas to real opportunities and make them to be also profitable and enjoyable the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great/Quick Read","review":"I found this book to be very motivating and inspiring. It contains great insight on the founding of the Virgin brand and Richard Branson, himself.The stories are very well written and easily painted in your mind. My personal favorites are the balloon stories...although in my opinion the calculated risks out-weighted the rewards which, is a complete contradiction of his business motto. Richard Branson is at the top of my list of favorite people and this book confirmed that positioning for me. Business wise, nice man, big heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - but very quick","review":"If you are looking for a book you can get through in 1.5-2 hours, then this is great. It is a fun read. A little bit inspirational, a little bit comedy, a little bit of self propaganda, and a lot of Virgin advertising, this book will not help you become a millionaire overnight, but it will make you think about how taking risks can ultimately pay off. I particularly love the story about how Sir Richard Branson started Virgin airlines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, read \\"Losing My Virginity\\" instead.","review":"I started with Branson's first book, \\"Losing My Virginity\\", and was absolutely hooked. That book is compelling, insightful, exciting, inspirational, and well-written. \\"Screw it, Let's Do It\\" on the other hand, is none of those things, and feels like a cheap re-hashing of \\"Losing My Virginity\\", but without any of the real substance. The writing is poor (leading me to wonder if Branson had a lot of help in writing \\"Losing My Virginity\\") and he rushes through anecdotes that he explains in detail in \\"Losing My Virginity\\". The whole book feels very cursory and surface-deep, and doesn't do justice to Branson's incredible persona. Don't waste your time, get \\"Losing My Virginity\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid for this book?","review":"The most poorly written book (short or long) I have ever read...next to Branson's other book, \\"Sir Richard Branson -- the Autobiography.\\" Appears Branson got \\"Screw It...\\" published only because he owns the publishing company. Regarding his \\"Sir Richard Branson -- the Autobiography\\", ditto for that one. Appears making a few bucks on his earlier \\"Virginity\\" book made him think he could rephrase content and sell as two more books with more or less merely different titles. Apparently Branson runs his business world better than he writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. A blueprint for business success.","review":"Loved reading about the principles of success from one of the most interesting and down to earth icons. GOOD READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah lets do it!","review":"A good pretty concise read of how he does this.....something I expect to keep for future reference.....very pleased it was available as an ebookIt shows what he also learned from mistakes made as well which was very good to see as it makes it real and more valid as we all tend to make mistakes....quite inspiring in this respect to keep on trying!!A good buyLaurie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"All I can say really, I was looking forward to learning something from Mr. Branson and quickly into the reading I wondered if he ran his companies as poorly as this book was written. He may be a big risk taker and in many cases he has pulled them off but really he sounds like a 5 year old with a big wallet running around starting businesses and buying islands I don't really see the message in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons in Life","review":"This book reads as if SRB was sitting having a drink with you. He comes across sincere, warm, and humble. I appreciate his quirkiness, his candidness, and his incredible vision in business and in individuals.His lessons in life are not at all intimadating and what he says is nothing new or what we shouldn't already know or at least have heard of; however, it's his delivery that sets him apart and obviously all the mistakes and success he shares - his rawness. I've also read \\"Losing My Virginity\\" and was completely in awe of him from beginning to end - indeed an extraordinary life for a most extraordinary, inspiring individual.The cover I believe appropriately portrays how he comes across inside the pages and hopefully how he is in real life . . . radiant and warm with such a sparkle! He has kind eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go Mr Branson","review":"Truly awe inspiring.I finished it in 1 hour. Print is easy on eyes.Got me motivated.May I say that Mr Branson is the Forrest Gump of Britain, albiet with a sharp and big IQ brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I read this book on a 1 hour flight and loved it. I found this book to be inspirational, motivating and fun to read. Sir Richard Branson is truly a bold and amazing person. I enjoyed reading about his various adventures of flying hot air balloons and all the risks it entailed. This book is about challenging yourself, making bold moves, never hesitating or settling for anything less than you want in life. This is a wonderful quick read for some long term inspiration to your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This has got to be the cheapest, worst produced DVD ever. Let's start with the Transfer which clearly was taken from a VHS copy of the movie and a poor VHS copy at that. The picture quality is unbelievably bad and almost un-watchable. The audio is even worse with a constant hissing noise that will have you wanting to cut your ears off in minutes rather than sit through it. The only extras on the disc are a bunch of trailers for some other equally bad looking movies. Overall this DVD is a joke and a total waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and pick up a VHS copy for a fraction of the price...trust me, you'll thank me you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"the prehistoric southwest","review":"This is a selection of writings about the ancient people of the Southwest and the inspiration they have provided to many authors. The selections include pieces from European explorers and settlers, archaeologists, artists and poets. A excellent book to take along on a trip out West, or read to discover authors you want to read more from. 244 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dolly doesn't care about people. Not really.","review":"My mother was passing so I made a play list from YouTube. When I tried to find the songs for individual sale, none were available. The only way I could purchase the songs were to buy \\"Dolly's entire cds.\\" at inflated prices. Low down and dirty marketing strategies, Dolly! I will boycott DollyWood and will never support Dolly and her boob jobs or her wigs again. Using gospel songs for profit is no different than Judas selling out Jesus. God gave you a great talent and you exploit it for $! DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, DOLLY? Very disappointed in you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"With the long list of well-loved gospel oldies on this CD, I was sorely disappointed in its musical arrangement. Dolly grew up with this music,as did I, but it was presented in a totally different style than one is used to hearing. Too much percussion and vocal chorus and not enough stringed instruments, and the way in which the songs were sung was uninspiring spiritually. I enjoy Dolly's voice and much of her music, but this one, for me, was disappointing.To each his own, I know that there are some who will like this style, but I could not even bring myself to listen to each song all the way through.Old gospel country/bluegrass sounds best sung the way it used to be. But again, there are some who would probably find no fault with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less XML-Databases and more opensource","review":"This book is not an application development guide. But it mentions about some *open source* tools and covers some API available in Perl, Java and C towards the end of the book. And the rest of the book is filled with descriptions of other open source tools, not completely irrelevant, but probably you were not looking for and distracting.If you are just looking for some description of tools or guide to use tools available, I suggest just you spend the time the web and you get lot more useful information than presented in this book.Even when the author talked about XML Databases, he is mostly interested in Document Management not the data. He did not do justice to the data that can be presented/stored in XML/Database."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"This book has some useful information, though it suffers from lack of editing. I thought that a draft copy accidently went to press when I started reading this. Many of the errors in this book are typos, but some of the errors have more to do with presentation and may confuse the reader about the topic.Open Source XML Database Toolkit does have useful information. Its strength is that it is geared to help readers understand how XML, DBMSs, and all the middleware fit together.XML and other computer markup and languages use esoteric symbols and naming devices; it is crucial that technical books about these topics get them right consistently. This book doesn't do that, which is why I have given it 2/5 stars. Informative (thus far in my reading), but -3 for poor editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most for all gardeners","review":"This book is a most for anyone who gardens or knows someone who gardens. Funny, down to earth, and full of interesting stories from across the country. Robin is a gifted writer, I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't know what it wants to be","review":"Some cute, quirky people featured in here. Shows the emotional need that gardening can often fulfill. When describing strangers, the author spins interesting and compelling stories. Unfortunately, when she writes about her family and friends, she loses her thread and the tales become self-indulgent and unfocused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"I wanted John Starnes.

I'm not sure what I expected, but the recipes didn't even look good to me. If I'm still going to have to prepare sides, then I might was cook the entree, too. I'm going back to using my Crock Pot for soups and chili only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing recipes","review":"This is a cute idea for a book, and its done with a nice format and layout. However my wife and I are disappointed with the recipes, as many of them rely on processed foods, canned soups, and powdered mixes for flavor. Some also require things to be cooked separately before being added to the pot, and/or use things like canned beans, and are not taking advantage of the crock pot cooking method in my opinion. Although we only tried one recipe for pasta with ground beef (and actually our one-year old liked it) I'm not sure we will make another recipe from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Kindle version!!","review":"This is not the complete book. Many of the recipes have ingredients with asterisks after them. The asterisks let you know of substitutions that you might like to use, rather than the original ingredient listed. On the Kindle version, you certainly see the asterisk after the ingredient in the recipe, but you have no idea what the asterisk means. Until publishers, and Amazon, stop ripping people off in this way, I'll stick with the print version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Gem","review":"I heard this album years ago and for some reason it stuck in my mind so I did a search on it. I'm glad to see that it is still available so now I will buy it. The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars is because I couldn't get enough of the guitar work, the guy did some brilliant stuff but was really subdued in a lot of the material so I'm disappointed. However I will do further searches on this guitarist (John Heyworth) and see what I can come up with. I hope he is still around and still making albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic early UK prog","review":"One of the under-appreciated classics from the early days of UK prog; heavy on the mellotron with melodic/epic stylings and great song writing. The CD starts out with To Play Your Little Game which sets the tone for the entire CD (this track is frequently part of various prog compilations). Similar to Spring, Asgard, Czar, Eyes of Blue, England (Garden Shed), Gracious and my personal favorite, Dancer (Riverbank). The Moody's set the tone for many others to follow and Cressida ranks up there with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"It's great that there are books like this one that address real life issues. This book is inspiring and brings hope that there can be freedom. I've learned so much from this book and have recommended it to several friends and even some of parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic","review":"This book definitely shows the power of a changed life! The testimonies in this book give encouragement and bring hope for anyone struggling with an eating disorder. Also very helpful for people who are connected to someone who struggles with this issue.

I definitely enjoyed reading it as someone who knows people with eating disorders!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starved: mercy for Eating Disorders","review":"Amazon did not mention that this is a CHRISTIAN based book and the philosophy is based on biblical references.

I can tell you that I am LIVING PROOF that the principles in Nancy's book are LIFE CHANGING and HEALING! God's power WORKS to conquer the strongholds in our lives, and eating disorders are no exception! This book is not only beneficial for people struggling with eating disorders, but for anyone with any kind of stronghold or addiction! GOD HEALS! I am now walking in freedom... PRAISE THE LORD and THANK YOU mercy ministries!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!","review":"This book is a must read in today's society with eating disorders running rampant! We need an understanding of what the root problem is with eating disorders. For a young woman to overcome a serious eating disorder, she has to first understand what the war inside of her actually is. The war is not over just the food. It's actually over her ability to see herself the way God sees her and to understand that her self worth and value is not in what the mirrors says to her, but rather what God says to her. Whether you believe in God or not, this book is an excellent source and easy read to understand eating disorder better and receive the hope for restoration for yourself or a loved one. Nancy Alcorn did a fabulous job on this book. It's a must read for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is Hope!","review":"This is an amazing book that is different from anything else I have encountered.

The case provides ample room for my 17\\" notebook, with ample room for my power cord and other accessories. Although I haven't traveled by air with it yet, I think it will serve those purposes nicely too. My only wish is that the \\"cargo\\" compartment would be just a bit larger. I know I'm probably trying to carry too much stuff in this case, but if I am carrying my notebook, there is not much room in the other compartment.

This book deserves more stars than Amazon allows to give."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you tye flys you need this book","review":"I 1st heard about his book on a Orvis Podcast. I think the book is high priced ,but is worth every penny you spend. I have used it often. It sets right next to my main fly tying vise setup. There is information within it that is priceless.

You can also purchase this book on CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"As an instructor for beginner, intermediate, and advanced fly tiers this books is like having an assistant within the room.

I've heard rave reviews about this book from fellow anglers. Even though this book is expensive, it's worth it. The book consists of step by step photos of tying on different materials for soft hackled flies, streamers, dry flies, bass flies and nymphs patterns. Since I mostly fish for steelhead, I wished the book had tips for tying egg patterns.

For me it's terrific escapist entertainment to watch once and that's it. Now with this huge set, the price of is a good deal for 96 hours of show, but only for major fans.Season 1 and Season 2 are my favorites. Implasable they are, but exciting and well acted the are also. I just wasn't big on season 3, as it felt way to rushed and a little desperate. Season 4 was better but still not to the standard of the first two. If you watch the show you know what you're in for. If you never have go back and watch some repeats on TV, or the current season. My view is it's fine show, just not quite as good as say The Sopranos or CSI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Quality","review":"Great TV series.

I discovered it on DVD and have bought Seasons 1-4. It is the best drama, intrigue, plot twisting, cliff hanging surprise of any show on DVD. You cannot just watch casually; you will get jolted by the action and extraordinary situations. While viewing, emotional support from a spouse or friend is suggested. It's too dangerous to go it alone... Seriously, its a lot of fun. Brilliant entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"24 seasons 1-4","review":"The 24 Series is action packed.

The Pentax Optio MX is a good buy. However, be aware that the software that comes bundled with it will NOT work if you have installed Windows Media Player 10. It only works with Windows Media Player 9.0 or earlier. Camera controls are intuitive and easy to access but holding the camera steady is a bit tricky. The included 16 MB SD card is a joke but you can buy a 256 MB for about $20 and that will do the job. Although the manual advises that you buy a \\"fast\\" card, a regular card works great even while recording at best resolutions. Autofocus noise is a bit of a nuisance if you are taping in a relatively quiet setting (just turn the volume down). Overall, a great alternative to bulky low resolution camera/camcorders for $235 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ninehundred what!!??","review":"This is an excellent product, I bought mine when it was the newest model and even then it was only $250 at Costco, anyone who pays $900 for it , needs to get their head checked now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be on kindle!","review":"Good for leadership training.

Unfortunately, she is simply being a woman of her time - after all, there has been little to no media coverage that has portrayed skinheads as being anything but violent hatemongers and nazi stormtroopers.Skinheads, in reality, are not by nature racist. The movement was started by Whites as well Jamaican and Carribbean islanders in the late sixties. It didn't start with the White Aryan Brotherhood or the Hammerskins. It started as just a bunch of working-class blokes having a good time.However, hate and shock sell these days, so making skinheads out do be anything good simply won't make a profit.

These speakers do seem to be very sensitive when adjusting the volume control. The sub woofer does not seem to have any issues, but towers do. When I just adjust the volume knob it can suddenly have a sharp, static noise come in and out. I have checked the connections as well as various volume controls within the Windows XP and Windows Media Player volume controls. Despite trying different adjustments they just are not \\"smooth\\" in any sense of the word. Fortunately I did not spend a fortune on them. Shop around and look for another alternative, because if you are like me and like to at least listen to some tunes when working at your computer, these are not the best option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, But Useless","review":"The only reason I gave two stars for these speakers is because they have pretty blue lights when they are turned on. However, the blue lights sometimes flicker and dim for no reason, or extinguish completely.The volume control is useless- move it the slightest bit to either side and the volume is either at the maximum or minimum. There is no in-between.Another problem I'm going to list is that static is a constant factor, and every couple minutes there's a loud popping noise and the blue lights flicker.This is a very bad product!!

You also know that you're going to meet some bad people,that you will be shown how much evil lurks in the minds of men, that nice guys will finish last, and it's going to be a tad depressing. The trade-off is worth it.I'd recommend it for a long flight in tourist class, or maybe a visit to Rochester, rather than bed or beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"epic fail","review":"Many people have described the plot so I will describe why I didn't like the book overall.First, the character of Dmitri served no real purpose to me. Secondly, they made so much of the tattoos but never explained them and they never became important. Thirdly, Alma's slow realization that she didn't hate him and that he loved her happened too quickly with hardly any development. The fact that he converted to Christianity does not mean he's not culturally Jewish, either, so if Alma truly were an anti-Semite, for her, he still would've counted as a Jew. What was the significance of chess in the story? The moment of epiphany was rather weak. The character of Siegl was not at all good for his age. Her stupidity was something that Joyce Carol Oates used at whim...sometimes she was pretty smart other times, she was dumb as a rock. Not cool. Finally, the ending was rather random and a real let down. His relationship with his sister had a lot of potential but she failed all around in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is better (pre/post) Holocaust fiction out there","review":"This is my first Oates book to read. She is a talented writer -- clever, metophorical, and she does know how to develop characters. However, there are better books out there that are not sterotypical \\"Holocaust\\" fiction -- even if it is post-Holocaust fiction. For a good,accurate, distrubing,and thought provoking read try Blood From the Sky, Mendelssohn is on the Roof, The Painted Bird, or even Ida Fink's The Journey.

Readers who want a sexy, fast-paced read with witty dialogue will not be disappointed, since this book has all that. But it has so much more. I really identified with Cassie as she struggled to be her own person, and rooted for Guy as he tried to show her she could have love without surrendering her sense of self. The scenes between them were hot enough to burn up the pages, but they were also humorous, touching, and quite imaginative. I'll never look at Squabble, foot massage, or chocolate the same!

Because of this unique setting, Lightning on the Sun becomes a highly-charged thriller. What truly separates this novel from others in the same genre is the fact that Bingham is obviously familiar with the historical, political and social intricacies of daily life in Cambodia. Add to that well developed characters and you're left with a powerful, fascinating story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing tropical yuppie angst","review":"Second-rate Robert Stone, third-rate Hemingway, fourth-rate Graham Greene. I have lived in Phnom Penh for 5 years and laughed out loud at some of the mis-descriptions of the city and its people contained in this turkey. It is all too obviously based on Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers, a much superior book in every respect. If you enjoy novels about troubled preppies playing out their war fantasies against a background of third world people (who are never raised by the author above the level of furniture and scenery) you'll love this meditation on the problems of yuppies abroad. I mean, what IS the meaning of life, man? Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy dog soldiers imitation","review":"I grew really fed up with this novel, and the rather banal nihilism of its characters. What is the source of their disaffection? Their priviledged upbringings, for the most part. It's hard to take that sort of anomie seriously, and it becomes insufferable, after a certain point, to endure their existential angst. Versus Stone's \\"Dog Soldiers,\\" which I'd read before and am now in the process of re-reading. He presents a much, fuller, richer perspective on the overall disaffection of American culture at the time, and how Vietnam played into the moral landscape of the nation. Granted, Stone wrote his novel in a more tumultuous period. Still, \\"Soldiers\\" delves into broader issues in a considered manner, whereas Bingham never seems to transcend the trope of spoiled, rich, nihilistic 30-somethings. Which -- not coincidentally -- is exactly who Bingham was."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIABETICS BEST USE OF YOUR MONEY","review":"VERY GOOD ..

The problem is this book's interpretations of Catholic teaching are inaccurate, distorted, and in some cases flat out untrue. This book is challenging for \\"cultural Catholics\\" and ignorant Catholics because it has many shades of Catholic truth and teachings they would recognize. But these truths are often twisted or misrepresented, therefore they are not accurate Catholic teaching, but something else. If one is really knowledgable of scripture and AUTHENTIC Catholic teaching, this book's errors and distortions are obvious and clear.If you are going to challenge Catholic teaching, you have to at least present authentic Catholic teaching accurately and completely. This books fails to do to accomplish this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book for anyone trying to understand the Catholic Faith","review":"I was born and raised a Catholic and recently left the church for a bible based church.

He takes what Catholics believe and distorts them in terrible ways. If the Catholic Church was like he describes it to be, then it would need reform. It is not, however, anything like it. This is another example on the scandal of the evangelical mind, that is to say, \\"The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is no evangelical mind\\"(Mark Knoll). He makes the protestant church look bad. Some protestant evangelicals write idiotic things like this which has the affect of making the whole church look bad. Books like this are why protestants are not normally considered intellectuals.

McCarthy's feeling of moral superiority to Catholics along with the glee which he unabashadly gushes in describing various Catholics who have left their faith, has a distinctive non-Christian flavor. What an amazing feat of theology and divine inspiration that McCarthy (who offers no credentials, incidentally) has discovered God's 'truth' all on his own.

This is a plain, ordinary album, which cannot boast a good song besides \\"Ark of the Envious\\".

They look OK but the metalurgy is inferior, made from recycled scrap.These are brakes, a critical safety component, not a cheap decorative lamp. Parts arrived beat up, not properly packaged, dents in surfaces from metal to metal contact. Would not repeat purchase.Lesson learned, buy where you can inspect the part prior to purchase. It may cost more but you will save in the long run.

I had seen her on TV and she displayed the very quilt on the cover of the book. I ordered the book for the pattern and was very dismayed when I got the book that it didn't contain the pattern. I'm very disappointed that many of the items featured in her book didn't have patterns to go with them. In the back of the book what how to order them making me feel as if I purchased a catalog more than anything. The craft projects she did feature I found most to be generic.The book is decent for decorating and a few craft ideas but don't buy the book thinking you can making everything in it without buying more books or patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK THAT QUILTERS AND NON-QUILTERS WOULD ENJOY","review":"LYNETTE JENSEN'S BOOKS ARE A REAL JOY.

From the advertisements, it seemed like a totally lame show and I refused to waste my time trying it out. However, 5 years ago, I was up all hours of the night with a new baby. Nothing good was on TV, and I stumbled across Arrested Development while channel surfing. I figured it was better than watching infomercials, so I tried it out. It was all I could do to not wake up everyone in the house with my laughter! From that point on, I was glued to the TV every time it was on.

Highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"This is a great deal. This is really one of the best comedies of the last decade. It only lasted three seasons but it is incredible. It deals with the problems the rich Bluth family encounters once the family leader ends up in jail. Starting from there it gets more and more crazy. The comedy varies between very often very subtle and straight-on slapstick. It is simply splendid. If you consider this first season, the first DVD is simply the best and strongest part: the second half of the season is not as superb, but still very good. At the moment it is also very cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn-a-Thon","review":"I read the reviews here, heard the hype elsewhere and decided to finally give this show a shot. What an incredible waste of time. This show is not funny, it's not even dry humor. It is stale, depressed, boring writing being conveyed by mostly listless tortured acting. Think of Grapes of Wrath minus the cheer and color. I believe this is the fault of the director ringing any life out of what should be good performances by a talented ensemble (not that anyone could do much with this poor script). Were the screen writers on strike again at this time??? And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, in walked Fonzie - yep Henry Winkler, and it got worse. The pinnacle of his career was The Fonz (which was dreadful) and it has all been downhill for him since Happy Days. No wonder it's on the free list, they should really pay us to watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the best sitcom on tv? That's depressing.","review":"If this is what people consider entertaining, it's no wonder the country is going to hell.

It's too cool and smart for average viewers weened on formulaic pap usually found on sitcoms. BUT-kudos to FOX for renewing the program for another season. If you have'nt seen it, pick up this set and immerse yourself in it. Then start watching and supporting this great show.

Every character is original and humourous, each establishing a unique identity and style. This show is capable of making you laugh out loud when you're home alone. The show is reminiscent of Seinfeld, with characters causing each other problems due to Seinfeld-ian misunderstandings. The show has a great heart, as family is a central theme, and source of comedy, of the series.This show has a firm commitment to consistency. The show presents subtle jokes that only a devoted viewer will comprehend.

I watched \\"the Office\\" with Steve Carell (who I loved on the daily show), so I thought I would love it as much as this - I hated it - the only good character was Steve Carell, so it sucked - the difference with AD is that everyone is so unique and so funny and brings their own quirkiness to the characters. And of course Jason Bateman is the best calm rational guy in the midst of a totally crazy family. The guest characters are great too - Henry Winkler, Martin Short, Mo Collins, Liza Minelli (who knew?), Carl Weathers etc. LOVE IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't all tv be this good??","review":"In Australia, they hide this little gem very late at night, usually around midnight (that same time they hide the likes of Six Feet Under and Curb Your Enthusiasm).

After just watching one episode, I was hooked. Most of the new sitcoms on TV now are not even worth watching. It's so great to see there is a new series worth watching. Jason Bateman does a brilliant job portraying Michael Bluth. His character stands as the voice of reason for the Bluth family. I was so happy when I heard they were making a second season.

It's our only \\"must see\\" series. After viewing the first season on Fox, we bought it on DVD and have watched it two more times. Each time, we catch new \\"bits\\" that we didn't see before. I'm puzzled why the series isn't a bigger hit; maybe because in order to \\"get it\\" you have to really watch carefully, and a lot of the jokes are lightning-fast. Blink, and you'll miss something. \\"Arrested Development\\" is truly a comedy series for smart people. If you appreciate clever writing, sharp acting, and absurdist humor, you should buy this set.

You can watch an episode many times and catch something new every time.It also has an excellent ensemble cast. Usually a sitcom has one or two stand out characters but I honestly can not pick a favorite from this series - they are all equally likeable and entertaining.I will rewatch my Arrested Development DVDs many times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrested Development","review":"Arrested Development is one of the funniest and fresh TV series.

Look at these reviews! See how many MORE 5-stars there are than 1-star? There is a reason for that! This is the funniest 30-minute sitcom EVER MADE (yes, funnier than Seinfeld and even funnier than Trailer Park Boys and The Larry Sanders Show!). It is unique in its having an announcer than runs throughout the show and explaining - and compliaing! - all along the way. (This announcer is none other than Opie Taylor!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underappreciated tv show of all time","review":"The typical person really confuses me.

It is nothing short of a crime that this show was as underappreciated as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arresting television is right.","review":"This has to be one the most clever shows and well acted shpws I have ever seen. The cast has an amazing chemistry with one another. And the originality is uncomparable to any other show. Why this show didn't last longer amazes me. The different characters and their storylines will have you in tears, from the nonstop laughter. I have forced everyone I know to watch this show. Its just too bad that FOX couldn't appreciate its greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Discovery","review":"I started to watch this show once it became syndicated on the G4 network. I could not believe I did not take the time to watch it when it ran on FOX. Everything about this show is fantastic, and no other show makes me laugh so hard. I can watch any episode over and over and know that it'll be worth my time. If there is one show to purchase on DVD, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Development cut too soon","review":"I love this series. I purchased seasons one and two when I was looking for a new show to get in to. I had only watched this once or twice on tv, and liked it, so I decided to try it out. Every episode is hilarious, and the actors are amazing. I am seriously upset that the show has been cancelled, and feel bad that it took me and others this long to appreciate how unique and funny this show is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Dirty Laughs. Not Some Highbrow Comedy!","review":"If you like Seinfeld of Family Guy, then you will love Arrested Developement. The show falls somewhere in the middle probably closer to Family Guy.Many people think this show is overly intellectual with snobby humor. Well, it isn't! THIS SHOW IS NOT ANOTHER FRASIER! There are plenty of dirty jokes and distasteful humor packed in each episode. One of my favriotes episodes of season 1 is Peer Pressure, where Buster gets George Michael to buy maryjane for his girlfriend Lucille. I also love Growing Up Buster and My Mother,the Car.In one of the 2 star reviews featured on Amazon, the reviewer mentioned that the main characetr's son is named George Michael and to him that wasn't very funny. However, this person obviously has not watched the show because that is very rarely ever mentioned on the show. The types of jokes made are about freeloading, sexual disfunction, prison time, alcoholism, and general family disfunction to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too smart for network","review":"This is the only sitcom I watch anymore. Just the fact that David Cross is a regular character says more than enough about the quality of the show and its humor. I caught on late so someone gave me this DVD collection and now I'm depressed that it's going to get cancelled. Oh, sure - it hasn't been announced yet, but it will happen. It's too smart for TV - especially for FOX, which only stumbles upon good content by accident. Maybe it will go to HBO."},{"rating":"2","title":"AD is now the standard by which I judge TV","review":"Unfortunately I did not discover Arrested Development until it was off the air, but it has been my favorite show since I first saw Tobias Funke dress up as a pirate using Lindsey's wardrobe.

Come back to us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PleaseWatchThisShow","review":"I was guilty of not watching this show. I purchased the DVD after hearing all of the rave reviews. Wow, TV can be fun! From the narration by Ron Howard down to the adopted Korean son, Annyong ( Hello!) this is a true gem. Please check it out before it is too late, FOX has already reduced this season's order of shows from 23 down to 18. They are teetering on the brink of extintion. FOX must have another \\"Who's Your Daddy\\" or some crap like that to air. I think they've made a BIG mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"It had me hooked from the start. Each character brings something to show, and the plot utilizes each one perfectly. It is best watched from the beginning, but the flashbacks and narration do a great job of refrencing past episodes to bring events into context. I just discovered the show, and was sad to see it lasted only three seasons, but am glad I didn't have to wait 5 years for them to bring it back!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best tv shows EVER","review":"I cannot enourage you enough to buy/rent/watch over your friend's shoulder/steal..whatever, Arrested Development. Not only is it ridiculously funny - it trumps funny with wit & intelligence. If you watch it and you \\"get it\\", you get to be an insider to the brilliant mind of Mitch Hurwitz. The fan base is huge, but this show was mishandled from the beginning by Fox...moved to different days and then different times without notice, pitifully promoted - Arrested Development even acknowledged that throughout the show. This show moves so quickly that you really need to watch each episode twice or more to pick it all up. I'm not kidding - this show is fantastic!

The show is sitcommy, but not too canned/cliched. The dialogue is funny but not spectacular - it mostly serves to give the characters personality rather than develop any in-depth plot points. I really enjoyed it, but mostly because there isn't anything else worth watching at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"Love this show. Excellent comedy. Very entertaining.

If you tuned in on the advice of a friend to Season 2 (what is going on now) and feel like it is only alright, please buy these DVDs. So much of the show is dependent on prior shows (and as you will see from Season 1, future shows as well).It will be the best 30 bucks you ever spent.--Joey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Juvenile writing, 3rd grade version of Weeds.

That is a top notch show full of laughs. I watched 2 episodes of this and didn't laugh ONCE. IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL!!! David Cross is just terrible. The script is terrible. The plot is stupid. No wonder this junk got cancelled, it is simply stupid. If you have an IQ over 100, avoid wasting an hour of your time like I did. How this got so many 5 star reviews?

It includes everything from more conventional treatments for illnesses to less conventional methods such as dietary changes and homeopathy.This book is also a great reference for parents who are unfamiliar with less conventional treatments - it gives helpful descriptions of what homeopathy and other natural methods actually are, the principles for treatment they use, and why these methods work. It is written in an easy-to-use format and really opened my eyes to alternative methods of helping my child stay healthy.The only thing I feel should be omitted from this book is the section on time-outs - I didn't buy a health book for it's parenting method, and would prefer not to be given parenting suggestions from this author. Otherwise, it's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thumbed and used","review":"Being an RN, I thought I was prepared to care for my own children--little did I know. When faced with a fever at 0300, it is reassuring to have a sane voice that might save you a trip to the emergency room. I use this book constantly for my own household and to give recommendations to friends who call me about their children. I have just one complaint--wish it came in a small, travel-sized version. It gets heavy in a carry-on bag. I highly recommend having a copy of this book and using it in discussing your children's health with your healthcare provider. I know it eased my pediatrician's mind to see that it was not a bunch of \\"hocus-pocus\\"; but a well thought out and written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Useful Book","review":"The book came in excellent shape. The information was detailed on a very wide number of areas. Provided optional treatments or care. Will be a book to refer to often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept but incomplete","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to a healthcare library, but it shouldn't be the only book in it. When my children were exposed to hand-foot-and-mouth disease, I found nothing to help in this book. On the other hand \\"Baby and Child Care\\" by James Dobson did address the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical","review":"I bought this hoping would help my daughter and my family, but was very disappointed when something really happens, I can't find a way to deal with it. Take a easy example, my daughter has this eczema and I tried to find a easy way to help her at home, but all I could find from the book are some very strange medicines that I've never heard of before.

For each ailment, it tells you different approaches and what your doctor will probably reccomend for it, then you can judge what you think is best for your child. I absolutely love this book and love the straight forward explanations of alternative and conventional treatments. So far, I have managed to avoid antibiotics by using a garlic and oil tincture in my sons ear, and I am currently studying the nutrition section. Next I want to hit the acupressure sections and learn more in this area.

As soon as I read that, it was on its way back. If the authors are so blatantly mistaken, I can't trust any of the other information it contains. I strongly recommend that you fellow parents out there give your children WHOLE milk products, unless you wish to stunt their neurological development. The brain is built with fat!

I really wanted to like this guy. Marvelous, unique, song choices. Simple, subtle arrangements. And oh, so nice on the eyes. But, that voice is just awful. Who ever told him he had the chops? The title song starts off nice enough, but once the saxophone solo shows up he has lost the show. Likewise I wanted so very much to enjoy \\"I'm Checking Out,\\" which introduced us to the fact that Meryl Streep could carry a tune, but he just massacres it. The song I most wanted to enjoy was \\"My Simple Christmas Wish,\\" but what an embarrassment that was; comparing himself to, or even half believing that he could best Streisand, well, even if she lost her voice, she'd still sound worlds better. I understand he is over six feet tall, and still quite young...maybe there is a future for him in modeling, because there certainly isn't one in singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's funny.","review":"This is hillarious.

I thoroughly enjoyed the information on the history of the breed. The book describes the breed's show standards and contains pictures of Maine Coons throughout. The book provides descriptions of the different color classes of Maine Coons, and I have not seen such a complete description elsewhere. The book does contain information on raising Maine Coons that really applies to any breed, but I put that information to good use when my first litter was on the way. The only negative I have is the price; but considering how often I refer back to this book, I believe it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"As seems to be the problem with all books about specific breeds, this one also fails miserably.

Like many Anne Margret fans this film has long been a holy grail for me. It revolves around a former Navy man (Parks) who returns to his small town many years after he left. There he meets his former High School flame (Margret) the local sex kitten who in the interim has married the local Millionaire. She works her whiles on him culminating in the afore mentioned fully clothed dip in the pool to seduce him. While not a timeless classic along the lines of say PICNIC, or RAINTREE COUNTY, the film is still mildly entertaining, and has long been high on the wish lists of fans to be released on video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, sensitive little gem","review":"While set in a specific time & place, Bus Riley's dilemma is a timeless one: how does a young, yearning, intelligent person break free of a restrictive society & its many alluring entrapments, and become an individual, following an individual path? Michael Parks delivers a rich, nuanced performance, ably supported by a fine cast. Ann-Margret is a delight as the luscious ex-girlfriend who draws Bus back into her very pleasurable web for awhile -- the film is smart enough not to make her a villain, but simply someone who has it all (or so it seems) but knows that she's still missing something from life. And both Janet Margolin & Kim Darby show why they should have had bigger careers than they did: both are fresh, believable, empathetic. Not everything is neatly tied up by the end, but new possibilities appear, and we realize that Bus may well be on his way to that individual path. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review","review":"I received this product in a timely manner. The movie was well packaged.

Her role is small, with perhaps 20 minutes of screen time, and her acting is at its histrionic worst! The story itself is all over the place, with strange incestuous/homosexual overtones that are heavily implied but never explored. The frigid school marm who is afraid of Bus' boxer shorts is the smartest one in town--she left the movie early on!

I have the 154CM blade-steel version, and it is fantastic. It came super sharp, stays that way for a long time, and is a cinch to make that way again. I can't say enough good things about this knife.

Slatkin, and the rest. This program of Vaughan Williams orchestral works is a real gem! I was familiar with the recording of the \\"Fantasia on Greensleeves\\", and desired the hear the rest of the works presented here. While I have other recordings of the \\"Tallis Fantasia\\" and \\"The Lark Ascending\\", I mainly bought this download for the \\"Five Variant of Dives and Lazarus\\" I listened to a number of samples of this work and decided that this is one of the best ones available.

Note, again, that rings are developed before groups. Having taught a course using this text as an additional resource, I do have one small issue with it. It seems that an inordinate number of problems require the results of a previous problem (or two) to construct the proof. So, if you are an instructor, pick your assignments carefully. If you are a student, look to previously-proven results from problems you may (or may not!) have been assigned to help you if you are stuck on a problem. All in all, this text provides a bit gentler approach to the material than Herstein's classic work Topics in Algebra, yet is nonetheless faithful to mathematical rigor. It also includes a nice array of interesting topics which augment the standard aspects of the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book for undergrads....","review":"This was the text used in both semesters of my undergrad algebra and I was really disappointed in it. The sequence we used was to start with rings and then into fields. During the first semester the instructor did an excellent job in making up for shortcomings in the text. The second semester (group theory) was a complete loss as I had both a bad text and a bad instructor. Joseph Rotman writes a FAR better algebra text, especially on the topic of group theory. I study algebraic topology and thank GOD everyday for Rotman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but SLOW shipping","review":"The book is in pristine condition, as promised.

I hate Sarah's cold personality and found the dialog between characters to be very calculated and unnatural.

I was an avid fan of the early GFR all the way through their first albums up to Phoenix. It was in their later albums that I drifted away. It seemed that they begin a shift from the hard rock that was their forte into the lighter \\"kid rock\\" sound. This was not my kind of music and I just drifted away. I never did understand the complete rift between GFR and Terry Knight, but think their first 6 albums their best.

Yes, there are some flaws but they are your normal \\"live\\" flaws (seems to be some feedback problems on guitar and at times they appear out of sync), but belive me, all in all a thouroughly enjoyable disc. Great song selection from that era. Definetly a disc to turn up (volume)---my first listen was at home so, I could not turn it up, and it sounded a bit muddy, then I took it to work with me and WOW, lets just say it took me a bit longer to get to work (had to take the long way).

I wished they sounded better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"This is an awesome game. It's very unique in that the courses are different from other racing games where you go around the whole track three times.

Some might call it a bit slick. I don't think so. Extremely well produced I'd say. As much as I found Mission Temple, his last CD just a tad wanting, this, to me, is pure perfection. By all means, go see Paul in person if you get the chance because you will enjoy the show. This is the CD to buy your buddies for Christmas. Buy it now. Paul will \\"make it\\" one of these days.

The chase is not in any way shape or form in the classic car chases of \\"Bullitt,\\" \\"The Seven-Ups\\" or \\"Ronin\\" The chase went on for what seemed like miles from the explosion(s) leaves you wondering why people were still running in in panic on the streets miles away(?) Poor direction and the aforementioned repetitious scenes rate this lower than low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ground Hog Day meets The French Connection","review":"This film recycles the same event over and over, each time adding a tiny plot twist burried in repetitive material. Each recycle starts with a clock dispay a la Ground Hog Day - all that's missing is the radio playing \\"I've Got You, Babe\\" and a little entertainment value. After they have recycled the same event to death and you are ready to hit the stop button if they show that darned clock one more time, they move on to a car chase that just goes on, and on, and on, as the excitement gradually fades into fatigued boredom. Do yourself a favor and skp this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's happening now!","review":"Great movie! Dennis Quaid is super. This movie shows how many people see different things from their vantage point. It also gives you an inside look as to how terrorists or any terror group works to get their job done, even to die to get their job done. Although this is fiction, there are many possiblities that could be true. The movie gives you something to think about and to be alert and aware of your surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea gone wrong","review":"This really should have been a 45 minute movie. The constant rewinding was annoying and then toward the end there were scene where you're wondering who Point of view you're looking at, because the one is should be isn't in the scene. Then one guy took that many secret service men out at the hotel? Yeah, right. The high speed car chase was most exciting part of the film. Watch at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, exciting, intriguing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for what it was: a piece of escapism; an action-adventure movie.Having read some of the other reviews, I see quite a bit of bashing for its lack of \\"realism\\". Well, \\"Star Wars\\" wasn't very \\"realistic\\", either, so I guess I don't understand that criticism.We have a single episode of political terrorism told from the varying perspectives of the participants, which I found very fresh and inventive.As we switch viewpoints, bits and pieces of the plot unfold in a creative manner. There's plenty of shoot-'em-ups, car chases, foot chases, bad guys (and politically incorrect ones, too, which was surprising), sympathy characters (a little girl in jeopardy)... the production team really covered all the bases on this one.The actors were fine in their roles; Quaid, Whittaker, Weaver, Hurt... all did good work. There were some fresh faces who also pitched in to make this movie a fun watch.I have no problems giving this a solid four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie entertainment at it's best","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

He ended up being the hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh Vantage Point no.","review":"this film is a complete mess of great chance to make an excellent movie. Vantage Point is about as exciting as watching a real bad reality show and as dull as dirty dish water . i was so bored i was about to scream most of the time and flashbacks they were overkill, maybe they could've been done in a way that wasn't so annoying. personally all i wanted was a story not a rewind all the way through whole entire film and the acting was wooden and not believable ugh--. so i'd say save your money and don't rent or buy this clunker, maybe rent but don't buy it. it's not worth any viewing time of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, horrible and waste of money","review":"Horrible movie and acting.

Strong acting, strong premise, great suspense and plot development. This was definitely one of the better movies I've seen recently. After watching it I immediately tried to use Amazon's suggestions to find something similar to download. I've never been much of a Dennis Quaid fan but this really gave me a new perspective on him.

The only issue I had with this movie was the ground-hog day like repeats of each scene (the movie shows the perspective of all the major players, so you get to watch it up until the explosion each time, then it rewinds, starts at the pre-explosion scene, and moves forward from the next person's perspective). Overall, this was an action-packed movie with never a dull moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not really worth the time","review":"Suppose you were a former member of the Spanish special forces and terrorists had kidnapped your brother.

Sigourney Weaver gives a very convincing performance as a news producer. When the reporter was knocked to the ground and appeared to maybe be dead, who was filming her for the news? Isn't there some point where the camera man must put the camera down and help out? This would have been a great movie had they simply did the thing with a plot and subplot in a chronological sequence, focusing on the character of the secret service agent, rather than play \\"Groundhog's Day\\" with it. Dennis Quaid? That was the best they could get? The flashback redo sequence served no real purpose. This would have been an even better film if a rouge Jason Bourne was the guy who came in and saved the President and then slipped out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool experimental film-making but ultimately misuses good talent","review":"Experimental films with a Hollywood budget should be encouraged and here the makers decide to tell us a story of a terrorist incident from several vantage points using the perspective of several characters. It works quite well, getting everyone's point of view into the picture, says a lot about how we witness an incident, the sides involved and works quite well for most of it, but unfortunately wastes a lot of talent to some misjudged character plot-twists that don't really gel or look good for that matter and has the leads vanishing or just standing around with a frown. The scenes with Forrest Whitaker running down a street at the same pace as the athletic bad guys for minutes on end shouldn't have us laughing either. When all is said and done though it is a good film and for all its missteps it still produces a somewhat tense thriller with a fair amount of action and a cool car chase sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"i am glad i rented this first","review":"another great cast with a terrible storyi am so glad i rented this movie and didnt buy iti dit not like this film and had such high hopesvery dissapointedthis may have been the worst action movie that i have seeni will def be not getting this movie on blu rayits def not any of the bourne moviesor even shooterthose are action moviesagain loved the casthated the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with great bonus features.","review":"Without spoiling the movie, the idea of going over the same events from several different characters separate points of view really works. It is fun trying to figure out who the good and bad guys are.The bonus feature that lets you track each characters movement as the action unfolds really lets you see the detail and effort the film makers put into trying to make sure that everything happens in the right place at the right time.The movie is 4 stars, the bonus features get it the fifth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for 1 or 2 viewings","review":"In Spain, the President of the United States is assassinated. This movie replays the story several times from the vantage point of different people. A tourist, a secret service agent, and the terrorist, are all followed through the events and we see how the story unfolds from the pieces of the puzzle they give us. This is a pretty good movie. I don't think it's one you want to take up space at your house, but it's definitely worth renting. It's suspenseful and entertaining. This movie makes me think. Why is it that most of the President's that have been assassinated didn't deserve it? Why are the one's that deserve it left untouched and loved by so many? Anyway, this is an action packed thriller that is worth watching once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLASHBACK OVERDRIVE","review":"The flashback redo from another point of view sometimes works good, if it is not overdone, like it was in this movie.

I will not rehash the plot of the film, as some other reviews have revealed too much in the way of spoilers already. Solid and enjoyable. Quaid makes his mark and shows that he still has what it takes to be an action/drama hero. I can only guess that the negative reviews came from the pro-war crowd who were expecting the type of \\"bang-em-up-shoot-em-up-kill-fest\\" that Hollywood excels at stuffing down the gullet of the ignorant masses. If that is what you are looking for, Vantage Point is NOT your film. This is an EXCITING, thought-provoking, thrill-ride without the typical dumbed-down delivery. The film flows smoothly and is not forced in any fashion. The flashbacks add to the intensity and anticipation. The movie's message is clear in the final minutes, as all the pieces fall into place.

But what I found is that they are no different than any other bottle, at least for my little one. In fact, she never spit up until she started using these bottles. And the colic didn't disappear like some people say. No one knows what colic really is and what causes it, so maybe there are different factors to it and some babies did actually get better with this bottle. I just know mine didn't.

There are to many parts to clean and they leak! I called Dr. Brown's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it. As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula. I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them. I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back@"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From These Bottles","review":"My daughter is 6 months old and we have just found out that she has feeding problems as a result of using these bottles.

They are great for formula. But due to the acid reflux her doctor started her on 1 tbsp of rice per oz of formula. She was having has a hard time sucking out the formula. It wouldn't go through the insert and it would get clogged up. So I tried to use the bottles without the insert but that caused the nipple to move and become loose and it would constantly leak. Removing the insert takes away the reason for the bottle, to help lessen colic and air bubbles. So if you are going to use this for plain formula I say go for it! Using rice, try another bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles, but flows too fast","review":"I absolutely LOVE these bottles....now that I found a different nipple for them. These bottles are easy to use and clean and definitely reduce the air in my baby's tummy. I prefer them to the Playtex drop-ins because I don't have to waste time and effort in pushing the air out like with Playtex. Unfortunately, for my primarily breastfed newborn, the Dr. Brown's nipples flow too fast and he would choke on the milk and get it all down the front of him---wasting a lot of my precious liquid gold! But I found another nipple that fits and is perfect. The Playtex Vent Air nipples work in the Dr. Brown's bottles and provide a slower milk flow. I'll just save the Dr. Brown's nipples for when he is older and wants a faster flowing milk source.Definitely recommend this bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for every baby","review":"I had a terrible time finding bottles that had a TRULY slow flow nipple, and that would reduce baby's gas.

I did notice that after I started using these bottles, my baby was MUCH more happy and had less gas and spit up than he usually had. I used those Vent-Aire garbage bottles and my son was not a HAPPY camper with them... he'd literally sweat trying to eat from them...and would take him 45 minutes or more to eat 6oz--EVEN AFTER I'd try and make the nipple hole(s) bigger. Needless to say, with Dr. Brown's bottles, he no longer strains nor sweats when he eats!! 2 drawbacks...(1)they're a pain to clean, and YOU MUST clean the inside chamber!, and (2) you must take off the nipple before heating in a microwave, else it will leak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"There is no perfect baby bottle, but these come exceptionally close.

He seems much more comfortable and I'm very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem Free","review":"We've been using these bottles for the last 7 months and I can't think of a single reason not to be using them. We tried quite a few different bottles but these seemed to be the best all around. Our daughter has never had any issues with them and cleaning them is quite easy (contrary to some reviews I have read). There are pipe cleaners and such included with the bottles that are handy. I happen to boil the nipples and the plastic rings after cleaning them just to make sure I got everything, but what parent isn't over cautious. On a side note, some people have complained about hiccups. Our pediatrician and many books have assured us that babies couldn't care less about them and that the most likely cause is that the baby isn't getting a tight enough seal around the nipple with his/her lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great For US!!","review":"When my daughter was born we tried numerous formulas thinking that this was the problem with all of her gas and spitting up.

We saw these bottles in a magazine and figured we might as well try them. They are wonderful. Our son had a few weeks of colic before we tried these. He also had reflux which caused respiratory problems and 2 trips to the ER. He has not had any of these problems since we switched to Dr Brown's bottles. He still gets gas occassionally, but it does not bother him. There are multiple parts to these bottles and the replacement nipples are harder to find than the bottles, but they are well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are plastic, NOT glass","review":"Did not mention anywhere in the product description that these are the plastic Dr. Brown's bottles, not the glass ones I was looking for. They are listed as BPA-Free but we're sticking with glass. Back they go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold Magnet- possible health hazard","review":"These bottles are terrible. Each bottle has six different parts- Cap, nipple, nipple ring, tan color rubber vent system, long transparent vent, and the bottle itself. The entire system takes really long to wash, and the vent system becomes moldy very easily regardless of how meticulously you clean it. It has a tiny wire brush with which you can presumably clean the small nooks and crannies, but that is impossible. They also stink with a putrid, moldy smell (like rotten milk) that makes me want to throw up every time I wash the bottle. My baby has developed diarrhea which I am sure is related to the mold growth. I tried using the bottle without the the complex vent system to remedy this, but the bottle just leaks like a garden sprinkler when I tried to do that. Please avoid this bottle at all costs. I am concerned that there are serious health risks with this bottle related to the mold growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Bottles","review":"I tried these bottles for my 1 month old daughter because they are supossed to help with gas. We tried both the long neck bottles and the fat bottles and both were terrible. She had worse gas than with the Avent bottles and the nipples are two soft.

I would recommed to skip buying too many 4 oz sizes and buy more if not all 8oz sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles!","review":"These bottles are a little more expensive, but they are worth it!

However, it is well worth the extra effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those who need it","review":"In the beginning, my son had a terrible time with gas bubbles in his stomach. Within a few minutes of eating, he would scream in pain. He was difficult to burp, so no help there. We tried the Avent bottles, which only made the situation worse given the odd shape of the nipples.The FIRST time we used a Dr. Brown's bottles we noticed a significant difference. In a very short time, he was no longer screaming after every meal.

My son has had bad reflex and feeding issues since he was about 2 months old. I tried every bottle that you can think of and none of them worked. Since I started my twins on the Dr. Brown bottles the reflex and the feeding issues have gotten 100% better. The bottles are very expensive but I recommend them to anyone that has issues with reflex. They even make a nipple for cereal and thick juices.

I saw them in the store while doing my shower registry and quite honestly, they looked too complicated so I didn't put them on my list...BIG mistake!I tried several other brands of bottles and this is by far the best. It does everything it claims to do as far as eliminating gas and spit-up.It isn't complicated at all and isn't anymore difficult to wash than the other bottle types. I found the slimmer design is easier for me to handle, but I would think the size of the bottle wouldn't matter as far as performance.If my husband would let me restock my bottle supply (18) with Dr. Brown's, I would be one happy lady, but that isn't going to happen!Don't make the same mistake I did, buy Dr. Brown's from the start...you won't regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does reduce Gas","review":"Although these bottles will not cure baby's gas, they do reduce the Gas significantly. When i would mix the baby's formula in regular bottles there would be a thick layer of foam bubbles (which contributes to gas & bloating). There are absolutely NO foam bubbles with Dr. Brown, no matter how long & hard you shake.There is no cure for baby's gas, because they suck in & swallow a lot of air irregardless. From our experience, we've found that a combo of these bottles & an over-the-counter liquid called Mylicon has given our baby a significant amount of relief.Note, our baby still has some gas issues, but it is no where near what it used to be, it's tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with Gas but Detailed Washing!","review":"This product did seem to help aleviate my baby's spit ups and gas, when compared to other bottles that would make my baby vomit. Just be ready to spend the extra time washing all the little parts that are inside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!","review":"Love these bottles! I'm primarily breast feeding but, when I have to use bottles, these work great. Very little (if any) air gets to baby & baby seems to have no trouble transitioning between these bottles & natural nipples. They do have a few pieces but, are easy to disassemble, clean up easily in the dishwasher & reassemble very quickly. Very durable & no leaks while drinking (although I have noticed that they will leak sometimes if they're in the diaper bag & it gets turned upside down). Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"are the best","review":"Dr Brown's bottles are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems. for the 1st 2 week I used other brands, but the bottles leaks, my baby had a lot of gas, and my baby was crying almost all the time because of the stomach aches (colico,) once my baby used Dr Brown's everything was perfect, now he only use Dr. Brown because he loves it and I love it! some reviews talk about the small parts being difficult to wash that's not true, it is just and extra work that you have to do but after a while you get used to it (and it's the best for the bb). Just don't be lazy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for gas, but leak when tilted too much.","review":"I got these for my daughter when she was born because I would have to break the suction of other bottles for the air to enter the bottle for the milk to flow, and one moment of her stopping her food made her ANGRY. So, I got these. They work great: except, if you drop the bottle and it it tilts back and forth too many times, you have to 1; have a rag handy for the horrible leaks, and 2. you have to upright it and unscrew the cap briefly and rescrew it to even the pressure. a pain definitely when holding a baby. But beside that, it is wonderful for gas.One more thing. Do NOT forget the stem inside or else she will be wearing the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"My son was 5 weeks old when we finally got smart and bought Dr. Brown's bottles. We had tried the other \\"aire\\" bottles and he still was gassy, even though he always burped well. Although my son was never colicky, he did have some gas pains evident by his crying and pulling his legs up. The Dr. Brown bottles have been wonderful and well worth the money. You have a few extra parts to clean, but the handy brush the bottles come with makes it simple. I hope I can say that these bottles have cut down on ear infections also. Our son hasn't had one yet, he is now 5 months old (knock on wood)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I was skeptical about these bottles, even though I had heard and read great things about them. My daughter had problems keeping her formula down from day one. We were using Avent bottles. We tried a new formula for her, it helped but she was still spitting up. We switched to Dr. Brown's bottles and the difference in just a couple of days was truly amazing, I was definitely sold on them. While she still spits up it's not near as frequent or as much!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Browns 3 Pack 8oz. Bottles","review":"I bought these bottles because my newborn had gas after feedings which made her have colic. The five star reviews is what sold me. When I received the bottles, I was so excited to try them. To my disappointment, there was no change with her gas. In fact, I thought she was even more cranky at times. I find the Playtex Ventaire to be more effective than these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles","review":"These were the absolute best bottles in our opinion. We tried a number of other brands and easily settled on using Dr Browns exclusively. They don't leak, the nipples never get clogged and they are always consistent in the amount of formula that comes out. Other brands would get clogged, or the formula would come out to fast for our daugher and she would end up crying and refusing to eat. We never had any problems with Dr Browns, they are a bit more expensive, but WELL WORTH it, they saved us so much aggravation. Our daugher is almost 4 months old and we have not had to replace a single bottle yet, they are still as good as the day we got them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter didnt like them.","review":"I bought these because my daughter was a spitter. She would always get to much air and spit up half of what she ate. So I bought these to try and she hated them. I have also tried the Avent and she got to much ait with those too. The ones she likes and works best are the playtex nursers. You can puch the air out so you dont have to worry about it. plus she was easier to burb. I wouldnt recommend these or avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"BPA concerns","review":"With all the concerns with BPA, we decided not to take any more chances especialy with our baby. Unlike reputable companies like REI, camel back and Nalgene: Dr Brown's is continuing to make and sell bottles made with BPA and when we asked if we could exchange our BPA plastic bottles for their glass ones the Dr. Brown lawyers sent us jargon and no exchange.THe design might be nifty but with reaserch that shows that BPA might be harmfull to adults and that Nursing moms and children should stay clear of products containing BPA it seems that the good ol' doc should pull the BPA product and either replace the product or refund the price we spent on it. We ended up buying glass Even flow bottles at Babies R Us for $4.99 for three. A small price to spend on peice of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatified - oh yes!","review":"Hello, I bought the Dr. Brown's bottles because everybody recommended them, for possible colic or gas. . . they're just great! EVERYBODY SAID. But nobody comments on the constant spilling (I actually have to make the formula with a cloth or bib around the neck of the bottle) because when you open the cap I have to be ready of a lot of milk coming out and you can NEVER leave the bottles upside down or sideways = SPILLING FOR SURE!! Also these bottles are hard to clean and maintain, if you don't dry well the inside parts by the second day they get mold!!!! And also the caps don't fit well in every bottle as the Avent bottles. So I only recommend these bottles if your baby has colic problem, otherwise use AVENT PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I breastfed my son until he was 4 months old and during the transition from breast to bottle is took us nearly 2 months to find a bottle he would eat from - he would just chew the nipples on the others. Once we tried the Dr. Brown's he took to it right away. Now, this is the only bottle my son will eat from! I love that they have so many options of replacement nipples. My son is almost 6 months old now, and he's on a stage 2 nipple, but I think that they go up to a stage 4 or 5, so we have more for him to grow in to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best bottle for my baby","review":"this is a wonderful bottle. my 2 month old no longer cranky, she hardly spits up, and she is a happier baby.forget the other bottles these bottles are a life savier if your baby is cranky and cries a lot.don't look at the price, just get its a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver!!!","review":"These bottles are great. Before my baby was born, I was told that Avent and Ventaire bottles were the way to go. That was so untrue. My son had terrible gas pains during and after every feeding. We saw the Dr. Brown's bottles and the claim that they decreased gas, so we decided to try them. I'm so glad we did. As soon as we started using them, our little one had no more problems. However, if we tried another bottle, he would get gas again. Thanks Dr. Brown for taking away our baby's pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HOPE YOU LIKE MOLD!!!!","review":"These bottles are horrible!! My son had bad gas so we tried these. They did work great for the gas, but one of the bottles in the 3-pack did not assemble correctly and leaked terribly. They also took FOREVER to clean and assemble.. not fun when you have a hungry infant crying for his food!Here's the kicker.. I boiled all the parts every day, and cleaned them thoroughly every time with the enclosed brush, but two weeks later I noticed some MOLD growing on all 3 of the beige peices. I cut open one of them and was disgusted to find a layer of brownish green mold coating the inside! No wonder he'd been having screaming episodes and started spitting up!!I felt like a horrible mother for using these bottles!If you want to prevent GAS, use Playtex nursers with Drop-in liners. They're SO much more sanitary, easy to clean, portable, CHEAPER, and prevent gas better than those bottles ever did for my son.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save yourself from colic!","review":"My 2-year-old had the worst colic. We tried special formulas, gripe water, Avent bottles, and nothing worked except for the faucet running and THESE bottles! I will never buy anything else for a newborn but these. Truly worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth all the hype","review":"Unfortunately, I was suckered in to all the hype about the Dr. Brown's bottles. I used them for 5 months and finally got so fed up with all of the problems that I bought all new bottles. The biggest problem I noticed was that they leaked after I had them in the cooler if we went out. I never filled them past the line, but they ALWAYS LEAKED when they were cold. They leaked standing upright or laying down. I'm a nursing mother and it killed me to watch my milk leaking from those bottles all the time. It was such a waste and my daughter would get milk all over her chin and neck. Cleaning the bottles was also a big pain. I really do not reccomend these bottles. I gave them to a friend who wanted to try them out. I'm much happier with the Playtex nurser bottles with the drop ins. They have never leaked and I'm not afraid to look in the bottle bag anymore when we are out!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra Work and Inconvenient","review":"I am sorry I chose to use the Doctor Brown bottles. The inserts are a lot of extra work. You can't heat the bottles up or mix the formula with the inserts in. Without the inserts they leek so I have to premake all of my formula and then pour it into the bottle. Traveling with them is inconvenient because the inserts need to go into the bottle after heating, so I have to pack them separately. They also leak on an airplane, which I found out the hard way. The inserts consist of two pieces, which make for more washing. This takes more of my time which is already stretched. My baby still spits up a lot. The bottles are very expensive. Had I not invested so much money in them already, I would start anew."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to drink from","review":"My 3 month old son was unable to get milk to come out of the nipple despite having no problems with any other bottles.

She just couldn't get any mile out of the Vent-aire and Avent bottles.She also had trouble with reflux, and these bottle helped with that too.Yes, they have many parts, but they are not hard to figure out and washed easily in the dishwasher (with a basket for the bottle parts - which I still use for her sippy cups now).I did have some same problem with leaking when the tube filled with milk, but it was minor.I recommend these bottels highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it sounds","review":"I bought these bottles because of all the great reviews.

I was just looking for a bottle with more space for formula. I hated the extra parts to this bottle..just more to clean and hassle with. I also did not like the fact that you can't shake it b/c it leaks everywhere and when you go to heat it up you have to take the nipple and all off or the formula leaks everywhere. Not very convenient when you are holding your fussy baby at 2:30am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks!","review":"This bottle leaks entirely too much!

I would not recommend these expensive bottles..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it numerous times.....","review":"Our daughter has no colicky problems nor any other related bottle problems. However, we originally used Avent bottles but wanted to try something sleeker and compact. After reviewing the minimal selection of thinner bottles at Babies r us, we decided on Dr. Brown's based upon the postive reviews read. Unfortunately, I can't give a positive review as the others have. We gave this product a fair try for two and a half months with no success at all. When it is time for feeding, it is too much work to just warm it up. In order to warm the liquid up without spillage, one must remove the nipple and other parts. When we shake the bottle to dissolve the formula clumps, it leaks and squirts all over. I really would like to continue using the bottles if I was able to solve these issues. But because my daughter doesn't have any bottle issues, it isn't quite neccessary to use complicated bottles. These must be only useful for troubled eaters....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenge(d) of Flight","review":"I have the VHS tapes from years ago when this series was first released.

Zero character development, thinnest plotline ever, stereotypes vs. actual characters, and a truly, horrendously painful russian accent.The robot, Atom, is very cool though. I would have been happy to watch more of it. They should have just cut out the \\"estranged father/son bonding\\" stuff, and just put in more robots.

This is what I wanted to see, and I got this and so much more. Academy award-worthy acting eliminates the cheese factor, and you can call it predictable, but it's more seeing-what-I-wanted-to-see.On top of all this, the robot effects are amazing.

From the muddied bass lines to the screaming guitar lines to the howling-ly cool harmonica, Big Sugar will reach into your soul and pound a smile onto your face. In an age of electronic this and computerized that these Canadian bluesmen rely only on the fact that people still want to see a cool show(it doesn't get any cooler than doubleneck guitars) and leave with a belly full of beer and a ring in the ears.

About the Temple Mount, the Tower of David, and the Siloam and Bethesda Pools. And about holy places of the Jews, Christians and Moslems.There is a section on the British in Jerusalem, which starts with Lord Palmerston's 1839 directive to the British Consul to exert friendly protection to all Jerusalem Jews, whether they be British subjects or not. It also tells of the increasing British antagonism to the Jews in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.There is also a chapter about the divided Jerusalem of 1948 to 1967, and Jordanian rule in the Eastern portion, followed by the reuniting of the city in 1967.Overall, it is a good read about Israel's capital city."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this flavoring, actually I bought several LOL","review":"I have to say I tried to like this flavoring.

Also, great action scenes!You can't go wrong with Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman, either. It was clearly good vs. evil, but those two guys can give nuance and depth to even the most basic of plot points.The Blu-ray version is clean and crisp. No pixelation even with the intense action and darker surroundings of the fighing pit and Freeman's apartment.

The song has a pulsating quality to it, which when you're dancing you can almost feel the rhythms like waves over your ears and mind. This song is not just for clubbers, either! My 6 year-old daughter finds this song irresistable as well, unable to stop herself from dancing in her seat when BURN FOR YOU is on the radio.The lyrics are not very deep, but once again the strength of this song is in it's musical qualities: smooth vocals, orchestral-like dramatic movements, strong beats, and catchy lyrics.

I've been watching this TV for about 2 months now and absolutely love it. I installed it myself and it was so easy, just plug it in, plug in your cable box and you are ready to go. The picture is crystal clear and watching HDTV on it is mind blowing. I love it that it tells you what signal it is receiving (i.e. 720i or 1080i) when you switch channels or put in a dvd. I really can't say anything negative about this tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied buyer","review":"I bought our set a little over a month ago at Circuit City. The set has performed flawlessly right out of the box.Most impressive is the picture quality. The 2 megapixel (1920x1080) 1080p image is sharp and the colors are bright and clear. HD images (from Comcast cable) are everything I'd hoped they would be. I've also observed that even standard definition rental DVDs display at near-HD quality from our Panasonic DVD player in progressive display mode.There has been considerable discussion on message boards about \\"banding\\" problems with some of the Sharp TVs in the D62U family. That was a major concern for me but I've seen no evidence of it whatsoever on our 42\\" set.Small quibbles - We frequently turn closed captions on and off. The Sharp remote control has that button under a hinged panel door that has to be opened and closed to reach it. The user manual is complete enough but organization is only so-so."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This my first HD television and I am happy.

Everything I expected and more. Unfortunately after about a week it started to experience the banding that I have read about in other reviews. I called sharp, they asked me to send about 5 or 6 digital pictures of the line and give them a couple of day to review them. Three days later I called them back and spoke with a representative who informed me tje TV was going to be exchanged and upgrade it to the LC-42D64U from the LC-42D62U that I had ordered. Because of the holiday season the shipping took a little longer than I would have liked but received my new TV in about two weeks.

I would not hesitate buying anything else from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible tv","review":"Since we bought this tv, we have had nothing but problems with it and with Sharp. During the first month, we returned it to the store due to a banding issue. During the second month, we called the company to use the warranty to return it again due to the same banding issue. They sent us a new tv which came with yet another banding issue and dark vertical lines that looked like a burn in. We called the company to use the warranty again and they decided to send us the new model(64U), which we just received. This is our 4th tv which is not a new one, but a refurbished one, that came without the correct mounting screws and without a power cord. The only thing Sharp said they could do for us was send us the cord & screws, so in the meantime we are left without a tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Picture POOR QUALITY","review":"Got my Sharp Aquos for Christmas.

This Aquos was a replacement for the first one I ordered. I ordered a 32\\" one but it arrived with a cracked screen (thank you UPS!). I contacted techforless and they said they didnt have the 32\\" model in stock anymore, so they cut me a deal with this one, which is from the same series. It took over a week to receive the new tv, so if you're in a hurry keep that in mind when getting an order through eagle service. I ended up paying about $900 for it. I have this tv in my bedroom, so it's a little too big. set up was very easy and the picture quality is superb. After hooking up my xbox 360, I couldnt get any sound to come out.

The good guys were on the side of right, and always lied for good purposes. The bad guys lied to advance their nefarious agendas.And this whole environmental apocalypse thing. Ho hum. _Sheep Look Up_ was sorta fun in that hysterical environmental sort of way.

In Kay Kenyon's world (and in our own?) we're running out of time, out of green earth, out of chances. The novel's heroine, Clio Finn, appeals to me because of an energy fueled by anger, but also because she insists on doing what she thinks is right. I enjoyed the time travel, which allows Finn a chance to see herself as future hero, and allows the reader to see her that way too, juxtaposed with the very human character we come to know throughout the novel. In a way, Kenyon allows us to imagine OURSELVES as heroes as we travel with Finn. I'm struck by the way Kenyon keeps up the momentum, and her language is wonderfully vivid and real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing First Book!","review":"Out of nowhere pops Kay Kenyon with a top shelf first book though with the imperfections of a first timer.

You whould never have old guys wretlign other old guys in matches that have already hapened 30 times before. There were some highspots in the Death Match, but not enough to cover up for the slow pace and weak action in the rest of it. THe one match I did enjoy was the Stretcher Match. THis match had four men putting on a great show using tables stretchers, and other various weapons in unique adn amazing ways.

For him to upload to the computer, all he has to do is flip out the usb and connect to the computer. NO CORDS! For less than $100, it was definetly a good investment. It is also great to tuck in your purse or shirt pocket for traveling. Nice not to have to worry about packing an expensive camcorder when traveling, and knowing I still won't miss out on taking video. I also don't have to worry about my son breaking my good camera, and I don't spend my time trying to teach him how to use this one, It is so EASY.

While recordings looked passable when viewed on the Small Wonder's tiny display, they deteriorated when viewed on any TV screen. Given the very low bit rates of these digital recordings, that's not surprising. The stair-step-edged video looked much like clips from video-capable cell phones.

Itdoes a good job, for what it's supposed to do. I dowish that it had a 4X optical zoom, but so far, I'vegotten along fine without that. I like the 'flip back'television monitor so that I can monitor the shot whenI'm taping myself talk. By the way, this camera is greatfor video blogging. With the optional SD flash card, youget over two hours of HQ video which is more than enough.Cheap alkaline batteries get gobbled up way too fast inthe thing, but lithium batteries keep it powered up andso do rechargeable batteries. It's a good little camerato keep with you when your on the go and it slips rightinto your front pocket. I like it and the sound qualityis very good. For an easy to use, tiny camera --if that'swhat you're looking for-- I'd recommend the EZ201. Some day,I'll get a more professional camera but this is all that Ineed for now and it's cheap and easy.

MXvATV:U more than fills the void.The race stategy is much more than \\"mash-the-gas\\" and go. On the hard or 100% difficulty settings you have to really work the track to get a win. Nothing like losing that 3 second lead you worked on for the last 10 laps because you got greedy and over-jumped the last berm.

Thank goodness I was able to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great so far","review":"I used this in combination with a baby food cookbook, I steam everything first, and then just run it thru the processor. I have made fruit and veggies so far, and they all turn out great. The only downfall is that the directions that come with it are very basic. They do not mention steaming anything first, and this step is necessary for your babys tummy and for it to \\"mush\\" up. It really makes the entire process very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's easy but not great for batches","review":"It is a good processor but it's just too small to really be able to do much more than nightly food processing. It's impossible for big batches and I think most of us moms who are making our own baby food are making it in big batches. I got a large food processor for Christmas last year and I'll be making this little one's baby food from that one. It's just too small!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I love this little processor. It works wonders for making formula...some powdered formulas tend to be clumpy if not mixed well this processor does away with that.

I have used this so many times to make baby food. You just boil the vegetables(or steam) and throw them in there with a little water or breast milk and mash it up easy as pie. I have also used it to make soup, pesto and other adult foods also. The only complaint I have is that food gets stuck up in the top where the motor is. But it isn't such a big deal that I would tell someone not to buy it. just keep your eye on it so there isn't too much buildup."},{"rating":"1","title":"It smokes","review":"Every time I've used it, it smokes and makes the food taste a little burned. I've tried only pulsing it for short periods, to see if that keeps it from over heating, but to no avail. If I could choose all over again, I'd spend a little more and get a small Cuisinart processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job...but has a critical design flaw","review":"This blender does a great job blending the food but the design is flawed. I can only assume that they intended to simplify use by skipping a button or switch. What you do instead is push-down the top part (motor) into the base where the blade is balanced on a metal tip. The problem is that the motor starts before the top and blade are secure. The result is two plastic pieces that aren't moving in harmony; and the gears grind down .... game over.You can make this work without the grinding of the gears only if a. you always combine the two parts perfectly or b. unplug before snapping together.In our case, my wife wasn't properly licensed and she seems to grind the gears every time :) The unit lasted about two weeks. We use an immersion blender now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so pleased","review":"I was looking forward to using this product along with my baby food making kit but this food processor seems to only be able to handle very small quantities of food. By small quantities I mean maybe 2-4 ounces at a time to be able to puree the food. I was quite disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it unless you plan on only making small quantities of food or food on a daily basis for your little one. Otherwise, it does it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working at all","review":"don't buy this product. this new model is not working at all. previous reviews were based on older model.

I've learned to be very suspicious of baby products from those places- seems like they've usually had some sort of issue and no one will buy them any more and sometimes those issues are dangerous like with this product.I think this blender is pointless. One could do much better buying a small food processor from Target or something. This Dex one is also cheaper at walmart online. This blender is weak, doesn't blend very quickly or efficiently. I'm horrified to read the reviews and learn about the plastic ring which I cannot find in mine! I guess I fed my baby plastic! Mine's been sitting in a plastic bag ready to go to Goodwill. Maybe I should just throw it away.It's a piece of junk that ends up in Ross because it's a poorly designed product. Do your baby a favor and buy a BPA free one somewhere else, and freeze your baby food in tiny Pyrex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful customer service","review":"I bought this unit and it broke right away. Bought another unit and it also broke rapidly. I checked the warranty and realized I could have it replaced. The company sent a replacement after a fuss and guess what? It broke after 4 months.

Their customer service is horrible and borderline disrespectful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Turned On","review":"I ordered this online because I couldn't find it in the stores and it arrived without a working motor.

I can't believe how well it works and purees EVERYTHING, so smooth. I used a different product and made a fruit blend and was left with chucks, seeds and pulp from the oranges. Then I put everything in this one and it was a perfect liquid blend. I won't use anything else for my baby. It's small and light weight and can't wait until my little one is older and I can try to mash up whatever daddy and I are eating. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own baby food."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Pros: good product, generally easy to rinse - some food does get stuck on lid/cover part which will take a lot more work.

The first half of the book has the colorful pictures with each letter of the alphabet identifying a concept of truth about our Creator and creation. Each letter is set to a tune so that it can be easily memorized. The second half of the book is dedicated to detail the concept connected to each letter, apply it to the lesson and provide a student activity. I am excited to use this resource and I think the kids will enjoy it as well. A caution: This book is from a Christian perspective and follows the belief of Creation, if you believe evolution is the means of our existence I do not believe you would enjoy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs color","review":"Not happy with the black and white pages. Wish it was in color like the actual book. My daughter lost interest in the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child abuse in ink","review":"I found this book in a dentist's office and ran through it in about five minutes. It seemed to me that telling little children lies about how the world is and how it works is a form of child abuse: it innoculates children against education, knowledge, and critical thinking, and thus it renders children less able to live successfully in the real world.We must all live in the modern world: trying to force one's children to live in the 3rd century by infecting them with this book does them vast harm, and it inflicts upon them a heavy burden that they will be forced to carry until they find the intellectual, moral, and spiritual strength to shrug off in their adult years.In order for children to grow up and complete in the world, they must have basic skills including how to think. This book is an ugly attempt to undermine that skill. Worse, we must compete in the global market if our society is to survive: teaching children occult-based lies is a danger to society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one","review":"In my opinion this is THE Emperor concerto to buy. Kovacevich has another Emperor concerto available through EMI with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, but this one is every bit as vital, and the set is a bargain to boot. The playing is very exciting, detailed, and brilliant. I could go on, but it deserves every praise. The sound quality is astounding for 1969, and Davis and the LSO were in one of their vintage periods. The other works here are recommendable too, particularly the violin concerto. But don't miss this Emperor."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Star Cast.","review":"Stephen Kovacevich is superb.

You can get 'em fast/slow, historic/modern, straight-up/self-indulgent...What this one is ... just wonderful. Krebbers was the longtime concertmaster of the Concertgebouw. This performance almost feels like a labor of love from the orchestra and its conductor for an esteemed colleague. The tuttis are noble, Krebbers' playing is warm and truthful to Beethoven style. The pacing is middle of the road--fast enough to keep things moving but not frenetic a la Heifetz.This recording got many positive reviews when it came out in the 1970s, and it deserves praise now. It would be hard to do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled \\"Dodging the Bear\\"","review":"This book is all about avoiding bearish turns in bull markets, and not, as the title claims, about profiting from bear markets.While the first half of the book is full of substantial and enlightening advice about reducing risk in bull markets, Harding offers only a meager 10 pages or so of light commentary on tools for profiting in down markets, namely short-selling and put options.Having introduced short-selling and put options, he quickly abandons the subject, with barely a word of advice on how long to hold a short position, and not one word of guidance on executing an options trade.If you want to learn how to avoid bear turns in bull markets, this book is worth the price.But if you want to learn how to execute profitable options trades and short sales in a bear market, you won't find this book helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extravagantly beautiful playing","review":"This recording of Verklarte Nacht is very lush almost too much so but it shows a side of the work that was undeniably there.

If anyone thinks we live in an intensely polarized political climate now, pick up this book. The most enlightening aspect of Foner's work, however, is in relation to how much scholarship on Reconstruction has changed. As an interesting exercise, read Claude Bowers' The Tragic Era, then W.E.B. du Bois' Black Reconstruction in America, then Foner's Reconstruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another lineage feed the crow?","review":"This is an extremely penetrating, yet low key, history of the reconstructed history of Reconstruction, rescued from the legacy of massive distortion in the century-old genre, beginning in the birth times of Jim Crow and the loss of the hopes of the 'second American Revolution'. All one can say is that it might have been worse, the Union might have sundered. The book details all the phases, good and bad, from the birth of the Klu Klux to the great depression of the seventies, and the loss of focus on the task to be completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of what is wrong with academic history today","review":"Eric Foner's Reconstruction is an example of what is wrong with academic historical writing today. It is overwritten, under-edited, and it in no way provides an adequate synthesis of the period. It, therefore, fails to promote a better understanding of the period for anyone without a fair amount of previous knowledge of this era."},{"rating":"1","title":"History or politics?","review":"I was extremely disappointed in Foner's book. Historians are supposed to do extensive research to discover as many facts as they can. Then they are supposed to attempt to resolve inconsistencies and conflicts in their research, before they finally weave together their \\"version\\" of what they believe happened and why. Unfortunately, many modern historians jump to a conclusion and only research and report on those facts which support their conclusion. Foner belongs in this camp.This is not a history of reconstruction. Instead, it is Foner's \\"essay\\" on what he would want us to believe. I would not read it. If you desire a better version, with a black bias, on the reconstruction era, read WEB Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk. It is as accurate at the turn of this century as it was about the turn of the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corruption was good for the American soul?","review":"Eric Foner once again displays his bias in yet another revision of history, this time the Reconstruction Era. Foner ignores the abuses wrought by corrupt politicians and a military regime determined to wreak vengeance on former Confederate States, and the many violations against ordinary southern citizens.In Foner's mind, Reconstruction was a benevolent institution that did everything possible to advance race relations and institute equality (then why did black women not get the vote along with black men?) in the racist south. Never mind that slavery had also existed in the north, and that racism was just as prevalent in the Union States.Whatever your view of history, one cannot argue that this work breaks no new ground and doesn't tell even the pro-Reconstruction camp anything that they didn't know before. Unfortunately it will likely prove popular in today's oh-so-politically-correct history classrooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reconstruction History from a Yankee Prespective","review":"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877 is heavily biased against the South. Yankees have been writing and rewriting southern history since 1865, with disastrous consequences for the truth.From 1973-1982, he served as a Professor in the Department of History at City College and Graduate Center at City University of New York.Foner earned his B.A., summa cum laude, from Columbia University in 1963, a second B.A. from Oriel College, Oxford, as a Kellett Fellow in 1965, and his Ph.D. in 1969, under the tutelage of Richard Hofstadter at Columbia.Jack Foner was blacklisted in colleges and universities in the United States for nearly 30 years after declining to discuss his political preferences with a government committee.One with such biased views of the South cannot write an objective history of Reconstruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know the time while you sleep","review":"The whole idea of a projection clock seemed a bit silly to me. After using this clock, I am hooked. It is easy to tell the time on the cieling. It also helps me sleep better, because I don't have to turn over to look at a clock on my nightstand. I also like the fact that this clock tells me the temperature and humidity outside.It just works great! In fact, when I travel, I miss having it!The only change I wish they made to it is giving more adjustments on the projection pivot. Sometimes people will straighten my night stand and change the location of the projected image without knowing it.Also, I wish the clock had a superbright mode to adjust the projected image with the lights on. Those are just wishes though. It is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"The author, Andrew McGlinchey, tells the story from the point of view of the main character Shamus Broderick. Broderick and his buddies experience twists and turns throughout the book that are truly fascinating. Hotty Toddy starts out tragically, but the novel has an upbeat and jovial conclusion. As the reader progresses through the tale, he begins to understand the amazing bonds of friendship that the characters have with one another. These unbreakable bonds, especially by Shamus, help each character grow from wild and somewhat misguided to successful upstanding citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Enemy But Time","review":"Mr. Harris again Uses Savannah, GA. as his back ground combining fact and fiction, using some characters from his previous work \\"Delirium of the Brave\\".

OK, Homes doesn't like LA, and for the same reasons many don't. But she's the novelist, and she's the one who got asked to write the book, OK? That's no reason not to like it. What's far more revealing, though, is that Homes apparently had no idea of where to go in this book or how to organize it, so she just kind of jumps all over the place, even going to a first-person interview format in places, which is pretty disjointing to the reader. The other thing is that, upon reading this, you understand that Homes is nearly as neurotic (some would merely say nuts) as a lot of the characters in her books. Her abberations and just plain weirdness are right out there, and, unfortunately, they're nothing to be boastful of.She talks about the hotel as if it's a sacred place, when all it is is another exorbitantly overpriced LA hotel that has a tad more charm than some others.AM, stick to fiction.

The only mystery was how the author has gotten 25 books published! It seems like a Yuppie's dream come true - a detailed account of everything the protagonist eats in snooty restaurants.Except for a few minimal attempts at hinting that something is amiss, there is no plot that I can find (another mystery!).

They involved the characters in the plot, they had more than \\"Hi, how are you\\" conversations and were more than cardboard cutouts. As a fledgling mystery writer it is very disheartening to see such \\"slock\\" sold to the public. If this is a ghost writer maybe I should apply for the job. I know I could write a better mystery. \\"The Cat Who..\\" books are thin anyway, but this book was made up of excerpts from Qwill's book which had little to do with the so called murder mystery plot. Believe me I will never spend hard earned money for another in the series. I won't even let it take up room on my library shelf. This book goes to the used book store in trade for something worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rumor of a ghost writer will persist with this one!","review":"I'm afraid the \\"Cat Who...\\" series is on a downhill slide. Although a quick read, this 25th title was flat & unmysterious. We know the villain practically from the get-go, and the story lacks the usual subtle clues building up to the ultimate solving of the crime. Come to think of it, there wasn't even much of a story! Major events like the fund-raiser are given short shrift, & important details such as Polly's leaving the library are glossed over. The characters, whom we know so well from the previous books, are one-dimensional. For that matter, where ARE they all? Chief Brodie barely makes an appearance, & then only as a bagpiper, and his classy daughter, Fran, has suddenly become a snobby lush we don't recognize. This can no longer be considered a mystery series which leads me to ask \\"Who wrote this book?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bland at best","review":"While I love the early \\"Cat Who\\" books, I'm not sure why I continue to read the series. In the past few books, the mysteries have been transparent and character development slow. This is no exception. Nothing really happens. The new characters aren't interesting or personable enough to make an impact on Pickax or the reader. There's no real mystery--a couple of yowls from Koko and a dead body thrown in at the end. The liberal use of exclamation points in the prose doesn't make up for the lack of action in the story. If you need a Qwill fix, borrow this one from the library. Better yet, go back and read one of the first ten books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to wrap it all up...","review":"When the editor misses two entire pages where the writing lapses completely into first person and then reverts back (and it was not within Qwill's journal entry) and with so many meaninless forays that seem to be gratuitous for sentimentality's sake, I hate to think of where this series is heading. IMHO, this series reached its peak with \\"The Cat Who Moved A Mountain\\" and \\"The Cat Who Wasn't There\\" and has seriously declined in plot and writing quality over the last four books or so. I was a major fan of Qwill and his world, but I have to say, sad as it is, that I just don't care much anymore. The fire has gone out and this book has helped douse those flames. I am not even finished with it yet...I have about 1/4 of it yet to go, but I already see where this is going. It's not quite as meaningless as the last book, but it is quite close. The substance in this story seems superficial, and I am going to have to fight to finish this off."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has no plot!","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio book and waited patiently for SOMETHING to happen, but all I got was Q having lunch with this person or that person, someone redecorating, Polly changing jobs, and the planning for a fund-raiser. I eventually realized that this is not a murder mystery like the other books, but rather the story about everyday life in a small town where people do very uninteresting things. If I were to abridge it, I would leave out everything except side 8 of the 8-sided tape set. That is the only part where anything happens at all. And even that is not very interesting.Oh yes, and Koko and Yum-Yum are virtually absent throughout the entire book.The earlier \\"Cat Who...\\" books really did have a plot that began in the beginning and threaded through the story. This book (like the last one) has dispensed with plot altogether...I have been a devoted reader, but recent trends indicate that this series has run its course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This is a sickingly incipid \\"book,\\" a complete waste of time.

The whole book seems to be about accumulating material for Qwilleran's Short and Long Tails. Koko and Yum Yum no longer play important roles and have been banished to acting like cats instead of the intelligent cat Koko used to be. I am beginning to wonder if someone other than Lillian Jackson Braun is writing these books. Please, more Koko, less Qwilleran and Polly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is my first (and last) venture into \\"The Cat Who...\\" series. I enjoy cats and thought it might be an amusing tale. I wasn't expecting any great piece of fiction. But this was bad fiction. I felt it had no point, no purpose. The author fails to expand on the important parts of the book like its plot and ending. Instead she spends too much time describing the cuisine. It seems to me the author has an obsession with food and cats. There's nothing wrong with either, but in this book they aren't woven into a story that's interesting, engaging or even amusing. After reading it I was angry that I'd wasted my time and money on a story with little redeeming value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Q and the Cats He Adores....","review":"If you've never read any of Lilian Jackson Braun's \\"The Cat Who\\" Series this is probably not the one you should start with. Ms. Braun's earlier books were much better or is it because I've become so comfortable with the series. I continue to read each book because I love Moose County, Pickax and the characters. Unfortunately, this book was very predictable. I don't read these books expecting a serial killer and I find it very refreshing to read about characters that have become like old friends over the years. I would definitely recommend this series for teen readers. Good, clean wholesome reading with enough mystery thrown in to keep the reader's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait for #26, They Just get Better with Each Outing","review":"Qwill thinks the Lockmaster Ledger is trying to pull the Moose County Something's leg....but the lead story about the diva turns out to be true and this leads Qwill, Koko, and Co into another thrilling adventure.

I would highly recommend this and her others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet but dull","review":"If you are looking for a mystery this is not the book you want to read. This is more of a soothing story to put one in a comatose state of sorts. In a weird way it was relaxing to read but there is not much plot, no action, no investigation as such and, 2 days after you read it, Koko's persuits will fade from your memory. Go back to the older books -- they are much more lively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun's back to writing well.","review":"I really enjoyed THE CAT WHO BROUGHT DOWN THE HOUSE, and I consider it one of her best, especially one of the best of her recent ones. Most of the book is a pleasant visit with the inhabitants of Moose County. The mystery is really only a side note, but it's still fun. The early books in this series were SO good, and later the plots seemed to be phoned in, but she's back in form here."},{"rating":"1","title":"An era has ended","review":"While I deeply respect Ms. Braun and have so greatly enjoyed the wonderful characters she brought to life in the Cat Who series, it now seems painfully obvious that she now has little if anything to do with the actual story developments in the newest entries in this series. And what is worse is that apparently no editors are available to clean up the writing, punctuation, and grammar in what is being published. Even when past plot lines were easily deciphered, the dialog among the many characters and the antics of Koko and Yum Yum were more than sufficient to make the read very enjoyable. Alas that is not true in this entry and the rapid attempt to close out the last chapter is the most disappointing of all. Perhaps it is time to allow the era of entertaining mysteries in Moose County to end and not drag the memory down with inferior editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fun, but not really a mystery.","review":"If you love Qwill and Pickax, it's a wonderfully fun story, but not much of a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery to this mystery","review":"Same lovable characters.

If I had, I wouldn't have bought this! There is no central peg; each disk stacks on top of the other (very loosely) lego-style. The small red disk is too small; I won't be giving that piece to my daughter until she's much older (at which point the toy will probably no longer be interesting). Returning things is a hassle, and I think she'll enjoy chewing on the larger disks, so I'll keep it...but I wish I hadn't purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"paint rubbed off","review":"I was shocked when we recieved this toy.

This book is also very well-written. I've also read The Little Friend, which is good, but this is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short review","review":"This will be short, but to the point. This book was one of the best I've read in my life. Just as the blurbs describe: chilling, enthralling, and so well written. I tried to skim a little at the beginning but found it impossible to do. What a piece of writing and I can't remember how I came across it or why I ordered it. I'm on to find out what else this talent has written and I hope her subsequent books are as enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotioanl, dramatic novel of friendship, love and murder","review":"An intriguing first novel about a group of college friends whose love of Greek classicism (and a greatteacher) leads to murder. While many critics have found this book pretentious, I found the charactersinteresting and well drawn. In fact, the charcters are the most interesting part of the book. The murderthat occurs and what leads up to it is less interesting than getting inside these characters heads. Readthis for a well-written look at five people and a look inside their heads as they go through a terrible yearin college. If you're looking for a good mystery however, look elsewhere. This is a character study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dostoevsky, True, But What Is?","review":"To the below review that states that this novel is not a Dostoevsky, I respond: what (written withing the past 75 years) IS? Nada. I consider myself a serious (if slightly young) reader, and I can tell you that this is in fact a good book. The characters are fascinating. Maybe I have a biased opinion because the characters were exactly my age, but I hope not. I respected the book's hypnotic style and complex, flesh-and-blood characterizations. I've never read a 500-page book so quickly, and even though this book would probably not make my top ten list, it would definitely make my top twenty. I don't think The Secret History petends to be something it's not, either. It is a psychological mystery. And I thought it was fascinating, and very, very touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many books do this to me...","review":"My girlfriend lent me this book to read on our holiday, and I think she regretted it - I ploughed through it not once, but twice, turning from the last page back to the first without a pause. Maybe one book in a hundred makes me do that. Sure this book won't satisfy everyone, as certain other reviews here make plain; written no doubt by readers who move their lips as they read, and whose knuckles drag on the ground as they walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vividly remember it after nearly 8 years","review":"I was awe-struck by this book when I first read it when it was published in 1992. (I now realize I own a first-edition that could have value someday!). I'm suprised now to learn two things. Number one is Donna Tartt herself. Why has she not written any thing else? The other is that the reviews are so obviously one-sided. It's either a one star rating or 5 stars with only a few with any ratings in between. It seems to be definitely a take or leave it kind of book. For me it was a \\"take it\\" kind of book. It was of the few books I still remember too much of to bother reading it again just now. But believe me, I will be reading it again someday (in paperback, however, to protect my first edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"who cares?","review":"I spent several nights reading this novel, which has been touted as being brilliant...... And now that I've finished it, I consider those nights wasted. Who cares about any of these characters? They are the epitome of spoiled college kids who spend most of their time drinking and using drugs and the rest of their time thinking how intelligent they are. The main character hates his parents, hates his hometown, hates everything about his life until he gets to college and then he finds a group of people he can spar with intellectually. In the end they are all insane or dead and Richard lives on, still hating everything. The references to classical lit were great, if a little too, too....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable bores","review":"I kept waiting for a real plot to emerge. Spoiled, self involved, drunken college kids accidentally kill someone and then spend the next 300 pages simpering about being found out. I don't care how smart they're supposed to be, I found them all to be insufferable bores."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow, tedious read","review":"A friend recommended this book. I do not know why. My opinion: I found it to be a slow, tedious read, mainly because it contains many detailed descriptions about people, settings and situations irrelevant to the story - what I consider \\"filler\\" and a waste of the reader's time. I think the book could have been much shorter. Furthermore, the characters and plot were never believable. A college student helps new friends hide a murder with which he had no involvement, and then helps those friends commit another murder to help ensure the first murder - again, one in which he had no involvement - is not revealed. The author uses her characters to display her knowledge of language and literature. I guess she had to use it for something.No, I've never written a book and I probably never will. And, yes, it's easy to criticize someone else's work. Still, I did not enjoy reading this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While this book at first seemed to have promise, I was increasingly disappointed and felt, near the end, that I had to finish it because I already had invested considerable time, not because I was enjoying it. In the end you really don't care for any of the characters and some even seem unnatural as do some of the situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I kept waiting for this book to get better. Though it is easy-to-read, it never did get better, not in all the 524 pages. I spent a majority of the book waiting to find out why the murder happened. And then the reason, when we finally got to it, was unbelievable. I get tired of authors trying to get us to sympathize with immoral behavior. And to expect us to believe that out of a group of such educated kids no one would do \\"the right thing\\" is tiresome. These were college kids who got sauced and pilled up hoping for some fantastic experience and then killed someone. Studying the Classics certainly didn't enhance their moral reasoning. There were interesting tidbits (disconnection from families, sibling incestual relationahips) which could have been explored to help us understand the characters more, but I guess she just couldn't find the space in this tome. When I finished this book, my last reaction was \\"Huh? That's it? Well, I'm glad this is over.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"banal","review":"It is very difficult to understand the enthusiasm this novel has generated. One can see what Ms. Tartt is trying to do here, but it is all a huge, unconvincing, cliche-ridden stretch. The main characters are suffocatingly self-absorbed, the theme amoral, the approach irritatingly mannered, and the snobbishness excruciating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that good","review":"Boy, was it hard labor getting through this book. First off, there is a lot of fluff in the book. Nothing seems to happen for the most part. To be honest, I really don't often read books of this ilk. However, I had thought that this would be a good page-turner, but it wasn't. After about six pages of reading I would stare down at my fingernails to see if they needed trimming or stare aimlessly out the window.Secondly, I really just didn't like the characters in the book. They all seemed to be just pompous ingrates who thought they were a lot smarter than they were. If I saw them at a party I would be forced to throttle each and ever one. In the end, there just seemed to be nothing redeeming about those people.All in all, pretty crummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: windbag at work","review":"Nil desperandum est. This book is to mystery novels what Alma is to Gustav...better Xenophon to Themistocles. The very cornucopia fed to Incitatus; cui bonii optimii. Tartt is not one to wear her erudition lightly. Sophomoric quotes from Goddard to Suetonius to Chesterton leap from the pages to illuminate the most banal of thoughts. This is a book where you are in suspense until page 1. The following 600 serve to add luster to the one-dimensional characters until they arise, chrysalis like, into fully-fledged two dimensions. Some hostile reviewers believe that Tartt merely loaded the Oxford Dictionary of quotations into a blunderbuss and picked up the pieces in random, eulogizing one per half page. But that would be scurrilous and beyond the enmity of Agrippina equal, forse qui, to the misogyny of Polonius.If you like this review, you will love this novel. Otherwise, stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored out of my wits","review":"I really had wanted to like this book - but it was way too boring - way too slow and waaaayyy too verbose (drivel -minute by minute endless details of walking, eating, drinking, smoking, etc. etc. ad nauseum). Plodded along, no action, no intrigue, no mystery and unsatistactory ending. I kept asking myself why I was reading it when I have 10 other potentially great and gratifying books to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh grow up!","review":"I was more than a little annoyed with this book. I have spent a lot of time on campuses and among academics and Donna Tartt confirms what I've come to believe about that environment: it's unhealthy, ingrown, and it breeds narcicissism like nobody's business. The main character is about as unsympathetic as they come, rejecting parents notwithstanding (maybe they had their reasons now that I've gotten to know him.) The characters that flutter around him are even less appealing. I wanted to reach into the pages of the book and snap my fingers in their pinched little faces. \\"Wake up!\\" I would have said. \\"You are not the center of the universe.\\" I've read other books by Tartt and found them to be engaging and meaningful. This one asks the reader to bear with the characters' self-obsession for hundreds of pages. I quit about two-thirds of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is Incredible!","review":"No other book keeps me awake at night. I've read this book 3 times and every time I dream about it at night and it's all I think about. I hope every person who likes to read reads this book. It may change your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring and tedious","review":"For the first time in my life, I could not finish a book. It was that bad. I tried; I even took it on a plane to force myself to read it. It is so boring I decided to look out the window for six hours instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most over-rated books ever","review":"Not suspenseful, not involving, and definitely not interesting. Basically, not any of the million things that its slobbering fans describe it as."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the next book by this author","review":"I read this book shorty after it came out 6 years ago. Thought it was a great book. Have been waiting for another book by this author. Will she keep us in suspense much longer like her first book ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An amateur effort","review":"I read this book because I had enjoyed her second book, \\"Little Friend,\\" despite its clumsy ending. I found this book to be amateurish, e.g., using an \\"Epilogue\\" at the end of the book to wrap up story lines involving minor characters...even though these characters were unnecessary to resolution of the main plot. Her characterizations were more like caricatures, describing (endlessly) the smoking and drinking habits of her characters, giving the rich protagonists excessively foppish ways. Annoyingly, there wasn't a single character I actually LIKED. All were venal, shallow, nitwits with no moral character whatsoever. Not even flickers of conscience for some very bad conduct. Finally, the plot was ludicrous in that (no spoilers here) the police were incapable of discovering who committed the crimes, even though there were clues everywhere. Like, \\"Little Friend,\\" there is a simplistic ending that does not coincide with the internal logic of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it & began again at the beginning.","review":"I hadn't heard of this book when I began reading it. My best friend sent it to me -- & cemented that best friend slot. It's an excellent book. I read it, neglecting the other parts of my life, and immediately began again at the beginning.I don't usually read books written by women; Tartt managed to write literature that goes beyond gender stereotyping. Will be ordering copies to pass on to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The closest thing to a perfect book I've read in a long time","review":"This book is simply mindblowing. The phrase \\"it will chnage your life\\" is often over used, but it fits this book perfectly. This is not to say that you'l drop your life and head to New England to study Greek, but you'll look at the world differently as you read the book. Think of the money you spend on it as an investment. I read it at least once a year and pass it on to my friends. Read it on a cloudy winter day and you can see yourself shivering in a warehouse with Richard. A brisk fall day and the leaves literally crackle under your feet.After I read the book I found myself identifying my friends as Bunnies, Henries, Richards, Francises, Charleses, and Camillas. If you finish this book and don't drop your jaw in amazement you've done something wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to forget this book.","review":"I know I shouldn't have even started the book. Having said that, I started it anyway, became curious as to how it ended, and did finish the book. I guess the talent of the author is that she drew me into the book and I wanted to see how it ended so I kept reading. To me, this book focused on all that can be dysfuntional in our society...and that was about it. I was disappointed and saw nothing positive that came to any of the characters throughout the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I never finished","review":"This book was the first that once I started it I failed to finish reading it. The plot intrigued me at first. What could have been a good book made up of interesting characters and unpredictable plot twists, became a chore to read because the author was too verbose. At first her description of everything made for an interesting and highly developed story. However, when she continually described the most mundane acts in no less than ten lines a piece I was no longer interested. I found myself trying to skip the verbiage and find the meat of the book. In the end I put the book down and never returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, stimulating book!","review":"Fascinating and a creative morality tale on every level! Great analysis of the light and dark present in every human being. Claire Stanard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret History","review":"The best book I have read in ages and the first I read by Donna Tartt. Her second book was not nearly as good which was disappointing. With the right actors the Secret History could be a block buster...Gynneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Matt Dillon. Hurry and cast it before they get too old to play the roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper!","review":"I received this book as a BOOKCROSSING.COM release. While the cover makes it look like a romance novel (it's NOT) and the title's totally forgettable this is one of my favorite books of all time. I will be buying a copy for my own library very soon!The author makes you feel as though you've been welcomed into the characters' inner circle. I enjoyed it cover to cover and enjoy thinking what the characters may have done after the story ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!","review":"This book is so descriptive it makes you feel as though you're sharing the experiences. Every page, infact every word that you read makes you want to read on. It isn't you're typical murder mystery - it's well, worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring + Pretentious = Waste of Time!","review":"This book was loathesome. I haven't hated characters this much since suffering through a Whit Stillman movie. I was begging and pleading for some calamity to befall the entire cast. Hey Donna, did they teach you how to write an ending in Creative Writing 101?"},{"rating":"1","title":"author's crime, readers' punishment","review":"I was attracted to Donna Tartt's novel \\"The Secret History\\" by the prologue's punchline: \\"This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.\\" Now I wish that were strictly true.Ms. Tartt attempted to write a modern version of Dostoevsky's classic in the style of Richard Farina. It's an interesting premise that fails entirely because she can't construct a vaguely convincing facimile of the male persona.The major characters (six stupid and corrupt rich-kids and their equally shallow professor) are uniformly effeminate and unimaginative. They are contrasted with various stereotyped fools and establishment stooges. If you stick with the book, you will find yourself hoping for a proper punishment for each of the characters. But no, they all achieve a proper post-modern salvation in the warm afterglow of their burned out brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and boring","review":"This book is way too long. It just drags on and on and on about uninteresting annoying characters. The narrator, Richard, is a dork. How is it that he comes off as such a dork and yet makes friends with this so-called elitist group? Throughout the book Richard brings up little tid bits that are unnecessary to the storyline. He gives about a paragraph of insight but then just drops it and there is no relation to the story. So what is the \\"secret\\" of this book? There is none. In the opening pages we find out a murder has occurred and the rest is just boring details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erudite, stylistic, but in the end not credible and boring.","review":"Agree with earlier reviews that said characters are one-dimensional and 'cartoon-y'. No emotional investment created in the narrator. I'm generally dubious of female authors writing male main characters and vice versa, and the reason for that is born out here - the main character comes off, if not feminine, a bit asexual, further damaging his believability. Too much style, not enough substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely absorbing, but wordy","review":"I was skeptical when I picked up The Secret History, but after a few pages I was in love with the story, the characters, and the suspense. Couldn't put it down, cried at the end. The story telling is never concise, though: descriptions seem drawn out and at times pointless, but it wasn't really a big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring.","review":"This book was just far too long for the little it achieves. The characters all seemed two dimensional, the plot plodded along to the extent that I found it difficult to focus and concentrate and was always wondering if I was missing something.I kept asking myself why was D Tartt going into this much detail. And I couldn't believe one review I read that suggested that if you don't like the book then you're stupid. No, if you don't like the book it's just because you're too bored reading it to take it all in. I just wish I'd given up after a hundred pages of it instead of wasting so many more hours of my life, but I persisted because I hoped foolishly it would pick-up. I have to say the best thing about the book was the very attractive D Tartts photo inside the back cover. I would advise people to look at that and ignore the print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They said to read this book and they were right","review":"More than any other fiction book, I've been advised by many to read this book. It was a joy to read as it allowed me to suspend disbelief and enjoy the charaters and environment. Also, this is the way to go through college - sufficiently academic but with a social life to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good character development, poor structure","review":"This book is ultimately disappointing due to the author's failure to maintain dramatic tension. Tartt gives away the main climax in the Preface. The reader immediately knows what will happen, and knows before long why it happens, then has to watch it slowly unfold. A later dramatic moment is unsuprising despite being (it seemed to me) incongruous with the character, and it comes largely out of the blue - nothing leads up to or follows from it.Some other reviewers' comments that I agree with: easily 200 pages overlength, feels like the 1950's, while it purports to be in the 1980's (I think), and the ease with which the students slip into their murderous behavior is simply not believable. The characters are quirky enough to be interesting, yet still believable and sympathetic, but the plot line is not credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply fantastic","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I forgot to eat and go to school while reading it. The characters all have their individual backgrounds and motives, which makes their interaction so fascinating. If I would recommend only one book, it would have to be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!","review":"This is my very first review for Amazon.com- prompted by that horrible Kirkus thing! I rarely read current novels- but I loved this book. I absolutely could not put it down or stop telling everyone I knew about it. Where is Donna Tartt now?The only other recent novel I felt the same way about was Posession by A.S. Byatt- so probably if you liked Possession, you will enjoy this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Live Up To The Hype","review":"I picked up this book with great expectations after all the glowing reviews and personal recs from many of my friends. I do not know if I expected too much, or if this book is simply not what it is advertised to be. The premise I found fascinating, and yet I feel that Donna Tartt did not do as much with this novel as she could have. She relied too much on detailing the immoral lifestyles the core characters led, and shied away from delving more deeply into a psychological analysis of how each of the main characters changed after Bunny's murder. Parts were also somewhat unrealistic, as I did not buy how easily Richard Papen was manipulated by Henry et al, and the ridiculous amount of alcohol and drugs that the students consumed would have made it difficult to ever think straight, much less thrive in their studies. Overall it was mildly entertaining, but I found myself struggling to finish the last third of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring story","review":"My best friend Iris recommended this book to me when it was just published a few years ago and I was fascinated, because it was set in New England(and I love New England). I read 100 pages and was about to give up. Nothing was happening in the book. Usually I love reading thrillers/mystery novels, but this one never really started. Iris calmed me down and persuaded me to read the next 100 pages which I did. The story didn\`t change - absolutely nothing happened. To please her, I read the book until page 300, then I finally gave up and sold the book on a flea market. I guess, the best mystery novels have been written until the seventies(I loved \\"The little Girl who lives down the Lane\\" by Laird Koenig which is from 1975) and before, but I don\`t remember a real thrilling book from the eighties or nineties set in New England. Or is there anybody out there who could recommend one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"She took ten years to write this?!","review":"BORING, pretentious, and a waste of paper, is the best way to describe this tome. The characters are shallow, self-centered, annoying drunks who fail to generate any sympathy. They are all so sure of their own superiority, sort of like the writer. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious tripe. Good for kindling though.","review":"It's a while since I read this book but the disappointment stays with me still.I read Tana French's 'The Likeness' and, putting ridiculous plot aside, quite enjoyed it. Some reviewers said it was a direct copy of The Secret History and that this was much the better novel.I did at least like some of the characters in The Likeness; to me, the first rule of writing a novel is MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS LIKEABLE. I detested all of them in The Secret History. I didn't care that one of them was murdered; I hated him as well. I hated the professor and I hated the references to Greek; it didn't make it more high-brow, just more boring. I have never felt so much like I wasted a day of my life than when I'd finished this. I thought it would be beautiful but it was b******s.Her other novel was b******s too. I didn't even finish that one. Please, read 'The Likeness' is you are into strange, antisocial groups of students; it does at least chug along at a fair pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! An A+ Thriller!","review":"I am a highly critical reader, but this book gets an A+ with extra points awarded for well crafted writing and a genius for creating a thriller with an unusual plot!Donna Tartt's style is transporting--her scenes anre so real, that they draw the reader into the book--start reading and you'll feel as if you are right there yourself.As I read it brought to mind A Separate Peace, Lord of the Flies, and a bit of Catcher in the Rye. I was sorry when the book ended, but I will pass it on to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written character study of college kids & murder","review":"An intriguing first novel about a group of college friends whose love of Greek classicism (and a great teacher) leads to murder.While many critics have found this book pretentious, I found the characters interesting and well drawn. In fact, the charcters are the most interesting part of the book. The murder that occurs and what leads up to it is less interesting than getting inside these characters heads.Read this for a well-written look at five people and a look inside their heads as they go through a terrible year in college.If you're looking for a good mystery however, look elsewhere. This is a character study."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Be Able To Put This One Away","review":"The narrator, Richard Papen, has just started college in Vermont. Interested in Greek classics, he begins his courses with five other students. But something is tying this small group of intellectuals together. Roumors are all over school, but Richard will soon become a part of their secrets, too. The book opens with quite a suspensful air--a student is pushed off a small cliff by his friends. And that's only the first two pages! The Greek classes themselves are quite interesting. The students discuss ancient Greek and Roman culture/history. Overall, the book is filled with twists and thrilling suspense scenes that keep you reading to the end and wishing Tartt would come out with another novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell burped up a book","review":"I just read 579 pages of this aimless prose. Where do I go to get my time back?Peopled by six amoral, half-drunk fools, this trendy cocktail tells of two incoherent murders (motivated by what again?) and the circumstances surrounding them.

If this hadn't been my book club selection for this month, I would have sent it back to the library. I've read classics, and this ain't one of them.

Donna Tartt is so blanantly obvious in all of her literary techniques that one can not help but feel insulted in her obviously low opinion of all of society. Perhaps this is just her writing style; however, it is still present and extremely annoying, taking away from the rest of the book. I wish that I could give this book no stars at all because, essentially there is no enthralling plot whatsoever. The main characters drink, sleep, and drink some more and then they murder somebody. I recieved this book for free and I still feel ripped-off. If you truly want to read this book, I would suggest checking a copy out from the library first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop","review":"I agree with the two star review elsewhere here that suggests what this book badly needs (editing).

Book dragged.","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I know it is supposed to be a similar style as Carol Goodman's books, but it defiantly is not. The story dragged until the point I finally gave up reading it. As a person who reads several books a week, this book took me almost 2 months to get through and I never finished. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"Thank God I borrowed this and didn't buy it. Pretentious, far too long, not a single likable character. The students come across more as inmates at a prep school for the emotionally and academically inept rather than an elite progressive college. This book wants its charcters to be dangerous and decadent and depraved and they're just silly, boring, spoiled children. Elizabeth Hand's \\"Waking the Moon\\" is a much better, though far more fantastic, novel about college students, mysterious rites, and the results thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"After reading the delightful \\"The Little Friend,\\" I couldn't wait to start this one. The book is a mish mash of drunken party scenes and hangovers. The characters are stiff and speak in ways peculiar for college students---how many times have you heard someone say, \\"goodness?\\" The descriptive scenes are full on dishes crashing in the cafeteria, which tires after a while. There's a lot of talking and very little action, with people reacting strangely to situations. When have you ever heard of someone being \\"stunned\\" when hearing that a friend was seen standing in front of a bank? Save your money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable Characters","review":"I did not care for this book, because I did not care what happened to the characters. Richard Papen was one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever read about it and considering he is the story teller, you should be able to identify with him on some level. Wonderful sentences and structure, but I just plain ol' didn't care about any of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written for a Movie","review":"I have always mentioned this book as one of my favorites of all my readings. I had mentally choosen actors to play every part of this story if it were ever made into a movie. Captivating story, moving in a Tarantino style. Questions are asked by characters as you realize you have read the answer pages before. The statement \\"You never know a person\\" applies heavily in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machines Making Machines","review":"The main flaw I found in this novel is that I found the protagonist, Richard, to be unconvincing. There is something odd with the way Tartt chose to make him a man, his voice is more the voice of the author's and it doesn't quite succeed.Novelists such as Donna Tartt, like many others, have a very common problem. Yes, they are well-educated, well-read, and intelligent, but they lack true grit. Perhaps it is a lack of life experience and because they gain much inspiration from other literature i.e. second-hand knowledge. This gives an air of falsehood to the work and never really hits on an instinctive, gut level.This novel will appeal to those similar to Tartt and be the book \\"I wish I wrote\\" since it shows off so much education and knowledge. But this novel ultimately comes across as a potboiler, despite all its literary pretensions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid read","review":"The Secret History achieves something quite interesting: though I despised every single character in the entire novel, I still enjoyed reading it. Normally I need likable or at least sympathetic characters with whom I can closely identify in order to enjoy a book. Tartt provides neither but rather than becoming infuriated and throwing the tome against the wall halfway through, I instead became steadily engrossed in the suspenseful, slightly surreal storyline.My only complaint is the ending. Tartt seemed unwilling to close the doors on the story and so the book stutters to a forgettable conclusion when it could have ended quite powerfully and with much more finality given a bit of trimming. Apart from that, while no masterpiece, The Secret History is more than worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"I'm not one for mass market paperbacks but someone gave me this book because I majored in Classics and am a Latin teacher--either the best or worst audience. I started reading as a courtesy and could not put the book down. Donna Tartt clearly has a knowledge of Greek and Latin, yet the book doesn't drip with scholarship. This book is extraordinarily well-written and full of characters who are sympathetic, believable, yet easy to dislike at times because each has their own flaws. The way the story unfolds, starting at the tragic end and moving back through time to explain how the characters got to that point was a brilliant take on the normal suspense thriller. I was impressed with this book from beginning to end and was a bit disappointed when I finished it. Trust me, I usually don't get excited by this type of literature but this is an absolutely fabulous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna, Where are You?","review":"Here's yet another example of an absolutely wonderful book which was never followed up by any others from this author. The Secret History is a mystery of sorts, even though you start off the novel knowing much of it. It is the unravelling of details (and characters' lives!) which is absolutely fascinating. This is one of those few books which I tend to urge people to read, even after fifteen years or so of its publication. It still resonates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"This book was amazing. It reminded me a lot of the Dead Poet's Society, but even better. I had read \\"The Little Friend\\" first and wanted more by this author and picked up this book. It's one of those books that stays with you for weeks or months after you are done reading it. I loved this book and can't wait until Ms. Tartt writes another one. Although I suspect I will be waiting a long time because her second book didn't come out until 10 years after the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretentious, but interesting","review":"This is a chilling story about murder, supposed friendship and how small groups of people can become cultish under certain influences.The story does drag at times as it follows some of the most pretentious college students ever created in fiction. The group is extremely bright, but not as bright as they think they are. The reader's awareness of the group's intellect and flaws follows the same arc as that of the narrator who realizes too late that maybe following the group wasn't such a good idea after all.Despite being more than 500 pages, not a single one of those pages contains a character you'd want to know personally. I'm not a proponent of authors only writing about likable people by any means, but it can be a challenge to read 500 pages straight about people who vary from despicable to the bad side of neutral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical and entertaining at once","review":"This book is not a masterpiece. Yet, it managed through both style and content to keep me turning the pages and reading for three consecutive days. At the end I felt that the author succeeded in striking a very good balance between entertainment and social criticism. So while the process of reading was always driven by the mysteries of murder, friendship and betrayal; it's the author's critical insight on social and academic elitism and the flawed nature of role models which ultimately remains as an aftertaste of the novel. It's a fairly socially aware thriller and for that I am giving it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Revisited","review":"Like The Magus by John Fowles, this book shows the bloat of an over-long gestation. However, Donna Tartt's tale of guilt without redemption is so beguiling that it is easy to forgive her many digressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real page-turner","review":"This is an excellent book. The Kirkus Review is crazy. I read a lot and this book is one of the maybe two or three per year that I read that I just can't put down, that I don't want to end. I have discussed it with probably five other people who have read it, and we all loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","review":"Definately one of my favorite novels. Not only was I sad to finish this but I've not found anything I like as well since I read this book. I'd welcome email suggestions from anyone who might offer reading recommendations for simular reads. I'd sure enjoy another Donna Tartt novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Seductive","review":"What delighted me most about this novel was the way things were never what they appeared, and each character had their own secret agenda. I don't love it to the degree that other readers do; I found the trip to and back from the funeral too long, and the drug use got repetitive. But I still got more out of it than I do out of ten or twenty typical contemporary novels. Another psychological thriller that recently blew me away is John Fowles' novel \\"The Collector\\", considered by some to be the first modern psychological thriller (1963). I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"Read this when it first came out, and still it resonates in memory. Another world, speaking of college life that should be familiar to anyone, but is totally foreign. Isolated locale, and isolated social system. Anything can happen, and does. Where oh where is Tartt's next effort? What became of her? If Jay McInerney is still writing, why isn't Donna?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre/Rotten","review":"I had to write a review of this book because I read about 300 pages of it and then noticedthe glowing reviews on the back by the New York Times, Sunday Times, etc., and I thought this is baloney.I don't understand how anyone could think this could be anything more than a long winded bit of fluff.The premise is good but the author can't do anything with it.The characters are not interesting or convincing, etc.. I still have about 100 pages to go and Iam only reading it to the end because I figure I have wasted this much time already - I might as wellfinish it - I really don't care how it ends. If you are a serious reader, don't bother with this unless youwant an example of what passes off as good fiction today. This is about as deep as a tuna fish sandwich.Stupid book. Look at the pretentious pic of the author too - dead giveaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ponderous but pleasurable","review":"Yes, the book, the diaglogue, etc. can be a wee bit ponderous. But this is a compelling story with a greatly believable protagonist (considering the circumstances) and for the most part a fantstastic plot.I loved the suspense, the ivey-leaguishness, the characters, the ponderous probing of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"I had heard about this book for years, and finally ordered it. What a load of pretentious crap. First of all, the characters were so poorly fleshed out that I truly could not keep them straight. And they spoke in this antiquated, affected style, like something out of a 1940's drawing room play. The whole Greek and Latin aspect of the book may be interesting to some people, but it wasn't to me. I kept waiting for it to get good. THe acknowledgements include a big thank you to literary agent Binky Urban who was (is still?) a big deal in the literary world. I kept wondering if Ms. Urban caused all of the fuss over this book and reviewers just bought the load of goods. The book is 557 pages long, and I got to 468 and could not continue. It was BORING! I hated the narrator and didn't believe that A) it was a male...the voice didn't feel male at all to me and B) didn't believe anything about his story. It seemed so contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"An erudite, ironic, stylish debut novel without much soul","review":"About three-quarters of the way through The Secret History, I was dazzled--16 years after it was written, this is still such a mature, complete novel, written in careful, lovingly detailed prose, about the relationship of character and aesthetics to murder and death.Then, in the last 100 pages, my reservations about the book from its first 100 pages resurfaced: Tartt's baroque and wooden characters and dialogue and bleak and humorless vision of humanity (although this stretch of the book is also paradoxically peppered with most of the book's laugh-out-loud deadpan moments) make (to use a mixed-metaphor I read online once) \\"awfully weak tea to hang your hat on.\\" The tense and punishing final series of turns is all very Greek and gothic (and not in that cuddly Eugenides way) but at the end of it all I found myself wanting wisdom a little friendlier, more familiar, and fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"The first half of this book is better than the second. Tartt sets up an intriguing plot line that veers off into a Dostoyevskyan soul-searching extravaganza at midpoint -- still well done, if you like that kind of thing. It's not her fault I wanted the book to go in a different direction. Beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired me to write","review":"When I decided to become a writer several years ago, this was one of the novels that inspired me.I recently re-read it and I have to say, I liked it just as much second time around, though I did find some shortcomings in the story. I'm not sure whether this is because as a writer I am more aware of content, structure, characterisation, pacing and all the other elements that go towards making a book special than I was when I was simply a reader, or that I now read more and have more to compare it to.I have recently written my own book about friendship and coming of age and have realised how difficult it is to carry off multiple threads about equally important characters and to bring their stories together to make a satisfying conclusion. For that reason, I still think this is one of the best books of its type ever published and would recommend it to readers of serious literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely wonderful first novel...","review":"Donna Tartt, in The Secret History, provides her reader with a first person account of what is perhaps the most profound and difficult experience imaginable. A group of five Greek language students, secluded from other students in thought, imagination, and experience, make the ultimate decision to murder a comfrere. This narrative tells the when, why, and how in a method quite unlike any other book I have ever read. From the first page, the reader is drawn in, and he cannot bear to skip a word for fear that he may miss something. Tartt's only weakness, and a minor one at that, is her tendency to overdramatize. However, this is a small price to pay for the insight she offers into human spirit and habit. In addition to the unique story line, The Secret History provides the reader with funny cliches, Greek and French asides, and one-of-a-kind wit. It's a book that any reader will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Sisyphus!","review":"The prologue, and, arguably, the first chapter -- a masterpiece of literature, of stage-setting, of baiting the hook. A work of art. I was HOOKED.But then came the rest .... and I read Every. Single. Page .... pretentious, precious, elitist. And yes, throw pedantic onto the pile. I very quickly tired of Julian, Charles and Camilla, Francis, Bunny, and the poor-Plano-plebe-looking-in-from-the-outside Richard. I thought the supporting evidence for Richard's infatuation with these Paris-Hilton cohorts would emerge eventually, but they never did. I didn't understand how these characters stood out for Julian's elite picks. Nor did I ever find Julian to be anything other than the self-absorbed individual that he turned out to be.About halfway through, I prayed for the end. I silently pled to the author: Do whatever it is you intend to do with these ridiculous human beings and be done with it. Just release me, oh gods, from this cursed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"devastatingly beautiful","review":"After reading this book for the second time in seven years, I'm still enthralled in the same awe-inspiring way. Though Ms. Tartt inspires me to write, her work kills me with its unsurpassable beauty. I can't think of any writer who can match her today. Donna, don't listen to the critics - they just don't understand. Please come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangible inspiration to escape \\"the stupids\\"","review":"The Secret History is a brilliant debut by authress Donna Tartt. She provides readers with a glimpse into the lives and development of a group of the academic elite and the by products thereof (i.e. Cloke Rayburn et al.). Tartt romanticizes the experiences of a traditional, although somewhat dramatized (it is fiction after all!), higher education complete with verdant lacrosse fields, Socratic methods, and the love of intellect. This appreciation for the intellect and all things erudite convinces the reader to fall in love with the intellectual-which the novel provides a modicum of choices...(I especially liked Camilla: \\"lying on a bed eating chocolates,\\" etc., etc.,...)Brilliant Work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of spellbinding","review":"I opened this book expectng a murder mystery. I got so much more than that....Donna Tarrt has broken free of any cliche she might have become mired in - college life, romance, mystery, and drama, she has avoided them all and blended an unlikely cast of characters into an intoxicating tale of murder, guilt, and group politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"a briliant and haunting book","review":"Tartt's debut novel disturbs one even more every time you return to it. She sketches the beauty of self destruction and the mystery of passion. There are so many subtle, yet deeply moving aspects to these characters, their relationships and their surroundings that each reread turns into a compeling, dark and sombre journey. Even characters that seem to be of relatively less importance show more and more complexity every time one rereads the book so that, like Richard Papen, I will probably never feel that I can crack the mystery of what really happened to them. This story will haunt me for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was book in there somewhere....","review":"This book reminded me of a Burt Lancaster movie I saw a long time ago called \\"The Swimmer.\\" Burt swims across Connecticut through his neighbors' pools. The unrelenting emptiness of the suburban lives he encounters forces him to face his own directionless, purposeless existence. Tartt shares the conceit of whomever was behind that film: I am good, not because I am moral or even because I have escaped the hellish treadmill of modern life, but because I am fully aware of our tragic situation and can stand slightly apart, observing from a partially detached and sardonic perspective. I'm not free but I at least know I'm in prison.I kept hoping for hope, expecting a glimmer, seeking a ray of redemption. I rode all half a thousand pages right to the end and was rewarded with ashes and despair. For me, the hopelessness of this tragi-Greek drama made it an unpleasant read. Good writing can only carry a book so far; there has got to be a destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop reading it!","review":"I read this book because I saw a recommendation of this author in Anne Rice website, my favourite writter, and i thought i could give it a try.I have enjoyed reading it a lot, it is one of the few books that I could take out of my mind and the only solution was to continue reading it. It does not happen very often, the last time was when i read A Simple Plan by Scott Smith, which is another amazing thriller.The great achievement of this book is that you feel identified with the narrator, and step by step of his story you can't stop thinking that you would have done exactly the same as him.I hope they can make a good movie of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I believe this is one of the finest novels published in the English language in the last decade or so. Ms. Tartt is a genius at exposition and character development. The questions addressed in the book, questions about guilt, redemption, etc. are exquisitely explored. The basic plot deals with a groups of young students of the Greek language at a Bennington-like school in New England. These people bond, commit a horrible, inexplicable crime, and then deal with the aftermath. I recommend this book without reservation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puffery, triteness, tedium","review":"Don't believe people who tell you this book is 'spellbinding' or 'beautifully written'. Indeed, it opens with the end then spends 400 odd pages on puffery, triteness, tedium and pathetic endeavours at high-brow, literary credence in a meak attempt to make that 'end' interesting. Ms. Tartt has floundered, badly, where the likes of Patrick Suskind flourish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret History","review":"Just began reading the novel and find myself unable to put it down. Fascinating and remarkably written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I read this book first soon after it originally came out and have re-read it twice since then. It remains one of my favorite books. Tartt's writing is amazingly descriptive and the plot pulls you in. The characters aren't all together believable--their oddities make the book all the more interesting though. A fun, quirky, unique book that will make you stay up late into the night to finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"What a book! and what a change from her other one. This book was fabulous. You are drawn in from the beginning because Tartt writes so well. I loved everything about this book. It was written with an extensive vocabulary and Tartt gives a real glimpse into the classical studies of Greek. I loved Richard from the start and this is written soley in his perspective. I love all his friends from Greek class as they go crazy and do amazing things. You'll love this book.It might seem a little long near the end but there is a great shocker at the end that left me stunned. This is the second time I read this too - I had to read it again because I liked it so much the first time.You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally mediocre","review":"This book is totally mediocre.

With so many wonderful books to read I recommend skipping this one and getting on with your life.Is the author serious with her character names: A big, strong athlete named \\"Bunny,\\" twins \\"Charles and Camellia\\" and one character who is too similar to a high-level soccer player - continually takes my mind away from the story and brings it somewhere else.There are too many plot deficiencies and if I had not been reading it for a book club reading I would have thrown the book into oncoming traffic & left it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Junk","review":"The slimy corporate maneuvering which produced this \\"writer\\" in publishing was as unwholesome as the one which produced that related creature in \\"music\\" Brittany Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh .........

I think I should have read the Amazon Reader Review's before I dove in head first. This book is probably the most unreadable thing I have ever encountered. I rarely and I mean RARELY give up on a book, but this one went straight back and was never finished. It's not worth the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm giving up on it half way through","review":"First of all, who goes to university to study Greek? It's a bunch of junior Thurston Howell the IIIs. You can imagine them saying \\"by Jove\\", \\"old boy\\", etc. {eye roll!} After 200 pages or so, we learn that the classmates killed a farmer, and one of them is blackmailing the others so they want to kill him too. The story is so boring and there is just too much text. It rambles on and on. I honestly cannot believe that this book was in the New York Times best seller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential--Wasted","review":"What a great premise for an interesting story completely wasted.This book is largely about mad genius. However, the author is unable to deliver charaters as brillant as we are supposed to believe they are. On Page 32 we find the best passage in the book. The mysterious professor Julian is set up as a central intelligence source. His philospically provoking passage on the contraints of society, however, is dropped and only loosely correlated to the central action. What's worse, Julian becomes a non-entity after this point. How disappointing. I felt as though the author had neither the knowledge of philosophy or the wear-with-all to create a truly genius character. Instead of letting us learn through Richard, a man with little or no character himself, we are forced to see things like Richard does, with no revealing character development.There are no surprises in this book and leaves you feeling totally cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, formulaic, and highly over-rated","review":"Tossing in phrases in Latin and Ancient Greek does not make a novel good. Shallow, self-involved, and depressing characters does nothing to improve it, either. The author tries to fool her audience into believing that this brush with \\"High Culture\\" makes her book noteworthy. If anything, referencing the greats only highlights her own work's shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, wordy, wordy","review":"This book should have been shortened by at least 250 pages. The author droned on and on seemingly trying to amaze the reader with her knowledge of Greek. All characters but for the main six were barely fleshed out making the epilog at the end detailing their updated histories confusing at best. I found it hard to understand how six college students could be so \\"brilliant\\" when they spent their days drinking, drugging, smoking, taking uppers, taking downers, dancing in the woods, murdering a man, planning and carrying out another murder and still have time to make it to class. In the end, it was sad most all got away with their silly, pathetic lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romantic Suspense Read.","review":"Anna Dunning is being stalked.

Then, I discovered this wonderful series.As Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme open the season, Rosemary loses her job at a university and Laura loses her long-time (two-timing) husband. While it might seem quirky to have them discover a murder every week, there is nothing unusual or different other than that fact.Since I am watching these on my computer, I often find myself looking up plant names as we go along, and have really come to appreciate this unique and very fun couple. After the first couple of episodes, they both felt like friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Viewing, Don't Miss It!","review":"In the first of six episodes, major life challenges confront both Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme. These are met and dealt with, as the women strike up a resounding friendship. They discover a common interest in plants and gardening, though they come from different backgrounds (one has a degree in horticulture and the other's father had been a farmer). Intrigue, mysteries and murders come their way and these horticultural sleuthing detectives face these challenges with charm, wit and intelligence. This is due in part I am sure, to the special talents of actresses Pam Ferris and Felicity Kendal. Beautifully filmed with an eye for colors, florals and greenery, this series is a cut above the ordinary. Bravo to the Brits for this new delightful series that is absolutely food for the soul.

They achieve astonishing feats of horticulture without breaking a sweat and never race home, screaming \\"I must have a shower this very minute!\\" In a recent episode (I don't know which series it comes from, sorry), they redesigned a ginormous walk in Regent's Park, solved a rather silly pair of murders on no reliable evidence, figured out who was stealing their plants, took in a three-legged dog, reunited two (count 'em) sets of long-lost lovers, and redecorated Laura's daughter's flat, all without much visible effort.

The connectors are always at the back of the TV, in the dark, without any lamp light, so it took a while to find out that the connector itself was not formed well. By looking at it carefully, the shield around the pins was too narrow. But, no dents: uniformly disformed. Funny enough one pin was smashed against the other in another direction than the damage to the shield. As far as I can see this is production damage that slipped through quality control. I took out the jewelry tool box and straightened everything out.

You will sure to love this album of well known voices and some that you may not have heard before- it is a beautiful CD of music and sure to be one of your favorites!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experiencing God - can't ever say enough about this music","review":"I have enjoyed this CD for many years and bought this and another couple copies to share with others I am in fellowship with who also desire to walk closer to the Lord. LOVE THIS CD. The evidence for the Lord Jesus is all around us but it is always so evident when the heart of God is so easily seen and heard through the words He puts on the hearts of fellow believers. This music speaks to the deep longing that followers of Jesus Christ have to love Him with all of the heart, soul, mind and body ~ to live what we believe and not just be \\"talkers\\". Wonderful, uplifting, stirring music ~ reminds me of the sentiment in Psalms, that my soul pants after God the way a dear pants for water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, cliché but sooooo funny.

I laughed a lot until I almost cried!The tragedy is on the producer/actors's side.They were and still are convinced that they made a...serious masterpiece instead of a laughing-out-loud piece of entertainment.Now that they know, hopefully they will change genre in the future and make a comedy, in order that we may be moved to tears this time.That would be nice!Interesting to see the reviews on this one all over the place!

I was very disapppointed with this version for the low quality transfer. Avoid this version of the series at all costs, unless you are a true devotee of 'One Step Beyond.' This DVD transfer is abysmal at best. Some of the introductions and exits of the episodes, and even some of the episodes, are cut short. The images are dark to very dark at times and are not very clear with unwanted sounds in the background that occur every once in a while. This is a very inexpensive transfer to DVD and leaves a lot to want.

We use the No-tic motion sensor, & while our baby was in his bassinet, it was great! We moved him to the crib, though, & have had two false alarms. Keep watch on your baby's sleeping patterns for a little while after you move them to the crib, because ours is a \\"scooter\\", moves himself out of his no-roll brace to the head of the crib, which caused himself to move out of the sensor's range twice, setting off the alarm (SLEEPLESS NIGHT!!!) After we readjusted it under the mattress, all was well, and we could sleep with peace of mind once again. This is a MUST for all parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 tin cans & string would work better.","review":"Awful.Piece of garbage.Let me start w/ the sensor. Difficult to install & it changes the manufactured purpose of your infant mattress. But believe me, that's the good part.The monitor itself is the absolute worst electronic I've purchased in 20 years. How? Why should it be that bad? I have no idea... It emits a perpetual humming noise. Constantly and it is not a quiet one. If you intend to plug this into an outlet w/ any other device - it will get worse. If the flimsy power chord touches anything - it will get worse.Also, that carabiner/belt-hook looking end on the monitor - isn't anything but decorative. Please, do not waste your money on this. I don't rant like this normally. I write reviews very infrequently. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This is a great product. My wife and I sleep much more soundly at night knowing that our baby is being monitored by this product while she sleeps. I've had the monitor about 5 months and only two times a false alarm has sounded. This occurred because she was not in the center of the bed and was breathing lightly at the same time. To me this is no big deal to check up on her. I prefer the machine to err on the side of caution than to confuse vibrations in the house as baby movements. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too much static.","review":"I love this mobile as it does not have too much static. We live in a building and have had bad experience with many other monitors. This one seems to be one of the best in terms of sound clarity. We have not used the sensor so I can't comment on that.

A good product for the $$$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Living to the sound of a hummmm...","review":"The idea behind this is great, and to be fair it does work as advertized.However it emits a horrible hum at any volume. We knew this is an inherent risk in analog monitors, but our old Fisher-Price is silent when plugged into the same power outlets.In the end, we splurged for thePhilips SCD590 Digital Two Parent Baby Monitor. It's $200 but you do get what you pay for. No interference whatsoever coupled with perfect sound clarity. Ah bliss..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace of mind","review":"We received this monitor off our registry. For a long time we never used the sensor pad. We felt we didnt need it. A few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach in the middle of the night unbeknownst to us. We would turn her only to find her moments later, or even hours later, on her stomach. We finally let her sleep on her tummy becuase it was obvious that was where she wanted to be. So the pressure pad is so sensitive that it picks up a 3 month old's breathing. we have only had a few false alarms but that was becuase she was way over in the corner of the crib. Hope that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"We splurged a little to get this monitor but we are very happy we did so. I sleep much better at night knowing that my baby's breathing is being monitored. The instructions indicate the sensor pad should be placed under the mattress directly under your baby with no bedding or padding in between. However, I've found the sensor will work even through a mattress, bedding, and a one inch thick sleep positioner. It's SUPER SENSITIVE which is GREAT! One thing to keep in mind - You should not have a ceiling fan on at night or have a strong draft in the room (such as an AC vent blowing directly onto your baby's crib). The unit will pick up air movement in the room. I highly recommend this product! I would not be resting at night as peacefully as I am without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Sleep all through the night","review":"Both my babies slept through after three weeks, and I found myself sitting next to them half the night checking their breathing. So I got the angelcare, and only checked for one night, found that it worked (it is easily tested by taking the baby out, the alarm goes off after 10 secs), and had peaceful nights ever after.Happy to recommend it to everybody!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I thought that this was a great product but when I went to get the last pack of the three pack it was busted.

The valve cover gasket does not fit my valve cover. It's mostly my fault, I would usually get more images of a part for my car to make sure it would actually fit, but I've had previous success with Amazon's Part Finder so I bought it sight unseen.

Again just an FYI."},{"rating":"1","title":"The low point in Sanderling's cycle","review":"I avoid reviewing dead losses, but I've been going through Kurt Sanderling's Sibelius cycle from the Seventies disc by disc. It begins with an anomaly, an eye-opening Sym. #1 that promises great things to come. For the most part, nothing great happens. The third is quite enjoyable, but the conductor seems totally at sea in this installment. The entire cycle covers a number of years, form 1970 to 1977, and it seems that the later you go, the more listless the performances. I've never heard a more aimless Sibelius Fourth than the one here, from 1977, which is full of dispirited playing from the Berlin Sym., never better than an also-ran orchestra at their best.I hope for better from the 1971 account of Sym. #5, which after all is a repertory staple, but Sanderling sleep walks through it, too, so the entire program has no bright spots. In short, a CD to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven Sent!","review":"Beautiful!!! It's great to have something made especially for Christian couples.

Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, a little short on melodies","review":"Overall a very enjoyable album. It plays pretty well for background music, especially given how seamlessly the songs transition together. You likely won't even notice a track change until you suddenly realise you're four tracks ahead.It's a little heavy on drum & rythm songs, I would have preferred more songs with lyrics or pronounced melodies. The whole set does have a consistent feel, though, so the song choices were well made.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"This is a fantastic collection of tunes! Energetic yet smooth, never irritating. Buy it before your cross-country drive & you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, BORING!!!!","review":"The only thing that makes this a mix CD is the fact that it is gapless. This might as well be unmixed because every song is married to the next by at least 30 seconds of nothing but a snare, kick & hi-hat. A *real* mix intertwines songs, having them play off on another.I give it one star because the songs are good and it has a flow.

With Arab Palestinians now armed to the teeth, with rockets that can reach the heart of Israel, we can and should start to take off our blinders about the harm that has been done by the international welfare system created to support this people. For it is not supporting the people, it is not bettering their lives.

Haddix' novel is well-crafted, slowly leading the reader through Dorry's experience with the Fishers, subtly transforming the group from one which welcomes her with open arms and promises of God's love to one which makes increasingly unreasonable demands on her, all of which carry the threat of an afterlife in hell if she fails. The book is ultimately a very balanced look at the fine line between faith and fanaticism, between cults and Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh outlook on faith v. fanatic","review":"\\"Leaving Fishers\\" is about a 15 or 16 year old girl named Dorry who moves from Indianapolis from small-town Ohio.

There is a rythmic instability in the playing that is atrocious. I've learnt a number of these partitas, heard numerous recordings of them, and cannot fathom why this performer tries to contort the rhythms as she does. Obviously as a musician one must decide when to bend the rhythm a little - a la Casals or other great Bach interpreters, but in this recording the distortions are that bad that the music has completely lost its meaning and continuity.Listen to the opening line of the first partita before buying this CD - a simple phrase is completely distorted. Also, be sure to listen to the gigue of this same first partita - it sounds like a child practicing! Listen to Richard Goode or numerous others play this gigue and you'll wonder how this CD was ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fusion heads watch out!","review":"This is a very different take on the whole soft Machine-sque/canterbury movement that went on over there in England during the seventies. In fact Hugh Hopper played with them on the second Isotope album (recommended also, 'Illusion'). I can understand some people not liking this group too much as the fusion thing is taken to extremes and thrown into your living room without ever asking for forgiveness. But that's what i like about them. Mainly fender rhodes , electric gt, bass and drums played at fast tempos (not always but most of the time) that keeps on grooving and grooving and then grooves some more. Nice solos too especially by Brian Miller (keys)...What ever happened to the 2 albums by his other group called Turning Point which included Jeff clyne too? was hearing them (lps) and they floored me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD READ","review":"EDDEIE SHACK WAS QUITE A CHARACTER AND AUTHOR PETER GODDARD DOES A GOOD JOB TELLING HIS STORY.

The tracks are segued such that it's impossible to tell where one begins and another ends -- a benefit when dealing with such disparate elements. \\"Dubs That Don't Match\\" strangely does match, and \\"Between Man and Woman\\" begs for something beyond its short running time, as does \\"I Can't Get My Eyes Off.\\" \\"3 Sounds from 94\\" sounds more current than the title would have you believe, while \\"Robot Snares Got No Cadence of Balance\\" similarly proves its title wrong.

Now the fronts fit fine, but on the whole, the new size is a bit too large for the rest of my feet!So, go to the mall and try them on first before buying, for best results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betula Birkenstock","review":"I do believe that this product is a type of Birkenstock, or maybe they have a license to sell as a Birkenstock, but they are not the Original Birkenstock as they claim to be.I did not appreciate the service I received from Midwest Sports. Choosing the size by the sizing chart and comparing it to my shoe size, I thought I chose the correct size; but it was not, it was a size larger. So I had to exchange them. Not only did I have to pay for the postage to return the item, I was also charged to have the correct size mailed back to me.

No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men's sizes only come in narrow","review":"I was disappointed, as they neglect to tell you that the men's sizes are narrow. I had to call and request a return slip.

I don't know what to do with this stupid shirt, it's too big for my daughter, too small for even my small husband and I. So dissapointed. I sent them a picture of the label, which clearly says Adult medium, and then a picture for reference to it's size. That's an Adult size medium, Fruit of the Loom next to it. You can see that the kitten shirt is only half the size, tops. How did nobody notice this? Especially for a package as important as two-day shipping?I want a new shirt.

But the SQL/400 technical information goes from basics to advanced. Most of the embedded SQL examples are in RPG IV and use the latest release, which provides some neat coding techniques.

Considering it only made about $2.5 million in box office receipts and left theaters after two weeks, it's an understandable oversight. Produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison studio, the film stars comic Nick Swardson as the titular Bucky, a man-child who discovers his uptight parents were once famous porn stars. With this newfound knowledge, Bucky decides to follow in his parents' footsteps and sets his sights on Hollywood, where his small genitalia make him a popular gimmick. There's more to the story, but it's really not worth getting into. This aggressively unfunny and severely misguided comedy is the worst movie I saw in 2011; do what you will with that information."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny & tuching","review":"This is not your average runchy comedy. If you love movies like napoleon dynamite & zack and miri make a porno then you'll love Bucky Larson. This to me seemed more like a comedy-drama rather then just a over the top runchy comedy.

Bucky Larson happens to have the lowest IMDB rating I've come across yet for a film that had wide release. 2.1 is not going to cut it these days. Need more convincing? Fine, how's a 9/100 metacritic rating for you? I wouldn't be surprised if nobody hires this director again, not even for a youtube video.Do not purchase this film based on people giving it 5 star and 4 star reviews.

I honestly was able to tell what was going to happen five minutes before it happened as it became cliched. The loser becomes a hero. There was no real original level of comedy here. I don't give it a 0 star like many had. But I can't give it a positive as the writers didn't come up with anything fresh as far as the jokes go.

I own three different i-Zone cameras and have taken literally hundreds of i-Zone pictures. But while I'm a big fan of the convenience, size and fun associated with them, I'm not thrilled with the price of the sticky film.The average price for a 3-pack (which is more economical than the 12-exposure single pack), depends on where you purchase your film and if it's on sale. Typically, the 3-pack will run more. But this price tends to go higher for the sticky film, which I don't think is worth the extra cost. And if you use your i-Zone camera as much as me, then the added cost will really multiply quickly.The main difference between the two kinds of films is that the sticky film displays a tacky-colored border around it and includes an adhesive-backing, which isn't all that strong. I agree with one of the previous reviewers to save the extra money and manually use tape with the regular 3-pack film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children","review":"Each of my three children have a different version of the I-Zone Camera (Barbie, Radio and regular).

The initial one I owned was really nice--high-quality, tight craftsmanship. I considered myself a fan of this brand.But the one I just got in the mail was a bit of a rattle-trap. The bolts around the tuning keys were loose, and some screws were loose, and it buzzed a lot when the strings were plucked. I spent a lot of time unscrewing things, and sealing the gaps in the hardware, and re-stringing and testing, before I got the guitar playing well.I think Luna must have changed some of their parts, or some of their factory processes, in the time they've been manufacturing this guitar. That's the only way I can account for the newer one being lower quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This cable is such a great value.

This cable was recommended to me by an Amazon electronics rep for its ability to deal with the 120hz feature on the TV.I also purchased the cable for my folks since they were using component cable on their Sony.

The construction is top notch and the connectors fit nice and tite. After spending $2,500.00 on a HDTV i wanted a cable that could bring out the best audio and video possible, but not spend an arm and a leg on an overpriced cable such as the Monster brand or buying a $5.00 cable that are made with lower quality. The price is perfect on this Belkin cable and you get the picture and sound you expect out of your tv. Belkin makes great products for the money and i highly recommend this cable. Im very satisfied with this purchase and i plan to buy a few more when i get a surround sound system and a Blu Ray player.

An ancient Roman hoisting machine allows workers to life six times their own weight - the 150 lb. stones are well within the limit. Pressure from the weight of the stones and precise alignment are more important to keeping things in place than the limited mortar of the day. Flying buttresses, arches, ribbed vaults, and in one case, an iron chain are also key, and allowed walls to contain large stained-glass windows.Some center areas were more than 12 stories high.

The simplicty of the sounds matched with the accented vocals give these songs an unexpected depth. For a first release, there are kernels of pop greatness here. The lyrics are evocative and at times rival the synth for music domination. which is fine. The tracks creep up and hook you when you least expect. I found myself playing the disc over and over.

It showed excellent writing by making the reader become so involved with the characters that it caused such emotion.Beast is about a Persian prince who goes against his religion to save a friend, and in turn gets punished by being transformed into a lion. From there you follow him through his trials and journeys on his path to learn how to respect others.It explains some of the Moslem culture, which I found interesting.I am surprised to see someone recommend The Raging Quiet (by Sherryl Jordan) because that is also one I would recommend if you enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prince in Disguse","review":"The book Beast is a very good book.

So he tried every thing to avoid his father. The only way to break the ancient curse is by a French beauty named Belle. If you want to find out if the prince is ever release from the curse. Then I would recommend you to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluffy little kitty","review":"Pretty nifty book. Beauty and the Beast from the Beast's point of view. Most of the book focuses on what happens to the Beast before he finds the enchanted castle and meets Belle. Another interesting twist to this version is that the Beast is transformed into a lion instead of a man-beast creature. The Beast's dual nature is still there in that he thinks like a man but has the instincts of a lion. He even attempts to live as a lion but when that fails he realizes he must try to lift his curse. This is where Belle finally comes in. I really like Belle in this book. She's a lot more strong willed than the other Beauties I've read about. Beauty and the Beast's relationship develops in an fascinating way because the Beast can't talk. I also love the cute little fox they keep as a pet. If you are looking for a pure romance book this one will probably be a let down. Otherwise, pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended Magical Tale","review":"Page after page, this book drew me like the proverbial moth to a flame.

Islam is a religion that i've always been curious about. There is a lot of mention of Islamic holy days and rituals in this book. In fact I am now reading a book on Islam as a result of reading Beast. It's interesting to read as prince Oryasman learns to write in the dirt with his paws as a way of communicating to people.

You'll have to modify your jack to one that plugs directly into the phone (no cord). They tell you what to have done, but that was aggravating.But the more serious issue is that when the phone is mounted on the wall (finally) the phone loses touch with the contact points, so it can't charge. I put the required part in place to support the phone to be mounted in a vertical position (it's a plastic piece at that base of the phone). But the piece is about 1/8\\" off of putting the handset in full contact.I'm sure it would be a fine phone, provided you didn't want to wall mount it.

Plots and characters move easily from the real world (whatever that means) to dreamworld and back, and even the players' bodies adapt to the need at hand.

To be honest, I do not know if it is Blomstedt's performances or the symphonies themselves, as these are the only recordings of 1 & 2 I have heard. Given that, it just doesn't seem that the music of these early symphonies takes off the way it does in Beecham's 3, 5 & 6 disc or Gunzenhauser's 4 & Symphony in C disc...I end up drifting elsewhere rather than listening, which is something I do NOT normally do with Shubert, early or otherwise.

It's garbage, like all Helfgott's other CD's! There are so many talented pianists pouring out of the premier conservatories around the world who cannot land a record deal and RCA hands one to the worst pianists in history. On this CD, Helfgott turns a noble, well manered Bosendorfer concert grand into a harsh, brittle sounding tin can. He bangs out the notes, rather than forming musical ideas. Why stop there? In several of the tracks, the piano is noticeably out of tune (Though this is out of Helfgott's control). I get nautious just listening to this. Go buy a CD of Vladimir Horowitz or Arthur Rubinstein (Or Anyone) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young Pizzarelli, just starting to come into his own.","review":"I've followed John's career since he was a young man playing duets with his father. This is an excellent disc. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because then I would have to give his current material 6! Even though the pianist on this disc is quite good, his current pianist, Ray Kennedy, is superior (in my opinion). John and his brother Martin have matured so much musically, and have developed such a tight bond after playing together for so long....you can see the beginnings of it here, and this disc is well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap junk","review":"Fell of the counter and the plastic bit holder shattered. The bit holder is made of cheap thin plastic. Once that breaks, its completely useless. Also it is cumbersome in the hand. Also, bits fall out of the holder (unless your working upside down) which means you have to hold the bit with one hand while twisting with the other. There is a magnet in the plastic holder to hold a bit, however, nothing to hold the plastic holder in the handle so it falls out. Threw it in the trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic handle breaks easily","review":"As you can see in the pictures someone else posted, the plastic handle breaks very easily. The problem is that the metal bits (which are fine) are held by a plastic handle, so when you turn with any force the metal bit just turns inside the plastic handle and breaks it apart.I had mine break while trying to unscrew small screws from the bottom of a laptop. Not very high-torque work, but enough to break the handle and render the tool useless.I salvaged it for a little while by wrapping the split handle with wire and gaffer tape, and then babying the tool thereafter.Someone else mentioned Husky, and I have a Husky tool that is much stronger: metal holding metal. Unfortunately it doesn't have the choice bits that this one had. (The bits are not interchangeable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but low quality materials","review":"Like another reviewer, I bought this at a local hardware store. Although it is a good concept, and convenient to have multiple bits that store inside the handle, the quality of the materials is very poor.I have not had problems with the plastic, like others, but with the metal bits themselves. The metal is VERY soft, and the bit will become deformed after only a few uses (Imagine when a the head of a screw becomes stripped, but this time it's happening to the screwdriver).I do not recommend this product, and strongly urge the manufacturer to make the interchangeable bits out of a harder metal with a higher yield strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take much","review":"I bought this from a local hardware store. It worked for a few uses, but the plastic socket on the screwdriver that holds the bits cracked open when I was unscrewing something.

Get something that's a little tougher.Seriously, a metal socket would be what, another 5 to 10 cents?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I needed this tool set to open my Palm Centro after it went for a swim.

Smith has created a book that the reader cannot put down until the last page has been devoured. I picked the book up to read on a plane trip and after I started reading, I never looked up to eat, drink or use the restroom. I felt like I would miss something if I stopped . The story is an intense detective fiction, and Smith has created some memorable characters with his vivid and witty descriptions. The plot is twisted and keeps you guessing until the last page.

Also missing is any useful guidelines on handling a Ventrue's power structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"My favorite Don Quixote has been the Naxos recording with Alexander Rudin, but upon listening to the Zinman again I'm not so sure. Zinman's first cello is the soloist, and he plays very well. Zinman's direction is wonderfully sympathetic, and the extraordinary sound engineering captures the whole thing with wonderful tone quality and dynamic range. This is undeniably the best sounding Don Quixote I've ever heard, and I include in that the classic Living Stereo with Reiner. The orchestra plays with scarcely believable panache. Tempos are moderate and sympathetic, and Zinman displays a wonderful sense of humor when appropriate. The other two works are well done, but you really buy this disc for the Don Quixote. If you have a first class stereo, this absolutely will tickle your fancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I am no expert in children's literature.

I can't even imagine the circumstances that took place for the band to produce Modern Love & Death. From start to finish it is nothing but sappy cheese laden nonsense. The sound is so much different from their first release which isn't always a bad thing but in this case the new direction is so far from anything cool not even crappy radio stations should be playing this stuff.

I realize there is only so much you can cram into two hours, but I personally could have heard more about Dennis Wilson's artistic contributions to the band when Brian stepped back (and only now, 25 years after his death, is DW finally getting the hearing and reinstatement back to the BB canon) and I definitely could have heard less about Mike Love's exaggerated contributions to the band. But to his credit, Alan Boyd takes an overall balanced look at the history of a band that's had more faces and personalities than any surviving bands of the 60s; there are also some really great clips in here.But if you are going to watch this for the first time, be sure to get your hands on Jon Stebbins' Dennis WIlson: The Real Beach Boy, available June 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" for Beach Boys fans!","review":"Wow! is all I can say about this DVD!

I received my 28-299A in 4 days; it went together well and runs flawlessly. My only complaint is with the unbelieveably cheap, plastic dust connector. It is thin and held in place with a spring clip which falls open in use because of the weight of the 4 inch adapter and collector hose. What on earth were the Delta design engineers thinking when they decided this was an acceptable feature for this saw? I have used the saw extensively and found guide blocks and thrust bearings very easy to adjust without tools. The blade tracks perfectly even after hours of continuous use. Come on Delta...improve the dust collection and make it equal in quality to the rest of the machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"I ordered this saw from Amazon. It arrived in about a week. Everything was packed securely and there was no damage or dings or scratches on the bandsaw. Assembly was very simple and straight forward. Machine runs pretty well except for mild vibration even after adjustment/tune-up. I replaced the belt witha PowerTwist belt with mild improvement. The mobile base is excellent and very sturdy. Overall, I am happy with the saw, except for the following:1. The dust collection assembly is a piece of plastic that is held in place with a small clip. Very cheaply made dust collection system and does not work well.2. The rip fence which is made out of aluminum is not flat vertically and I can not get it to sit 90 degrees with the table. I am planning to contact Delta to get a new fence.3. The bandsaw wheels were out of plane when arrived from the factory, but this can be adjusted.I hope this review was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding package.","review":"I recently bought this package ... and was delighted with nearly everything. It shipped quickly, came packaged well and was very easy to put together using Delta's instructions. Except for being fairly heavy and hard to lift (ask a friend to help set the saw on the stand) everything went smoothly and was operable in less than 2 hours. This was my first mobile base, but certainly not my last. How wonderful! The included blade is not great but a good spare to have around for tighter curves in thinner material. The only drawback was that the included fence was about 1/32\\" out of plumb with the table. The rails are perfectly level with my top, but the fence tilts slightly toward the blade. I'm sure this will only affect very tall stock and I can add an auxilliary fence if needed, but thought that was a little disappointing. Otherwise a very nice package."},{"rating":"2","title":"mindreader needed","review":"this is my first band saw. i put it together in a couple of hours, without assistance. i suggest help, parts of it are quite heavy. hooking up the belt drive was a little bit of trial and error, the instructions were okay, but not great. i've been using the machine quite alot and it seems fine so far. i plan to add the neck extension when i get up the courage. fit and finish were fine. delta blue grey contrasts nicely with the fine ground cast iron table. demetrious"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a winner!","review":"A favorite at our house for years.

Now Rob is back with the second installment \\"Crucible\\", and it's a work of metal art, but it doesn't come close to measuring up to the songs on \\"Resurrection\\". This album is much richer in darkness, and you can see very clearly that the songwriting reached for a rougher edge this time around, somewhat too rough for my taste on two or three of the tracks, you'll find them hard to get into. All the same, it is a decent metal album, and it still blows away anything Rob has done prior to the Halford albums in his solo career.

This latest efford is more metallic and I miss the melodies I know Halford is capable of. And although the album contains some real fast tracks like \\"Betrayal\\" and \\"Wrath of God\\" the overall impression is that it's a slow heavy album with simularities to Dio's \\"Strange highways\\". I'm not impressed by the guitar work, and I was hoping for a different approach from the Metal God.

It contains just enough new twists in a familiar metal environment to keep your ears on alert and interested. An armada of 14 new creations delivers everything you would expect from the master of really clean razorsharp heavy metal. Rob sings as good as ever and on a couple of tracks he laid down dual vocals - his normal and his \\"blow all to pieces\\" pitch.

Song writing is very inconsistent and do not stick in your head. Recording is very bad, mix is thrown together and the vocals are also horribly produced. Album sounds rushed instead of inspired.I also think Roy Z should take a backseat on producing albums. His productions tend to be overly sludgy sounding with overdone bass and drum volume drowning out the overall mix. I have a couple of Helloween discs produced by Roy Z and the production is also muddied on them as well.Rob Halford should stick to the original formula instead of experimenting. If it ain't broke don't fix it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait, I take it all back -- it stinks!","review":"I wrote a positive review (under the name \\"Skeptic\\") of the Phillips Cassette Adapter in early February 2007, shortly after trying it out. \\"So far, so good,\\" I said cautiously. Well, cancel that recommendation. Within a couple of weeks the item began to malfunction -- what I can only describe as toggling back and forth, from tape-forward to tape-backward, repeated several times -- so that music or talk from my iPod would be interrupted every few minutes by a series of clicks and silences. Then, less than a month later, the thing failed entirely; each time I insert it into my car's cassette player, the player simply ejects it. // Okay, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to buy so cheap a model. I'm now going to try something a little more up-market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape reel sticks; does not spin","review":"I couldn't get this cassette adapter to work in my car. Upon investigation, I found that the tape reel sticks, and doesn't spin. I opened the cassette adapter up (it's screwed together), and found that the gears do not line up very well. Needless to say, I returned this cassette adapter to Amazon. I was pleased to see that Amazon paid for return postage on this defective product. I will be buying another cassette adapter from a local store (maybe Radio Shack), so that I can more easily return the item if it doesn't work. It seems that a lot of these cassette adapters have flaws in them, and the more expensive models are not always better.

At first compassionate, Blaise soon loses his readers with his inattention to plot and chronology. His story jumps from his time with his family in Bombay to Calcutta and the present with almost no transitioning explanation while his use of Indian words unknown to his reader are not clarified.If Mukherjee had written this book entirely, readers' interest may not have wandered as far. Bharati's interpretation of their journey is nostalgic and whimsical at the same time, telling of her return to India after a fourteen-year absence. She often visites the idea of what if; for example, what if she'd stayed behind in India and married an Indian? What if she'd led the traditional Indian life?I feel a bit sorry for her story being the secondary plot in this otherwise difficult book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this grinder!","review":"I have been thru alot of grinders, we have had this one for several months and I love!

The time put into the solo album/career could be used to put decent material as a group(QRyche). After listening a few times, the material grew on me. Some of these songs could pass for Queensryche tunes (Passenger). I noticed that some of the tones and lyrics could be worked on, but it still has the Queensryche touch. The album has a more romantic, mellow tone. I can listen to the album when I am in a relaxed mood or in the car. I just wished that Geoff Tate used this material with the band members of Queensryche. If you listen to this album, you thought it was Queensryche. *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"I really don't know what to think of this album. I listended to it about 6 or 7 times already, but never get thru the entire track list and...sorry, up until tody never bought it.I'm a huge Queensrche fan and was waiting for a solo outcome after I saw the unplugged sessions. Geoff's vocals can do so much more than what he let's us hear with Q. Therefore I expected so much more I guess. Instead I get a 'flat' Tate, not using his potential. It's not that the songs are too soft or not Q-like enough (actually good, or he wouldn't have to go solo), but to me there is really not much there. Maybe somewhat more variety next time, a little more experimenting with different styles, a little 'risk' now and then, ...??"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Album Saved Only By Tate's Vocal Gifts,","review":"First, what this album IS NOT: It IS NOT metal, and it barely falls into the category of hard rock. I almost want to classify it as R&B;/New Age, but it doesn't really work there, either.As to the music itself: the instrumentals are weak in the \\"traditional rock\\" sense, so don't expect the old Queensryche guitar solos on this album. The instruments work to emphasize Tate's voice, and are pretty simplistic in their play styles. Most of the songs themselves seem to lack spirit, but are rendered decently by Tate's melodic voice.I probably wouldn't have purchased this album if I wasn't a QR fan, and I'd recommend \\"new\\" fans pick up Queensryche's _Empire_ or _Live Evolution_ rather than this album. Still, track three (\\"Helpless\\") and track eight (\\"A Passenger\\") are pretty good, and track five (\\"Every Move We Make\\") is solid once you get over that annoying beep."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've must be joking........","review":"As a diehard QR fan, I was elated to see this solo effort from Geoff Tate. With trembling hands, I opened the CD, placed it in the player, and prepared to be rocked. After the first track, I checked the CD to make sure that this really was Geoff Tate. What a disappointment! I have tried to listen to the entire CD, but it is just too painful. This is \\"Queensryche Lite\\" at it's worst!! Unfortunately, this same musical style has spread to the latest QR album \\"Tribe\\". The disco/techno-dance/ethnic rythmn sound just doesn't work!

As a result, I felt the album was slow and boring for the most part. It's as if Geoff Tate has redefined himself......as a lounge singer.Don't get me wrong - there's probably one or two salvageable songs (namely Passenger), and I think there are moments where he still sounds pretty darn good. It's just that I think he has (or had) the best voice in the business, and I don't feel that it's showcased at all on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tate's Voice Carries This Album","review":"This is one of a very few new albums I have been excited about in quite some time. Let me begin by illustrating my firm grip of the obvious - Geoff Tate's voice is phenominal! If he simply read the Seattle phone book this CD would have 3 stars. I really enjoy the music in this cd although I am not a big fan of drum loops and overdubbing. However, the arrangements here do seem to work nicely and blend in the total musical fabric of the album. I especially enjoy the piano and bass lines. My only negative would be that there is not much change of pace or tempo, each song either has a steady rock beat or is slower. The album could have used some change ups or a few suprises. Having said this, given any promotion and single release, \\"Geoff Tate\\" would go platinum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, my foot!","review":"People, i don't know if the great reviews for this album were because it was able to be used in place of sleeping pills (thanks to the slow music on almost every track) or if this album had become the soundtrack for twisted love affairs (every song is how i love you and why can I get myself straight , yada yada), but i do know it sucks. I have been a fan of Queensryche for years since 1991 and i have collected all the albums, but i looked forward to hearing Geoff Tate's wonderfully full voice in a new genre. Dear God, I was so disappointed. The music simply sounds insipid and weak, with no potential for showing his vocal talents and only get worse every song after. Please Geoff if you are reading, trying to go into Michael Bolton land is best left for Michael Bolton.

For fans like me, there's certain things we want to see matching such as character voices, personalities, directing, and action while at the same time introducing a new dimension of the the Bebop world we've yet to see. The formula of 80% familiar with 20% new introduction made for a two hour pleasant experience in a setting that was somewhere between the middle and the end of the original series.

The story is rich and the artwork is extraordinary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best","review":"why i think its the best is because of the fight sceen at the end between spike an vincent. that was my favorite part because you could tell they put a lot of hard work into that one scene.if you are a big cowbody bebop fan i would not stop and think before i buy this movie, it's worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"More=Good","review":"In Cowboy Bebop The Movie you get more of EVERYTHING that made the series great in huge portions. The movie boasts more fluid and detailed animation over the already high quality of the television show. It also includes a fantastic soundtrack C/O Yoko Kanno, the same music director for the series. The reason that I loved the series was that it possessed a unique blend of style, drama, and humor. All these are present and just as well intertwined in the movie as they were in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap money grab","review":"Skip this Blu-Ray version of the movie. It is a quick money grab off of fans. The disk contains no extras and barely even has a menu. The previous dvd version had quite a few extras. Wait until a real version comes out in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"You cant go wrong with Cowboy Bebop","review":"Like the series the movie was GREAT, if you dont care for anime I still recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Epic Movie of One of the Best Anime Ever.","review":"What can I say, I love this movie. Cowboy Bebop was one of the first Anime I saw on Adult Swim about four years ago and has a very special place in my heart. Its simply stunning. From teh visuals Bebop is famous for to the wonderful storyline. It really cant be beat by much out there. I really cant say much about the story because its so deep that anything I say could be a spoiler. You just have to see it for yourself if you are a fan of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"cowboy bebob: the movie","review":"Spike Speigel and his crew of bounty hunters, Faye valentine, jet black, and thriteen year old Ed, search the streets of mars to find the undead murderer Vincent. They encounter bbreath taking obsticals that could themsleves killed or put in jail. It is a hilarious, ass kicking classic. This film contains strong laguage and bloody voilence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holy Grail of Anime!","review":"Does your life lack a spice? Days dull and boring? WATCH THIS FILM. It may not change your life, but you'll surely love it... :) Techinally, this film is rated R, but a more approriate rating would be 14A. It doesn't have much coarse language, but the violence is intense and the plot is for older viewers (if you don't know what a bio weapon is, kids, don't watch it. You wouldn't get it.)The soundtrack is glorious, the characters are real and believable, the villain is a slightly sadistic man with a tortured past... A delight to all senses. Except smell. Or touch. Or taste. But...Ah, stop reading this and go watch it!Actually, you probably shouldn't watch this is you're squeamish- Spike and the gang are masters at letting the blood flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie you'll find","review":"Think of it, Pizza, Bling, Bling, Anime, Spike, and that Bebop feeling. Times that by 15, and times it by 15 again. That's this movie. If you don't hate Bebop, you'll love this movie. I love the series, and I saw this my eyes shot open. 2,000,000 times better than the movie. Rating: *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect. 4 and a half stars, really","review":"Two years after the popular tv series Cowboy Bebop finishes airing, this is released. I must say that it is not as good as the show, but has the same vibrant art, all star casting (Megumi!), and awesome character design. One thing I love about this disc is that it has interviews with the voice actors behind the English and Japanese casting. Therefore, you finally SEE Megumi! Cowboy Bebop fans, rejoice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cb movie","review":"This movie was just as good as the seris. Mostly because all the same people who made the seris came back to make the movie. The plot takes place on Mars year 2071. Just days before Halloween a boilgical explosion goes off killing hundreds of people. A reward is offerd of 300 million wu longs. This of course draws the atention of Spike and the rest of the bebop crew. The man responsible for this atack is a man who like Spike has seen death and came back. Only he has the cure for the posin for the disese he set lose.Thats the plot.Now for the fight scenes. Just like in the series the fights are great, the animation awsome and the soundtrack good as ever.If your your a fan of Cowboy Bebop you'll love this, if you like anime you'll love it. To tell the truth I can't see how you couldn't like this. It's one of the best anime movies I've ever seen right behind Ninja Scroll and Akira.A MUST OWN FOR ANY ANIME FAN!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy Bebop - The Movie","review":"This is one of the best movies ive ever seen. The series is one of the greatest things ive ever seen also, but this tops it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does great anime get ruined in the US?","review":"I haven't seen the dvd version of this but I have seen both the fan subbed \\"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\"(downloaded) and the US version of it \\"Cowboy Bebop - The Movie\\"(in theaters).This is a great movie with a good story that is up to par with the show and with music to die for, if you watch the Japanese version. In the US we a get a version that has been, for lack of a better word, raped. The wonderfull bebop music has been replaced with terrible rock, totaly ruining the movie.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh..","review":"I'll keep this quick.I gave this 1 star to affect the overall score more.My real rating is about....2 stars.When I first watched this,I was expecting it to be really good.Maybe I got my hopes up too high.The TV series is fantastic.But..This movie seems like it was an episode at first,but streeeeeeeeetched out.It really did drag out,which is funny,because the ending felt rushed.It suffers from both edges of the sword...The ending is extremely anticlimatic,and Spike seems out of character off and on.Great animation though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate","review":"This isn't a bad movie,but may not be a appropriate movie for little kids. Avoid this movie if you want your little children to behave. Buy Finding Nemo instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I purchased it (1.5 stars)","review":"This film was rife with typical anime \\"philosophy\\" regarding the supernatural, aliens, alterna-reality. Fun stuff, right? Not here.I can't even begin to tell you what in the world this was about, since I fell asleep about a third into it, played it back, and still hadn't a clue. I felt like I wasted several hours of my life. Even the animation wasn't anything to write home about. (1987's \\"Akira\\" continues to blow everything else away.)Maybe if I'd seen the TV show this would all make sense. But I haven't, so there it is. For all I hear about the TV series, this film really does the entire Cowboy Bepop phenom a disservice. It just doesn't work as a stand-alone anime film.For a MUCH better story involving avenging dead (at least that what I think the baddie in CB was trying to do), rent/buy HBO's \\"Spawn\\" series.At least the DVD makes a good coffee coaster..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh. I don't get it.","review":"I never liked Cowboy Bebop and I tried to watch all the episodes when I borrowed the box set from my friend. I wanted to see why people liked the series so much, but I honestly couldn't watch it because it was so boring. I thought maybe the movie would be better, but it's just as boring as the series. I really don't understand how everyone can like this so much. The movie isn't funny, I only laughed like twice, there is nothing good or interesting about the characters, plus I really don't like the way the way the movie looks. It's kind of dull and depressing. Am I the only one in the world that doesn't like Cowboy Bebop?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"In my opinion this movie completely lost the spirit of the original series. The TV show was all about cool music, exciting action, and interesting stories. The show also had a great feeling of fun. Unfortunatly, this movie forgot to include these great aspects of the original series. I found the movie to be boring and depressing, with very little music or humor.I saw this movie in the theater on opening night with hundreds of other Bebop fans. Everybody was loud and excited about seeing the movie, but once the movie started the crowd was dead silent. It was not out of respect of the movie, though. It was because we were all so bored. I left about 20 minutes from the end... very disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a classic","review":"From wonderful animation, to great music and super action scenes, this movie has it all. I didn't think I would enjoy this movie so much (the title got me turned off), but in the end, it is one of the best anime I have seen. I got the Blu-Ray version, so the image and the sound were both crystal clear. It freaked my cat out, but my wife loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect! except.","review":"you said it was unrated, but it was actually rated 'R'. but besides that, the movie was amazing! i didn't think it was as good as the series, but i still thought it was an epic, kick-butt movie that every anime/Cowboy Bepop lover should watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare One","review":"Cowboy Bebop the Movie is a rare one indeed. It's an Anime movie you can watch without knowing much about the original series. Of course, some knowledge is needed because the characters are never truly introduced the way they are in the the series. Having a Cowboy Bebop fan explain the characters in small detail before watching the film will solve this problem, though.The movie itself, with it high production value, is gorgeously animated with plenty of action. Columbia/Tristar was able to get all the original voice actors (a rare thing when a movie is published one place and the Anime series another), which was top notch in the series and is no different in the film. And the story itself, though entirely seperate from the main story in the series, is thrilling and full of surprises. The movie, as expected, follows through with an excellent soundtrack. A must see, must have for Anime fans or movie buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"No extras, great quality...","review":"People weren't lying about the lack of extras (plus no english credits) but that doesn't bother me since I have the original on DVD as well (with the extras). I was looking for a cheap bluray to try out since I just got my first player, and the video/audio quality is great... I don't have a 5.1 system (just a bose) so it doesn't bother me it's not 5.1... If you're a fan of the series, and/or already own the DVD I would get this as well since it's so inexpensive... Definitely worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with it.","review":"The quality on Blu Ray is excellent. It's definitely lacking in any special features, but if you like the series it's still worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy plague","review":"Take cowboy, add sci fi, New York and animation with a hip music back ground and you have a hit movie with nonstop action.The fatalism and dead end psychology of the villainwith a government that is everybody's enemy makes thebounty hunters the heroes without a cause.I don't think they are really trying to be funny, butas lot of the dialog and action is so old and over done thatyou find yourself laughing at the black humor of theeastern nihilism mixed with cowboy macho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"The movie is an awesome movie but the blu ray released by Image Entertainment sucks because it does not have 5.1 audio, only stereo for both English and Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome Yoko Kanno & The Seatbelts extended music video!","review":"This is a long episode, not really a movie, and it's best viewed as an extended music video, featuring many excellent songs from Yoko Kanno & The Seatbelts (who also did the music for the TV series). I love the TV series, and I had hoped for something a touch more special from the movie, but it's still a solid effort. The music puts it over the top, making it completely worthy of the Cowboy Bebop name."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever made","review":"This film takes an up to date problem of terror and puts it in a futuristic setting. Even if you are not a fan of japanese animation you can enjoy this film. The story is enjoyable by anybody. Anyone who has not seen this film has to be close-minded and needs to broaden their horizens and open their mind to new things. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically Brilliant but without a soul","review":"I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I was a big fan of the show and when I heard that the movie was essentially a longer TV episode that actually appealed to me. Unfortunately, during the hiatus between the end of the show and the production of the movie, the team forgot what made the show good. The characters seem to be only shadows of their former selves, the plot is not developed and events happen for reasons that are not explained (For example: just why is a character involved in a dogfight with the military for example? The script gave no explanation why this character would be considered an enemy). Essentially it is more interested in looking good than BEING good. I've learned that when it comes to sequels or new productions of an old show in anime, you can't go home again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bebop - underwhelming","review":"After renting this (I was so glad I didn't buy it) I thought: \\"Nan-dai?!\\" This movie smelled like a bloated episode, and the ending of an invincible villain who finally became \\"vincible\\" was way too slick for me. Yeah, it had an assortment of characters, but they didn't relate to each other, and they all seemed to be \\"free agents\\" out to make a quick buck. It just seemed determined to mix as many themes as possible: Middle Eastern; Western; babes; Blade Runner; etc. Barf, barf,Give me Fifth Element any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, the DVD could be better","review":"The Movie was great. The dvd on the other hand could be better. Instead of offering French as a language option, Sony should have made the Japanese language 5.1 digital. Also, the English subtitles are extremely terrible. The extras were great. The English dubbing was very good and did the charaters justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of the year. Hands down.","review":"This movie encompasses all the good things that are bebop, and adds a longer, larger format, and seeing it on the big screen is every otaku's dream come true. the fights beat the matrix, the plot beats %99.9998 percent of american movies, and the bold step to deal with bio-terrorism during these times of censorship and war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adams Fell (short of my expectations)","review":"Adams Fall by Sean Desmond has a great concept, but the execution of it falls by the waistside. I wasn't impressed by this new author's writing style or story development. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the story seemed pretty rudimentary, like back in Creative Writing 101. And the story -- supposedly scary -- didn't send any chills down my spine. Sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Sean Desmond hate Adams House so much?","review":"I eagerly awaited the receipt of this book because, like the author, I lived in Adams House - in B entry, in fact, where this book takes place. What fun, I thought, to read a book set where I had had so many adventures. Alas, no fun, just disappointment - and, quite honestly, embarassment for the author. He must be ashamed of such an excruciatingly awful book. Just terrible. And not just badly written - which it is - but such an absurbd depiction of a Harvard that just does not exist. Makes me wonder why he hates Adams House so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I read Sean Desmond's Adams Fall expecting it to be thrilling and captivating. I got so bored with it, it even amazed my dad when he read this incredibly boring book! If you want a good book to read, I suggest that you read Bloodline by Jill Jones. Bloodline has terror, mystery, love, romance, an twists all the way through to the end. I still remember exactly what happened throughout the entire book, including what chapters the events took place in. Don't finish reading all your mystery books until you have read Bloodline by Jill Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait to Start This One Again","review":"Although this is a skinny little book and today it's dark and dreary, a perfect day for reading, I didn't expect to read Adams Fall in one sitting. But I did. I just couldn't wait to find out what else was - or wasn't - going to happen to this poor, crazy guy. I don't usually read a book for the second time so soon, but I think I will start this one again right away. Believe me, I will be looking at everything with a slightly different eye this time. Gosh, what does Harvard think of this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to learn about the Brain!!!!","review":"This book offers an easy to read, insightful view into how the brain works through the use of fascinating stories. Klawans takes the reader through his patient's syndromes and stories and analyzes what could cause these symptoms. I did not need a medical background to understand most of the book, though you had to remember what medical history was revealed in previous chapters as some stories used past disorders to build on further ones to show how the brain and modern medicine has evolved throughout history. I gave this book four stars because it kept me intrigued and made me want to learn more about the brain and how it works. Sometimes textbooks are to dry for me to want to learn and this book made the information entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone who has been exposed to some biology and neuroscience and wants to learn how the brain can affect the body as a whole from feeling in the toes to rapidly changing emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"An underwhelming effort","review":"I was deeply disappointed by this book. The entries on individual stories don't provide basic bibliographical information about first publication or subsequent appearances. Entries consist of facile plot summaries with next to nothing by way of critical insight or biographical context. I'm astounded such a feeble work was even published. The work of S. T. Joshi on Bierce is far more substantial on both bibliographical and biographical issues. The only use for such a book as this is if you can't remember in which story a particular character appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penny Collecting","review":"As a child, my Grandfather collected pennies for each of his Grandchildren.

She had arthritis in her hands and I would insert the coins for her. This was in the 1940s. I started my own collection which was later lost in a move cross country. A few years ago, I started again, but now I find I cannot secure the coins properly and they fall out. I have tried various tools without much success. This makes me sad, as the folders are convenient and inexpensive and take up a relatively small space. Now I must find another method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas","review":"I saw Regis sing Marshmallow World with Craig Ferguson on the Late Late Show on CBS and decided then to get the album. (even though Craig is not actually on this album) It's one of my favorite songs though apparently less well known to just about everyone I mentioned it to! In any case the album has a nice nostalgic feel to it and the selection of songs included are nice sing-along and feel-good Christmas music. Regis' voice is just okay but comfortable to join in with, and Joy's voice is beautiful. I love the album.

However, this is such saccharine dribble, you will either find yourself in a sugar-induced coma or in a ceramic bowl emptying the contents of your stomach. The second 'star' for this review is for pure unashamed audacity for putting out a Christmas album of homely standards and then being surprised that he did such a deed.

No excessive force was applied - this is a flimsy, cheaply made, utterly worthless piece of junk. To put it in perspective, it cost 6 times as much as the price of the one bottle it sealed before it broke.I have had other Rabbit products, the signature opener, and the foil cutter, and both worked fine.

So far it has worked very well. It's nice because you manually adjust it to tighten-untighten it, so it's very easy to put in/take out & it works on almost all bottles.After reading other reviews I try to not overtighten it, but still get a good seal. Because of this I lose a small amount of bubbles in champagne (maybe 10%), but even with that it still outperforms (BY FAR!) the cheap sealer I bought from Walmart. We typically finish off champagne or wine over the course of 2 or 3 days & can't tell a difference at all in the quality of wine & barely notice the change with champagne.I have only stored our opened wine & champagne upright, so I don't know how well it seals when the bottle is on it's side.So far for our needs it has performed very well. If that changes I will update my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't over-tighten!","review":"I was very hopeful about this product, having read so many positive reviews.

It was easy to use and when I opened the bottle the next day, the water was completely sparkling still, more than it ever has been with just the regular cap on it, so I was very excited about it and ready to order several for friends. But then I sealed it back up and it broke. I don't know if I over-screwed it, but I thought it should be turned as far as it would go until it stops. I may have gone too far, because it broke immediately.

Also fits around plastic liter bottles. To make it work takes a few seconds worth of patience -- just twist the sealer until it starts getting tight. I think the inside of the device expands as you twist to fit the inside of the bottle. Sometimes I didn't seal it completely--it's easy to tell when you don't twist it enough or don't put it on straight because you can easily pull it off the bottle, rather than having to twist it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Complete garbage, typical of China-made products.

This is in stark contrast to the image that I have developed of the man who is often self effacing in his lyrics. The other parts of this DVD are simply poor except for the three song video which is well worth watching. Except for that part, don't buy this DVD for the music.To say that I was disappointed in a number of ways would be an understatement.

The Synergy episodes are good quality and compare favorably to other MLM sets - realize though that these are from the mid-1950s and not remastered.I did notice on Synergy's Volume 1 set the episode order is erroneously listed on both the box and the DVD menuswith the fifth title actually running first. The correct order is \\"The Contract\\", \\"Countess Margie\\", \\"Honeyboy Honeywell\\", \\"Margie's Mink\\", \\"Shipboard Story\\", \\"Who's Married\\".

The question was not one of \\"philosophical semantics\\" for them, it was about the precondition of knowledge.The problem is not the trivial one about which philosophers now obsess. We can all agree that if snow is white, then the statement \\"snow is white\\" is true.

Now, I'm down with crazy and strange. What I'm not down with is bad.SPOILERS AHEAD:In a nutshell, Batman has to go up against Xenomorphs that have been mutated, combining their DNA with that of several of our favorite Arkham Asylum residents...it's an Army thing...super warriors, you know? The idea isn't all that bad, but the execution is horrendous. The writers took a neat conceit and blew it. David Fincher did the mixed DNA thing very well in Alien 3, and Alien 4 was an odd but creative misfire that extended it. This one just blows up the shotgun barrel.The art makes it worth a star.

The Boston Symphony Orchestra under Sir Colin Davis' direction give some of the most vibrant performances I have heard of these symphonies. Although they may have been eclipsed by Davis' recent cycle with the London Symphony Orchestra and Ashkenazy's with the Philharmonia Orchestra as definitive recordings, they remain among the most compelling recordings of Sibelius' symphonies out there. Without a doubt, they are a steal at this price, and are my recommendation as an excellent introduction to Sibelius' symphonic music. Accardo's exquisite playing of the violin concerto rounds out this impressive set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype and reality","review":"I recently bought the Sibelius Volumes 1 and 2 in 2-in-1 sets. I wont comment on the artistic content as they are covered in others reviews of this page. The sound quality of Vol 2 is decidedly degraded - almost unlistenable - compared to the much much higher quality of Volume 1 (with magnificient artistry). The transfers are AAD on the Phillips label which, like DGG, of the 1970's are not meant for better quality music systems (even of that period) and unless remastered disappoint the listener. It is possible that reissues for this particular packaging could be faulty or may be that the repackaging is so cleverly done that all the goodies are on Volume 1 and the second-best on the second. Davis is redoing the Sibelius Synphonies with LSO and that may account for the rush to get this set out of the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimony","review":"Who remembers Abendroth ? Another student of Felix Mottl, his nickname was nothing else than \\"the other Furtwängler\\" (gulp) and it is all too sad that his major recordings of Schumann or Beethoven are so rarely recommended. Here is, in my opinion, one of the two or three best interpretations of the Fifth Symphony on record. Less hurried than others (Knappertsbusch for instance), Abendroth gives this work a sense of grandeur only to be found in Jochum's live recordings. The only shortcoming here is sound quality : good enough for a 1949 recording, but a bit noisy. But that shouldn't prevent any serious collector and, to a wider extent, any Bruckner fan to buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doug Stapp \\"STATIC\\"","review":"Well,we've all seen it, heard it before, what's so amazing about this new guitarist that would make him stand apart from the pack?

The Ronald McDonald magic show was more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some decisions by Maiden simply amazes me...","review":"Some decisions by Maiden simply amazes me... It seems that sometimes they dont'know how ridiculous they can be. This once majestic band decided to release a show mixed with a magician presentation. Alright, I'm not against innovations... But to release a show featuring the tour when Bruce Dickinson had already decided to leave, when the atmosphere amongst the band member were not good due to that (check their official biography, RUN TO THE HILLS) is not a ver clever choice. Also, to face that guy Janick Gers is a real test of perseverance. He's the most untalented guitarist ever to front a mega band. I think he runs and runs around to disguise his lack of playing.The magic part is ludicrous, annoying, childish. this show is all cliche and no quality.

I can't express the dissapointment in the sound. As a previous person posted, you can't hear Bruce's vocals. I anxiously changed all possible setting in my receiver in hopes that it would make a difference. No chance. It is terrible. Even the two-channel option was unacceptable. I also thought the magic and other stuff was kind of cheesy, maybe it's because I'm in my thirtys and no longer a teen. But, Maiden is about the music and nothing else. As far as the performances, I was dissapointed in that as well. Hopefully, they release another DVD of Live after Death with better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent piece of entertainment","review":"The last Iron Maiden performance to be fronted by the God of heavy metal vocalists, Bruce Dickinson (until he returned!).

We all know that the post-Adrian Smith Maiden lineup was just average. Bruce's last two Maiden CD's (Fear of the Dark and No Prayer For The Dying) were sub par.

Anyway, I figured I had to get the DVD just because it would be cool to have a Maiden DVD. Not a great move, it turns out.The one positive thing I can say is that the picture quality is impressive. This thing looks cool. But then you have to listen to it, and it falls apart. Whoever did the mix should be embarassed. This was the first concert in 5.1 that I've purchased, and it about turned me off to any future purchases. Horrible, muddy sound with Bruce's vocals buried waaaayyy back. The stereo mix is fair. But why buy a DVD to have a regular stereo mix?

As a teacher and artist this will be a vital book for me. This book is helpful to put vague, arty ideas (such as composition and handling of edges) into crystal clear language with visual examples. This is not a how-to multi-step book (yawn -- too many of those already!). Other reviews cite the text as a bit 'dated' for language (printed in the 50's) and only black-and-white illustrations, but that is of little concern. Color pictures are not needed to understand the ideas presented. I did not find the text too dated. This book contains ideas for beginners through advanced artists, although I think it will likely confuse the beginner who is just starting to paint. I'd still recommend getting this for the beginner however -- just know that you will only understand certain ideas as you practice painting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Every Artist","review":"This book is a must read for all artists.

I ended up underlining almost the whole book! This is a must for the reference bookshelf of any artist, beginner or professional. While the writing style might seem a bit outdated, remember that Carlson was born in a different time and in another country and I have to say I found it charming.

It doesn't have much text in it, but what there is is awful. This book is filled mostly with emotional and philosophical ramblings instead of useful and practical information that teaches you to paint landscapes. The author says painting must be learned by practice and can't be taught. Then why did he write a book? Carlson's own paintings and drawings are of poor quality. They are crude and sloppy. I don't think such a poor artist is worth learning from. I wouldn't want to paint as poorly as he did. This is a stupidly written, uninformative book, a waste of money.

The >> and << press and hold does not fast forward normally, sometimes it automatically takes you back to the beginning/end of the track/song. It's a 50/50 chance if you'll be taken all the way back or not. Also after pressing the Stop button and then pressing Play it takes you to the beginning of the CD instead of resuming where it stopped. This may not sound like a big deal when playing a music CD, but it becomes a HUGE problem when playing an MP3 which has many hours on each CD/MP3 and often long audio-books are on them, and to find where you stopped can be very time consumming and therefore irritating.

The breadth of brands covered in Watches International 2000 and the depth of coverage are questionable at best. While most of the information is organized well and presented in a seemingly objective fashion, at times, the focus of this book seemed to be on marketing rather than on the watches themselves. For instance, the section on Bedat appeared to come straight out of a Bedat advertisement. Sections like this beg the question, \\"Did certain makers contribute generously to the financing of this publication?\\" Furthermore, some of the makers that have been included seem to have been selected based on their watches' high ticket prices rather than on the maker's ability to make a superior timepiece. If objective information on fine timepieces is what you are looking for, spend your money on Wristwatch Annual 2000 by Peter Braun instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY SHORT LIFE - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"As many other reviewers have said, after a short time - maybe 6-8 months, it quits reading CDs - giving the error \\"no disc\\".B4 that it was great - wonderful sound, etc. but a very short life.

It's a lot of silver plastic that sounds like - plastic. For its size and weight, I expected much more. Also, the minuscule LCD display is too small to read. The 'mega bass' is a joke - 'on' it approximates a AM radio; 'off' it's a tin can on a string; my $40 PC speakers sound far and above better. Stereo separation is better then expected for a portable, but the lack of any bass/mid's makes this unacceptable. Also, the controls' placement and design keep one guessing as to what is what.

I bought this one after listening to it compared to many other boomboxes in BestBuy, and decided to buy it based on how it sounded to the other systems, and also that I was very pleased with my mother's. I've had this system for about 3 months now, but I haven't really used it much since the first few weeks, b/c the sound quality really bothers me. When I turn my system a few notches, it quickly picks up a static fuzziness. It may just be my system, b/c it didn't seem like I heard that distortion in BestBuy, but it also could have been that all the background noise in the store covered it up. On a positive note, the system does have a cassette player and a pretty decent radio, but based on my experience, I could not recommend this system to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!

These hard to find recordings by german born, russian trained pianist Peter Rösel make some of the strongest cases for the more challenging 1st and 4th concertos especially. He creates a tremendous sound from the piano without it sounding at all clangy. There is ample virtuosity accompanied by interpretive sensitivity and subtle rubato. Tempos are not so fast allowing for much expression of nuance. Grab both this and the CD of the 1st and 2nd concertos if you can find them. The 1982 sound is excellent as is the accompaniment of Kurt Sänderling and the Deutsch Sinfonie. I also own excellent recordings of the 3rd by Horowitz/Ormandy/NYPO and Janis/Munch/BSO and Hough/Litton of the 4th concerto finding these Berlin classics recordings to be fully competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linux System Administration Certification Handbook","review":"I got this book to study for the Caldera Openlinux course, It's a really good one that covers exactly what you need for the first part of the exam.

My 3 year old learned to swim & my 5 year old, who already knew how, learned to do the over arm freestyle and is even starting the side-breathing. The techniques are easy to learn and the instructor is terrific!Most important, the video teaches children to fall in the water and save themselves, with clothes on and in all different types of situations.

I turned it on, and then the camera zoomed very well, and still took very clear pictures. Also, it has 2 other GREAT features: Records Videos and Records Audio(Sound).I really recommend this camera, it is really good, way better than many other cameras, and very cheap.

After exactly 25 days of first using the camera, it stopped working. Completely. It will turn on but that's it. No ability to take pictures or view those already taken. I'm not an avid user, I probably used it a total of 10 times. Perhaps this was a defective model I had the misfortune of recieving? In any event I plan to exchange it and see if I have better luck with another one. It was a wonderful camera when it actually worked.

One would think that would be a selling point, but they manage to screw it up by making Stewart read in what is best described as a generic god-like voice.To make matters worse, the imagery is older than old school. No polished CGI here.

As two haunted, scarred souls work through the maze to find love, in direct contrast stands the troubled marriage of Sarah's brother and his cruel wife who is bent on seducing Lucien.

Sadly, if Christ is the focus then only 6 references to Jesus are made or what he said. All of the rest are references from Paul, Peter, John, James or Jude. Given the fact that Jesus was a Jew, there is no evidence of this nor is there any evidence that he expected people following him to accept his Jewish teachings. Being a Christian from the content of this book seems to be a whole new religion having nothing to do with Judaism. Therefore I find this book not helpful and on another track.

Breakins to computers just for the heck of it. Hooliganism, as the book calls it.But there are more serious attacks. Phishing-style, for example. Where financial fraud is being tried on an unwary user. No adequate technical answer is given to this by the book.Further along the scale of severity is cyber terrorism, or even cyber war. These are disguished by the former being done by groups unaffiliated with any government. While the latter is, or might be, performed by one government on another.

Indeed, the composer himself disowned them. There is intrigue and excitement in the Second, but the present third is uneventful and totally unmemorable. Nevertheless, Jansons typically makes it sound convincing.In the Fourteenth, Shostakovich is, again, not as spectacular as he was in his preceding compositions. Sergey Aleksashkin cannot be faulted however, his Russian is vividly caught and his sonorous tone is perfectly matched to Shostakovich's vocal vision. Larissa Gogolewskaja is not in the same league as her famed accompaniment. Jansons is typically fine, as is his fantastic Bavarian forces.Again, both these works suffer from a lack of sparkle and are unmemorable. They certainly do not belong in a highlights collection of Shostakovich. For completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Gibbs I beg to differ.","review":"Irradiation is very safe. Titan Inc.

But Paul Giammati was NOT the actor to pick for this role -- his performance was pretty much like a hole in the middle of the series. The camera work went from distracting to downright annoying with all of the crazy angles (either the camera man has one leg shorter than the other, or the director was striving, unsuccessfully, for a dramatic effect). After watching the second installment, we gave it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homer Simpson, Founding Father?","review":"I agree with most of the negatives people have laid out regarding this series. I don't think anyone who watches it can come away with an accurate view of Adams or the time period unless they have prior knowledge. I'm not going to give a long list of my disappointments with this film since they've already been said by others, but I'll leave you with this one observation that has so far gone unnoticed or unmentioned:IN TOO MANY SCENES, JOHN ADAMS LOOKS LIKE A FLESH AND BLOOD VERSION OF HOMER SIMPSON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Blame the Material!","review":"Let's call a spade a spade--this was just not very good movie making. I forced myself to watch every episode but the finale (my dedication has limits). Each time I wanted the show to do well, but each time it left me oddly unengaged, as if I were getting the story second-hand from a disinterested correspondent. Is it the curse of the American revolution, whose story can't seem to be made into an entertaining movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no John Addams Here","review":"McCullough's excellent book is poorly treated in this mini-series. After watching the series you have no clue of what Addams or the founding fathers accomplished.Addams and Hamilton are particularly poorly portrayed, you have have no clue to Addams fiery nature or Hamilton's financial dynamo and the impact they had on the creation of the country.The series is ultimately boring because it give us no insight into the great accomplishment that was the lives of these men and women.Much like the movie Ray at the end we have not yet seen what made John Addams great. Read McCullough's book or Ron Chernow's Hamilton, they give a sense of great adventure and accomplishment of these men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit bumping me!","review":"The acting, dialogue, and pacing are all superb--credit the director and the actors for that. Where the movie falls down is in the camera work, which comes close to ruining the entire series. Apparently, no tripod was used for the camera work in this film. Instead, the point of view is always moving--up,down,side to side. Imagine yourself in a movie theater, trying to enjoy the story unfolding on the screen before you, but the person next to you keeps bumping your shoulder, jarring the image in front of you, causing you to lose your concentration. That is the practical result of the camera shenanigans used in this movie. As a result, the viewer is never quite able to lose himself in the film. And that is a shame, for it is a compelling story. Instead, we are continually being \\"bumped\\" by an intruding Director of Photography. The camera work should never draw attention to itself, at least not to the exaggerated extent that it does in JA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The production values were great, but really, this was just DULL. I don't know how it won so many awards -- it's like they think a lot of low lighting and scenes spoken in whispers (which i couldn't hear w/o cranking up the volument) made it 'classy.' I blinked and missed the Boston Tea Party. Still not sure when they did the Rev War and Dec of Inde. And sorry, but I just couldn't stand watching Paul Gia in scene after scene looking like a pop-eyed toad.Historical inaccuracies were also annoying. Minor point, but the Title menu was not quite intuitive and tedious to maneuver thru.In addition, altho i bought this set new, and my dvd player is new, it hung up several times in my player.

The miniseries gives us a fascinating look at the maneuverings of our earliest American politicians. The relationship of Adams and his wife Abigail touches the heart, although their problems are not ignored. Jefferson and the other leaders who dealt with Adams are vivid characters, not just icy portraits in a history book. You will not find a better dramatization of our nation's history. And this is our actual history; the series does not just use a historical backdrop for a nonsensical action extravaganza. Learn something about your country, and have a great time doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story In History","review":"Wow. To read and now watch the life of John Adams' adult life is to get a superlative glimpse into the founding of our nation.

The only hesitation was that it came out on DvD first, but when the Blu-ray version came out I bought it. The production demanded that clarity in detail.The show also showed how.. well. REtarded America had become in education in regards to our children and how well people spoke outside of monosyllabic dialogue nowadays.

I have yet to get pass the first three episodes. I undrestand the effect they were going for, use of a steady cam to simulate actually \\"being there\\" but to use it when a couple is lying in bed having a conversation is ridiculous. I found it annoying to watch. The crooked camera angles are reminiscent of the old 60's Batman series. I found it very distracting from the story being told that I just had to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this series. I only watched half of it. The insert in the box said it was rated PG but I didn't know that full frontal nudity, and explicit love scenes, were included in that rating. I expected a film that would give my family a better understanding of history, not sex-education and anatomy. It was also more gory than I expected. None of that needed to be in there to portray the historical events. There should have been a warning in the purchase information. My children were appalled that I would buy something like this. It was very embarrassing that I did. I bought it because I love American history but \\"Hollywood\\" has to ruin everything.

Not much else to add, was on time and the product was what I had in fact ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting tribute to a courageous patriot","review":"Appropriately, the HBO mini-series portrays John Adams in a positive light. He was responsible for critical decisions such as naming George Washington to lead the continental army and to stay out of war against the French and British during his presidency.The minor historical inaccuracies do not detract from the story. The mini-series speculates on the role that Abigail Adams played in her husband's decision making. Clearly she was a bright and incisive political thinker.One of the most interesting features of the film is the raproachment between Jefferson and Adams. The mini-series should be required viewing for all those in politics today."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Price Liberty?","review":"The John Adams Mini Series on DVD is well worth the hours it takes to view the whole set. The screenplay is based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams. Both the book and the mini-series take their audiences back in time through the hearts and minds of John and Abigail Adams. The experience is inspiring and exhausting. The family is as dysfunctional as it is exemplary, as reasonable as it is exasperating, as visionary as it is blind-sighted. A democracy in Iraq does not seem impossible after watching the characters and circumstances responsible for the formation of American democracy. John Adams is cinema at its best. It represents the past so well that it inspires hope for the future. What is the price of liberty? John Adams gives an answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"History comes alive","review":"My husband and I loved the book and couldn't wait for the miniseries to come out.

You don't need to be a history buff to enjoy this DVD. Beautiful cinematography, costumes, and fine acting by Paul Giamatti (I want to watch Sideways again!) and equally talented Laura Linney, the series will take you back in time to our founding fathers' struggle to create a new nation. Directed by Tom Hooper (Elizabeth I), along with the music score by Joseph Vitarelli and Robert Lane, the series will take you on a amazing, magical journey. Now, I don't know how accurate the movie is to the actual event. For that I will read David McCullough's book --- all 651 pages of it! As far as the DVD goes, however, this one is a keeper.

This is truly in that rare company.It may be good that I didn't read the book as I read those negatively jaded reviews here...but I can't think of any movie/video that can capture the imagination filled tapestry of a well written book....so judging a movie/mini-series from that standpoint has always seemed pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painless American history study!","review":"This video jumpstarted interest in this period in American history in our homeschooled 17-year-old, and started mom and dad re-reading the McCollough book around which it is framed. We found it mostly true to the historical account with some small allowance made for the exigencies of movie-making. A few scenes might need to be skipped over for of younger kids at parents' discretion. One really feels a part of the times when watching. It was very difficult not to watch in one sitting! A real \\"page-turner\\" (or disk changer?)! We found the casting right on target, and the casting of George Washington seemed nothing less than amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"John Adams (HBO Miniseries)I had read and enjoyed the book very much. So, I had been waiting for this series to come on DVD, since I had not seen it on HBO, and I was not disappointed. The casting was perfect, Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney as well as the rest of the cast were terrific in their roles. It is such a pleasure to visualize historical events. I read someplace that it wasgloomy, but I didn't find it so. In fact, just the opposite is true, you appreciate the difficulties these great people had in their daily life before modern medicine, transportation, etc. and you can only be inspired by their faith in God. We are so fortunate that they were such idealists, ready to sacrifice themselves for this new country. Abigail showed a spirit of true conservative feminism asking John \\"to remember the ladies\\" while she was also dedicated to her home and family.I recommend this series to anyone who wishes to better themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic American History","review":"This is the best use of your entertainment money. It is an amazing, well-written docu-drama about the evolution of our country from English colonies through Jefferson's presidency. To put words into the mouths of our Founding Fathers and get a strong sense of their personalities - John Adams in particular, of course -- is the best history lesson you can get. And be entertained to boot!! The acting is superb, the visuals are stunning and the story, well, we all think we know it but it is astounding to \\"see\\" it in a modern way. Beats a history book in high school any day. Well worth the money. Family can watch it together, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Historically Authentic Film Biography","review":"This is an excellent film biography. It is clear that great pains have been taken to get the historical details right. The close involvement of Pullitzer prize-winning biographer David McCollough no doubt helped to ensure this. At the same time it is not dry history, but engrossing and entertaining, as we get a sense of the truth that history is -- in large measure -- the history of real people. This is not an exercise in hagiography, not an exercise in myth-building. John Adams and the other Founding Fathers -- as well as Abigail Adams, and others -- are painted \\"warts and all\\". Yet at the end we come to respect them and admire them more truly as people we feel that we really do know.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams miniseries (HBO)","review":"I first rented this from our local public library not knowing what to expect, and I liked it so much I went on Amazon.com to purchase it!

John Adams is known to many as a \\"Founding Father\\"..yet pales in comparison to those better known such as Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and yes, even John Hancock. This film rights the wrongs history has done to Adams legacy. I defy anyone to watch it and come away with not a better respect for a man whose sense of justice extended to enemies as well as friends. Behold a man who made mistakes, but whose honest simplicity of nature would not allow him to support a lie over a truth. It\`s reported that Adams claimed later in his life that no one would build statues and memorials to his name. This film makes the case for doing just that, in honor of a humble man whose oratory skills made the greater case for american independence from Britain, and forming a checks and balances executive, legislative and judicial government, that became the United States of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what an eye opener.","review":"I have been to the memorials in DC several times. The Lincoln memorial in DC is perfect, the Washington monument is appropriate. But every-time I have gone to the Jefferson memorial, I feel something is missing here. Now I know what it is. If Adams was the voice and Jefferson was the pen, and they together were the north and south of our independence and liberty. Then they should have two statues of these men in the Jefferson monument. One on each side, facing each other with our sitting in the center to contemplate what John McCullough has so very definitively brought to light.

This mini-series does the book, John Adams, and the viewer great injustice.Overacting is the lightest offense. Anyone who has read much of Adams' own words will have a difficult time seeing him in this series.However those who know anything HBO has done, will have no difficulty discerning their fingerprints on this series. Partial male frontal nudity in the first episode (a man's clothes are torn from him while he is tarred and feathered). The second episode (dis) graces us with Franklin talking about castration and men's 'stones'.What would have been an entertaining and educational series, reflective of Adam's own values, has been corrupted and poorly executed. That McCullough has allowed his name to be associated with it is quite dissappointing.The much older John Adams series, while less professionally polished, shines far more brightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The camera work was worse than my kids are capable of producing (like a hand held recorder being held by a drunk) and I was very disappointed to hear David McCullough's endorsement of this film. I too feel strongly that we should all know our history better than we do but Hollywood isn't the place to get an accurate portrayal of history. I suggest David McCullough's book, Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, The Boston Massacre by Hiller Zobel, anything the Founding Father's wrote themselves, and not a horrible movie like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"First disk was good except for the full nudity","review":"I have to rate this one because of the unnecessary full male nudity and drawn out scenes of a woman's breast. This isn't about \\"what's wrong with a human body\\" argument time. This was a historical docudrama. The nudity only distracted from the story. It served absolutely no purpose. Had it been properly R rated, I wouldn't have to be writing this review because I would have skipped watching anything R rated from HBO.The above is a good enough reason to skip this series. However, the series didn't measure up after the first DVD. The first disk was very engaging for me. It was interesting how the US was begun, according to this story teller. I suppose I should read the book if it's at all based on fact. The last two DVDs were more soap opera interpersonal relationships that got boring after awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great show, worth watching","review":"When I saw the first advertizing for this show and noticed that Paul Giamatti would have the leading role in HBO's mini-seriesJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries), I had my doubts that he could pull it off.

Giamatti ended up more than \\"pulling it off\\", he did an outstanding job, doing justice to McCullough's wonderful novelJohn Adams.The producers took the time to do it right--costumes, set-design... even using the language of the day.

Paul Giamatti is incredible in the title role as John Adams; Laura Linney is also wonderful as Abigail Adams. Their story moved me to tears in the end and left me wanting to know more about them and others who were instrumental in the founding of our country. Added bonuses are the brief vignettes showing the making of the series. I hope that others will come away from it as I did wanting to know more and with a renewed appreciation for these people and what they went through.

In these days of superficial debates about flag pins and flip flops and other nonsense items and accusations about relatively meaningless things like who's more arrogant or whose preacher is more offensive or who panders more to whom, it is especially poignant to be reminded about the great stakes we had then and have today and an vivid example of a much more effective way to address our challenges and find ways to work together.

The actors, especially Paul Giamatti as John Adams, really bring history and the period of the revolution, the writing of the constitution, the fight of America's independence to life. What a human side of these historic figures we have in this series. Having visited the same son-in-law in Boston I could visualize the places well since I had actually walked there. I would highly recommend this for a history buff or anyone interested in the struggles of our country in its beginnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Adams -- WOW!","review":"I found clips on YouTube and immediately knew I had to purchase this DVD! It's a marvelous presentation -- not a documentary, but a dramatic and historically realistic film. The acting is tremendous. John Adams and his wife, Abigail, corresponded while separated -- which they were for many years at a time -- and so there was a great deal of information available to make the film. Also, the story gives one a better idea as to how difficult and dangerous it was to start the United States of America, and how bickering and opposing ideas plagued the founding fathers. Just this weekend, I saw it in the store for approx. 2 1/2 times what Amazon charges, which made my purchase at Amazon twice as sweet!

Very long film (3 DVDs, at least 8 hours), it originally ran as series, so make sure you split your watching into at least 3 parts.

The thing that caught my eye was how they didn't pretty up the sets & people. It looked hard & dirty. You could even hear flies and bugs buzzing."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Rocks","review":"Before seeing the mini series John Adams, READ THE BOOK. It reads more like a great novel than a biography. Then, by all means see this beautiful telling of our country's founding and of this great man. The dignity and sacrifice of Mr. Adams, and the men who birthed the freedom that we precariously guard today, is something to behold. And, as always, Playtone and HBO spared no expertise in the crafting of this stunning series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the book, hated the series","review":"I loved the book so I was looking forward to the series with great interest, however the writers of the series apparently never read David McCullough's book. John Adams as written by the script writers and played by Paul Giamatti is overly stubborn and vain, yes the real Adams was stubborn and vain but if he was as stubborn as played in the show; nobody would have had worked with him. The series skips over big chunks of Adams' life and areas of historial interest (his renew of his friendship of Jefferson is hardly mention.) instead Giamatti goes around scolding people.One bright spot is Laura Linney's Abigail Adams, it's dead on; from what I have read about old Abby you didn't mess with her or her family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many historical inaccuracies for me - Read the book","review":"How did David McCullough allow this? I was shocked at the liberties taken with American history in the series that were completely absent in the book. Adams is shown showing up after the Boston Massacre to cradle the dying, then he's present at Lexington. NONE of this is true! There are far too many others to mention but the one that really put me over the edge is that they have Ben Franklin stating \\"After all, we have a Republic, if you can keep it,\\" to Jefferson and Adams in France, 1785 while this country was still being governed under the Articles of Confederation. Correct me if I am wrong but I am pretty sure that he stated this to an anonymous woman in Philadelphia, PA in September of 1787 after signing the new Constitution. If you love history skip this thing and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"john adams","review":"I enjoyed this series very much. John Adams is a man that every American could emulate. Would that his kind of man would be living in the White House always. It was well-done and the acting was supurb. Even though John Adams was not a handsome man, he was not quite as homely as Paul Giamatti was made up to be - in my opinion, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"nudity warning","review":"The movie was entertaining, though I question the validity of some of the events and situations that were depicted. I didn't feel like the founding fathers were treated respectfully by the writers. My main objection, however, is the unnecessary (and I believe inaccurate) full frontal nudity in the tar and feathering scene. And the lengthy, and again very unnecessary, woman's breast scene at the end. I feel it was a thinly-veiled appeal to HBO's baser audience and ruins an otherwise O.K. movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs to be rated--not suitable for children","review":"I was disappointed by the level of unnecessary violence and nudity in this DVD.

If you really want to understand this man and this period in our American history you have to read the biography by David McCullough. The HBO series is entertaining but does not capture the essence of 1776 America or the details which John Adams captured in his writings which are featured in the book.

Our 11 year old is actually excited about watching it and even bought the soundtrack. The film is approachable for children, though the language occasionally requires interpretation and there are some gory scenes, i.e. people with the pox and surgery.

Nevertheless, \\"John Adams\\" was a revelation for me. It's not just that it contains information about one person's life and career. The little known facts and stories around our 2nd president, as well as many of his contemporaries [Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hancock, etc] bring the birth of our nation to life. \\"John Adams\\" also debunks some of our nations 'cherry tree type' myths, while bringing the realities of real sacrifice for the sake of freedom to the screen. I recommend \\"John Adams\\" to teachers for their classrooms, to history buffs, and to anyone who wants to watch an honest-to-gosh 'reality show.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funding Fathers","review":"It is a good series which take us to the origins of the United States History.

This is a movie, and all historical retellings are inaccurate to some degree and do you want to know why? Because you were not there nor was I; which means even if we \\"new\\" for a fact what exactly happened, we will still have some of the facts wrong...none of us were there.So the moral of this rant, is enjoy this historic film for what it is...I am sure that they got it pretty close to the mark.

Alot I didnt know. Then I bought the Dairy of John Adams, wich was written in almost every day for over 50 yrs. As I read the Dairy I found that their journeys were laid out in map form, listing places, towns, hotels, sea ports, Churches, castles...etc. I decided to look up these places using google earth and come to find out that 240 yrs later these places still exist. For example John and Abigail stayed in Cowes for a week at the Fountain Inn. Its still there and one can google earth it and see the exact place they stayed. Then they moved down the road to see a famous church, its stil there. I followed them accross the Atlantic using the Lat & Long they wrote down. It is alot of fun to trace their journey from town to town, as they describe the places that they are in, and you can see exactly what they saw.

The book comes with about 8 sheets of special shrink plastic. You will need ordinary colored pencils and it would be great to have a Sharpie, preferably a fine point one, and a pair of small scissors, as well as an oven and cookie sheet. The book is full of small color images; the kids trace an image with a Sharpie or black colored pencil, color it in with colored pencils, cut it out carefully (parents might want to help ages 7 and under) and bake it. The plastic shrinks, which is great fun for the kids to watch through the oven door. The plastic curls up at first and you're SURE it won't work but it does!

It is just like when we were kids,but you get to design your own drawings. It does seem to work better with colored pencils rather then markers. The first few dinks my daughter did with crayola brand markers (NOT WASHABLE) and the ink kept rubbing off even after baking. If you want to use markers, Sharpie brand seem to work the best (We use them to outline the drawing.)

Even my sister in law showed great delight with this book, as she has had prior experience, too. We also chose to included aShrinky Dinks Refill Packas the book only contains eight pages of Shrinky Dink paper to use.

I used it the first weekend after receiving them. I installed curbing around most of my flower beds and capped them with a nice decorative cap stone. The kurb kit is easy to use. I used extra wooden stakes to keep it from bowing out when I poured the concrete. Since that time I purchase 2 additional kits and plan to put curbs around all the beds in my yard. It is a inexpensive way to really dress up your yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated material that scams the artist!","review":"This is not an official DVD release. It is a compressed version of the out of print laserdisc release. Some prior reviews have commented on the video quality that is not up to DVD standards - now you know why. Also, in order to fit laserdisc content onto smaller capacity DVD media, they not only compressed the video, but left off 3 songs that were on the laserdisc version and are still referenced on the DVD cover. Anyone who would pay $50+ for pirated material is out of their mind. At least have the patience and common sense to buy it off eBay at a much lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant overview","review":"This is a brilliant overview of the legal framework of analysing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, written for a lay audience.Boyle demonstrates that Palestine is legally a state - recognised by over 110 countries worldwide - and that since Israel has refused to recognise it, and has, in fact, trampled over its sovereign rights, it deserves to be suspended from the United Nations.Israel's entry into the UN, after all, was contingent on its adherence to UN Security Council Resolutions 181 and 194, which, fifty-seven years later, it has failed to implement. These constitute gross violations of international law, for which there must be legal consequences.Boyle effectively proves his points with a learned, yet accessible style; unfortunately, intelligent and reasoned views such as his are absent in American discourse on this topic, especially in the \\"paper of record\\", the New York Times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent book that raises interesting arguments","review":"The author starts with the premise of solving the conflict using international law and precedents set in other similar cases. He writes like an editorialist in the sense that the articles do not really link or go in order. They are just different arguments for the same point. He is a supporter of the PLO and the two state solution, which people here can debate about the pros and cons, but I will not bore the audience. If you want an international law approach to a handful of topics involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict, I recommend the book. If you want a general reader or information on a specific topic involved, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blames the victim....","review":"Palestine, Palestinians & International Law is this:Israel is always wrongPalestinians are always right.This is a piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true feeling of Paradise","review":"I live in paradise.

I ordered this book (and the second book in the series) for him in the hopes that they would encourage him to read. That didn't quite happen. Eventhough he loved the story (I read it to him) and the illustrations are imaginative, the reading level of the book was way too hard for him!

The Boston Symphony Orchesrta and Chorus perform with great verve and power under the baton of Erich Leinsdorf. Not even the exquisite sets of Kempe and Kubelik can compete here. Konya gives the best recorded portrayal of the mystical knight, Lohengrin. He combines chivalry, strength and tenderness in this treasured and moving performance. Amara is memorable as the dreamy, vulnerable, virgin, Elsa. Rita Gorr is her driven, hateful nemesis, Ortrud. Hines is a regal Henry. With such resources Leinsdorf has given us a magisterial, vital, and authoritative reading of Wagner's score, a reference shelf recording that even Kempe and Kubelik cannot equal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reminder of the wretched Leinsdorf, from sooneone who was there","review":"I went regularly to the BSO in the Leinsdorf era, and he was a wretched conductor on the whole. Now that he's long dead, I can almost forget him, until the stiff, unyielding, utterly inert conducting on this CD set reminds me of those awful years. Lucine Amara was dragged in at the last moment as a replacement in the part of Elsa and is quite bad, completely ignorant of Wagner style, too small of voice, etc. Sandor Konya is a joy, however, the ideal Lohengrin.

Seriously? This is a book written for children highlighting the message that \\"if it doesn't feel good, you don't have to do it.\\" Teaching children to do things that are good for them even though they aren't pleasant (eating right, exercising, studying, being respectful) is a lost art in our society and this book just shows it in a few pages.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful English Book","review":"We received this book as a gift from a friend in England. My 2-year-old LOVES it. As the other reviewer mentioned, it is exaggerated and ridiculous, and kids understand that.

There Africa is a cool place to visit with cool animals, bigger than Superland and smaller than the earth (the next thing she offers to buy). I can understand how that sentence might be misinterpreted, but please don't write off this book because of it. It is too much fun.

But the book is just garbage. What are you teaching children when, if they say \\"no\\" to something, you just keep upping the bribe (well-meaning though you may be) in hope that they will comply and then, in the end, you both just skip to dessert?If letting them stay up half an hour late and buying them an elephant isn't enough, heck just let them stay up forever, never bathe, never wash again, never be helpful, buy them a 12 zoos, 14 supermarkets, let them live at a theme park, let them never go to school--then prove to be a truly empty and pathetic parent when, after all that--you give the child dessert instead of dinner.Absolutely no educational value.

The package said that a full charge would last around 15 hours, but mine did not seem to last nearly that long. I've heard that having the volume on a high setting makes the battery go down faster, but I didn't have the volume set very high on mine.2. On your computer, you can't rename files or play them directly on from your player. If you want to rename a file, you have to copy it, paste it somewhere else, change the name there, then copy it again and move it back to the player.3. This player comes with earbuds.

Their formations totally lack any intel about where the Americans are; their commando strikes early in the book have no visible effect on the war effort.The result is that North Korean tanks blindly stumble into prepared American positions with predictable results. It's pretty much a dream scenario for a tank battalion commander. Believe it or not, there's actually *another* turkey shoot later in the book. Add in an improbable romantic sideshow, and you have pretty much a battalion commander's fantasy of the best that a war in Korea could possibly go.The result is a remarkably complacent story by an author who is usually lucid and authorative."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another war story","review":"Never really grabbed me.

Fortunately one US tank battalion and a cavalry troop are in a training area north of the US Army garrisons and stop the main north Korean attack cold giving the US and the South Korean Armed forces time to regroup and counterattack.Proud Legions is the story of the men of this tank battalion and their struggle against the north Korean People's Army.This is a good book to read on the beach.

Macbeth is tenatious, like a bloodhound that will not give up once the sent is found."},{"rating":"2","title":"hamish macbeth a winner once again","review":"This book is definitely one of the best mysteries I have ever read. This is the first time I have ever read a village mystery that could top a Miss Seeton novel. The pacing is excellent and the writing itself is excellent. This book is an great choice for someone who has wanted to try the series but unsure where to start. Death of a Macho Man is a sure hit. I can't wait to read Death of a Dentist (the new hardcover just out)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of a Formulaic Detective","review":"I discovered M C Beaton in Netflix with Hamish MacBeth which is a great series. At first the novels were delightful and I read about six before her repeat of whole sections of text became annoying. I gave up and went back to the more cerebral Elizabeth George and Henkel Manning. Excellent for a few reads though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, as usual.","review":"Death of a Macho Man by M. C. Beaton was delightful. I enjoy getting to know Hamish Macbeth and can absolutely see the countryside around Lockbubh. Beaton's ability with description is phenomenal. The mystery is always wonderful, but the characters remind me so much of people I have known. It is a warm and cozy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loosely written, but some interesting new angles.","review":"I thought this book gave me some interesting things to contemplate regarding life, and why man has created \\"God\\" to protect himself from the ability to forsee his own death. However, most of it seems written in a very sketchy manner that makes me feel that at least half of the assertions are not well founded or researched. Not that I've bothered to follow them up myself.I also found the discussion of germs and their competition for survival very interesting and insightful to human lives in general.I just wish he had written the book in a more controlled, directed, and researched manner. It left me with tons more questions than it answered completely.I hope someone has written a book that elaborates on these topics as they relate to human life and everyday living. But it was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"made in china","review":"ive now had two of these and have also replaced the rotor and cap once and the ignition spark is random causing misfiring. the cap is thin and made in china also. i called mallory for them to send me a made in usa cap and rotor and i got a made in china POS again!

Younger audience members may become bored or laugh at the screen, but I think overall Eddie still has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show","review":"This is a laid back kind of DVD, good with a couple beers and a good HiFi.

The video is not \\"preachy\\", but gives quotes and histories of the life of early Church life using the lives of five saints.

No doubt individual recordings of the various symphonies are available that will have more more flair to them --- definitely, these performances take a strict by-the-numbers approach which may leave more ardent Tchaikowsky devotees feeling chilled. However, by and large, the performances are consistently decent if not great (I prefer a livlier tempo for the Polish, but that's just me).This is the perfect set for those who are largely indifferent to Tchaikowsky's symphonies --- as I must admit that I am these days --- but nonetheless would like to have them available for listening for not a lot of money. It is also a good starter set for those who are just beginning to assemble a basic collection of the standard symphonic repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loves it...","review":"I got an order of this for myself, since it had such good reviews.

But ignoring the religious convictions of a people which underlies the political forces that shapes that people will always leave great gaps in purely secular history. What is lacking in a secular approach is remedied in this American history. The political movements of the pre-revolutionary days through the moral questions that so often divide us into liberal and conservative camps have little meaning without the context of the common faith experiences that have shaped those movements. Few other nations have been influenced by religious culture as has the United States. In this series, PBS has given us the continuity of that religious experience from the earliest European settlements to the present day. A fascinating study of how faith has shaped politics in ways we seldom realize or wish to acknowledge. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody should see this series","review":"This program is a great overview of how integral religion is to American history. And the forces are still in play. It helped me to understand where (and when) Evangelicals are coming from. I had no idea of the very deep roots of the prayer in school issue for example. I like history but I found a lot here that I had not known or had not thought about.

Furthermore, it ignores many differences between major Protestant groups to the point of misrepresenting Protestantism. If Protestants and Catholics are ever to be reunited in faith, that faith must be based on truth. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Debate over Christianity","review":"A more appropriate title for this book is how to hate catholicism. I feel that I have joined a religious cult just by reading this book. By stereotyping catholics, it lends no justice to its comparisons. Calling the arguments biased is an understatement. Perhaps if the author knew something about catholicism, he could make an intelligent argument. Instead, he bring us down to his level.This book was recommended by a teacher of mine. Based on his recommendation, I have lost faith in him. I would have thought he had stronger reasoning ability to form independent thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, fair analysis","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is wrestling with the issue of just what separates Catholics and Protestants. The authors, in my opinion, do a very good job of accurately presenting the Catholic viewpoint, showing its internal consistency, but then going on to show its Biblical inaccuracy. The biggest benefit Protestants and Catholics can get from reading this book is understanding how they both often use the same words to mean very different things -- one of the biggest causes of confusion between the two groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises here ...","review":"It is clear by these reviews and ratings that this book changed no one's opinion. We are still debating the same topics after 450 years. I will say that if you have an Evangelical viewpoint this book will strengthen that view with very clear biblical proofs.Let me ask Catholics this - If God wrote a letter just to you and it arrived in your mailbox would you allow someone else to read it to you and tell you what it said or would you want to read every word for yourself? Put aside the Catechism and just read God's Word. I assure you, you won't get the doctrines of the Catholic Church by just reading the Bible unless you allow someone else to tell you what it says.Just as Jesus held the Pharisees responsible for knowing the Old Testament scripture (and condemned them for adding rules and laws that were not there), we are responsible for searching the New Testament and believing the plain truth that God gave us in the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"pick another please?","review":"it is just silly to me when i think of all the debate against who is right. Does God really care who does what as long as you BELIEVE it doesn't matter!!! I was a devout protestant (yay United Methodists) until recently when i converted to Catholicism. this book gave me little insight on true Catholicism, but merely gave the stereotypes which have been ingrained in our protestant minds throughout our lives. It is sad to see that they dont belong, but i have yet to meet a catholic who hates protestants as much as i have met protestants who are disgusted by the stereotype of catholicism which they arent even familiar. choose another book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PFD","review":"This PFD has extra pockets for storing gear such as light sticks and a whistle, also it is very adjustable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Very little thought has gone into direction.

The alien plot is dull and extremely unoriginal. Kenyon's NA characters are stereotypical in a very unflattering way.

Don't watch it alone. Or when you are really hyped about something. Take the time to watch it carefully, because it is enjoyable and deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Janeane Garafolo movie!","review":"Please look carefully at the director's name before buying. This Paul Thomas movie is actually an adult movie produced by Vivid and not a very good one at that. Luckily I only spent 5 bucks buying a used version and not $69. Oops!

The ironic thing is, im such the fan of janine garofalo it's not even funny. I finally found a film where she rocks. This film is what i've been dying to see janine do. It was such the perfect role for her, and it was filmed in such a way that was creative and art house-ish.I also loved the performances by Margaret Cho and Bobcat Goldswaith. I love their sense of humour, and along with janine, this makes such a raucous dark comedy. There are so many memorable quotes in the movie. The dialogue had me genuinely laughing hard. This is now my favourite janine garofalo movie. Considering it's one of her few starring vechicle films, it surpasses \\"reality bites\\". Now i want to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow starter but stick with it","review":"I almost turned it off but a half hour into it I got hooked.

The real, historic story about the counterfeiters is interesting, but the film doesn't do it justice. I only watched it to the bitter end, because I tried to understand why this movie got so much praise in the German press. I still don't understand. There are much better Holocaust movies.

It is about a counterfeiter called something or other who is forced to make fake dollar/pounds bills at a - yawn!! - concentration camp. The sets were of such poor quality and cost-cutting so evident that it was really shocking. I had an almost claustrophobic feeling; as if some amateur actors got together, selected an abandoned warehouse in erstwhile East German town, discussed a script whilst drinking beer and eating sausages rolls and presto, they get an Oscar. I wouldn't even dare to compare it with classics like Schindler's List. This movie is almost obscene! It leaves you so totally cold and untouched!

When World War 2 broke out, he was transferred to a Concentration camp and he was approached by the same Berlin Detective that arrested him and was now a Major in the German Army.

A film about concentration camps with the most interesting of characters playing the lead. This film is more about counterfeiting and proposes a great reason Germany dominated the war. They counterfeited British currency to four times the actual worth and had in mind to do the same with the Dollar. What just happens then is a never heard before story of the world's history. Strongly recommended film. The Counterfeiters did something I never thought it would from the off set. Highly recommended. It's like the Pianist with not as much as emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Foreign Film!","review":"Really enjoyed the movie, even though I had to read the subtitles to comprehend the story.

The story of the Nazis forcing concentration camp inmates to forge foreign currency to bankrupt England was compelling. The 'dilemma' the characters face of doing good work and enjoying more comfortable survival, or sabbotaging their captors efforts, drives the film. The special features include a Q&A with the Director where a lot of great information is told about what happened to the characters after the War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Germanic Opus","review":"The Counterfeiters is one very good film. It's even better when one considers it is based on a true event within Nazi Germany! Jewish counterfeiters and forgers who ran afoul of the law are in a prison camp and are recruited by the Third Reich to counterfeit American and British banknotes. How this is accomplished and why it ultimately fails is carried out in detail in this film.The film is in German, with fairly large English sub-titles. Among the extras is a queston-and-answer period with the director, who speaks near-perfect English. There are few other extras. Beautifully photographed, it was the best foreign-language Oscar winner for 2007.

The controls are strenuous and needlessly complicated. The sound and music aren't too impressive either consisting mostly of loud rock beats and repetitive play-by-play. The gameplay is completely ruined by the terrible control and lack of characters(around forty I believe). The replay value is practically nonexistent with a pathethic Story Mode, a rather bland Online Mode and an absence of many important stipulation matches. The graphics are transcendent, but that won't save it from receiving a bad rating. Overall I just think this game could've been enjoyable if not for the complete lack of effort by the designers.

The true first edition up to the current one always has content on the same pages because it creates uniformity in message.I would heartily encourage you to wait to get a Big Book for until you have a sponsor, the book is really meant to be read as a two-person experience that can help you recover from the affliction of alcoholism.

I can see why many in recovery today have little use for it (more than half of AA meetings no longer have the book around to sell). One wonders whether the message no longer resonates for the contemporary alcoholic, or if the stilted and cumbersome writing of the author leaves too many befuddled about what the message really is.I'd recommend the book if it was given a contemporary re-write.

He likes itand insisted I watch it too. I think it is grainy, campy, has a weak and very limited story, is poorly acted, music that makes me cringe it is so corny, costumes that look as though they are from an amateur dramatic society's rag-bag, and sets and props that are cardboardy. All 'helped' by many of the English subtitles being out of synch with the pictures. So, its not really the best film I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUST OWN I DONT THINK S0","review":"i like most of you were depending on amazon reviws to by this film. somtimes i wonder if people really even no film. i have over 350 horror movies in my home libray and this one would be lucky to crack the top 300. nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real horrorshow","review":"An absolute farce of a movie.

The bad news is that the movie is very dark. The opening scene that takes place in daylight appears to be at night. The last scene is a bat flying away but the bat can't be seen anywhere. It's just a black screen shot. If you watch the \\"Making OF\\" feature, the bat is clearly there and it almost looks like dawn is breaking. There is obviously something wrong with my copy. I've emailed Synapse Films to find out. I want to return mine for another copy, but it seems they're on back order.

All the details are almost lost and this is a terrible shame. If you wish to 'SEE' the film in a much better presentation, I say watch the standard definition UK Carlton DVD and forget about this awful transfer. Maybe Synapse had their heart in the right place, but the end result needs recalling and correcting. In fact, I have not seen a Hammer film darkened so much since the terrible Warner VHS of Taste the Blood of Dracula... What's worse is the synical excuses that have surfaced in the wake of similar criticism, of presenting the film closer to how it was allegedly 'intended' to be screened. What a farrago!

The problem? He rambles. A lot. Stories of his experiences as the CEO of Herman Miller and his vacations seem to crop up every few paragraphs, and more than a few seem only tenuously connected to the subject matter. I also spotted several plugs for books that he enjoyed without even an explanation as to why he enjoyed them or how they relate to what he's talking about.

Perhaps if I had been a fan of his poetry or hadn't read so many other (better) memoirs, I would have liked this more. I found his writing to be extremely sloppy, and--yes, although it is a memoir, I acknowledge--he seems like an egomaniac. Yes, it's great that you've had such a checkered life and met so many eccentric characters, but it's nothing we haven't seen before.

The author spends more time decribing her travel schedules and the clothing of the characters she interacts with vs. attempting to understand and honestly portray the women and their way of life in a society. It is recommended she spend more time researching the topic before claiming to be an 'expert' on a topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial travelogue","review":"This is a disappointingly superficial 'analysis' of feminism in islamic areas; it is really more of a travelogue with feminism as a loose theme. More attention is paid to the colorful sights, food, characters, clothing, etc. than to any depth of perception or analysis of women's lives and feminism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and pointless","review":"This is a rambling account of the author's travels in Islamic countries as she tries to understand the existence and nature of their feminism. But she recounts a hit and miss series of encounters, a day here and there in each place, and never summarizes what she understands each country's feminism to be, or to compare them. It is a book with potential -- there is value in recounting her personal experience -- but it is too often at the level of what people wore and ate, and disconnected comments about women and feminism. The author doesn't take the next step toward making sense of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not scholarship, nor representative or thoughtful casual reading","review":"This is not Islamic scholarship. Rather, it is the imperialistic impressions of a white American woman who wants to see if the savages have discovered fire. She has no understanding of the history of Islam, its geopolitical variances, nor of the history of \\"Islamic feminism\\" that began in the 1920s in Egypt, Turkey, and other nations simultaneously. Her perspective is arrogance-made-writing, and ignorance profound. Her own scholarly irresponsibility is clear in her bias - and elsewhere, including a lack of real dialog: her tales don't leave the homes of upper-class women and she is satisfied with data collected through (her own) woefully inadequate language ability.Skip this book. Instead, something by the likes of Amina Wadud will satisfy any reader seeking representative and thoughtful casual reading or more profound academic rigor, such asInside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform in Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating, but problematic","review":"This is without a doubt the most informative book I've ever read. The lessons learned are innumerable, invaluable, and unforgettable. Fernea however, is irrepressibly annoying.

Park uses this setup as a vehicle for exploring the religious landscape of the lands through which the two travel. They encounter Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and many other beliefs. Park uses Jeshua's interactions and Corax's commentary to highlight the ideas attributed to Jesus that can also be found in other religions.Park's book is an excellent, fast read, chock full of information but also managing to not be too ponderous or too preachy.

It works well on the camera as an automatic flash, but it gives little scope for creative photography. When used with a FZ30 camera, it sets the aperture at f4.0 and the shutter speed at 1/30 sec, and this cannot be varied. The built in flash allows the flash exposure to be varied by +/- two stops, but the addition of the DMW-FL28 takes away this adjustment. The only adjustments are three stages of flash strength. There is also a auto-macro setting, a manual setting that uses the same three stages of adjustment and a manual setting, again using the same three stages. There is a slave setting, which flashed when I used the weakest setting for the built-in flash, but I did not get any flash in the picture - perhaps a timing problem.

I recently upgraded to a Nikon Coolpix 5700 but wouldn't buy it until I knew the DPS 9000 would work with it. This is a must-have for digital photographers. It completely eliminates the need for batteries without adding a lot of weight and unlike other higher-end external packs, the cord connecting it to the camera is not attached to a waist unit, constantly getting in the way. I started with one and added a second pack. The first time I used it, it lasted as long as four sets of rechargeable batteries had on a previous ocassion. Easy to use, and in the long run easy on the wallet, with no need to ever buy another battery/battery charger. It has a \\"fuel gauge\\" on the side, letting you know how much power you have left. It includes four different connecting cables (and a chart letting you know which one matches your camera) and a car charging unit as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with \\"most\\" cameras","review":"This item was mistakenly shipped to me by Amazon instead of a different battery charger. I thought I might keep it, as the package claims that it is compatible with most Canon digital cameras, plus many other brands. of the 1 Nikon and 3 Canon cameras in use at my office and the one Canon I own personally, it isn't compatible with any of them. Also, there are no instructions included to explain the various components.

You will gain an understanding beyond basic distributions and calculating means.I have both of his books and his presentation is both authoritative and intuitive for the student.There are a ton of exercises and answers.The only reason this is not 5 stars is because it is a little dated. But you can pick this up used on Amazon and it is worth the time for the serious student."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE BOOK","review":"This book is horrific. The student is left clueless. In no way is this for a beginner in probability. its probably for someone who has lots of experience and solid background in probability. Hard to believe that this 1996 book is being used today in 2006 in some schools, when there are several good books published in probability. Either the school wants to fail you, or they just want to make it incredibly tough for the student by deciding to use this. Last semester my school was using the ross sheldon probability, which is much better. This book is of no use other than to be treated as a toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap toy - big disappointment","review":"This bucket looks like it would provide plenty of opportunity for creative play, but it did not. The \\"cans of play-doh\\" were not standard size, but rather, the tiny 2 ounce ones that are pretty useless. The food molds are too small and the dough got stuck. Because of that, my kids left the molds filled with play-doh on the table and went off to play in their \\"kitchen\\" where they played with wooden food toys.You are better off with simple cans of playdoh and a bunch of cookie cutters. This toy was really junky.The only reason I gave this a 2 for durability is because the pieces are made of plastic and wont break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but it doesn'tactually work","review":"I am just about to send my Simplefi back. Functionally, the unit is exactly what I wanted. It even installed in 15 minutes and worked first time. Then the bad news started. It lost its PC connection, and I couldn't get it back. I reinstalled the software, I rebooted the PC. My PC - running Windows XP Home - BSD'd on bootup. I spent two separate hours on the phone to Motorola tech support ahout all of this. They basically admitted it doesn't work with XP, and they don't know why.So this is a real shame. I'd love to keep this device. But it is going back, and Motorala of course won't repay me for shipping it back, or my wasted time. So I have to pay to debug this for Motorola and Simple Devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple To Use","review":"I got one of these about two months ago. I'm running XP, & it took about 15 minutes to install, from the time I opened the box to the time I started listening to music through my stereo. Installation was straight forward, and you could tell that Motorola put alot of thought into the product, based on their excellent documentation. Between the hundreds of internet radio stations available with the Simplefi software & the music I have on my hard drive, I should have plenty of commercial-free music to listen to outside on the deck as I grill the steaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some flaws, but does what it is supposed to do","review":"Does what it is supposed to do: Allows you to listen to mp3's and streaming internet radio on your stereo. The interface is not perfect, mostly because it is a pain to page through every single artist or album (in alphabetic order) to get to the one you want.On the other hand: it is wireless, and it uses an older wireless system, not the newer 802.11b or g. Believe it or not, this is an advantage. 802.11b is notoriously undependable, especially in a home environment, because it shares the same spectrum as cordless phones.Unfortunately, it does not appear that there will be any further development on this product. The software has been at version 1.2 since I bought it months ago. But while the software could be slicker, it is fully functional, and does what it is supposed to do.I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLIMP3 vs Simplefi","review":"I've tried the Simplefi and it was a pain to use.

My unit is definitely going back, and will be replaced with a Sony or something else NON-Samsung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed. Horrible remote.","review":"Have had this for several years. The player actually works okay for both VCR and DVD use.However, the remote control is so poorly designed, I rarely use the unit. The buttons are small, and as another reviewer commented, pressing menu takes you back to the main setup, and you have to start over. It's too bad, because as I said, I have had no technical issues with the DVD play, VCR play, or memory card. You will regret buying this unit. I use component hookup for my DVD, and have the sound connected to a Sony receiver control center. No technical issues at all. Still only a one. What a horrible remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I purchased this because it appeared to be compatible with all formats of dvds including DVD+R-DL. It was.

I bought it because it was on sale at Best Buy for $140. I was excited because it was an early Christmas present for the kids, from their grandma.I did not research it because I knew of others who had Samsung products, and never really had a problem. I really made a mistake in not researching, I usually do.After three weeks, the DVD player broke, with the DVD now stuck inside- the VCR works, but there is a mind-altering flashing on the screen. My sister-in-law later informed me that she had this exact player- she bought hers in June. Her DVD player also broke. She researched and found that this is a very COMMON problem with this particular model. I wish I had known!Please buy something else and don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't. Save yourself the frustration.","review":"I actually have an earlier model Samsung DVD player, and it, along with other Samsung models at the time, had a horrible skipping problem on many DVDs. Samsung's support was almost non-existant -- I found out there was a firmware upgrade for the player, but not through their website (where I couldn't find any help whatsoever), but through a friend with the same problem. HOWEVER, the firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem, and the last I heard, there was a class action suit filed here in Pennsylvania (which I received an invitiation to be a part of, but could not participate in, I think because I no longer had the receipt). Considering their lackluster customer support, I would advise anyone against buying any DVD player from this company. Players are much cheaper nowadays anyway, and you can get an excellent Sony or Toshiba for a modest price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD player is a piece of junk","review":"Samsung has the worst customer support I have ever used. There are 3 MAJOR issues for this DVD player.1) Cannot copy DVD's onto VHS.2) Cannot play some international DVDs even though they claim that it can play DVD, DVD-RW etc.3) Digital Optical output sound doesn't work properly.I would not recommend anyone to buy Samsung DVD players unless they are given away for free.One thing to keep in mind is to fast forward the DVD movie, you will have to press down and hold the FastForward button for about 3-5 secs to FF."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE......?!","review":"If I could've given this CD a minus rating I would've.

He has not even had a hit song yet. He won American Idol. Chris Daughtry has already left him in the dust as far as popularity and album sales go.

I mean these are some of the premiere musicians of our era. Well, I was severely disappointed by the lack of effort put into this album.

However the succeeding episodes were absolutely terrible. They lacked depth, creativity or even coherence.

Let hope they continue to release future seasons of Lewis and same way they did for the series 3 release, which is exactly the same as the UK release, uncut and corret show title, or I'll be buying once again the UK release. Series 1 & 2 on the USA releases are missing approx. 10-11 min. of footage in each episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Morse","review":"I enjoyed Morse when it was originally broadcast but found him a depressing character on rewatching. Lewis is a better man -- perhaps not as intellectual, but as good a detective and someone you'd enjoy meeting for a pint. His sidekick is an excellent foil for him -- an intellectual rocker. The plotting is excellent and the production values what you'd expect. I've enjoyed the Foyle's War series the most, but Lewis is a close second.

Pete Townsand of the Who was standing offstage, watching his act, that followed the who's.... and Janis Jopplin turned around and said, \\"he's stealing your act!)

But the rest of the performance is all here in full color - and this was the first time the American audience was really turned on to the Jimi Hendrix Experience. It's a great show - yes, he burns the guitar at the end, but if that's all you're interested in you can see that in the Pennebaker film. This video is best because it is a complete record of him first blowing the audiences minds - and THEN when it can go NO FURTHER, demolishing his equipment. What more can you ask for? A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"There was not a moment of this video that I didn't like.

He was virtually unknown in the U.S. at the time. He was recieved with skepticism, appearing in Monterey with such big stars as THE WHO and JANIS JOPPLIN. By the end of the night, the face of rock and role would be changed forever. Jimi plays a relatively short blistering set, in a time when concert filming was extremely primitive. However, this video is well worth the money, despite the quality of the film. <Oh, yeah.

The highlight is the splendid performance of Brahms' Double Concerto with cellist Janos Starker and violinist Henryk Szeryng both excellent soloists. I have rarely heard such a fine performance of this concerto, with neither soloist outshining the other; both are mutually compatible. Under Bernard Haitink's direction, the Concertgebouw Orchestra yields a warm, vibrant performance. Szeryng's performance of the Violin Concerto is fine, though he lacks the technical prowess of a Mutter or Vengerov, especially in some of the most technically demanding passages in the first movement.

The headpiece is angled so that it doesn't fit flat on your head - instead the weight rests on the back ridge. Worse, the hinge in the middle is slightly below the ridge so most of the weight of the headphones is actually resting on one point - in the middle of your head.Also, when folded they are much bigger than the RCAs and not much smaller than the SONYs - which don't fold at all!Avoid these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sound, nice ear warmers","review":"I owned some Sony MDR-E10LP Earbud Headphones for about a year, but I forgot them at home when I went back for winter break.

Also provide's clean power to your electronics. In other words, it provides a constant flow of balanced voltage to anything that's plugged into it, something that regular surge protector's don't offer. Unfortunately, this luxury is the reason why this thing is so expensive. One thing i liked about the protector is there's a light which illuminates to let you know that your wall outlet is grounded. Ever since i moved into this home, i was unaware that my wall outlet in my living room wasn't grounded out (had a loose wire). I immediately called an electrician to fix the problem and i would have never known the problem existed if it wasn't for the fact that i bought this pricey surge protector. Con's: The Price. You take away the clean power feature, and the thing wouldn't be hardly any different than a 30 dollar surge protector that retails at radio shack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always working","review":"Some people will complain that this is too pricey and you're just buying it for the brand name.

It always lets me know that it's on, it has convenient adapter and regular plug outlets, phone and cable jacks, and everything is pre-labeled. If you're into saving the UPCs and receipts, Monster even provides $$$$$$ worth of a guarantee to back this product. I highly recommend this product if you want to feel secure knowing that your $$ is being well spent and protected.But hey, if you want to trust your pricey entertainment system to a rinky dink, no-name, off brand, made in China, $19.99, Wal-Mart special, then this is certainly not the product for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very classy music.","review":"I remember being at parties or having my own and this album being played.

However, that's not always true, because although the band were often mellow, their best known songs were actually harder-edged or very humorous. \\"Keep On Churning\\" opens this CD in a great rocking mode, and while the rest of the CD doesn't quite keep up the pace, the band prove themselves to be versatile musicians in a variety of styles, with a great sense of humor.

When GG isn't too wasted to sing, he sings very well. Not like with the Jabbers but the ragged voice GG exhibits at this point because of substance abuse fits suitiably.

Prokofiev's Sixth Sym. is seriously nelgected in the catalog, and here we have a first-rate orchestra, the National Symphony, in quite good osund from 1996. They play well for Slatkin, who unfortunatley finds little inner life in the score--his lumpish Sixth is a thing of fitful gestures and no overall purpose. There's some energy in the Scherzo but even that is without spark.Better is the Over. on Hebrew Themes in its orchestral guise--it's one of Prokofiev's most attractive short works. Rather than bringing out its Jewishn folk flavor, Slatkin plays it as blandly as early Samuel Barber. The spiky suite from The Love of Three Oranges shows a bit more spark, but not enough to resuce a routine outing. One is left to ponder what hapened after Slatkin's early promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best 6th !","review":"Those who think this a great performance of a neglected masterpiece need to sample other sources. Walter Weller (Decca) and Neeme Jarvi (Chandos) are far better than Slatkin who is just great with American music but rather light when it comes to Prokofiev and Shostakovich. Gergiev's recent live recordings of the Prokofiev symphonies has unpleasant sound in spots but his performance of the 6th is quite good. They ought to reissue the Ormandy recording stuck in Columbia's vaults somewhere. It's a rather romantic approach to Prokofiev but a great performance nevertheless. For some reason this work is difficult to bring off and probably will always be overshadowed by the more popular 5th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have \\"lively\\" post-rock","review":"This is great post-rock.

Highly influenced by free and improvised jazz skronk and the freeform movements by such guitar luminaries as Ray Russell (recent reissue on Jim O'Rourke's Moikai) & Sonny Sharrock (played w/ Pharoah Sanders, Last Exit w/ Brotzmann, Laswell...) Great own for any avant-guitar-rock fan. Also equally worth checking out is the same trio on 'Lost In The City' (Intakt records) and Moore w/ Surgal on 'Klangfarbenmelodiee...and the colorist strikes primitiv' (on Dead C. honcho Bruce Russell's Corpus Hermiticum label)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecstatic Piece","review":"Ahh, that record is one of the best pieces in my collection. It's really a classic piece: long, tempo changing, stirring, emotional.

Daydream Nation is Puff Daddy near this one. It can't really be described, compared to anything ... Before i bought it i asked other Sonic Youth fans on the internet, how it is, they said \\"it's really a jazz improvisation\\". OK, i said, i like jazz and i like Sonic Youth, i'll get it.

Based on the content of the book, if you have not snagged a man with money while in college, you have missed your opportunity. This book really does not give much input on how an entry level professional would marry up. Secondly, it does not help if you are out of the circle trying to get in. The author makes it obvious that she came from a background with money so it was much easier for her to attract a man with money because she is already in the circle.

I think it is great that the main actor cannot only act well, but can also sing! It's not every day that you get that.Also, looking back to Wild Wild West, I think that song is good too. Will Smith has a way of writing songs that are both rhythmic and invigorating. The other review by \\"a music fan\\" did not reflect or represent this album and artist (Will Smith) well at all.

At that point, it finally turned on and I was able to listen to music for about 20 minutes before the battery went dead again.

My last one (Zen Nano) broke after I dropped it and I wanted something a little more robust. I assumed that the low price had to do with the lack of bells and whistles on this very basic player but apparently it is a reflection of the quality as well. The battery life is horrendous. It only lasts an hour or two in use and seems to drain over night when the device is turned off. The controls are difficult to use and I was unable to get it out of stopwatch mode with hitting reset.

Windows Media Player can't find the device more than half the time, and when it finally does find it, it can't work with it. I also tried it on my MacBook Pro, but with itunes, it's not compatible, and with the audible books due to DRM, I couldn't work around it using it as a hard drive.SO... I sent it back to RCA.I'll give them props that they sent me the upgraded version, the S2002 but it is the same story. It's a hunk of junk that I am going to literally place in the trashcan.

Anyone who buys this recording expecting to hear the Canadian power trio re-invented by classical musicians is getting ripped off. Is it any wonder that the front cover describes the \\"artists\\" as a generic \\"string quartet,\\" rather than telling you exactly to whom you're listening?The arrangements are actually not bad at all; it's a shame that whoever put them together didn't feel the need to hire real musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential, little delivery","review":"Find a place that will let you listen before you buy. I have been a Rush fan since Moving Pictures. I have spent 7 years playing percussion in a concert band and orchestra.

The music itself very well mirrors the focus of the project, the best band of all time (in my opinion, of course) RUSH. Some people, like my wife (who is also a RUSH fan), find the string quartet treatment of any rock band somewhat disturbing. I find it an enjoyable change. All things considered, it is obvious that a lot of hard work went into every aspect of the CD, this isn't some \\"fly by night\\" company. I'm sure the musicians were tired keeping up with the fast paced rythms of YYZ and other high tempo songs. The recording is crisp. The sound is clear. The music is arranged true to the original songs. There's really nothing more I could want as a RUSH fan who also likes symphonic music from time to time. This disc certainly isn't for everyone, but if you're curious and on the fence, I suggest you'll probably like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Translation","review":"This CD is laughable. The artist didn't bother to alter the arrangements to adapt Rush's music to a string quartet setting, but rather plays the music note for note. The result is comparable to playing the music on a cheap keyboard. The absence of percussion (a critical part of Rush songs) makes the music sound hollow. I have enjoyed symphonic renditions of Led Zepplin, and they come off much better because horns and percussion fill out the sound. CD may make a fun April Fool's gift for the Rush fan in your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Executed, but....","review":"The execution is there, but a lot gets lost in the translation. First of all, I think most Rush fans would agree that there isn't any part of their sound that could be removed. The obvious lack of translation of Neil's percussion immediately takes away a great deal from these songs. Secondly, I miss the energy and kick that help make Rush such a great rock band; these songs feel rather \\"toothless\\" in a sense. The classical interpretation just leaves me feeling hungry for the \\"real thing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all for a tribute album","review":"I consider tribute albums to be the absolute lowest form of music. However, this CD is pretty darn good! It has some of the best Rush songs played by a string quartet -- and it actually resembles the music of Rush (unlike most other tribute albums)! The music sounds great played this way. Check this out if you are a Rush fan and enjoy classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a HORRIBLE CD. Ttechnically flawed, and cliche.","review":"Please, don't support the people that made this CD. The production quality is half-baked. Some of the solos and lead parts are poor quality samples of stringed instruments, and could possibly be the General MIDI string patches from your very own Sound Card.The arranger has taken no artistic or creative freedom in this tribute - they merely play the Rush songs note for note - not taking advantage of the sonic palette that the String Quartet can offer. They could've had some lush and wonderous interludes - but, that would've been too difficult.If I ever have my own business, this will be the \\"waiting music\\" that I play over the phone.I'm a musician and audio engineer. I work with dozens of other audio engineers and musicians. They have all laughed out loud when listening to this CD - buy it if you want a novelty CD. That's about all its good for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for a Rush-loving doctor's office!","review":"Having just seen 2 Rush concerts in the past week, I still have live Rush sounds and sights in my head that return and resonate when I listen to String Quartet Tribute to Rush. With that disclaimer out of the way, I highly recommend this album to hardcore Rush fans as well as the casual listener. There are no jarring keyboards/vocals from Geddy, nor any brilliant Peart drumming, but if you have the songs imbedded in your acoustic memory you can fill in the blanks to please you as you wish. Standout songs IMHO are Red Barchetta, YYZ, The Trees, and Freewill, but no song is unlistenable. Regarding the title of this review, I may very well keep this CD for years so I can use it as \\"office music\\" if/when I own my own practice someday.

I realize the instrumentation in a string quartet pales in compairson with that of a full symphony, so I'll resist the urge to compare this with Us and Them, and instead I'll focus on this disc. I'm disappointed. I'm sure I'll get flamed for this, but many of the songs sound like those (lovingly crafted, mind you) midi files you can download from Rush fans' web sites. YYZ sounds particularly computerized...almost like something you'd hear in a n 80s-era video game. To my ears, the music of Rush would translate extremely well played on \\"classical\\" instruments, but this disc unfortnutately suffers from a major case of not being able to get past the language barrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time, waste of money","review":"Rush is a legendary band, but I find it quite hardto admire this stuff.

I do think it gives decent bounce control (42D) but the band is too tight if the cup size is correct and is giving appropriate bounce control. In addition, the straps are far to short for anyone that is taller or has a long torso causing the bra to either slide up or cut into the shoulder. I actually took a pair of scissors to mine lengthening the band by two inches, adding a 2-3 inch strap extension with extra soft padding on top of the shoulder. The final sewing adjustment was to trim the top 3 hooks and create a bra that is not similar to wearing a straight jacket. Waste of a lot of cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"I purchased this bra after researching best rated sports bras. I was training for a 12 mile trail race and having lots of issues with chafing (severe chafing). I have to say that I successfully trained and ran my race with NO CHAFING! The girls stay put, no bounce at all! This is the best compression bra that I have found, and I have tried several. It does take some getting used to since it can be tedious to put on- lots of hooks and eyes. The band fits really snugly as well. I can deal with the snugness as long as I do not chafe. Losing skin over my shoulders and under the breasts was extremely miserable. If chafing due to bounce is your issue , or just too much bouncing, this is the bra for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're active and you hate to bounce, this is for you!","review":"I have been graced with the natural *gift* of large hooters.

And forget working with a trainer in the gym when he has you running stairs or jumping over things...oh the stares. I was never been able to run before I got this bra. I will admit that it's tight, but after searching for years for the right solution, I'll take it. Sometimes I even undo the bottom one or too hooks and that provides a little relief when I am on the heavier side. Another plus is that I have always had terrible posture...I'm sure out of being self-conscious. My size appears drastically reduced when I wear this bra, and I have found that I stand up straighter and taller with confidence during my workouts. I love this bra and highly recommend. Two thumbs up! I cannot thank Enell enough for developing this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Yes Yes!!","review":"I bought my Enell about 4 months ago and it's been fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it. I used to have to wear 2 sports bras and even then I bounced and it HURT!They do run very tight, but that's good because they get looser as you're exercising. At first I thought mine didn't fit because I was so squeezed in, but that just means that it fits perfectly. I can't say enough good about this bra.One down side?

I've always been a person that needed to wear two sports bras while exercising to support me, but not anymore as long as I wear Enell. I wear a 34 C and the size 0 fits me very well.

I was so disappointed when I tried it on. If you call being mashed flat, it's supportive. Comfortable...not after you hook it up.

I certainly appreciated the color photos in the middle of the book, but, whenever I see such material in a paperbook, wonder if there was even more in the hardback version. Four leafs, 8 pages, were provided in the paperback. Anyone know if that's the same as the hardback? I've come across paperbacks that obviously had photos and figures that were excluded from the book. In some cases, that makes a big difference. I think I found two figures in the book. Maybe one.

This video is essentially material they couldn't show on tv because -- in a few instances -- it was too violent or showed some nudity. But portions of this video were also shown on Cops, except with some editing cuts. Other portions of this is stuff that could be shown on Cops.

Two police cars collide at an intersection while driving to the same crime scene. Both cars had COPS camera crews riding in them, with film rolling the whole time.

The book is very good at explaining all the different aspects of breeding---I highly recommend it for anyone who is thinking about breeding.

The ginger taste is too sharp and over powering and the other flavors I can NOT taste at all in this bar besides the coconut it has a \\"soapy\\" taste!!For the record this has NOT been my experience with the two other smartmonkey bars I have tried.

This was an idiotic move on my part since, as you can see, the price is astronomical and I never had to read it. Whatever you do, do not buy this book. It is completely unnecessary. By the way, I currently have a high A in the class (I just have to take the final) and I never opened a text book or read any of the other books he had us buy. Just pay attention in class, take good notes, and use an encyclopedia to define the I.D.'s when He gives you the review sheet.

If Mr. Twain was as portray, I guess the folks were even more laid back than me. I am not a SNL fan or reality show fan, thus the presentations do not always have to be fast-paced or overly silly.

I have long believed, and this DVD confirms that Mark Twain Tonight is easily one of the greatest treasures of the American stage in the last half of the 20th Century. That Mr. Holbrook has performed Mark Twain every year since 1954, in over 2000 shows, is nothing short of miraculous. This 90 minute performance brings the wisdom, humor and humanity of one of the most morally insightful men of the 19th century to life. His words continue to be as hilarious, poignant and relevent in the 21st century as they were in his own time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember this from years back and it's still as great as I remembered","review":"I've always been a fan of Mark Twain, read several of his books (back in college) and then whe I saw Hal Holbrook on a tv special, I really liked how he portrayed Mark, with the gravelly voice, etc. When I saw this was available, I figured I'd like to hear it again.

I hope her voice will recover someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing new arrangements; voice OK, no longer great.","review":"This CD looked promising from the label, but was so disappointing I returned it. Andrews' original performances of many of these standards, such as those from My Fair Lady, were absolutely gorgeous. For some inexplicable reason, in an effort to \\"improve\\" on these standards, the arrangements have been all mangled. They contain unexpected modulations and other strange changes which make the listener want to grab the original recording-which is what I did for My Fair Lady. Julie Andrews' original recordings of many of these songs were sublime. Unfortunately, these retakes remind us that her voice isn't what it once was, as she too often talks her way through the songs and avoids the jumps and high notes that she used to hit in clear, thrilling fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"The June Spirit's \\"five minutes of fame\\" was very short lived. They only completed one full length and an EP and then broke up in early 2003. In my eyes I see it as the June Spirit could have been a lot more then they were. The cd, \\"Testing Superstition\\" is filled with amazing lyrics and beats. Each song, may be very emotional, but you know about the song-writers life a lot and can related to it in many ways. Each beat keeps you on your seat waiting to hear the next song. In my opinion this is one cd nobody can be without. I never get tired of hearing the same songs over and over.

Ah, but in this book we learn she wasn't the path to truth afterall, he was duped, but as a result he has now learned the REAL path to truth. How do we know he's found the REAL path to truth...this time? He tells us he has! The author clearly has great credentials, with his scholarly Oxford background raised at every opportunity.

I always went past or stopped prematurely. The buttons are all really cool but you can hit them by accident very easily. Here are some more cons:-No PC interface. You need to buy a dock or other accessory to use it with your PC-Every song on the ipod MUST be on the computer. If you have 500 songs on the computer and put them in your ipod then hook it up to another computer...all the songs are erased.-You cannot upload songs from the ipod to a computer.-PRICE!!!!

Reminds me a bit of an early U2 album. Has a similar fight, urgency, and sense of cause.. I too heard them on a podcast called Luna Musings.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great indie debut...","review":"I heard one of their tunes on a podcast a couple weeks ago and was hooked. I ended up being one of the hundreds of people at their record release party this past Saturday. AGENCY blew me away...I bought the record immediately and its been on at my desk at work since then. This album is a diamond in the rough...a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and precise well-tempered clavier","review":"I am the owner of many versions of the Well-Tempered Clavier, both volumes. Gulda's, which I have just recently discovered, is now one of my favorites, to me equaling Glenn Gould's and Rosalind Tureck's incredible performances. Gulda's, like Gould's, is eccentric and as dry as can be imagined; stacatto, minimal rubatto, no pedal -- often hard, sharp, even harsh. But what clarity; the lines of counterpoint stand out perfectly. Each interlocking melody is clearly and beatufilly defined. I'm not a big fan of \\"mushy\\" Bach playing (though some of it, like Andras Schiff's, is very fine indeed). Here is a nice, arid rendition of Bach's keyboard masterpiece. At a bargain price, how can you go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird in places but often beautiful","review":"This is not a hitorically informed reading! It sounds a bit crazed in places to be honest, but is also often very beautiful. Not what you shoud have as a first recording, but Bach especially responds to an indivdual approach, and this shows the WTC I in a new light. Pretty good sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dry and odd performance, I did not like it at all","review":"I do not like this performance at all. It's dry, there isn't much energy or passion. There is a sort of crispness to the playing...things are cut too short. Tempos are odd. The emphasis is wrong. It just doesn't feel right.I tend to be tolerant of perverse performances such as Glenn Gould...but at least Gould has energy, intensity, flow. This...is just annoying to listen to. I'd choose any mediocre pianist playing the WTC in a \\"normal\\" way over this strange and unpleasant performance. Get a different CD of the WTC, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Bach a Robot?","review":"This is a passionless recording. You could easily get the exact same performance from a computer. Bach was a warm, inviting and hospitable person and this recording shows none of that. If one takes the time to study the meaning of the WTC, one can easily see this aspect of Bach in the music. The preludes and fugues of the WTC, not to mention all the works of Bach, have the potential to be played in hundreds of different ways so to tolerate a recording that offers the nutritional value of iceburg lettuce is silly.Moreover, the piano sounds really bad. It took me weeks to listen to the whole recording.Another reviewer mentioned finding a recording on an instrument closer to what Bach had. Not only is the sound closer but the tuning is more accurate as well. Baroque tuning is a bit lower and when played in the lower tuning, all the pieces take on a much different meaning. Find a recording using harpsichord or clavichord.I threw this recording out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I wanted to like this book being a fan of both authors. Even after the first hundred pages of nothing happening, I had hope. But, in the end it's a cute cat and unicorn girl story without any particularly interesting characters, adventure, or reason to be written.Plot summary, Acorna, unicorn girl, is hijacked to a strange planet by her cat. Once there, she cures more cats, discovers that the apparently nice guy is really a very bad guy who wants to poison everyone because--uh, well, no good reason, he just does. But Acorna is good to go and has lots of help. In the meantime, she wishes she could find her boyfriend.Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for both kids and adults","review":"What's not to love about Carl? This is the best of the Carl books, save the original Good Dog Carl. In this book, Carl has to watch the baby and a new puppy in the park. The illustrations are multi-layer -- adults will pick up on things that kids won't (like the different art schools of the painters in the park). Adding the puppy is a fun twist. I was really glad to see this story in a board book for toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog as Babysitter?","review":"I guess I just didn't get this book but I really didn't like it. The whole premise is that a Mother gets a break from caring for her baby by turning the young baby over to a dog. My young sons looked at me and said, \\"Mom why did that Mom leave her baby all alone with a dog?\\" I said, \\"I said it's just a story but it's kind of a strange story for kids. Some people think that animals are just like people. They don't realize that an animal has animal instincts, and may act on those instincts by biting.\\" I like dogs myself, but young children need to be taught to be careful around animals. They have been known to bite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"A great choice! Have your child make up their own story as you follow along. It's really fun to see how they view the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanstastic Book!","review":"This book helped me teach my children the differences between wet and dry, large and small, different colors, different shapes, counting, etc. This is a book about using your imagination which is your thinking or active mind. Each time we read it together we changed it slightly which we did many, many times. Thank you Alexandra Day for hours of fantastic memories with my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Carl book of all!","review":"This is, by far, the best Carl book (in fact, one of the best of any picture books). My just-turned-two girls have had this book for months, and it is their favorite. Not only is the artwork fantastic, but the book is actually quite clever (I love the scene with the artists painting Carl and the baby in abstract, impressionist and modern art styles). It is filled with spectacular images that grab a toddler's attention, and the detail is enough to keep adults interested, too. Even after reading the book many times, I still find things I hadn't noticed before. The book includes a carousel, flower garden, balloons, ice cream, train, petting zoo (with seals???), slide and much more ... plenty to show and teach your children! [As a side note, apart from this book and \\"Good Dog, Carl\\", the other Carl books fall short of our expectations]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and funny.","review":"Plenty of details for the parents to enjoy. The modelling for the painters is quite funny. This is my favorite Carl book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot believe the 5 stars for this book...","review":"If this had been my first Sandra Brown book, I would never have picked up any of her books again!The lead male character (I refuse to call this guy hero) is a foul-mouthed, abusive, jerk who treats the female lead with contempt and cruelty most of the time. And guess what she does?She takes it and takes it like a masochist, and she falls in love with him for all his \\"wonderful qualities\\". Give me a break! She had as much personality as a wet noodle.I wanted to throw this book across the room quite a few times and quit reading. The only reason I did continue was because I kept hoping it will get better. Not really. If you like female leads with a bit of fire in them (Angel Creek's Dee Swan comes to mind) and male leads that are strong and macho WITHOUT resorting to abuse and cruelty, give this book a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrificial Lamb","review":"Poor Lauren, she was like a lamb led to slaughter. Shame on Ben for asking a sweet, innocent girl into the midst of his badly disfunctional family. I can't think of a worse scenario. What was going on in Jared's head to treat unknowing Lauren in such a manner. And Olivia she took the cake. How Jared let her pull his strings was mind boggling. Someone wrote that they just loved all the characters. About the only lovable ones were Elena, Rosa, Maria and Gloria. Rudy wasn't bad either, but Jared needed his tail whipped.At least all the bad guys got it in the end. What a bunch of ruthless scum."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent....","review":"This book was my first \\"historical romance\\" and it is the one that turned me onto them, I have read several now and none of them have compared to this one.

If you haven't read it then you are missing a good one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't want to put it down!","review":"What has brought Lauren to this wide spread territory in Texas? What is her connection to the old tycoon who invited her? Why did he invite her? For himself or is she to help him settle his son Jared? What does his wife Olivia think of all this? Interesting plot twists and turns, as usual for avid readers of Sandra Brown. And, of course, it wouldn't be Sandra Brown without some interesting, tension building episodes between the main characters, Lauren and Jared. Is it a mariage in name only? Or is there some passion? Could it actually be love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a wonderful story and I enjoyed reading it very much. While reading this book I felt like I was in the story myself and feeling what the characters were feeling. I think it is one of Sandra Brown's best books. I loaned it to my sister-n-law and she also loved reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting, breath taking adventure that will capture you.","review":"Hidden Fires was a wonderful book. Ya'll should try it. I must admit that at first I didn't want to read it because the title was sort of cheesy. Come on now, Hidden Fires...Sort of like a romance novel with no real content or story. But I was wrong. I was riveted by Brown's way of making the story flow with great ease and have exciting events that all intertwined. Hidden Fires had a great, exciting, and interesting plot. I could not put it down. The characters were so real and the Texas surroundings that Brown described made me feel as if I were there. I felt like jumping on a horse right alongside the characters as they went along their business. When Brown would describe the characters I actually felt and saw them. I found myself sneaking away some time from work to read it. I laughed, became angry, was elated, and ok, ok I cried. But overall this book was Fantastic!!!!! PS Ignore the cheesy title"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?!","review":"I'm a huge SB-fan AND I like historical novels, so I considered this book the perfekt combination. But it was bad, bad, bad. First, the story plot is an annoying up and down of misunderstandings and yes-no-situations. Second, the plot is unbelievable, especially toward the end. Third and worst: the book is full of dislikeble characters (except the minor roles). Jared, the so-called \\"hero\\" is just terrible. He is rude, mean and abusive, but oh-so-handsome. So much for his qualities... Lauren and the other charcaters in the book tolerate all of his abusive behaviour, how sad is that. Lauren falls in love with Jared, an obviously mentally-disturbed male who makes everyone around him suffer and mistreats her. What a message! I really wonder what Sarah Brown wanted to tell her readers with that story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..Boring..Boring","review":"This is the second novel I've read by Sandra and I am truly dissapointed. The fires were definitely hidden, because I could not feel the burn. I found myself skipping over several pages at a time. The characters were not likeable, or I just couldn't connect emotionally with them. Also, when she (I don't even remember her name) realized she loved him seemed rediculous because nothing he did endeared her to him. I propably won't read anything else by this author because the price of paperbacks have gone up and I certainly don't have money to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duggar Fans","review":"Our family really enjoys all the Duggar DVDs.

This group was young and restless! The teacher assigned to monitor us, helped us focus on \\"studying\\" by dropping this record on the player and the effect was startling! Though this occurred more years ago than I'd like to admit, my memory of it is still very fresh. When I saw the CD for sale, I sampled some of the selections. To one untrained in music, it sounded the same as the original, although some of the conductors and orchestras must be different. It still has the same effect on me that it did so many years ago. I reccommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich, mesmerising collection","review":"The first time I heard this CD I could do little more than be still and just listen.Yes, it's that enchanting.Debussy's piano Arabesques were so beautifully performed they could have been the first notes after creation - light, happy, rich, and amused.A truly marvelous collection.

I can't even put into words how much I love \\"Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun\\", lush music that transports my mind to the islands of the South Pacific. I love the impressionist era in art, and this music is from the same time. It fits. \\"Images for Orchestra - Perfumes of the Night\\" is my other favorite track. Much of the music exhibits a highly cinematic flair. Sometimes I listen and feel like I am watching old movies. Beautiful images flood my mind; intense emotions, color, and dramatic scenes. Highly recommended. Listen and dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO TONY & NO GOOD!","review":"If Tony Jaa is in this this then I missed him...Looks like a poor quality home movie with terrible acting.

The better thing would have been to design a sturdier velour tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upshaw is incredible","review":"I was present for a performance of Ayre in New York a couple of years ago. It's a song cycle drawing on several different cultural and historical traditions -- Christian, Muslim, Jewish and of course the composer's native South America. The performance was quite exhilirating. The music is mostly tuneful and the orchstration very interesting.Still, I can't help wondering if this is the kind of music that will last. Will people still be listening to Ayre 100 years from now? I'm not sure. I hear geat talent and skill -- but do I hear genius? Again, I'm not convinced. Sometimes, I have the feeling of being manipulated. This music is very politically correct, especially the long lament for the Palestinians at the center of this work.One thing is for sure: Dawn Upshaw is sensational. She molds her voice into a supremely flexible instrument, making it do all kinds of wonderful things.I do recommend this recording. It's interesting and it asks good questions.

I was also disappointed that the subject of archetypes was not clearly tied to the planets, signs and houses. The author does bring a lot together in this book, but it is very general, more of a grouping of what's been stated by others, than an actual point of reference. Perhaps as my astrological studies continue this book will become more meaningful to me. I've since found much more relevant information on the four elements elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teacher's Dream Resource Students Love!","review":"I recently discovered this gem of a resource, and I was thrilled because it accompanied my fifth grade noun unit perfectly!

The illustrations are wonderful, and I am planning on buying the other books in this series on verbs and adjectives as well. If they are anything like this one, I am 100% sure I'll use them just as frequently as I am this one!

To this day it is still working, so I am very happy with my purchase.

The instructions tell you how to set up presets manually by moving up and down the dial using the left and right buttons but I couldn't get that to work either. Got it to work once I think by random luck but when I turned the car off and on the frequency had changed and my attempted presets were gone. The connector to the iPod seemed a little loose so maybe that could have been the problem but I wasn't willing to try and bend it at the risk of damaging the iPod.Ended up with a manual cable/charger from a different mfr with the little transmitter in-line with the wire.

I read the reviews on this before buying it and they weren't to good but i decided to give it a chance anyway. I bought it for my dorm room in which it performed well until the reciever went out. I am not sure why it went out because i never blasted the music. For the short time that it did work, it was really good. I ended up sending it back and buying another brand system (Coby) for about $30 more which I hope is a lot better. Cheaper brands are better for me because im in a dorm and don't really need a Sony or other expensive brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This system shut itself off after 1/2 hour if you leave the volume up. It only goes up to 40 and the sound is terrible. I'm returning this unit a.s.a.p back to Amazon and buying something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Long","review":"It seemed nice while it lasted, which was about 4 months. This unit runs very hot and I even had fans on it. One day it just had too much and quit on me.Pros: Lots of inputs, looks nice, decent sound.Cons: Subwoofer came with a vibration, probably bad seal. I bought mine recertified, so this may also be why. Not very loud, had to turn up to 45/50 to get decent volume.Other Comments: This was my first Surround Sound System with a Receiver. I have upgraded to a Pioneer VSX-D812 which blows the RCA way out of the water. If you're looking for something cheap to put in a small room and not use alot of power or much noise the RCA is fine. If you're looking for a decent Surround Sound System, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds OK, didn't last very long","review":"I bought one of these 3 months ago at the local WalMart. For the price, it was OK. I hooked it up with my Direct TV dish setup. The sound was a little weak on some movies. It has several variations of the surround sound from sounding like a stadium to being in a Church along with 3 Dolby settings.I thought that being made by RCA it would last. The only problem I had was it died with less than 3 months of use. I had 5 days left of the 90 day limit for returns when it died and I had to return it to WalMart. If this thing had lasted longer I would have given it at least a 4 star rating.Also this model that is listed does NOT come with a 5-Disc DVD/CD player. Just the receiver/amplifier to hook your DVD or VCR up to."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible system","review":"I wanted a powerful thousand watt system to replace my 350 watt system that was getting old and did not have the inputs that i would like now that I have an hdtv. This system has all the inputs and outputs necessary for home theater it really lacks in sound quality. There is no hard thumping realistic bass. My old system had a 100 hundred watt sub the sounded so much better. When watching a movie with gunshots and special effects I would say that this system will leave you unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"rca rt2770","review":"I brought this system 12/11/2007, I would let you know this system is no good, I would tell anybody not to buy this system, I have sold this system all ready. This Best System is RCA RT2500 But You Can't find it no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000????watt I dont think so","review":"I was impressed by the reviews and purchased this product. In my 10 X 18 media room you have to crank it up to 45 ( 50 being max vol) and that is via the digital coaxial connector!! I replaced the front speakers with my Bose 201's and it helped a little but I will replace this asap. Great for a childs room. New progressive digital dvd player is connected to the system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many!","review":"Options that is...There are so many inputs, digital, analog... I have a feeling I am having an issue because I don't have the inputs right. Maybe. I can't turn the unit up past 10 (about 1/6th of the volume) because the unit powers off by itself and won't turn back on (and stay) unless I turn off all the sound inputs (DVR in this case) then turn the RCA back on and turn on the DVR (or whatever source). I've tried everything. Why don't they make that protection circuit adjustable? Or just take it out and make the unit so a protection circuit isn't needed? Maybe I'll have to go to the 3.1 surround option but I don't really want to! I've got an email in to RCA to see if they can help me but until I update this I suggest you pay a little more and get a Sony (my Sony was awesome (although it's protect circuit gave me trouble at first too)). If I figure this out I'll update this posting."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEATS MY JUNKIE LGLHB335","review":"WOW MY LG GHB335 DIED AFTER ONE DAY SO I BOUGHT THIS UNIT AND AN AWESUM SAMSUNG BLU RAY NET READY PLAYER WOW, THE SOUND IS INCREDIBLE, THE BASS IS 3 TIMES WHAT THAT JUNK LG COULD DO AND SOUND IS FULL AND CLEAR NO IT'S NO MEGA LOUD BUT IT'S PLENTY LOUD, I DO PRO AUDIO FOR A LIVING AND FOR 151 DOLLARS AT TARGET AM THRILLED!!

I ran into the problem of the speaker wire being hard wired into the speakers. The wire they've included is just to short. My theater room is not very big. It was in a previous life a 1 car garage. I was not able to reach the back speakers to the back edge of the room, and the front speakers would not reach to the outer edges of the front wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"aspiring philosophers","review":"This film was a dissapointment to me. It really took something away from my love of techno.I tired of watching/listening to \\"artist\\" after \\"artist\\" try to wax philosophical, to floor me by saying something deep and profound.Much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting history of electronic music","review":"This is one of the better documentaries on electronic music. It was very interesting and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Droning interviews spoil this DVD","review":"A disappointment. I was hoping for extended selections of the artists' music, with maybe a little introduction/explanation. Unfortunately, its mostly artist interviews droning on and on with only snippets of the music. The artist comments are typically, \\"...its like everything that's noise can be music...but its like, uh, all about the technology...\\" No real passion or insight until some more snippets of a rave flash briefly by. Lots of subtypes of the techno music described, but its confusing how they differ for the lack of lengthy defining examples. If you are a knowledgeable fan and want some camera shots and comments of your heroes, this may be for you. If you want a clear introduction of the music and which artists may interest you enough to buy their music, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of this movie should've been","review":"\\"Clubs and Raves and The Young People Who Go To Them--Oh Yeah And The Old Genius Farts That Pioneered The Music They Dance To\\". BUY - MY - COPY - PLEASE!!!! I expected this film to play like a Keyboard Magazine interview with the artists; detailing their influences, their gear and how they create their sounds. There's a lot of DJs standing behind turntables bobbing their heads, mere snippets of the new techno bands like Prodigy, only a passing mention of Kraftwerk and no mention at all of the Art of Noise. I was disappointed.

Buy it to hear partykids and scenesters wax poetic about a rave scene that no longer exists (as it's shown here), but not for a history of electronic music. I'd recommend Better Living through Circuitry over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREATIVITY for the ear","review":"As a self-proclaimed electronica freak I must recommend this one to not only those interested in electronic music, but also to anyone interested in opening their mind to the possibilities of NOISE. However, this film left me wanting more background on the use of music (specifically electronic) in its relationships to manipulating the senses.....and its correlations to design, be it spatial, physical or virtual......however, this is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn how the craft works!","review":"(Sorry about that header.) Ambitious and mostly successful overview of the roots and branches in the modern electronic music scene. The film covers quite a bit in just over an hour. The use of \\"sound bite\\"-length artist interviews seems to irk some reviewers; I think they are failing to savor the irony that this is just the cinematic equivalent of \\"sampling\\", after all. As in any similar collection of interviews, artist comments range from the banal to the revelatory, but the director gets credit for not allowing any concept to become too redundant. This film edges out the very similar documentary \\"Better Living Through Circuitry\\", by thankfully not inserting so many tiresome, epileptic seizure-inducing scenes of people \\"raving\\". Highly recommended for genre fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History of Electronic Music","review":"MODULATIONS is a great look at the history of electronic based music and techno and is the perfect companion to BETTER LIVING THROUGH CIRCUITRY a film about rave culture currently making the festival rounds. Between these two films anyone can get a complete understanding of this exciting and evolving music and lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panda-comparable licorice made in America","review":"I'd been a Panda user and decided to give Red Vines a try, lured by its lower price. I haven't been disappointed, the taste is very similar to the Panda standard. Perhaps even a bit stronger when you first open up a bag.The only area in which Red Vines lacks compared to the Panda is in the packaging. These Red Vines come in non-resealable poly bags. Once you open a bag, you have a day or two to eat all the candy inside before it starts to dry out and begin its inexorable transformation into a jaw-breaking confection. Now if you are really addicted to this stuff, I guess that wouldn't be a problem, but those of us who enjoy our licorice in moderation it's an issue.Four stars only because of the packaging, otherwise the product is quite well recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, spiritual, uplifting music","review":"Yea for Kirtana.

This is my first romance movie and taught me some emotions - love, sadness, and pleasure. Even though other people would think this movie is very fictional and ridiculousWhen I decided to see this movie, I just wanted to see one of my favorite actresses. I hated to see romance movie because I didn't want to feel such emotions that most of romance movies gives. After I saw this movie, however, I was unable to regret. I could feel the love between a lover, and a family. It was so moving and I almost cried when the movie was finished. This movie taught me how to feel the love and how beautiful it is.I'm afraid that I can't watch this movie again because it's so sad.
